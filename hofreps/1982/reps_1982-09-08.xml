<PARA> Mr Hayden-Mr Speaker, in that case, I take a further point of order. I am sure that there was some murmuring and perhaps you did not hear the question clearly. The thrust of the honourable member's question very simply was to refer to statements that the Prime Minister made in this House yesterday when he quoted from a document. The honourable member has proceeded no further than to indicate that the Prime Minister quoted from a document to which he resorted. In those circumstances it would be rather odd if the question could not proceed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I refer him to correspondence that he and his Department have received from me over the past 18 months relating to the Phillips tractor company of Merredin in agricultural Western Australia. It is a small but viable manufacturer of four wheel drive agricultural tractors ranging in value from $70 ,000 to $250,000. Is it a fact that this company must pay the 2 per cent special revenue duty on all its imported mechanical components, thus increasing costs by $600 to $900 per tractor? Is it a fact that all imported four wheel drive tractors are free of all duty, including the revenue duty, and therefore have a substantial competitive advantage over the Australian product? Further, can arrangements similar to those announced for the shipping industry be made for this viable and efficient manufacturer, thus alleviating this obvious injustice?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV4">Mr HODGMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst the honourable member was kind enough to tell me that he would ask this question, it is not a Dorothy Dixer because he is critical of an aspect of Government policy which I feel ought to be debated by the House and certainly taken into account. The 2 per cent revenue duty which was imposed by the Government on 24 May 1979 does apply. That is the response to the first part of the honourable member's question. In respect of the second part of his question the answer is also yes. It is fair to say that the question of this duty was considered this year by the Government in the Budget context, but because of monetary constraints it was not possible to remove the duty. Lastly, I say to the honourable member in relation to the specifics of the case that, if the company concerned is able to raise the Australian content of its product to 55 per cent, which is the minimum required, the company will be eligible for the current bounty assistance. Unfortunately, at present the company's Australian content is only 43 per cent. Unless it can bridge the gap between 43 per cent and 55 per cent the benefit will not be available.</PARA></TALK.START>

The specific matter raised by the honourable member has been under investigation and review by the Australian Postal Commission, and that review is considerably advanced. I have received several reports from the Postal Commission. Amongst other things, the Commission is taking into account, as I am, the very strong representations made by the honourable member. I know that the honourable member feels that, with the emergence of the Northern Territory as a very significant geographical and political entity in its own right, the people of the Northern Territory, particularly Darwin, should have distinctive postcodes. I share that view and I am very grateful that the honourable member should have pursued the matter with so much zeal and resolution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Administrative Services to his obscure statement of 31 August last in which he announced the exoneration of an unidentified Minister from unspecified allegations. Were these allegations serious enough to warrant investigation by Federal and Victorian police and other government instrumentalities? Did the Minister order this investigation on his own initiative or after consultation with or at the behest of another Minister? Did the Minister decide on his own initiative that the identity of the Minister involved and the nature of the allegations should be suppressed, or was that done after consultation with or at the behest of another Minister? Will the Minister make full disclosure on this matter to the House to avoid further speculation within his and other departments that the Government is trying to cover up yet another scandal involving a senior Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1154" SPEAKER="Newman The Hon K.E." NAMEID="WM7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BASS" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am prepared to describe the circumstances which led to that statement. They are as follows: I was advised that during an interview with the Victorian police by Mr Patrick McCabe allegations were mentioned to him that a Commonwealth Minister had purchased a unit on the Gold Coast, that that purchase was from, to use the words, 'Australia's biggest drug runner' and that part of the purchase price for that unit had been a car which the Minister had allegedly imported duty free. These allegations were passed on to Mr McCabe, I understand, as part of an unsubstantiated rumour which emanated from a known criminal. They were serious accusations and, of course, they cast a very serious slur on the person who was named in them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I took that matter to the Minister concerned. He immediately said that the matter should be investigated and offered every co-operation in that investigation. I put in train with the Australian Federal Police an extensive investigation. I have been subsequently advised by the Acting Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police that that extensive investigation has shown that the allegations have absolutely no substance whatsoever. Indeed, the only aspect of the allegations that is true is the fact that the Minister did buy a unit on the Gold Coast. They are the facts of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> I ask all honourable members just to reflect once again on the circumstances. If any small time criminal or any other person who has a motive makes an allegation against a member of this House and if that allegation is repeated in the gossip columns that are around us in this House and if other members of the Press Gallery seize upon it and promote it to a red hot rumour that has the whole place buzzing, it puts every member of this House in jeopardy. If the allegation is to be promoted to the front pages of the newspapers as soon as it is made, where does it lead all of us? I think Mr Laurie Oakes summed up the situation pretty well in an article he wrote in the Age on 3 September. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> A lie told by a big-talking criminal had somehow escalated into front-page news . The episode demonstrated how easily and unfairly a politician's reputation can be damaged.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the allegations that have been made in this regard. The allegations, of course, have been made by the Leader of the Opposition. We should take note of the fact that ever since the Costigan report was given to the Government, and given to the Leader of the Opposition as a courtesy so that he should be informed on this very important and serious situation, the Leader of the Opposition has set out to smear individuals and to smear the Liberal Party of Australia. Right from the very first moment when he stood on the steps of Parliament House the night after that he said that he had read the report and that it blew his brains out. On radio stations, in newspapers and on television he has gone out of his way to say that people in the Liberal Party are involved in organised crime. Sometimes he says it directly and sometimes he says it by implication and innuendo, as he did yesterday. One of the things he said yesterday was that three knights were involved in organised crime. He said a lot more about it as well. First of all he implied in this House that the names were contained in the Costigan report.</PARA></TALK.START>

Can the Deputy Prime Minister tell the House the implications for the future prosperity of this country of increases in costs in our export industries, particularly iron and coal, and the increase in our growing reputation for unreliability as an exporter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the actual report but it has been brought to my attention that concern was expressed by some of the Australians at the conference about the possibility of declining imports by Japan of our iron ore and coal. I think one has to recognise the realities of the situation in that the Japanese steel industry looks like going through its lowest production year for the last 11 years. This is because of both lower consumption in Japan and lower export possibilities. That is affecting our sales of iron ore from Western Australia and coking coal from the eastern States. What Australia has been advocating in making representations to Japan is that there should be a sharing of any decline in the imports of raw materials. We have developed a very substantial iron and coal exporting industry in parallel with the growth of the Japanese steel industry. If there are any reversals we would want to see the same equitable proportion going to Japan as we have traditionally had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee meeting that we had recently I made the point very cogently that we did not want to see our percentage share of the market being lost. Traditionally we have had about 48 per cent of the iron ore market. It is a bit lower than that this year and we would like to see that picked up. Traditionally, we have been getting from 50 per cent to 55 per cent of the coking coal market. So concerned is Western Australia about the matter that its Minister for Resources Development was in Japan only last week pointing out that if Western Australia were to get any lesser share of the market it would seriously jeopardise the economic operations of its iron ore exports.</PARA>
<PARA> The Premier of New South Wales is also very concerned about the matter. At the moment he is in Japan and will be making similar representations. I think the greatest damage that has been done to our reputation over the last year was caused by the surge of industrial disputes and problems. They led to shipping delays. Fortunately in New South Wales there has been some reprieve from that situation. The long waiting time, resulting in heavy demurrage paid on ships off Newcastle and Port Kembla, has been eased. There has been a responsible response from the unions as a result of discussions between governments and the industry. I am hoping that the unions will recognise how important it is that from now on they maintain the orders that they have; that they try to reinstate the reliability of Australia as a dependable exporter. I cannot emphasise that enough. At present, when there are difficult export circumstances around the world, Australia has to struggle to its utmost to maintain its competitive position, and reliability plays an important part.</PARA>

I am pleased to report to the House that officers of my Department have commenced the processing of some 450 people in Ho Chi Minh City for migrant entry out of a total of approximately 6,000 people who have been sponsored in Australia. I point out to the House also that the cost of passage of these people will have to be borne by the migrants or by their sponsors in Australia. This is distinct from the refugee program, under which the costs of the passage are borne by the Government. If current progress is maintained I expect the first arrivals within the next two to three months. These people come under the Family Migration Program and are being sponsored by Australians in exactly the same way as are people coming from any other part of the world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we can somehow bridge the diversion without my going over the points I was making, if other newspapers have a wrong lead or interpretation similar to that which I saw in the Australian, they too will get a correction, as the Australian did early this morning. However, there is no justification for any error. Apart from a clear reading of the parliamentary record putting beyond any dispute that there was no reference, implicit or explicit, to the Costigan report in the terms in which I discussed this matter, it was made quite abundantly clear at a Press conference I conducted at about 4.10 p.m. in my office in Parliament House at which a large number of media people were present. I do not intend to waste time on that silly sort of distraction with the Prime Minister who seeks to become the sort of quintessential man of public decency, a role the public would not recognise, I am sure, in all of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to go on to the statement of the Minister for Administrative Services in which he said a couple of things. He referred to a letter from, I think, the Police Commissioner quoting my statement about people who have been elevated to the peerage of the realm. In case there is a semantic quibble there, I say that it was clearly a mistake to refer to 'peerage of the realm'. That refers to people who have been appointed as barons or whatever. I meant to refer to knights of the realm. I do not want to waste time on that point but I clarify it in case there is a semantic quibble in that regard about which the police are waffling. I did not use the word 'briefing' in my statement. I said: 'They are well known to the police who have conveyed their identities to me'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few things that have to be said about this matter. The Minister for Administrative Services may recall with some embarrassment when I jolt his memory about a conversation that he and I had on the front bench on the Government side of this House after the dinner break one night in the last session. I will come back to that in a minute. It is declared that I have not been to the Australian Federal Police headquarters. I mention in passing that on more than one occasion senior police officers, and not just members of the Federal Police, have mentioned this matter to me. I think honourable members will recall my past association with the police force and the fact that I maintain links with people who when I served in the police force were junior but who now hold senior positions. I also have a fairly friendly relationship with interstate police officers at a fairly senior level. If there is any quibble as to whether I have been to the Federal Police headquarters here, I merely draw attention to a letter sent to me on 7 July 1981 from the training division of the Federal Police. It was an invitation to dine informally with members of the Australian Federal Police officers course. Members of the Federal Police and of the State police forces were present on that occasion. I met a number of them. On that occasion, as had happened on earlier occasions elsewhere and as has happened on other occasions subsequently, this matter was raised with me. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, the Minister for Administrative Services pretends that there is oblivion in his mind in relation to this matter. I suggest that it exists in relation to many other matters; there would be no debate about that on either side of the Parliament but I put that matter to one side. I remind the Minister that one night in the last session in this Parliament I crossed the chamber and sat with him on the front bench. I said to him that senior officers of various police forces, including his own from time to time, had been mentioning to me the names of some fairly eminent titled people from the corporate sector who were involved in organised crime. I mentioned their names. I mentioned the three names which were given to me by the people I met at the Federal Police officers' dinner. I will tell the House what the Minister said. In relation to one of those names he said: 'I have heard about that person. We have kept an eye on him but we have not been able to get anything on him. We are very suspicious of him but it is very hard to pin him'. That is what the Minister said in this House. If the Minister quibbles about matters of this nature being raised, if he wants to condemn with contumely the use of anonymity, and I think anonymity is proper in these cases-the matter is well understood-let me remind him of an article in the Canberra Times of 10 May this year in which he was quoted directly. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Asked if there were 'respectable, reputable businessmen mixed up in organised crime in Australia,' Mr Newman said, 'Of course there are, and they have become so entrenched they have organised themselves so that they are well safeguarded from the normal thing we have been used to in this country . . . </PARA>

He was the man who asked me a question as to whether the three knights referred to were referred to on the basis of their being mentioned in the Costigan report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in the atmosphere of last week's growing public outcry against the Government's reprehensible conduct in respect of the tax avoidance industry, which had been so starkly revealed in the fourth interim report of Commissioner Costigan, there may have been a tendency to overlook another disastrous illustration of why the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government are no longer entitled to the respect and confidence of the people of this country. On Thursday and Friday of last week the Australian Council of Trade Unions held a federal unions conference, and out of that two- day conference there emerged a resolution of historic significance. I remind the House that such a conference of federal trade unions conducted by the ACTU between biennial congresses is the most representative way of testing the will of the trade union movement in this country. Out of that conference there emerged a resolution which I say is deserving of earnest consideration by the Government. I ask members of the House to bear in mind precisely what was said in that resolution which, following the federal unions conference was endorsed by the Executive of the ACTU. In particular I ask that the first paragraph of the resolution be borne clearly in mind. The trade union movement of Australia, so assembled, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The causes of unemployment are manifold and as recognised in policy are not capable of simple solution. The following proposal does not pretend to be a panacea for all our economic problems nor will it create by itself full employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Right at the outset of that resolution which was passed by the federal unions conference and subsequently endorsed that day by the Federal Executive of the ACTU was a responsible statement starting off with the proposition that the causes of unemployment are manifold; that the ACTU did not have all the answers and that it did not pretend to put forward a panacea in regard to this matter. Let me read further from what the ACTU, so assembled, said in respect of this fundamentally important matter. It also acknowledged in its resolution the significance in part of some things that are contained in the Budget. In other words, it was not simply trying to condemn the Federal Government totally out of hand, saying that nothing of relevance had been done. Indeed, the resolution stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The income tax changes announced in the 1982-83 Budget satisfy the wage and salary earners demand for tax indexation and as such they alleviate the need for unions to build income tax increases into claims for cost of living adjustments.</PARA>
<PARA>Again that is a thoroughly responsible and constructive approach by that assembling of the Australian trade union movement. It recognised that what happened in the Budget in respect of tax indexation met that part of its claim. As I said at the outset, there is first of all a responsible recognition that the trade union movement did not have all the answers and that the causes of unemployment were complex. Secondly, the ACTU pointed out that it took positive account of what the Government had done in the Budget. It went on to make very specific proposals about what could be done, on its part as well as by the Government, co-operatively, to try to deal with the problems confronting this country in general and in respect of unemployment in particular. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not believe that the trade union movement can be expected to make the only contribution and for this reason there should be a collective response involving: (a) forgoing half the benefits of tax indexation (which means $4 per week at average weekly earnings level). </PARA>
<PARA>The ACTU went on to refer to the other matters which would be involved in such a comprehensive package. I again remind you, Mr Speaker, and the House of the context. The ACTU asserted that it did not have all the answers and that the causes of unemployment were complex; it recognised positively the contribution that the Budget has made in respect of tax indexation-that that had met the ACTU 's part of the negotiations that it had had with the Government-and from that totally positive and responsible approach it went on to make a specific proposal about how the ACTU and the rest of the community could make a sacrifice by forgoing half the amount of tax indexation to create a national employment fund which would be directed, on the part of the ACTU which had made the sacrifice and the rest of the community, to helping those in the community who were currently unemployed. That was the decision-an historic decision-that was taken by the ACTU on Friday of last week. The whole context of the debate and the resolution showed on the part of the ACTU realism, responsibility and flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the response by this Government to that decision and attitude of the ACTU? The most convenient way of referring to the expressed reaction of the Government is to go to the Age of last Saturday. Under the heading 'Fraser scorns unions' job deal' we have a report on the reaction of the Government. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU's offer to give up half the Budget tax cuts in return for a big job creation scheme was rejected by the Federal Government yesterday, only hours after it was approved by more than 150 unions. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the very specific language of the rejection made by this Government. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The acting Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Brown, described the plan as a 'mild form of lunacy', hare-brained and absurd. </PARA>
<PARA>This was the reaction of the then Acting Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to this positive proposal involving a sacrifice of half of the indexation cuts. The response by the Acting Minister was that the plan was a mild form of lunacy, hare-brained and absurd. If we are properly to understand the hypocrisy and the recklessness of this Government do not let me immediately rely on my saying on behalf of the Opposition what judgments should be made about this sort of response by the Government. Let me briefly refer to the range of editorial reaction to this response of the Government. Firstly, I go to the Australian Financial Review of Monday, 6 September. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Instead of attacking the employment creation plan put forward by the Australian Council of Trade Unions last week it would do the Government and others more credit if they were prepared to realise how far the majority of unions in the ACTU have moved towards a rational approach to Australia's economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA> It is one of the great political faults of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, that his instinct to kick a political head when he sees it prevents him from realising how far the ACTU has in fact moved towards genuine social compromise in the scheme put forward last week. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . .</PARA>
<PARA> With an election looming in the not too distant future it is probably not surprising that the Prime Minister should not be willing to concede that the ACTU has travelled a long way along the path of reasonable compromise . . . If the Prime Minister were genuinely interested in consensus in the matter of wages policy he ought to recognise how far the ACTU has moved. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the Canberra Times of the same date. What was its reaction to the plan? It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has chosen to characterise it as ''lunacy'', and to reiterate that wage increases are the root cause of unemployment. That is the sort of simplistic rhetoric that gets us nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it has been hasty in dismissing it out of hand. That looks like a slap in the face to people prepared to drop their customary, hard adversarial role and try for real negotiation. It could lead to a very damaging standoff. </PARA>
<PARA>The Canberra Times said that the Government should accept:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that the ACTU has offered a genuinely useful set of proposals for negotiation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We come to what yesterday's Age had to say. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The insulting way in which the Fraser Government rejected the ACTU's economic plan on Friday permits only one conclusion: that the Government is now more concerned about election tactics than economic management . . . There has been a growing recognition on all sides that Australia must learn from the consensus policies of the countries that have weathered the recession best . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, one would have thought the Government would recognise- as anyone concerned with the issue must recognise-that the ACTU's proposal was a very bold step towards such a consensus . . . This is a big and courageous step for the ACTU to make, and it deserved a warm reception from the Government . . . The Acting Minister, Mr Brown, consulted Mr Fraser, who saw it as merely a threat to the Government's campaign strategy for an early election. </PARA>
<PARA>The Age went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> On his leader's instructions, Mr Brown not only rejected the offer, but did so in such a derisory manner as to suggest to the ACTU that it should not bother in future. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA> This is an abysmal way to run an economy. </PARA>
<PARA>It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Fraser Government has slammed the door on the union moderates seeking consultation. By virtually telling them not to come back, it has given carte blanche to unions with industrial muscle to get what they can, while those lacking muscle fall behind. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee), who is at the table, the Age had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate Mr Macphee may as well extend his holidays. There seems little point in negotiating an agreement when your principal wants a confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA>There is the wide range of reaction from the Australian Financial Review, the Canberra Times and the Age condemning the Government. What they said and indeed what we say here is not that the ACTU proposals are necessarily perfect and without the possibility of criticism, nor is it suggested that the ACTU would make that claim itself. What was universally recognised in those editorials was that here was a really constructive, positive approach along the road to consensus, a recognition on behalf of the trade union movement that wages can play some part in the creation of economic problems including unemployment. They recognised on the part of the trade union movement an openness, a frankness, a holding out of the hand and saying: 'Look, we know that what we do can have some impact upon what happens to other people. It can have an adverse impact. What are we doing? We are acknowledging that and acknowledging that part of the Government's Budget was helpful in regard to the tax indexation claim. We are positively saying that we are prepared to forgo a half of the tax indexation that has been offered. Why? We believe that in that way we, as a trade union movement, can try constructively to do something to help those who are unemployed'. What do the unions get for their pains? They get this condemnation that they are engaged in lunacy and hare-brained approaches. Is it any wonder that the Age, the Australian Financial Review and the Canberra Times condemn this Government and say that it was putting electoral advantage and perceived political advantage in front of the proper management and conduct of industrial relations of this country?</PARA>
<PARA> I say to my friend the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) at the table-I use those words 'my friend' advisedly-that the time has come when he must stand up and be counted on this issue. Is he going to repudiate publicly this offensive nonsense which, by general consensus, is seen to run counter to the best interests of this country? I simply cannot believe that the Minister endorses the approach of the Prime Minister and of the Minister for Communications, who on this occasion readily filled the role of malleable monkey for the organ grinder from Nareen. We had hoped that those sorts of days were behind us when the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Viner) was dismissed from this post. We have a tragedy in this country of high and rising unemployment which is an economic and a social disaster. The trade union movement, not necessarily with the perfect approach, has held out its hand in constructive co-operation. It is prepared to forgo half its tax indexation increases. The very least the Government should have done was to say: 'We welcome this constructive approach. We do not agree with all that you are putting, but we are prepared, in the interests of this country, to sit down and talk with you'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The relationship between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions just cannot be looked at in isolation in terms of the events of one week. I remind the House of the fact that on 7 July a tripartite conference was held at the request of the ACTU, agreed to by the Government with the employers, to consider what ought to be in the forthcoming Budget and what the interests of both sides of the industrial fence were. The ACTU put some very elaborate and certainly very constructive propositions to us. It actually made public a resume of what had been put on that occasion. In fact, if one drew up a table of what it put and what we have responded to in this Budget one would find that we have actually met all of its principal demands. Its demands did not contain a reference to the kind of so-called national employment fund which it announced last Friday.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr MACPHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am merely trying to be kind to the honourable member for Wills on this occasion. Clearly the drought proposals are the result of a worsening climatic situation; regrettably the unemployment situation has been with us for some time. We on the Government side have said that we do not in any way welcome the high levels of unemployment. We are doing what we can. We have said in many debates in this House, including one a couple of weeks ago, that we are trying to contain and reduce those high levels of unemployment. We sought the support of the ACTU in those measures. The ACTU had two opportunities before the Budget- the last of them was on 7 July-to put views about employment and unemployment. It did not do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has to be recognised is that the proposition now put by the ACTU, while it has the commendable features that the honourable member for Wills has pointed out, also has the commendable feature that the trade union movement of this country now acknowledges the importance of helping to curb unemployment and create employment. It also acknowledges that while it has not got all the answers and certainly is not fully responsible, it does bear some responsibility for improving that picture. It has that advantage and I can acknowledge that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr MACPHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. The practical observation which the honourable member for Wills chose to ignore is: How does one, three weeks after the Budget is presented, respond to that kind of argument? Is the ACTU, for example, powerful enough to say to its members: 'Sign on the dotted line. Sign away half your tax reduction'? Are those 50 per cent or more of persons in the work force who are not unionised going to have the ACTU speaking for them? Will they say: 'Yes, we are quite happy because there has been a Federal unions meeting and someone has decided on our behalf that we will forgo our tax reductions in the Budget'? What the Acting Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr N.A. Brown) did say and what the honourable member chose to ignore was contained in the last paragraph of the Acting Minister's Press release. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the ACTU wishes to have discussions with Government on the proposals it has put forward, then the Government is willing to do so. However, such discussions would need to be on the clear understanding of the importance the Government attaches to wage restraint in present economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The importance of that statement is that as a precondition, as it were, for this kind of national employment fund-a precondition for co-operation, so it seems, reading the ACTU's release-there was a commitment sought from the Government to support the maintenance of real wages. There were several references on the wages policy side to a precondition that the Government must agree to a centralised system of wage fixation which guaranteed indexation of wages. The Government made it clear that in the current economic circumstances that was not on. While I again congratulate the ACTU on getting this far, nevertheless one sees a great deal of vagueness in this quite extensive document. In fact, I have spoken by telephone to the President of the ACTU and said that when he thinks it is useful I would be pleased to have a yarn with him and any of his officials on what the plan means. We are agreed that the most useful thing for him to do now is to go, as he was asked to do by the meeting of last Friday, to the peak councils in the States-the trades and labour councils-and when he has completed that exercise we will have a discussion on what the document means. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not presume to quote the President but I think he would acknowledge the difficulty as is illustrated in that famous expression about the ink not being dry. When the Budget has been presented, what the ACTU has now put could not reasonably be entertained by the Government. It is hardly surprising that the recommendations put forward, both administratively and in terms of the principle of the Budget, cannot be accepted. But it is significant that, however belatedly the trade union movement generally, as distinct from some of its leaders, now acknowledges the seriousness of unemployment, the fact is that to some extent that situation is worsened and has been brought about by some of the actions of some of the militant trade union leaders in respect of excessive wage demands and hours reductions. It is a matter about which they could be concerned and should be concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important too to note that the national employment fund, even if it were feasible to administer, would amount to an extra cost of some $785m. Admittedly this is to be taken away from certain other taxpayers who would believe they need it and whom we believe will use it effectively. The Senior Vice-President of the ACTU puts the number of persons who might be trained under the scheme at only some 40,000 in the next six months and perhaps as many as 120 ,000 within a year. No government can seriously consider in isolation that sort of proposition as opposed to the care which went into the preparation of this Budget which is aimed, of course, at helping to retain present levels of employment, improve the real disposable income of people and in fact to restore our economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU has at last recognised the unemployment situation. Let us not forget that the Australian Labor Party overlooked unemployment in the preparation of its policy for its biennial congress. In fact, both sides of the labour movement have been rather remiss on the question of unemployment whereas the Government has consistently expended increasing sums Budget by Budget on training programs designed to give people a level of skill for permanent employment. It is also worth noting that the Victorian Premier is now reported to be seeking to break some election commitments that he made on employment subsidisation. Whilst I do not know whether he has made a firm statement on this matter, there are reports in today's Press indicating that he is interested in breaking that election commitment. One of the most important aspects of that is that glib statements are made sometimes by trade union officials and Labor politicians about the gravity of unemployment and the fact that somehow or other the Government has to produce a magical answer. I think the ACTU and the Opposition have to recognise that the time for putting these views forward is prior to the preparation of the Budget. Having said that, I certainly will look forward to a detailed discussion with the ACTU on its proposals, to try to put some flesh on the bones and to see how relevant they might be in the preparation of the next year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the trade union movement has come a long way in recognising the unemployment situation and the fact that there is a link between excessive wage increases or labour costs and unemployment. At this stage I believe it would be irresponsible for us to support the proposition for indexation of real wages. I believe that the ACTU and its members should look at the benefits that this Budget brings to them on 1 November. They should then make an assessment of what they believe might be done in the next year's Budget. No proposal of this nature was put to us in the tripartite discussions. I do not think that any reasonable person, including the editorialists, can expect the Government now, three weeks after the presentation of the Budget, to respond to a proposition of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA> If there was to be a federal union meeting one would have hoped it would have been before the tripartite conference. The date for the tripartite conference was set a good month before it was held and it was set to suit the convenience of the ACTU leadership. The statement by the ACTU on the mechanics of the fund to which reference has been made-indeed, it seems to me that the honourable member for Wills relied solely upon that fund-do not provide detail. They would not provide detail if he were in government trying to administer the fund. I have asked the ACTU when we do have our discussions to spell out what it wants to operate. Certainly as I read it now the Government would have to say to pay- as-you-earn taxpayers 'We are going to change our mind and call back the PAYE scale to take effect on 1 November'. This would be costly. It would be time consuming. It would mean that many people who are not affiliated with the ACTU and who would not want the ACTU speaking for them would say: 'Wait a minute, the Government is in breach of faith as far as I am concerned'. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole proposition is just too silly. The timing is quite absurd. I suggest that the wrath, or sense of frustration, which was felt by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Acting Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations owed itself to that. For the first time, a constructive tripartite discussion was held. All three parties told the Press how constructive and useful it was. The Prime Minister said that he and his Ministers took on board what the ACTU had to say and that its views would be reflected in the Budget. They were very clearly reflected in the Budget. On the night the Budget was brought down it was described as horrible. Three days later the ACTU had to put out a statement which showed, as the honourable member for Wills has acknowledged today, that the Budget had a number of good features which met things its members were concerned about. It had many good features and very few irritating features the more that members of the ACTU took the time to examine it. </PARA>
<PARA> At last Friday's meeting the ACTU produced some idea of a new employment creation fund. That idea was not advanced to us before the Budget, and it is clearly something which requires Budget implementation. It would require a complete rewriting of this Budget if we were to try to cope with it now. The idea has been thought through no better than some of the plans that have come from the ALP over the years for the creation of jobs by subsidisation, without any certainty that people would be employed for any real length of time and not at the expense of other people. No matter how one looks at this proposal, there are many more questions to be asked than are answered in the ACTU's document. I do not believe that it will be able to provide within the next few months a detailed program which would be capable of implementation. I do not believe, in other words, that had the ACTU put the idea to us on 7 July we could have got it into the sort of shape required in time for this Budget. I welcome the fact that the ACTU is concerned at last about the relationship between wage increases and unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In seconding the discussion of the matter of public importance brought forward by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), it is interesting to note that at last we have had a statement, or at least a few words, from the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee ) on the subject of employment. There is not much doubt from what he said that he does not agree with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown), who was acting in his place while he was away having a holiday. To put this matter into perspective, we need to look at some of the things that have happened since the Budget. On 24 August the Prime Minister was asked this question in this House in relation to the Budget:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What does the Budget do that will provide incentives to those making claims for increases in wages, particularly unions, to diminish those claims?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a very substantial incentive in the Budget to moderate wage claims as a result of the totality of the measures that the Government introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Wills indicated that the trade union movement in deliberations at its conference recognised that some of the things that were done in the Budget were of benefit to the union movement. The Prime Minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is reasonable, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions has recognised that it is reasonable, to think that this establishes a precondition for wage restraint through the course of this year. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said on 24 August, and I started to believe that perhaps the Prime Minister was learning that a consensus approach could work. However, it did not last long. As the honourable member for Wills clearly indicated, on 3 September when the ACTU approached the Government on this matter there was an immediate reaction. The confrontation approach took over while the Minister was absent and another Minister was taking his place. Clearly, the Prime Minister scorned the unions job deal. The Acting Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations described it as a mild form of lunacy, as the honourable member for Wills has said. The immediate reaction of this Government to a genuine attempt to do something about employment problems in this country was to attack it on a confrontation basis. From a few days after the Budget when there was a slight softening of the confrontation approach we went back into it full bore, while the Minister was away. </PARA>
<PARA> We are putting forward today the argument that there was an out-of-hand rejection. The honourable member for Wills has clearly indicated that. The statements that were made and the way in which they were reported in the Press were clearly seen by the public and the media in this country as indicating that a sensible proposal put forward for discussion had been rejected out of hand. It was a counter-productive rejection. Either we have a common sense approach in this country in negotiations on wages and conditions and dealings between governments and unions or we continue with the sorts of confrontation policies we have had for the last seven years, and which are counter-productive. They will not do anything for the stability of the economy in this country. They will not do anything for the problems of unemployment in respect of which the ACTU was trying to put forward proposals. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, who is at the table, has told us in statements on the Budget that we can expect unemployment to rise next year to 8 per cent, an increase of 40 per cent to 50 per cent over this year. He announced those figures in speeches following the Budget but when the trade union movement comes together and presents a plan for discussion the Government's approach is a confrontationist counter-productive rejection of the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of unemployment will not go away. The Minister said that a tripartite conference was held on 7 July so that the unions could sit down with the Government and put their claims before the Budget was brought down. The Government claims that it met the princpal demands, but it completely ignored any proposals on job creation. The Budget has clearly indicated that people will be out of work in greater numbers than ever before. The Government has come forward with no proposals for jobs. It claims that it is doing things for job training. There is not much point in the Government's putting money into job training when it is not prepared to put something towards creating jobs. The trade union movement made a genuine attempt. The union came together and said to the Government: 'We are prepared to put forward a plan whereby $725m of the tax indexation concessions can be used to create employment, to establish a national employment fund.' The Government is completely ignoring that proposal. It is using the work force as a tool for inflation control and doing nothing to counter the effects of unemployment on the families of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me get back to the matter of vital importance. The Minister first of all acknowledges that the proposals have some merit. He congratulated the ACTU on the document. He told us that he has spoken to the ACTU President and that he is prepared to negotiate and talk about employment problems with the trade union movement. What a complete opposite is the Minister's attitude to the initial reaction by the Prime Minister and the Acting Minister, who went to the Prime Minister and got the okay to issue his statement to the Press. Fancy any Minister, the day after a proposition is put forward to a government, saying that it is a mild form of lunacy, hare-brained and absurd! At the end of his Press release the Minister said that perhaps the Government could talk about it. This is the type of approach we have seen for seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> It will never do anything for the economy of Australia. If we really want to see the sorts of problems this has created in the past and will create in the future, particularly for this Minister, we only have only to go back to 28 April 1981 and the resignation of the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). What he said then is relevant right now. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Two things are relevant. First, effective industrial relations in this country have been put at risk by the undermining of the authority of the responsible Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>It was not a bad effort last week of the Prime Minister and his Acting Minister, while the Minister responsible was on holiday for a couple of days, to take the opportunity to undermine him completely. The former Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Second, the nation requires a steady and responsible conduct of its affairs, and especially in the extremely significant area of industrial relations. As my predecessor and I have frequently said, it is fundamental that the power of government in the field of industrial relations be used with fine judgement. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder how long it will be before we find the present Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, who is at the table, in the very same position in which this Minister found himself, being undermined by a Prime Minister who is interested only in confrontation and who is not interested in the unemployed of this country. The former Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA> This is especially so in an outmoded system of industrial relations unsuited to the shift of power between capital and labour. </PARA>
<PARA>Mark my words, those statements made on 28 April 1981 when another Minister of this Government resigned will definitely come back to the mind of this Minister. I challenge him here and now to repudiate those statements made by the former Minister and I challenge him and other speakers on the Government side, especially the next speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Connor (Mr Tuckey), who as usual is ready to have a go at the unions, to state publicly what this Government's position is going to be. Will he follow the Minister at the table, who presented logic and common sense and said that he intended to speak with the union movement? Or will he argue on the side of the Prime Minister and the Acting Minister who treat this matter as a confrontation contest at all times?</PARA>
<PARA> The unemployed of this country, who are estimated by the Minister at the table to be 8 per cent of the work force this year, are waiting for this Government to come up with a policy. The trade union movement has come forward with a sensible proposal. We have heard the Minister say that he is prepared to talk. We have heard the Prime Minister and the Acting Minister clearly scorn what the trade union movement did. This Government has to make up its mind what its policy on the unemployed is. Does it want confrontation and more problems or will it take a consensus line and talk sensibly to the union movement about the massive problems that come to any country which has 8 per cent unemployment and half a million people who cannot receive a job or a wage?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Albert Monk retired as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions there was a noticeable shift to place politics ahead of worker benefit in that organisation. The proposal being discussed here today demonstrates how far that movement has proceeded, accelerated no doubt by the success of its now past President in entering this place and being granted speedy if undeserved promotion. On Budget day the ACTU had no compunction in rejecting out of hand and before consideration a Budget which could certainly not be criticised for its generosity to wage earners, in both direct benefits and in support for labour intensive industries such as the building industry. We now find the ACTU promoting impossible and impractical schemes aimed not at improving the lot of its members but also at creating a platform for its past President and his Labor colleagues to attack the Government for not accepting this olive branch grafted to a nettle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not a constructive attempt to address the problems of unemployment in this country. It is a cynical and destructive attempt by the new political hopefuls of the ACTU to promote their personal positions at the cost of Australia and its workers. One newspaper suggests that this proposal was a genuine olive branch. That has been proposed to us today. An olive branch must give one some place to hold when one receives it. The ACTU made sure that there was no such place. What did it offer the public and this Government? Did it offer them a return to the 40-hour week or improved worker productivity and industrial practice? Did it make any proposals at all that might increase Australia's competitive position in world markets, such as simply ensuring that our goods are allowed to leave our ports? No. Did it offer to arrange the immediate opening of the Drayton coal mine with instant and direct creation of 150 jobs? No. Did it promise to stop money-grabbing strikes such as the meat industry strike in drought-stricken Victoria? I thought honourable members opposite might be interested in that. No, it did not. Did it promote a policy to guarantee Australian industry and its work force regular supplies of fuel and energy? No. We have at this moment a strike which is denying people jobs, and this proposal is supposed to be about job creation! Ho, ho, ho! What then did it offer? It offered to assume the role of government. So obsessed is the ACTU's executive with playing politicians that it has forgotten completely all the practical and constructive things that a council of trade unions should be doing on behalf of its members. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is funny that the honourable member for Wills should say that. My concern is that if the shadow Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations should revert to a family tradition and become a clergyman, no doubt the ACTU would then wish to assume the role of God, a position, it would appear, that some members of the Australian Labor Party-in particular the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins)-believe they have attained already. It is also obvious to me that the departure of the previous President has not created an improvement in the ability of the ACTU for economic understanding or for plain arithmetic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills has been proven singularly unimpressive in these fields, second in fact only to his total inability to provide this Parliament and his own party with bold new initiatives or proposals. He became a member of this House with great expectations for creating employment and then he recommended a return to the Regional Employment Development Scheme! He heaps bucketfuls of criticism on the Government but fails to make solutions himself. This shadow for a shadow Minister still believes, as do his colleagues, that two plus two equals seven. What better example than that which appears in this constructive ACTU proposal where it is suggested that by reducing workers' take home pay and consequently their spending power by $4 a week and company profits by some amount not yet specified, the money saved can be used to create extra jobs! New and unproductive jobs maybe; extra jobs never. The proposal is straight out double counting and typical of people who have neither had experience of business nor done manual labour. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, whilst I recognise the need to create equity in our taxation system by removing the practice of tax avoidance and evasion, I challenge completely the ACTU's reference and the Opposition's belief that this transfer of funds from the private sector to the public sector will create extra jobs; nor will any proposal such as the re-establishment of free health services or expanded welfare programs. Money must be provided from somewhere and it is time that the ACTU discovered and informed its members that they-the members-are and will remain the principal source of government revenue, whatever the political colour of the government. We will not improve the standard of living by providing a free service and then reducing wages through tax, and Opposition members can laugh at that. The ACTU and its past President seem committed to government job creation programs. The past President, of course, tried some direct input during his presidency of the ACTU. I commend him for trying. The notable attempt, of course, was the ACTU's takeover of Bourke's in Melbourne, a veritable workers' co-operative where the loyal union members would flock in their thousands thus improving their standard of living and creating jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us get the situation straight; the business failed and that is a fact. I can say that because we know that it is a fact. We do not have to have any innuendo about that. We know who thought it out. What is more, he got it for nothing, and he could not make a success of it then. Nobody went to his store because he did not have the same compulsion he had with union membership. Let us get down to the point and recognise the simple fact of prosperity. Prosperity was explained by two men who were discussing a successful and self-made businessman. One said: 'Ah, but he has been lucky.' The other said: 'Yes, and the harder he works the luckier he seems to get'. In those words lies the solution to unemployment in Australia. The solution does not lie in reduced wages, higher taxes, free medicine or higher unemployment payments, as proposed in the ACTU document. It lies in increased productivity per dollar paid. It lies in increased hours worked and, in particular, in work carried out for five days a week uninterrupted by strikes. It lies in more production and more exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ACTU can make suggestions about Government policy and at many times it has been welcome to do so. Its responsibility, nevertheless, is to get its own house in order first. Were the ACTU prepared to go down the genuine job-creation road instead of the Government-bashing road it might discover some of the following information. Yesterday the world spent $40 billion. Yesterday Australia spent $ 400m, about one per cent of that total world figure. Australia shares only one per cent of world trade and a very much smaller percentage of the labour intensive manufacturing sector. One need only refer to the standards of living that applied in Australia before its present involvement in international trade to realise that world trade is the basis for all employment in Australia today. That being the case, more than 6 million Australians gain employment from one per cent of world trade. As unemployment in Australia now stands below 7 per cent it can be said that an additional 0.07 per cent of world trade could remove all unemployment costs from the Australian taxpayer. Such a small percentage could hardly be measured, even in the present downturn of world trade, and is obviously achievable. It just requires that people get together as Australians and not suggest that one can take a dollar out of one pocket and put it in another pocket to create a job. That is all the ACTU proposal says. It is typical Labor Party economics and it is not worth two bob. Any time we like to look around we can see jobs going out the window because nobody has ever sat down--</PARA>

<TITLE>Price of Petrol</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia ( electors of the division of Grey) respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the recent seeking or granting of increases to the wholesale maximum price of petrol is recognised as an artificial means to enable oil companies to maintain their present profit levels, and the Federal Government to also retain its present high level of petrol excise through parity pricing of our oil, a stealth tax, against the predicted decline of the O.P.E.C. world oil prices.</PARA>
<PARA> This artificial tax and price increase imposed upon our oil (Aust. imports only 3 per cent of its oil requirement) by the Federal Government and oil companies, affects the whole of the economic structure of the Australian consumer, commercial and agricultural sectors. The stimulation this tax and price has upon hidden and indirect taxation, far surpasses any tax effect from any other single item essential to the welfare and living standards of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) All maximum wholesale petrol price increases sought or granted be refused or repealed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) a single standard maximum wholesale petrol price for the whole of Australia (city and rural) be established and initially based on March 82 CPI quarter.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Such a wholesale price be fixed for six months then adjusted in parity with pension/benefit increases twice yearly.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Parity pricing to world oil prices be re-adjusted to 50 per cent of O.P.E.C . prices at the December 82 CPI quarter, and to be adjusted half-yearly to maintain 50 per cent relativity to world prices.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) parity pricing and oil prices be re-introduced into the CPI indexes.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to enable appointments to be made of Special Prosecutors with clear authority and independence to institute in exceptional cases and carry on necessary prosecutions. These cases will be of such a special character that the community should not be left in the slightest doubt that prosecutions will be handled with the highest professional competence with complete independence from any extraneous consideration. The first appointment of a Special Prosecutor will be of a person to assume overall responsibility for the handling of the prosecutions for the alleged taxation frauds referred to as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and for co-ordinating the recovery by civil remedies under existing law of the amounts thereby lost to the Commonwealth. This legislation is therefore a clear indication of the Government's intention to proceed with the utmost vigour in these cases regardless of all considerations other than the proper enforcement of the law and the protection of the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal task of a Special Prosecutor will be in relation to breaches of laws of the Commonwealth or a Territory but he will be able to conduct prosecutions for offences against the laws of a State where he receives an appropriate appointment by or under the law of the relevant State. The Government is determined that the Special Prosecutor be backed and supported by all necessary staff including lawyers, accountants and investigating staff and special provision is made in clauses 17, 18 and 19 to ensure this result. The accountability of a Special Prosecutor is ensured by the requirement for annual reports of his operations. His independence is assured by the provisions of clause 7 limiting any direction or guidelines to directions or guidelines of a general character not relating to a particular case. Special Prosecutors appointed under the legislation will play an important role in the administration of criminal justice under Commonwealth law within the limits that will be imposed on them by the Attorney-General's delineation of their functions . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9) 1982 increase sales tax rates by 2 1/2 percentage points; that is, the three categories of sales tax rates are each increased by 2 1/2 percentage points. The lowest tax rate is increased from 5 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent; the intermediate rate, from 17 1/2 per cent to 20 per cent; and the top rate, from 30 per cent to 32 1/2 per cent. This is the second year in a row in which there have been significant increases in the rates of sales tax. Last year also sales tax rates increased by 2 1/2 percentage points, which means that the rate of tax on goods in the third Schedule, which incurs tax at the lowest rate, has gone up from 2 1 /2 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent in the last two Budgets covering a period of just one year. A trebling of rates in a year certainly is a very substantial rate of increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Goods covered in the lowest tax schedule which has had this enormous rate of increase in the rate of tax are principally household furniture and appliances and other household goods. Goods taxable at the intermediate rate have had their tax rate increased by one-third in the last two Budgets; that is, from 15 per cent to 20 per cent in the space of one year. These goods include cars, commercial vehicles, boats, computers, confectionery, stationery, soft drinks, spirits, beer and imported wine. The goods taxable at the top rate have had their tax increased by almost one-fifth in the space of one year; that is, over the last two Budgets. They include such items as radios, televisions, cameras, jewellery, cosmetics and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill removes exemptions from a range of goods and imposes tax on them at 7 1/2 per cent. The goods not exempt, but which will now be taxed, include maps; hand tools, including gardening tools; motion picture films; household drapery and soft furnishings, including sheets and towels; servicing and construction equipment; cleaning cloths; and blankets. All those items were not previously subject to sales tax but are to be taxed at 7 1/2 per cent from 1 January next year. Some of those goods which are now to become taxable were included in the range of goods the Government sought to remove exemption from last year. The House will recall that in last year's Budget an attempt was made to raise $330m in a full year by taxing a whole array of items which were previously not taxable. The Government has not sought to reintroduce such an attempt to tax all those items again this year, but some of those items have been included in the list of goods which are now to be made taxable. Of course, last year the Government dropped its attempts to spread that tax to the wide variety of goods which had previously been exempt. This year it has picked up a number of items at which it was looking last year, including soft furnishings, drapery, manchester and hand tools. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills amount to yet another move by the Government towards the introduction of a broadly based tax on goods and services. Over the last few years the Government has taken various measures to try to achieve this objective . In 1978 it set up an inquiry into such taxes as a broad-based tax on goods and services, which inquiry was soon abandoned following a major campaign by the Retail Traders Association. The Government set up another similar inquiry in 1980 following the 1980 election, which inquiry recommended an extended wholesale sales tax, which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) again rejected under political pressure by early 1981. In last year's Budget the Government extended the wholesale sales tax. The Treasurer denied that this was a move towards a more broadly based system and described it only as a small adjustment within the existing system. </PARA>
<PARA> Had all those intended changes in last year's Budget in respect of sales tax been passed the full-year revenue effect would have been a 32.7 per cent increase over the previous year's collections. It would have been a very substantial rate of increase in sales tax revenues indeed-hardly one, I would have thought, which befits the description of adjustment within the existing system. As I have previously mentioned, the attempts to obtain that substantial increase failed principally because the extension of tax to items previously exempt was abandoned eventually by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, of course, the Government has announced further extensions in this year's Budget equivalent to a 20.8 per cent increase over last year's collections. So we have that substantial increase in sales tax revenue this year . Many new goods have been brought into the sales tax system by the correction of so-called anomalies and the extensions to previously exempt goods in this year's Budget. This is little more than a gradual move to a broader-based tax by the back door, which we can expect to see more of in future Budgets should this Government remain in office-which seems very doubtful. </PARA>
<PARA> These increases mean that sales tax collections have risen from 6 1/2 per cent of total Commonwealth tax collections in 1980-81 to 8.7 per cent this year, which is a very substantial leap in just two years. This has happened because of the very substantial sales tax measures which were announced in last year's Budget and in this year's Budget. As I have said, all this indicates attempts by the Government to introduce a broad-based indirect tax system in this country-a substantial move towards indirect taxes and less reliance perhaps on income tax. The Government may talk of less reliance on income tax but there has not been much evidence of that until this year's Budget and even now the tax cuts are small indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not in favour of these measures but will not seek to prevent their passage by the Parliament. However, we wish to give formal expression to our concern at these measures. I therefore move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not opposing the Bills the House expresses its concern at the Government's actions in again increasing sales taxes, which increases will have adverse consequences in regard to inflation, the equity of the tax system, and living standards'. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me amplify our reasons for concern at the imposition of these tax increases. As the amendment moved at the second reading stage states, we are concerned about the inflationary impact of what the Government is doing. There is no doubt whatever that these measures add to the rate of inflation. The Treasurer admitted that. He said in this House in March 1981 that a $500m increase in indirect taxes represents a one per cent increase in the consumer price index. He admitted quite clearly that substantial moves towards reliance on indirect taxes increases the rate of inflation and pushes up the consumer price index at that rate-one per cent for an increase of $500m. By virtue of the Bills now before us, the government is seeking to increase sales tax revenue this financial year by $414m and by $595m in a full year. The full year effect-the figure one should look at if one is concerned about prices-is over $500m. We can therefore say that the Treasurer, on the basis of his own calculations given to this House, is directly and indirectly adding something like one per cent or more to the consumer price index by increasing these sales tax rates and removing exemptions. That is clearly what he is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a government which we are told fights inflation first, but last year and this year it sought to increase sales taxes in a way which clearly adds to inflation. The Government is fighting inflation by increasing prices. That is a very curious process indeed. This increase of one per cent from the increase in sales taxes in this Budget is not the end of the story. Other increases in indirect taxes in this Budget will certainly mean that in total the increase in the consumer price index, which comes from this move to increase indirect taxes, will be over 2 per cent. The total increase in direct taxes from measures announced in this Budget will be $1,046m this year but in a full year it will be $1,445m. That $1,445m, it can be seen, will add something near to 3 per cent to the consumer price index, on the basis that $500m equals one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget is supposed to be concerned, as all previous Fraser Government Budgets were concerned, with fighting inflation, but it is quite clearly, on the face of the increases in revenue and the calculations given by the Treasurer, directly adding nearly 3 per cent to inflation by the increases in indirect taxes contained in it. That strikes us as quite an incredible process. Clearly it means a very significant boost to inflation. It is of course a major reason for spiralling unemployment. The rate of unemployment is now nearly 7 per cent. The Government admitted that in the very near future it will be over 8 per cent, and the Australian Financial Review claimed that by the end of this financial year it will be 10 per cent. Despite spiralling unemployment we still have a rate of inflation of the order of 11 per cent, on the Government's own calculations. Of course, a major reason why it is still of that order is that the Government is directly adding nearly 3 per cent to the rate of inflation by measures such as the one now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were concerned about getting the level of inflation down, one would think it would not add 3 per cent to the inflation rate by its own actions , but that is what it will do. By increasing these taxes it quite clearly not only directly increases the level of the CPI but also stimulates income claims by wage earners and others to make up for that increase in prices, and therefore adds indirectly to inflation. So we have quite a substantial inflationary impact stemming from such action. Both directly and indirectly there are inflationary impacts which in the end cause this very high level of inflation to continue despite massive unemployment. It strikes us as quite an incredible economic policy to pursue inflationary measures at a time when the Government continues to say that it is concerned to fight inflation. I must say that in the last year or two that rhetoric has tended to break down a little. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year's Budget raised indirect taxes almost wholly through sales tax rate increases by $449m in that financial year, and $596m in a full year. If we look at last year's Budget and this year's Budget we can say that in the space of a year-it is only just over a year ago since we discussed last year's Budget; indeed, we did so at this time last year-we had increases in indirect taxes of the order of $2 billion, or $2,041m to be exact. Again, on the basis of the Treasurer's own calculations, that adds about 4 per cent to the inflation rate in the space of a year. That is the kind of inflationary impact that we see from the Government's own actions. It is indeed a very large influence on the inflation rate. If it were not occurring we could be pretty sure-in fact, we could be absolutely certain-that there would be a much lower inflation rate than at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make one other point in respect of the inflationary effect of sales tax increases, and that is that the increase in prices which occurs because of sales tax increases is not only the amount of the sales tax increase. This wholesale sales tax is placed on the last wholesale price, but between the wholesale price and the retail price there is a substantial mark up. The mark up includes the wholesale price which incorporates the amount of sales tax. When one increases the level of sales tax, with constant mark ups, there is an automatic increase in the price as a result of not only the increase in the sales tax but also the 50 per cent mark up or whatever it is. A 50 per cent mark up and a 2 1/2 per cent increase in the price of, say, a refrigerator as a result of this Budget means that the sales tax increase will also be marked up. The increase in the price of that refrigerator will be 3.75 per cent. With a 7 1 /2 per cent tax applying to refrigerators, the actual increase in price caused by taxing refrigerators is not 7 1/2 per cent but 11 1/4 per cent, assuming a 50 per cent retail mark up. That is something to bear in mind when we look at these increases. It is not just a 2 1/2 per cent increase in the price; it is a 2 1/2 per cent increase in the wholesale price which, with constant markups, means that the retail price will go up at a higher level than that. The Budget has accelerated the inflationary impact in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor which causes us concern about these measures is the regressive nature of indirect taxes. As I have shown in earlier debates, increases in indirect taxes bear most heavily on lower income groups. Increases in indirect taxes are likely to reduce the equity of the tax system. It certainly is true that various international studies have looked at indirect taxes in many countries to ascertain where they fall and who is most affected by them. Some have argued that where broad based indirect taxes such as VAT-value added tax- apply the impact is near proportional, or at best proportional. I know of no one who argues that indirect taxes have a progressive effect in the way that income tax does if in fact the tax is not avoided by people on high incomes, as is certainly the case in this country at present. But certainly those international studies indicate that at best there is a proportional impact from indirect taxes and that most often the tax is regressive. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the case in other countries we can certainly assume it to be the case here. Indeed, various studies have shown that that is the case here. I have alluded to those studies in previous debates in this House and I do not intend to refer to them now. We believe it is quite clear that the Australian indirect tax system is regressive. More reliance on that system means greater inequity in the tax system, or less equity, and that is a process which we deplore. In saying that I must take account of the fact that in this year's Budget the reductions in income tax that have been implemented-which cuts are in reality far less than the Government maintains after one takes account of the absence of tax indexation-are shaped in such a way that they do give greater benefits to lower income earners than to higher income earners, at least as regards the income tax scale. Items such as the mortgage interest tax deduction can be said to work in the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The countervailing increases in indirect taxes, much of which we are now discussing in the Bills before the House, will substantially, if not completely, offset the slight improvement in the equity of the tax system that comes from the revised income tax arrangements for this year. We do not see the tax system as having been improved in this Budget. Indeed, any benefits which have come from shaping the income tax cuts in a way which gives greater proportional benefits to people on lower incomes has been offset by the heavy additional increases in indirect taxes which are incorporated in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, dealing with the effect on living standards, the rise in sales taxes this year considerably reduces the improvement to living standards contained in other Budget measures. This financial year the average family will have its living standard reduced by $1.75 a week because of increased sales tax rates in the Budget. That figure comes from taking the total amount of revenue to be raised this year from sales tax increases and dividing that total by the number of Australian households. We get about $1.75 a week in additional sales tax payments per Australian household this financial year. With other increases in indirect taxes there will be an impact of about $4.40 a week on the living standards of Australian households. That is, they will pay on average $4.40 a week more in indirect taxes this year than they did last year as a result of the increases in the tax rates and the abolition of some exemptions which are contained in the Budget. That increase in sales tax more than counteracts the benefits from this year's Budget for many families, indeed for most of them, as I pointed out in my speech on the Budget. I do not intend to go back over them. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the increases in indirect taxes in the last two Budgets, in association with the increase in the income tax burden that has occurred in those two Budgets taken together, have more than wiped out the benefits to living standards from other measures in this year's Budget for almost all households. We can say that over the last two years there has not been a reduction in income tax. Indeed, there has been an increase in the income tax burden for Australian households. There has also been a significant increase in the indirect tax burden on Australian households, and those increases in the direct and indirect tax burden quite clearly and markedly outweigh any benefits contained in this year's Budget by way of increased family allowances or other benefits. We see Australian family living standards as having been adversely affected by the increases in indirect taxes in last year's Budget and in this one. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fourth area of concern about the measures now before the House. We cannot accept the Government's arguments for implementing these increases. The Government argues, for two reasons, that it is desirable to place greater reliance on indirect taxes and less on income tax than is currently the case. Firstly, the Government says that we raise an unduly high proportion of our total tax revenue from income tax and therefore we should move more to indirect taxes. Secondly, it says that greater reliance on indirect taxes would enable us to reduce our losses through tax avoidance and tax evasion. Those are the two key arguments which this Government continually refers to as being reasons to move towards a broad based indirect tax system or more reliance on indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the first of those arguments, it is already the case that we raise a higher percentage of our taxes from indirect taxes than do countries generally in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That is, on average we raise a higher proportion of our taxes from indirect taxes than do Western capitalist countries. The latest year for which we have comparable statistics is 1979. In that year Australia raised 31.71 per cent of its taxes from indirect taxes and the OECD average was 29.35 per cent. So in 1979 we were quite notably above the OECD average for the proportion of our taxes which we raised through indirect taxes. Since 1979 we have had big increases in the crude oil levy, and in the last two Budgets we have had big increases in sales taxes and other indirect taxes. We can assume, I think rightly, that that differential between us and the OECD would have increased over the three years since 1979. We believe that the argument that we need to move more towards indirect taxes because we have an undue reliance on income tax simply ignores the fact that Australia already has a relatively high proportion of its taxes raised through indirect taxes. The Government will simply not confront that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The second argument which the Government uses is that more reliance on indirect taxes will help to reduce tax avoidance and tax evasion. I should like to make two points about that. It is just a straight cop-out to say that we cannot overcome the tax avoidance problem, therefore we will move more towards indirect taxes and make sure that those who are currently avoiding tax at least pay some tax through higher sales taxes. That is the kind of argument that is being used and it is one which we believe is totally and completely unacceptable. The duty of this Government is to make sure that people do not avoid income tax. Of course, as we have known from what has been discussed in this House in the last couple of weeks, and indeed over the last few years, this Government has been hopeless in preventing massive tax avoidance and evasion. Having come to the point almost of despair at its total inability to close off tax avoidance and evasion, or unwillingness to do anything about it, the Government says: 'Let us move more towards indirect taxes because at least in that way we will ensure that when people spend their money on various goods they will pay some taxes'. We believe that that is a complete cop-out of the Governments responsibilities. It is duty bound to ensure that it does everything in its power to prevent tax avoidance and evasion. I do not want to canvass the arguments in that regard now , but it is patently not doing that. It should be doing that if it wants to overcome the problem of tax avoidance, not use this cop-out approach and saying: 'Let us move towards indirect taxes so that the tax avoiders have to pay something when they buy a refrigerator, a blanket or whatever'. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reaction we have to the Government's argument is that it is simply not the case that indirect taxes are avoidance proof or anywhere near it. It is not the case overseas; it is not the case here. A report entitled 'Value Added Tax-a Study of its Practical Aspects' by J. D. Petty, a research paper for the Taxation Institute of Australian Research and Education Trust, is a study of indirect taxes overseas. It shows quite clearly that in country after country- the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Denmark and Italy-there has been great trouble in preventing avoidance of value-added tax. Value-added tax is supposed to be the most secure, most self-enforcing, most avoidance proof of all the indirect taxes. Yet here we have a study which points to all sorts of problems that have been faced by governments overseas with the value-added tax. If one looks at the overseas experience one certainly cannot get any satisfaction about indirect taxes being avoidance proof, and therefore if we go more towards indirect taxes we will overcome the problems of tax avoidance. We simply will do that, on the basis of overseas experience. In regard to our own experience there is no reason to believe that that would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Asprey Taxation Review Committee, which reported in 1975, indicated a variety of ways in which sales taxes could be easily avoided. Recent annual reports of the Commissioner of Taxation have indicated a considerable degree of detected avoidance and evasion of sales taxes. The latest annual report of the Taxation Commissioner says that 20,206 investigations were conducted during 1980 -81 resulting in additional tax and penalties of $20.6m. This is some evidence of avoidance and evasion. Also, the annual reports of the Taxation Commissioner show that the number of legal proceedings for enforcement of sales tax increased by 214 per cent between 1975-76 and 1979-80. In a very short period indeed we had a very substantial increase in the number of legal proceedings in this area. So, we can see that evidence shows that there is great difficulty in preventing avoidance of sales tax and indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> But there has been also a lot of evidence recently about various new schemes which have been introduced in regard to avoidance of sales taxes. These take various forms. One form this avoidance takes is through price splitting which is used predominantly in the cosmetic, soft drink and pet food industries. Essentially, the price of a good is split into a manufacturing cost and a service cost with the service cost being funnelled through a subsidiary company set up for the purpose. The price claimed as the price of the product is taxable but the service charge is not. Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd is one company which has reportedly set up a service company in February of this year. It began double invoicing customers for, on the one hand, a service charge and, on the other hand, the cost of soft drinks. There have been various other evidences in the daily Press of this and other forms of schemes. As recently as yesterday there was an article in the Sydney Sun which was headlined 'Dealers In $250 mil Car Tax Fraud'. What this article does is to expose the way in which car dealers are paying very little sales tax indeed on new cars. As that becomes more widely known the competitors are forced to get into the business otherwise they are undercut in their pricing and lose the business. So, we are seeing a mushrooming of that scheme which the Sydney Sun says is in the order of $250m. There is, quite clearly a lot of evidence of avoidance of sales taxes. It is a nonsense to say that this is an avoidance proof tax and that a movement in this area will mean less tax avoidance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It never ceases to amaze me, following as I often do the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), in speaking on economic subjects such as sales tax, the way he can pursue the figures to represent a case which I find extraordinarily difficult to believe. He suggested that Australia has a high level of indirect taxation compared with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. I just happen to have with me the statement that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) made on 12 March 1982. That statement shows clearly that the proportion of total tax revenue raised in Australia from general consumption taxes was 6.1 per cent. Out of 22 OECD countries we rank twenty-first. How on earth the honourable member can say then that we rank highly amongst the other OECD countries is absolutely beyond me. I suggest that the honourable member for Gellibrand refer to that speech and the tables 1 to 4 annexed to it which should clarify the matter for him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year's Budget increases both expenditure and receipts. Part of the increase in receipts is from the sales tax measures which are the subject of this debate. Before I discuss them in detail I will deal with some of the broader issues. Clearly, in a time of world and Australian economic recession the type of Budget a government brings down must have different goals from a Budget presented in a relatively better economic climate. This Budget increases expenditure by 13.9 per cent and receipts by 11.3 per cent. That expenditure could well be increased further with the drought aid announcement made last week . That aid, of course, is meeting a specific need which has arisen in rural areas. Given the disastrous nature of the drought, its extent and its effects that aid was clearly called for, and I welcome the Government's initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is that the increase in expenditure and the deficit is clearly aimed at stimulating the economy in this period of recession. I believe it is appropriate and defensible on those grounds. I say that because I am a strong believer in smaller government rather than larger government. I adhere to the view that we ought to be pressing to reduce the size of government. However, to adopt rigidly that line of argument while ignoring the recession and the appropriate remedy for our current economic ills would be unrealistically intransigent. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be well known that during the 1930s recession governments generally undertook a great deal of belt-tightening which many believed aggravated the problems of that period. Having learned our lesson most economists agree that it is better now to try to mildly stimulate economic activities in times such as this, which, of course, is one of the objectives of this Budget. Australia is not only confronted with a world recession but also the recession comes at a time when, as a result of excessive wage demands, we have seriously disadvantaged ourselves because we have lost a great deal of our competitive advantage on world markets. It is, therefore, essential that our wages structure be brought into line with the rest of the world. This Budget provides enormous assistance through reductions in taxation and an increase in benefits to all Australians. The benefits especially for the average family are worth around $20 a week. Even if we deduct the cost of the increases on sales taxes imposed by these Bills it is well recognised that the average family will still be around $ 17 a week better off. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken the initiative to increase take-home pay. That initiative must be taken into consideration when wage increases are being sought . It is in this context that I repeat: Our wage structure must be brought into line with the rest of the world. I am, therefore, disgusted when I see that, despite the Government's action and despite the high level of unemployment in Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions appears to remain intent on entrenching excessive levels of wages growth. I quote the Acting Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the present Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown), who said on 3 September:</PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU's wages strategy, if put into effect, would mean a substantial further increase in real earnings over 1982-83, a further squeeze on profits and a marked deterioration in employment. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> This strategy involves a specific campaign of industrial action in sensitive industries in order to force employers to concede. The unions seem unwilling to bring their claims to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission where they can be examined on their merits with regard to the public interest, free of disruptive industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA>If Australia is to progress out of this recession there must be co-operation from the unions, otherwise there will be higher unemployment and lower standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the details of these Bills. The Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9) impose an increase on the various rates of sales tax of 2 1/2 percentage. In other words, the respective rates will increase from 5 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent, from 17 1/2 per cent to 20 per cent and from 30 per cent to 32 1/2 per cent. The result is an increase in revenue this year of $370m and, in a full year, an increase of $490m. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill imposes sales taxes of 7 1/2 per cent on a range of goods that were previously exempt. Those goods range from mats, hand tools and to equipment used in the course of servicing, repair or construction. It does not include goods which become part of the goods being repaired or the structure being built . The Bill will increase revenue by $44m this year and $105m in a full year. The total estimated revenue from these changes this year will be $414m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a full year this will amount to $595m. It is interesting to hear the interjection: 'Ripping off the poor'. I believe we ought to compare those increases with the expected cost to government revenue of some of the income tax reductions which are initiated in this Budget. Honourable members will see from the figures that the interjection is totally false. The Opposition seems blind to the real economic effects of this Budget. There are changes in the income tax rates scale and I will outline them: There is a reduction in the standard rate of tax from 32c down to 30c in the dollar; there is an increase in the tax free threshold from $4,195 to $4,595; and the standard rate step of tax will rise from $17,894 to $19,500. The cost for this year will be $1,468m. Let us compare that with the $414m increase in revenue from the sales tax measures, the subject of these Bills. It is quite clear that the thrust of the Budget is to increase take home pay. The interjections are totally false. The full year cost of the income tax reductions is $2,357m. Compare that with $595m, the full year cost of the sales tax measures, the subject of these Bills. There is no doubt that those figures support the view that families will be better off as a result of this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there is a further and important matter to be considered when discussing these Bills. They are a step in the right direction in correcting an imbalance in our reliance on income tax as a source of revenue. I will refer to the table which I referred to earlier in this debate, which is an annexure to the Treasurer's statement last year. One can see that 20 years ago, in 1962-63, the proportion of the Commonwealth Government's revenue raised from personal income tax was around 37 per cent. This year it is around 55 per cent. In other words, over the last 20 years there has been a steady growth in the proportion of revenue coming from income tax. I believe it is imperative to redress this situation because high levels of income tax are a disincentive for individuals. It is a disincentive to invest and a disincentive for individuals to increase their work effort or to do overtime. These are fundamental reasons why there are obvious advantages in changing the mix of direct and indirect taxation. Clearly, if we are to shift our emphasis of revenue raising away from direct taxation it will increase the prospect of further substantial and desirable reductions in direct tax, particularly personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills are effective in reducing the amount that would otherwise have to be raised by income tax not only by increasing sales tax on some items that are already taxed but also by broadening the base of goods which are to be subject to sales tax. In fact, this year, the proportion of revenue raised by income tax will remain high even though there is an increase in sales tax. This year it is estimated that personal income tax will raise 55.8 per cent of the Commonwealth Budget's taxation revenues. Company tax will raise 12.6 per cent. It is worth looking at that figure because last year the proportion of the Budget raised from company tax was 13.9 per cent. The year before it was 15 per cent. Why the proportion of company tax has dropped is pretty clear. The rate of profitability of our companies in Australia has fallen because there has been an unbelievable wage push in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of revenue raised from customs, excise and sales tax will increase this year from 20.8 per cent to 22.2 per cent of total taxation revenues. The proportion of revenue arising from the crude oil levy will fall from 8.4 per cent last year to 7.4 per cent this year. So overall the proportion of revenue arising from personal income tax will fall by less than one per cent. One reason is that the amounts raised from company tax and the crude oil levy will fall. The proportion of tax arising from the customs, excise and sales tax measures will increase and the proportion arising from personal income tax will remain about the same. However, I reiterate that, given economic recovery and increased company profitability, there is the prospect that revenue from company tax will rise and further reductions in personal tax could be a prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention briefly two other points. If we continue to shift the burden from direct tax to indirect tax this will mean that those who buy goods for resale, which are subject to the tax, will have to find larger amounts of money to fund the purchases of those goods for the period they remain unsold. At the moment sales tax is payable 21 days after the month in which the goods were purchased by the person intending to resell them. Therefore, if we are to continue to go down the track of moving from direct to indirect taxation the Government will have to give consideration to the time which is given to pay these taxes. At the moment 21 days is allowed. It may well be that to ease the burden on the cash flow, particularly that of small businesses, that period ought to be reviewed to see if more time to pay should be given in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I want to raise is the confusion which inevitably follows the announcements on Budget night of increases in sales tax. There was an example again this year of consumers going into shops and small businessmen not knowing whether to impose the new sales tax. There is a clear distinction between excise and sales tax. Some excises are imposed from the night of the Budget, but sales taxes are imposed on goods which are subsequently bought by the retailer. It is, therefore, not correct for the retailer to impose those sales taxes unless they are in respect of goods which are bought by the retailer following the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Commissioner of Taxation ought to make available an explanation of the difference between the excise and sales tax increases which inevitably occur in budgets. If such an explanation is readily available to small businessmen I think it would be of benefit to them and when changes occur after a Budget they would know whether they had to increase the prices of their goods. That will avoid the problem which arose in Adelaide this year when some businessmen put up the price because they did not know. Customers were aggrieved -reasonably and fairly so-by that. They took the matter up, I understand, with the office of consumer affairs in South Australia. If the Commissioner of Taxation could make the above mentioned information available I think it would assist the small businessman. I conclude by wholeheartedly supporting these Bills as part of what I believe is a very welcome Government Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me first of all disillusion the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) concerning the proportion of total taxation in Australia which is raised by way of indirect taxes. I am perfectly aware of the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has quite deliberately misrepresented the position in order to justify the switch that has taken place towards indirect taxes. To have the honourable member for Barker compound that mistake, that deliberate misrepresentation, by not bothering to check the figures makes the situation even worse. I say quite emphatically that Australia does not raise a relatively small proportion of total taxation by way of indirect taxes. In fact, the situation in Australia is quite to the contrary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most recent figure available from the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development concerning the proportion of total taxation raised by way of indirect taxes in Australia is 31.7 per cent. That is the figure given by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) in his contribution to this debate. The figure that has been given by the Treasurer before and which was repeated by the honourable member for Barker relates only to sales tax. Of course, it is very convenient for the Treasurer or for any other honourable member on the Government side simply to-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the position. The Treasurer was referring only to sales tax. He knows it. For the honourable member for Barker not to make the effort to go and check those figures in the first place to confirm that the Treasurer is not only misleading us but quite obviously also is misleading honourable members who sit behind him is a disgraceful situation. This is particularly so because these figures have been used to justify the transfer of the tax burden away from the high income earners, who should pay more under the progressive direct tax scale-who can and should pay more-to those people who should not be expected to carry the burden. The changes that have been introduced by this Government, particularly the changes over the last two years, have been based on that sort of deliberate fallacy on its part. It is about time it was put to rest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9) and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill represent a continuing assault by this Government on the living costs and living standards of Australian families. The Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9) have the effect of increasing by 2 1/2 percentage points all those increased rates which applied from last year anyway and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1982 has the effect of bringing into the sales tax net a number of goods that had previously escaped it. There is no question that the Government is quite determined to continue this assault. It was thwarted last year in the miserable attempt that it made to inflict a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on what were classified as the necessities of life, for example, kids' clothing and shoes, building materials for people's homes, and books and newspapers. Fortunately that was rejected by the Senate and the Government has not had the gall to reintroduce it-at least not on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole Budget package was introduced in the context of an early election. If that election takes place there will be a reversal in approach and the Government will introduce all these fiscal measures next year. The Government knows that, we know it and the Australian community knows it as well. Despite all the Government's rhetoric about adjusting the tax mix, the fact remains that indirect taxes are regressive, unjust, inequitable and create a much more severe burden on lower income earners. The approach that this Government has taken to this question throws into very serious doubt any suggestion that this Government might be humane or might have any compassionate feelings for those people in the community whom it continues to burden. </PARA>
<PARA> The repeated claim by both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer in relation to indirect taxes is that there is some need to adjust the tax mix, to place more emphasis on indirect taxes, to provide scope for a reduction in personal income tax. In fact what is their real objective? I think this was indicated very clearly in a radio interview with the Prime Minister in Perth in December last year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Also I think the best way to spread the burden a bit is to have a broader-based indirect tax--</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the next group of words:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . because that does raise quite a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed it does. It is raised from people who should not be expected to make the contribution of that big amount of money. I will quote from the editorial of the Newcastle Herald of 1 September last year relating to the consideration given to sales tax intentions at that time. The following are not my words but are from a responsible, reputable and highly respected major provincial newspaper in Australia. The editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing the Government says on taxation can be accepted with anything but scepticism. </PARA>
<PARA>What the article went on to state is in marked contrast with the sort of nonsense we get from honourable members on the Government side, including the Treasurer, who should be here when the Budget is being considered rather than flying around the world. He should be here not only to answer the charges about the Costigan and McCabe-Lafranchi reports but also to defend his Budget. The Newcastle Herald continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The regrettable aspect of the political juggling is that sales tax is here to stay. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a vicious tax, and in some respects even an undemocratic one. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is. There is no way in which the Opposition will support the continuous shift towards indirect taxes. Of course, the Treasurer repeated the claim when introducing these amendment Bills this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I drew attention last year to the clear advantage that lies in effecting some change in the mix of direct and indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I again emphasise the potential that such a change generates for desirable reductions in direct taxes, particularly personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Government was taking advantage of the situation before what it thought was going to be a snap election to introduce these measures. The more obvious measures appear to have some sort of concessional arrangement built into them. Obviously the Treasurer has learnt the way in which it is possible to finance tax cuts that he was wondering about in April this year. He said: 'Tax cuts are not feasible. Where are we going to find the money?' He has discovered the solution: To provide tax cuts with the one hand you must drag the money back with the other. Of course, that is what these sales tax increases are intended to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sales Tax Amendment Bills are designed to impose a sales tax of 7.5 per cent in a range of goods that are now exempt from the sales tax under the First Schedule. Let us look at some of the things that will impact on households. There will be a 7 1/2 per cent sales tax on cleaning and polishing cloths, cleaning sponges, handkerchiefs, blankets, braid, ribbon and tape, household drapery and soft furnishings. Some of the goods taxed that will have an impact on industry are contained in the first list but as well as those are hand tools, engine cleaning cotton waste, and servicing and construction equipment. Of course, last year the Government wanted to impose a 2 1/2 per cent tax on building materials but it was not allowed to get away with it. This year the Government has decided to compensate in some way-it still wants to make sure that the home builders are ripped off-by building into the cost of home construction in Australia a 7 1/2 per cent sales tax on equipment used to build homes. That particular provision is to give a net result to revenue this year of $44m and $105m over a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The next provision is even more interesting and fascinating. Let us look at some of the provisions of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9) for this year. First of all, the 5 per cent sales tax rate will be increased to 7.5 per cent. I do not think we should allow the claim to continue to be made that the increase is 2.5 per cent. In fact, it is not; it is an increase of 2.5 percentage points and the increase in the sales tax is 50 per cent. In two years the sales tax paid on those items included in the Third Schedule has increased by 200 per cent. The increase in sales tax on items in the Fourth and Fifth Schedules and those goods that were not covered by any Schedules has been from17 .5 per cent to 20 per cent. It was suggested again that that is an increase of 2 .5 per cent. In fact, the increase is 14.3 per cent and it should be recognised as such. The sales tax levied on items in the Second Schedule has increased from 30 per cent to 32.5 per cent. Again, it has been suggested that the increase is 2.5 per cent. It is nothing of the kind; it is 8.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the fascinating contrast between the 8.3 per cent increase in sales tax and the other increases. The percentage increase of 8.3 per cent will apply to things such as jewellery and furs, gold plated wear, perfumery and bath salts. I will now tell honourable members some of the things on which sales tax will increase by 14.3 per cent. They do not include the bath salts of the wealthy but the soap of the lower and middle income earners, kids' bicycles, soap powders, disinfectants, soft drinks, toilet paper and kids' toys. The percentage increase in sales tax on those items is 14.3 per cent but the percentage increase on the bath salts of the wealthy, the gold plated wear, the perfumery and the jewellery and furs of the wealthy is 8.3 per cent. The increase of 50 per cent goes on refrigerators, washing machines and a range of household goods. So the people who are struggling to get their homes together will pay an increase in sales tax of 50 per cent. What a miserable approach. Is there anyone on the Government side who can reasonably defend such a proposition ? The increases will give a net result this year of $370m and the rip-off over a full year will be another $490m. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the total increases in this Government's Budget from indirect taxes . The increase in the existing rate of 2.5 percentage points, not 2.5 per cent, will yield $490m in a full year. The application of sales tax at a rate of 7.5 per cent to goods in the First Schedule will yield $105m a year. The excise on distillate for off-road use will yield $176m a year. The increased excise on beer will yield $135m a year. The increased excise on cigarettes and tobacco will yield $125m a year. The total increase will be $1,031m a year. We can add to that the commensurate increases on Customs and excise duty, the tax on bank transactions and other indirect taxes yielding $200m in a full year. We can add the increase that is expected on the excise duty on oil and liquified petroleum gas this year which will be another $220m. So the increases continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I will finish on this point: In 1975-76 the proportion of total taxation which was provided by indirect taxes was 28 per cent. That was at the end of the period of the last Labor Government. That Government had been able to reduce the proportion because it did not believe that indirect taxes should be raising the revenue. Now the proportion is back up to 30 per cent. There is no question that if the Australian people want equity built into the tax system and the way in which the Australian community is managed there is only one party in Australia that is determined to and capable of building equity into the system and that is the Australian Labor Party. The Australian people will have the opportunity to establish that change very shortly. </PARA>

<PARA> The total revenue from sales tax in 1982-83 is estimated by the Treasury to be $3,629m, an increase of 27.1 per cent over last year. When one considers that the increases last year were 35.8 per cent over those collected in 1980-81, the amount of revenue now being collected by the Government shows up starkly as being a particularly heavy burden on the Australian community. The total revenue increase in sales tax since 1980-81 has been $1,527m or 72.6 per cent. In cold hard terms the increases in sales taxes over the last two years mean that a family of four is paying an additional $7 per week on the acquisition of goods and services. If the excise increases on fuel are included the rise in indirect taxes over the two year period amounts to $8.40 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> In February this year, when debating the Government's Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981 [No. 2], I predicted that by next year the Government would be extending the sales tax provisions to incorporate the taxing of food and services in accordance with the suggestions made by the Treasury in its 1974 Taxation Paper No. 5 dealing with Commonwealth taxation of goods and services. My prediction, which was vehemently denied by Government members at that time, although not yet completely fulfilled, has been partially vindicated. The new sales tax of 7.5 per cent to be applied to a range of goods and services bites further into the area which has never been subject to taxes before. On 17 September 1981 I had incorporated in Hansard appendices D and E of Treasury Taxation Paper No. 5 of 1974.

<PARA> This table is presented in such a way as to show the expected yield from goods that might fairly be brought within the coverage of the tax, more essential goods that would be more difficult to bring back within the coverage of the tax, and finally those items of expenditure which fall at least in part outside the definition of consumption expenditure and which would involve to some extent the taxation of producer goods. It can be seen that the first category of goods, the taxation of which might encounter less opposition than the second category, would provide only limited additional revenue. </PARA>

<PARA> The table shows estimates on the basis of four different assumed rates of tax. If services were included within the scope of a retail sales or value added tax it would be desirable in the interests of administrative simplicity for the rate on services to be the same as that on goods. A separate tax on services in conjunction with the existing wholesale sales tax would not necessarily result in administrative advantages if imposed at the same rate as the tax on goods. It is not necessary, therefore, to think in terms of rates equivalent to the wholesale sales tax. It can be seen, however, that quite high rates of tax would be necessary if substantial amounts of revenue were to be raised by taxing services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. From an examination of these tables it is easy to see how the Government is gradually taxing by stealth those goods and services which were previously exempt. In the 1981 Budget, tax was applied to many of the goods shown in appendix D. Those items which escaped the tax in 1981 have now in the main been caught by the present legislation. The major item still not gripped for sales tax is foodstuffs. Turning now to appendix E, we see that for the first time the Government is going into the services area to collect sales tax. It is hitting the repairs section which, incidentally, will yield the second highest return after travel costs on which sales taxes will now be levied. I would think that after the Government's reversal on previous promises made on the imposition of indirect taxes I am on fairly safe ground still by saying that within 12 months this Government intends imposing sales tax on foodstuffs and the remainder of the goods and services outlined in appendices D and E. Government members can deny those remarks all they wish but the actions of this Government to date in this area have proved otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer in his Budget Speech to the House this year and last year said that the Government is seeking to move gradually away from a reliance on personal tax as a source of revenue to a widening of the indirect tax base. I should like to outline some of the goods and services which will now be subject to the imposition of sales tax for the first time and others which will be subject to the overall increase of 2.5 percentage points. My reason for outlining some of the items is to show how the disposable incomes of the Australian community will be affected under these measures. The Treasurer, in his Budget Speech, dismissed the increases in two and a half lines when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> This broadening of the sales tax base is to include goods such as hand tools, construction equipment and manchester. It does not include what some have regarded as the 'necessities of life'. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation now under debate provides for a 7.5 per cent sales tax to be imposed on goods and services which until now had not been subject to any tax. I have not time in this debate to go through all the matters, but if we look through the schedules, excluding the items now to be gripped by this tax, we see quite a number of household items listed: Household drapery and soft furnishings , namely, bedsheets, bedspreads, curtains and textile cords, loose furniture covers, pillowcases, quilts, tablecloths, table covers, table mats, table napkins, table runners and doilies, tea-towels, towels, face cloths and face washers, blankets, travelling rugs and handkerchiefs made of cloth. One could go on and on, but time does not permit. Goods now being taxed at 32.5 per cent compared with 30 per cent last year include radio and television receivers, record players, cameras, video recorders, watches, jewellery, et cetera. Tax on these goods will raise $565m this financial year, an increase of 18 per cent over last year. As my colleague the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) pointed out a few minutes ago, these items are bought by people who can well afford them and who are not being subject to the same percentage increases as those on the lower scale. </PARA>
<PARA> Goods now being taxed at 20 per cent compared with 17.5 per cent last year include motor cars and commercial vehicles, boats, confectionery, stationery, computers, soft drinks, et cetera. Tax on these goods will raise $2,764m this year, an increase of 24.6 per cent over last year. Goods now subject to a tax of 7.5 per cent compared with 5 per cent last year include household furniture, appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and other household goods. Tax on these goods will raise $300m this year, an increase of 92.3 per cent over last year. So we can see where the burden is falling. As I mentioned previously, the total sales tax collections this year of $3,629m are an increase of 27.1 per cent over last year and represent an extra payout of $3 per week for the average family man with a wife and two children. The present increases in sales tax are completely reprehensible as they hit hardest those on lower incomes. The statement by the Treasurer that the goods being taxed do not include necessities of life is not a feasible one. Would anyone really suggest that household furniture, refrigerators, stoves, mattresses, blankets, bedsheets, towels and tablecloths, to name a few items, are not necessities of life? If the Treasurer does not consider such items as necessities of life, he and other Government members are suggesting a very low standard of living for the Australian community. Of course these and many other goods being taxed are necessities of life and as such should be free of any tax. Irrespective of a family's income, these goods are a necessity in the home. To back up my statement that indirect taxes fall heaviest on those on lower incomes, I refer the House to a number of studies carried out in this area. The first study I refer to was carried out by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia and is titled 'The Reform of the Commonwealth Government Sales Tax' and is dated August 1982. On page 10 of that report, under the heading 'Equity', it states:</PARA>
<PARA> In assessing the equity of a tax it is useful to distinguish between horizontal and vertical equity. To satisfy horizontal equity, a tax should impose the same burdens on individuals having an equal capacity to pay tax. Vertical equity requires that individuals with unequal capacity to pay be treated differently and in accordance with that inequality. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Vertical equity considerations suggest that a tax should be proportional or progressive with respect to income. Hence there is concern about the regressive nature of a broad-based indirect tax. Although essentially proportional in terms of consumption expenditure, the tax is regressive as related to income. This is because the proportion of income spent on consumption goods declines with movement up the income scale. The question then arises as to whether any regressivity introduced by the proposed changes should be compensated by income tax or social welfare adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that the tax cuts afforded the community offer only an indexation catch-up and in no way compensate for the massive increases in indirect taxes. The next study I refer to is the 1975 report of the Taxation Review Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Asprey. It showed quite clearly that taxation is very sharply regressive at the lower end of the household income scale, nearly proportional in a wide middle band, and progressive only at higher levels. The reason given was that indirect taxes are chiefly responsible for this occurrence. The Committee prepared a table showing taxes as a proportion of income for the year 1966-67 and, although the income levels are now largely outdated, I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard because I believe it shows how indirect taxes fall heaviest on lower income earners. </PARA>

<PARA>It can be seen from this table how the burden of indirect taxes falls three times harder on those on lower incomes. I am sure that an updating of the income levels to current levels would show similar percentages for indirect taxes, particularly taking into account the massive 72.6 per cent increase in revenue in this area over the last two years. One could go on referring to other studies , including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study on the impact of consumption taxes, which showed at page 18 that consumption taxes as a percentage of disposable income were regressive in nature. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the people on low incomes who are continually being asked by the Fraser Government to bear the greatest burdens. It was these people who fared worst in the Budget. They got the lowest percentage tax relief and they will also go to the end of the line for low-cost government housing. When deciding which items are to be subject to sales tax, the Government has thrown equity to the winds. The burden has again fallen on those with the weakest voice in the community. The Government's philosophical ideals were quickly abandoned when its powerful friends in the news media campaigned against sales tax on printed material earlier this year.

<PARA>This amendment to the Bill is necessary as a result of motion picture films becoming taxable. Item 107 in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act which exempts motion picture films is to be omitted and will be inserted in the same form as item 6 in the Third Schedule. Goods covered by the Third Schedule are to be taxable at 7.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Item 107A, First Schedule, provides exemption for certain goods for use for business or industrial purposes in the production of motion picture films. It is to remain in the First Schedule but paragraph 1 (c) of that item refers to apparatus and materials for use in developing, editing or otherwise processing goods to which sub-item (2) of item 107 applies. With the omission of item 107 from the First Schedule the reference in paragraph 1 (c) of item 107A to item 107 (2) is of no effect. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that the exemption provided in paragraph 1 (c) of item 107A operates as intended, it is necessary to alter the reference in that item to refer to sub -item (2) of item 6 in the Third Schedule.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment is of a purely technical nature and as such the Opposition does not oppose it although in listening to the speech of the Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Hodgman) it was hard to discern precisely what it is about. The package of sales tax Bills that we have dealt with and and the sales tax amendment that we are dealing with now indicate in the general sense the Government's increasing reliance on the use of sales taxes as and indirect taxes as a way of raising revenue. We have seen in this Budget that the Government is to raise approximately $1,500m extra in revenue from indirect taxes. We have seen the burden of taxation in this country moved from those people who can afford it to those who cannot afford it. Indirect taxes affect everybody equally. They affect people on high salaries at the same rate as they affect people on low salaries, people who have no income and pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Banks (Mr Mountford) said earlier, the present Government's increases in sales taxes and indirect taxes will cost a family of four in Australia approximately $7 a week extra to live. That to my mind represents a very unfair shift of the burden of taxation in this country. In fact in this Budget we have seen a quite significant increase in other forms of tax for ordinary income earners. Pay-as-you-earn taxes as a proportion of total tax collections have increased from 43.5 per cent in 1981-82 to 45.4 per cent in 1981-82. In the same period we have seen company taxes decline from 14.2 per cent of total tax collections to 11.9 per cent. When we couple that increase in net PAYE taxation with the sales taxes and indirect taxes that have been levied by this Government it is quite plain that the Government is embarking on a deliberate approach of making low income earners and ordinary wage earners pay the cost of its economic program. We have seen the Government put forward the somewhat phoney Bicentennial Road Development Program and a levy on petrol to ensure that that Program will be paid for. Once again, that will flow through to the cost of goods and services for ordinary Australians. That is the sort of revenue that should be raised by methods other than a tax on petrol. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Labor Government when it was in office reduced the reliance on indirect taxation the coalition presently in office has reversed that trend and, in line with the stated preferences of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), has moved towards a heavier burden of indirect taxes, due mainly to the rapid growth of taxes such as the oil levy, which I have just mentioned, and sales taxes. The Government has attacked even such areas as sport. It is interesting to note that the Government's increase of 2 1/2 percentage points in the sales tax on sporting goods, from 15 per cent to 17 1/2 per cent, will provide it with a revenue in the next financial year of approximately $90m. Of course, one has to contrast that with the $3.7m that the Government provides to assist sporting bodies. On the one hand the Government takes $90m away from people through the sales tax on sporting goods and on the other hand it gives a paltry $3.7m in grants to sporting organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also seen in the perversion of the taxation system under this Government a terrible crime perpetrated on pensioners. The Government seems to have missed the fact that many pensioners are still paying mortgages. While one can applaud the Government's proposal to provide some relief to people who are paying off their homes by giving a tax rebate, one can only look in dismay at the fact that the rebate does not apply to pensioners or other people on low incomes who do not pay tax because unfortunately they do not earn a taxable income. I think when these things are taken into account the moving of the tax system to rely on these broad-based consumer-oriented taxes rather than on taxes on dividends and on high salaries is to be deplored. I feel that the Government should look again at this method of raising revenue. I think it should look again at the proposals in this Budget which ensure that those people who are on low incomes or very moderate incomes are penalised once again. The Budget's tax cuts and other tax measures are great for those people who have money. For those who do not have much money they are dismal. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals with regard to sales taxes and other such indirect taxes that we have been discussing today in this Parliament place more and more pressure on low income families in Australia who are going to the wall every day. To raise $ 1,500m through the type of tax proposed in this Budget is appalling in my view. Something should be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I never cease to be amazed at the double talk that one hears in this Budget debate from one Opposition speaker after another. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) seeks to convince the Australian people that he and the Australian Labor Party alone have the economic recipe that will solve all our economic problems, reduce inflation, restore profits, create jobs, inspire confidence and get our economy back on the right road. But how could one forget Labor's disastrous economic management when it was in government? In 1972, when the Labor Party was elected to office, the inflation rate was 4.5 per cent. Three years later it had risen to 17 per cent. The unemployment level in this country was 2.6 per cent when it was elected and three years later it had nearly doubled.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Memories are not as short as that. Seven years will not separate the Australian Labor Party from the memories of the Australian people. When the Labor Party took office the Budget deficit rose from 0.4 per cent to 4.9 per cent of the gross domestic product. In three short years the whole nation was plunged into an economic crisis of unprecedented proportions. In three years we endured three Treasurers who lurched from one desperate policy to another, from printing money to Khemlani loans. The present Leader of the Opposition presented to this Parliament an irresponsible Budget which led to a Budget deficit representing 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product. The present Budget has a deficit of only one per cent of the GDP-one of the lowest deficits in the western world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party in government succeeded in plunging this country into an economic crisis. The Australian Labor Party in government presided over the worst years of industrial disputation on record. In 1974 we witnessed 6.3 million days lost and $128m lost in wages. The Australian Labor Party in government succeeded in destroying our reputation as an overseas trading partner and a nation that could be relied upon for safe and stable investment. The Australian Labor Party in government embarked upon an irresponsible spending spree which resulted in a huge Budget deficit year after year, inflation and rising unemployment. Yet the Australian Labor Party today seeks to convince this Parliament and, indeed, the electorate that it has the economic remedies, the answers to the current international economic problems and the internal economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> I contend that the Labor Party neither has the answers to solve the current economic problems nor the capacity or the will to do so. Nothing demonstrated this more to this House and to this nation than the Leader of the Opposition's speech in this debate and the so-called agreement between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions on prices and incomes. There is no agreement with the individual trade unions over which the ACTU has no real control. What does it mean however? It means that a Labor Government would support full wage indexation and higher welfare spending in the hope that the unions will agree to wage moderation. It means that hundreds of thousands of people who are now employed could well lose their jobs if full indexation is restored. It means also increased government spending, higher deficits, increased inflation and worsening economic circumstances in one of the worst international recessions this century. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no easy answers or easy options available to any government in Australia. There are no easy options available to the Australian people. The sooner the Opposition and the trade union movement recognise the hard truth the better the long term prospects for all Australians. Although in 1981-82 our real growth was 3 per cent-indeed it has been one-and-a-half times the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries since 1978 and we had one of the highest increases in private capital investment for 30 years- the truth of the matter is that our economy is now in recession. Our difficulties need to be viewed against the background of the worst world recession since the 1930s, a fall or stagnation in six of the major world economies in the March quarter-nobody can deny that as much as honourable members on the other side of the House might weep-the worst slump in world trade for over two decades, huge unemployed populations in the industrialised nations, a severe slump in the world steel industry, serious problems amongst many major overseas banking corporations--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear that honourable members opposite cannot take the truth. There are serious problems amongst many major overseas banking corporations. There is a slump in world commodity prices and high interest rates in most overseas countries. On the domestic front our problems will be exacerbated by one of the worst droughts in eastern Australia this century, severe balance of trade problems and high interest rates. These problems are the most serious in some of the rural industries which are essential to the economy and to foreign exchange earnings. I represent one of the worst drought affected regions in Australia. On behalf of my constituents I welcome the initiatives taken by the Commonwealth Government to alleviate some of the burdens that the farmers, graziers and rural communities are carrying at the present time. The subsidy on interest rates above 12 per cent and the 50 per cent subsidy on fodder and cartage will give the farmers some heart and hope. If an effort had not been made by the Commonwealth Government to encourage the feeding of breeding stock I have no doubt that there would have been enormous stock losses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are difficulties ahead. There is no way in the current world economic recession that any government can protect every person, every employer and every industry from the full effects of the recession. However, a government can do its best to lessen the impact of that recession. I believe that this Budget and the recently announced drought relief measures go a long way toward helping to lessen the impact and to stimulate economic activity to the maximum extent possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall Budget strategy will provide assistance to those in need, incentive for investment, growth in the construction industry and job opportunities. All forms of Commonwealth welfare allowances have been increased. The average family with two dependent children and a home mortgage will be better off by $17 a week . Incentives to investment will be given by tax rebates on housing interest payments; substantial outlays to industry, including taxation incentives and depreciation allowances costing $700m; rebates on the first $1,000 of company dividends; increased retention allowances for small businesses; and tax incentives for employees to buy shares in the companies for which they work. Assistance to rural industry will be increased by over 40 per cent to more than $300m. There will be growth in the construction industry, and this will certainly be assisted by the home ownership and housing incentive policies already announced. There will also be increased funding of welfare housing, increased funding of aged and handicapped persons' accommodation, substantial increases of 26 per cent in funds for major Commonwealth public works programs, and increased assistance to the States for public works. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program will add an estimated $2,500m to present road funds over the next six years. The Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program will transform Australia's road network. It is the most significant roads program ever initiated in Australia. I hope the Opposition supports it to the hilt. It will benefit all Australians and will be particularly welcomed by decentralised and tourist industries, city businesses, transport operators, private motorists and indeed the primary and rural sector. The estimated $2.5 billion will substantially boost the level of Commonwealth financial assistance previously allocated to the States and the Northern Territory for roads. Expenditure this financial year is expected to be $150m. The total road funding by the Commonwealth in 1982-83 under the Bicentennial Road Development Program and the current ongoing program to the States and the Northern Territory will amount to $914m. This is an increase of 33 per cent, or $229m, when compared with the $685m allocated last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983-84 when the ABRD program is fully underway Commonwealth expenditure for both road programs will be an estimated $1,208m, an increase of $523m, or 76 per cent, over 1981-82. Under the ABRD program the States and the Northern Territory will be required at least to maintain their own expenditure on roads in real terms. This is to ensure that the program funds are fully devoted to additional efforts on our roads. The major objectives of the program are to bring the national highway system to acceptable standards by 1988 so that it provides for the safe, reliable and efficient carriage of traffic between Australia's main centres; to accelerate the construction of current developmental road projects, including roads of national tourist importance; to assist the development of major urban and rural arterial roads and, when desired by the States, to provide assistance for approved urban public transport projects; and to enable local government authorities to upgrade their local road systems by 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Motorists will be able to drive between all mainland State and Territory capital cities on completely sealed and virtually flood-free surfaces by the bicentennial year. Large parts of our heavily trafficked roads will be provided with divided carriageways and by-passes of major towns. Substantial lengths of existing two-lane sealed roads will be reconstructed and widened, including narrow or flood-prone bridges. About 60 per cent of the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program funds will be allocated to the States and to the Northern Territory and their local government authorities for rural and urban arterial roads and local roads. There will, of course, be significant benefits to all road users: Savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time will be realised. Delays due to flooding which have been so common in North Queensland along the Bruce Highway and dust hazards which have been so notable on the Landsborough Highway in Queensland will be reduced. Most importantly, road safety will be enhanced. Probably one of the most important features of the program is that it will create job opportunities throughout Australia, particularly in the regional areas. It is anticipated that the program will directly create more than 8,000 new jobs in the road construction industry. All in all we expect that a total of at least some 20,000 jobs in direct and indirect employment will be created. A large proportion of these jobs, as I said earlier, will be in regional areas where jobs are so badly needed at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to ensure that the taxpayers get full value for the charges they are being asked to pay to finance this program. The revenues from this year's one cent per litre increase in the price of petrol and two cents per litre increase thereinafter will be earmarked and paid into a trust fund for expenditure on this program until 31 December 1988. The funds will not be spent for any other purpose. They will not be syphoned off into other expenditure areas. Apart from a substantial increase in capital funding for roads, the transport and construction portfolio expenditure provides for a substantial increase in capital works generally. All told, some $2,000m will be outlayed during 1982-83. That is an increase of 18.4 per cent, or $307.4m, when compared with 1981-82. There will be a 26 per cent increase in capital works this financial year. This expenditure of $368.4m will provide a significant boost to the construction industry. Almost all projects will be carried out under contract. About 50 per cent of the design work is done by private consultants at present. The construction and associated service industries will therefore share substantially in the increased activity. Repairs and maintenance of civil and defence facilities will increase by 14 per cent to $172 million, and the projects of course will become part of the national asset. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the recent decision to revitalise the Australian shipping industry on a commercial basis, several other initiatives are under way to enhance the capacity of the surface transport area to service efficiently the transport needs of Australians. In this session of Parliament I will be introducing legislation to improve the efficiency of the Australian National Railways Commission. That legislation will enable the Australian National Railways to adopt a more commercial approach, subject to any specific ministerial direction in respect of Public Service obligations. A deficit of $71.5m has been provided for this year but the aim is to achieve financial break-even by 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government, in association with the States, provides support for the Australian Railways Research and Development Organisation. As I said earlier, the Budget provides for significant development of the Australian transport system which, together with the increased capital works expenditure, will provide a significant boost to employment, particularly in the construction industry. I am determined to obtain maximum value from the substantial outlays that have been made by the Government in this area. Australia's prosperity is vitally linked to our trading performance, which in turn depends on an efficient transport system and capital investment. During the coming year the Australian Railways Research and Development Organisation will be holding a series of workshops and a seminar on rail policy issues, seeking to reach agreement between the States to reduce railways deficits. Also, in association with the States and the Northern Territory, a joint working party has been established under the auspices of the Australian Transport Advisory Council to examine the development of an Australian transport strategy which recognises the respective roles of all three tiers of government. This examination was proposed by the Transport Industries Advisory Council. It will not be an introspective in-house examination. Anybody who has a particular view about our transport system-I mean users and operators alike-will have an opportunity to put that view forward. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget will give the economy the degree of help that is required at present. It will provide job opportunities particularly in the construction area . The Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program will undoubtedly not only provide job opportunities but also will ultimately lay the foundations for a really first class national road network. I can see why the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) is smiling. He has a lot to smile about because he loves driving on good roads. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Beneath the tinsel and show of this year's Budget lies an admission of this Government's bankruptcy. The Treasurer (Mr Howard), in his speech, admitted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . It is difficult to envisage any real growth in domestic non-farm product in 1982-83 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Farm production will decline; in 1982-83 business fixed investment could well decline; real private dwelling investment is still forecast to decline faster in 1982-83 than it did in the previous year; there is unlikely to be any real growth in employment in 1982-83. So with the labour force continuing to grow unemployment therefore seems likely to increase; and the outlook for the balance of payments will reflect the developing outlook both at home and overseas. In other words, our position will be gloomy. Not since the Menzies Government in 1961 has the Australian economy failed to grow for a whole year. Not within parliamentary memory has a government forecast no growth. This is a statement of political bankruptcy and the Government must take much of the blame for this state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget has been called a family Budget. Certainly concessions have been made to the family by means of increased family allowances and income tax relief . However, when one takes a close look at the Budget it becomes apparent that the Treasurer has taken more by means of sales tax, Customs and excise levies, bank duties, et cetera than he has afforded in income tax relief and sundry handouts. This Budget is cosmetic. </PARA>
<PARA> Income tax is, of course, the key revenue component in the Budget. This year some $18,973m will be levied from wage and salary earners. That is 45.4 per cent of the estimated Budget receipts. Another $4,373m will come from the self- employed thus providing a further 10 per cent of estimated receipts. The Government's income tax package is a mixed bag. The Government is to be commended on the steps it has taken-limited, awkward and hesitant though they may be-in tackling the problem of tax avoidance. This move is long overdue. The Government has consistently refused to use its legislative powers to tackle tax avoiders. Treasurer Howard was briefed in 1978 about bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. However it took him two and a half years to introduce the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act. I fear that this Government will not achieve even the modest target it has set itself in this regard, given the fierce opposition from within the Liberal Party's own ranks especially from my State of Western Australia. In any case, how can the Government know how much the Australian Taxation Office will be able to claw back when the Treasurer will not state how far back he will go to collect the money? This is a question which the community should be asking. After all, the money that the community will gain from tax avoiders is money lost to Liberal Party coffers. The Government has to temper its community responsibilities because of its party liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this month people in Kalgoorlie were graced by a visit from Mr W. W. Mitchell, member of the Liberal Party State Council and chief paid adviser to successive Western Australian Liberal governments. Mr Mitchell told us that the Treasurer's moves against tax evaders would do irreparable damage. Mr Mitchell stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is dominated by a philosophy of economic control and lacks the get-up-and-go spirit of the States which set goals to get things done and give people employment opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>No doubt Mr Mitchell was referring to the wealth of opportunity to be found in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth as well as the private tax avoidance industry. Mr Mitchell has since, of course, launched a $50,000 appeal to educate the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer as to the errors of their ways. I am sure that Senator Crichton-Browne, Syd Corser and Denis Horgan will be claiming their respective contributions as an educational tax deduction. The relief afforded in the Budget to low and average income earners by means of raising the tax free threshold and the top of the standard rate tax step, as well as reducing the standard rate of tax is to be welcomed. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I did think that my remarks were modest. It is unfortunate that the Government has not seen fit to provide any substantial relief for the far-flung residents of my electorate. Last year, for the first time in a decade, the zone allowance rebate was adjusted. Now a taxpayer who lives in Zone A will get a base amount of $216 plus 50 per cent of the dependant's rebate. A taxpayer who lives in Zone B will get a base allowance of $36 plus 20 per cent of the dependant's rebate. Last year a special category was created which allowed a $750 rebate plus a Zone A or Zone B dependant rebate , depending on locality, for any taxpayer who resides more than 250 kilometres from a population centre of 250,000 people or more. The creation of this special isolated zone was a step in the right direction, although it created severe anomalies in many places in my electorate. For example Leanora and Yalgoo are most unfortunate as they miss out by only a few kilometres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is unfortunate also that the Government again appears set on ignoring the needs of remote area residents for another decade. The current allowance is mere tokenism. At its existing level it cannot have any effect on decentralisation or provide any significant compensation for the disadvantage of living in remote areas. The Government must move now to increase tax allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the Government has gone for an increase in sales tax. In 1982-83 total sales tax payments are expected to amount to $3,629m compared with $2,854m last year and $2,102m the year before that. In two years the share of the Budget revenue derived from sales tax has risen from 6.5 per cent to 8.7 per cent. I am opposed to this trend. I have said in this House before and I repeat it again now that all sales taxes are iniquitous; sales tax is indiscriminate. Everyone has to pay sales tax regardless of his ability to pay. This form of taxation hits poor and country people more than anyone else. Sales tax particularly discriminates against country people as it is levied on a percentage of the price of goods that pass from the wholesaler to the retailer and there is a freight component as well as the unit cost. As a result of sales tax increases, residents throughout my electorate are footing more of the overall tax bill this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government appears to subscribe to President Reagan's dictum that graduated income tax was invented by Karl Marx. We certainly appear to be heading down the road to an American situation of far greater reliance on indirect taxation. This is a trend that I feel must be reversed. As a result of this year's Budget an extra $595m will be levied from consumers in increased sales taxes. Local government suffers as it is guaranteed only a percentage of income tax revenue. I believe that this Liberal Government is determined to undermine the limited financial independence afforded to this most important area by previous Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year in my speech on the Budget I warned that once an item appeared in the schedule and became taxable the amount of tax levied would start to speed up. We now find that items such as radios, televisions, stereos, cameras and jewellery will be levied at 32.5 per cent. Furniture, air conditioners, refrigerators and most electrical goods will be subject to a 17.5 per cent sales tax. Motor vehicles, spirits, soft drinks, toys and a whole host of other items will now be levied at 20 per cent. A number of items that were previously exempt will be subject to a 7.5 per cent duty. These include maps, hand tools, soft furnishings and servicing, repair and construction equipment. The tax on servicing, repairing and reconditioning equipment for motor vehicles, aeroplanes, ships and railway rolling stock will inevitably force up transport costs within my electorate and indeed throughout the whole nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Pet food is now subject to a 20 per cent duty. This must seriously affect the commercial exploitation of kangaroos. It is just another example of this Government's concern for country jobs. This issue was taken up by a Liberal Party member for Lower North in the Western Australian Upper House who was lamenting the Government's decision to tax the industry so savagely. </PARA>
<PARA> This year, as a result of the Budget, we find that a special surcharge on motor spirit and distillate is to be introduced. This must raise between $300m and $ 400m in a full year when the 2c a litre surcharge is reached. The only redeeming feature of the surcharge is that it will be set aside in a special trust account for road works. My electors will want to see some appreciable road works before they cop this. I have always held the opinion that sufficient funds are derived from existing crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas excise duties to cover an impressive road construction program. I note that this year the oil levy is up 3 .9 per cent and will bring $3,287m into Government coffers. I cannot support this double tax on the motorist just simply in the name of road works. A portion of the existing crude oil levy should be set aside for road works. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget envisages lifting the exemption from excise duty for off-road diesel fuel. This is designed to yield $176m in a full year. This new duty will adversely affect agriculture and the fishing and mining industries in my electorate. It must lead to higher transport and power charges. Bricks and road building materials will cost more, so will fuel for cranes, tractors, bulldozers , excavation equipment, on-site power generators, and other diesel-fired machinery. Once again, the country suffers more than the city. The Government is intent on gaining an extra $12.5m from increased air navigation charges. This will inevitably make it more expensive to travel within Western Australia and interstate. Air fares are already very high. It currently costs $90 to fly from Kalgoorlie to Perth. It costs $174.20 to fly from Port Hedland to Perth and $291 .50 from Kununurra to Perth. Since I got those figures a few days ago there has been a substantial increase in fares of the order of 7 per cent. The Government should be moving to check air fare price rises, not fuelling the fires. The very least it can do is to allow Trans Australia Airlines to compete on some of the lucrative interstate routes. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn my attention to some of the Budget outlays. Despite their much heralded announcement, many Budget allocations are paltry. Under Prime Minister Fraser unemployment is a growth industry. How does he treat the unemployed? Unemployment and sickness benefits for young people under 18 years of age will rise by only $4 a week from $36 to $40-the first increase since 1978-and by only $6.30 from $58.10 to $64.40 for people over 18 years of age. The Government will no doubt expect these beneficiaries to live gratefully on the smell of an oily rag for another four years. Once again, pensioners received a pittance, with a $ 3.10 a week increase for single pensioners and a $5.20 a week increase for couples. No attempt has been made to index pensions realistically. It is commendable that the limit on permissible pensioner earnings has been increased, albeit for the first time in 10 years. I just wonder how many pensioners will be able to earn the extra income, given the current state of the economy. The easing of the income test requirement for the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and Secondary Allowances Scheme is welcome. This will not, however, significantly ease the burden for parents in the north of Western Australia, where wages and costs tend to be high. I welcome the increase in funds for assistance programs for young unemployed. I regret that no significant plan for job expansion is contained in this Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> In the time I have left I wish to say a little about the Liberal Party philosophy which underlies this Budget. Insofar as any economic theory has controlled the Fraser Government's economic policy, it has been based on these nostrums: Firstly, inflation is caused by deficits; secondly, if deficits fall inflation falls; thirdly, higher economic growth and a rising inflation rate are mutually exclusive; fourthly, a rising inflation rate makes people save a greater proportion of their income and therefore suppresses aggregate demand and growth; and fifthly, interest rate increases are caused by public sector borrowing demand and interest rates will fall if public sector borrowing demand falls. The great bulk of Australian statistical evidence contradicts all these beliefs. This now is becoming generally known by a long suffering public.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was rudely interrupted by the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was saying that the last and most damaging piece of Fraser-Treasury dogma that prices and incomes policies never work cannot be contradicted in Australia because it has never been tested. It is, however, resoundingly refuted by overseas experience. An effective prices and incomes policy is the common denominator of success. All of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries with low unemployment and high growth-Austria, Japan, West Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway-have used such a policy, and it has worked. In nearly all of them inflation has been kept remarkably low.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The circle of failure is complete. The Fraser Government has failed relative to the governments of other countries and to the Government it replaced. The magnitude of that failure is starkly revealed in the following comparisons. As at December 1975, the annual change in the consumer price index was 14 per cent and falling. In fact in the last quarter it was 10.4 per cent. As at June 1982 inflation was 10.7 per cent and rising. The seasonally adjusted annual growth rate for the half year to December 1975 was 1.5 per cent. To June 1982 it was 0. 7 per cent. The non-farm seasonally adjusted annual growth rate for the half year to December 1975 was one per cent and to June 1982 was 0.2 per cent. Unemployment, seasonally adjusted, was 4.6 per cent in December 1975 and 6.7 per cent in June 1982, and is set to increase by 50 per cent this year. In December 1975 our balance on current accounts showed a deficit of $794m. This is a significant figure, especially when compared with the June 1982 figure of a deficit of $9,080m-a deficit on current account of $9 billion. Those figures speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet this most mendacious of men, the current Prime Minister, had the gall to talk about reprehensible circumstances in 1975. On that occasion he and his discredited junta set out to destroy the reputations of good men; yes, even to drive them to an early grave. They did not do this because they believed there were reprehensible circumstances; quite the contrary. This boondoggling bunch of self-seeking charlatans did it because they knew that under Bill Hayden's guidance the economy was coming under control. They knew that with Bill Hayden in the Treasury the Australian Labor Party would get it together and go on to win the next election in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> This scenario they could not stand. These people so blatant in lust for power were prepared to abort every vestige of common decency, every shred of Westminster tradition. They knew that with the jackals of the Murdoch Press they could fool the electorate, and they were prepared to polarise the nation. They were prepared to demonstrate to all the people that might is right and that the law of the jungle prevails. These rogues set the standard of behaviour for the people of Australia. It is the Frasers, the Nixons, the Sinclairs and the Barwicks of this world who institutionalised the U Jack system in our land. It is their example and the shonky judgments of their Chief Justice that set the scene for the great tax scandals that now wrack this nation and cost the people of Australia so dearly. </PARA>
<PARA> But where do we go from here? Before Costigan I was saying there would be no early election; the Budget was a fraud and was seen as such and the last desperate fling of a desperate despot had failed. Now, of course, with Costigan the Government cannot risk an election and it cannot live with its falsified Budget. It will resort to the printing press as it desperately clings to the power it loves. The Government is caught in a tide it cannot stem. It will change its leader, but the public will not be fooled again. Australia must work as a united nation. Australia can only do this with a government of national reconstruction. A Hayden Labor Government is the only way we can heal the divisions amongst our people. If this Prime Minister has any shame, if he has any care for the future of our land he will take the only honourable course. He will call an election so that he and his ilk can be swept from power and make way for a Hayden Labor Government. This is the only way that we can work towards national unity. This is the only way that he can expect or deserve any kindness in the valedictories that will one day be his. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the things that I learned very early in the piece on entering this House is that one really does need a sense of humour. After sitting through that particular diatribe I often wonder how people without a sense of humour can exist in this place. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) in his speech today showed his own sense of humour. Obviously nobody in his right mind could take terribly seriously some of the stuff he has said. I was not going to spend too much time commenting on some of the statements he made, but I think they certainly should be corrected because he has accused the Government of all sorts of things, including fraud in its Budget . He has given us his rundown of the financial situation in Australia. Maybe some of these things should be corrected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that he turn his mind to this morning's edition of the Australian Financial Review which does not have in this place a reputation as being terribly pro-government. On page 8 there is an article on how the cash flow crisis has floored developing countries. An analysis has been given, which is really very good, which gives the financial status of countries around the world . It is interesting that Australia does not appear in the list of countries that are having severe problems. In fact, of the 22 countries that are listed in this table, Australia certainly does not appear. I understand that we are much further down the list than that. If we try to line up our situation with those of the countries that are listed, we see that in actual fact our economy is in a fairly sound state. I was interested to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie about the tremendous advances that have been made in Sweden. I suggest that he take a very close analysis of, for example, the unemployment rates in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. At the moment Sweden is experiencing an unemployment rate-</PARA>

Nobody is denying that the situation in Australia is very tight indeed. However, in terms of that, the Budget that was delivered in this House by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has in fact been a very generous Budget. Many people would suggest that in some respects that Budget may, in fact, be too generous. But to say that it is a fraud and a sham certainly does not stand up to a close analysis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two salient points came through to me in this Budget. First there was a philosophical commitment to spread the tax burden; that we move towards a broad based tax, with the emphasis on going away from income tax, thereby, in the long term, benefiting all Australians. Secondly-the honourable member for Kalgoorlie did admit this, I acknowledge that-it is a family Budget. If honourable members do an analysis on the figures they will see that the Budget is in fact far from being a confidence trick. An average Australian who is earning $300 a week will be up to $17 a week better off than he was previously as a result of the Budget, even taking into account the higher sales tax and other charges that were introduced. In this Budget the total benefits available to an average family consisting of a sole breadwinner with a wife and two children paying off a $25, 000 mortgage on their home, amount to $19.84 a week. However, the indirect tax increases admittedly can raise this family's weekly expenditure by about $3 a week. The largest single component of the increase was $6.69 in reduced tax rates, while the home loan increase rebate accounts for $5.05. That is real relief for one section of our community that has certainly suffered most severely. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are serious about making an effort to support the family unit and the concept of the family unit in Australian society, certainly this Budget goes a long way towards doing just that. The other overall Budget expenditures are interesting too. Defence spending, for example, is up by 11.8 per cent; education expenditure is up by 13.5 per cent; health expenditure is up by 16 per cent and housing expenditure is up by 24 per cent. Of course, the social security and welfare bill this year is up by 15.4 per cent, with 28.2 per cent of the total outlays in this Budget being spent in the area of social security and welfare. I get rather tired of the accusations that are being made to the effect that the Government really has no job creation programs. An analysis of the Budget will show that in a very real way capital works programs this year are going to be very much to the fore and in themselves are going to have the capacity to be able to create a great number of meaningful jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) gave a run-down of the national roads program. I think that that program has been welcomed on both sides of the House for what it is going to provide for the people of Australia. That program alone is going to be a major job creation exercise. We have seen the commitment for the Burdekin Dam project. The honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) mentioned by way of interjection a few moments ago the amount of money that will be spent around Australia in the area of aviation. In recent years a number of people in Australia have realised that this is one area that needs very special attention. For example, in my own State of Queensland this year another $300m has been allocated to be spent over the next four years on upgrading a number of those airport projects. Naturally the new Brisbane International Airport will take about 50 per cent of that allocation. Within the new Brisbane Airport project itself another 4,000 jobs will be created. I think that is a very real example of how these capital works programs can help create employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Major works also are being undertaken at Cairns, Townsville, Coolangatta, Maroochydore, Bundaberg and, of course, the secondary airport for Brisbane at Archerfield. This pattern of expenditure is not confined only to Queensland. In fact, there are major projects right around Australia as Australia upgrades its facilities to take part in this tremendous boom in international tourism to Australia. I am sure that with the additional works being done at Adelaide Airport, with Perth Airport being upgraded and the upgrading of other secondary airports around Australia there is this realisation that the tourist industry has a great deal to offer. One should welcome those projects. Of course, these job creation programs are such that they will mean long-term and meaningful jobs . They will not be the short, hiccup-type of programs that have been advocated by members of the Opposition which really give no long-term job satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to see the pattern of employment that is developing in Australia. Once again I will cite the situation that exists in Queensland. With the latest statistics just released by the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs we can see exactly what is happening in Queensland. In fact, at the moment Queensland enjoys the lowest rate of unemployment in Australia and, indeed, the lowest rate of youth unemployment in Australia. I think we should always be careful to analyse just what is happening in this area. There is some reason for concern about what is happening in Queensland. There will be 25,000 young people going on to the job market in that State this year. These are people who come from the State of Queensland. In addition, it is now estimated that 9,000 school leavers from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and their families will be migrating to Queensland during the Christmas period and will be looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been a tremendous influx of New Zealanders into Queensland in recent times. The current rate of employment of New Zealand youngsters numbers 60 persons a week in Queensland, according to those figures. At the chance of upsetting our trans-Tasman friends I think this whole area of New Zealand migration needs some very close attention. I know that the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) has raised the subject with some concern. At the moment the plain fact is that we are getting a tremendous influx into Queensland of New Zealanders who are looking for work. That concentration is very much on the Gold Coast. If we look at the figures showing what has happened in recent years I suppose we can get an indication of just how serious the problem could become. In the last five years there has been a doubling of the number of New Zealanders coming to settle in Australia. The number of New Zealanders permanently living in Australia at the moment is in excess of 180,000. In the past we have always had something of a balance between the number of New Zealanders coming here, gaining employment and settling and the number of Australians going to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment there are around 55,000 Australians living on a permanent basis in New Zealand but the number of New Zealanders here, in excess of 180,000, gives some sort of indication of the imbalance. I wonder just how long that situation can go on. I will cite as an example a situation that has developed in my electorate. I think the two critical electorates in the Queensland situation are the electorates of McPherson and Bowman which lie respectively on the Gold Coast and on the shores of Moreton Bay. In the bayside suburb of Wynnum, where there is some light manufacturing industry, an example came to light in recent days. One of the major clothing manufacturing companies there, one that is doing very well and which has had a major expansion in recent years, has been employing extra staff. Forty jobs were going in recent weeks. Applications were called. Jobs were advertised. Commonwealth employment officers were notified. In actual fact the person who runs that factory employed 32 New Zealanders as part of that intake of 40 people. He tells me he did not particularly want to do that ; he wanted to provide jobs for Australians but the Australians did not apply. He said that from talking to the 32 people that he put on it would seem that usually New Zealanders tend to find jobs in Brisbane within three days or four days of their arrival. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders just what is wrong with the employment situation in that south-east corner of Queensland if we cannot get some of our unemployment figures down and some of those Australians who are looking for work into the work force. They are really quite remarkable figures. I believe that the whole area of New Zealand migration to Australia will have to be looked at very closely indeed. Of course, we realise that it is not only Queensland that is experiencing this tremdous influx of New Zealanders but other States of Australia too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe it is just that Queensland is a little better equipped to handle this influx than, for example, a State such as Tasmania, which the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) has just reminded me of. I will refer to another couple of points as they relate to Budget outlays. I mentioned the development work at Brisbane International Airport and the tremendous advances that could happen there. Within a matter of a forthnight Brisbane is to be the venue of the twelfth Commonwealth Games. I am sure that that event is going to be a great success. I was disturbed in recent days to see that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works had recommended that the extensions to the new Brisbane International Airport should not be completed until 1990. I congratulate the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) for overriding that decision and deciding to continue with the works so that the project will be completed late in 1986 or early 1987, virtually on schedule. There has been some tremendous development there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I took out some statistics on passenger arrivals and departures at Brisbane Airport during the last financial year. Last year 230,785 people arrived at the Brisbane Airport terminal. That was an increase of 17.25 per cent. Departures were up to 223,904 people, an increase of 20.39 per cent. Interest in Brisbane as an international destination is obvious. There were four new international carriers servicing that airport in the first six months of this year and another three carriers are giving indications that they will start services into Brisbane either later this year or early next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously this raises the question of what is happening in the aviation market. Admittedly Queensland is becoming one of the major tourist destinations of the South Pacific but one cannot help but be perturbed at the continuing battle raging between the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments as to the future of Sydney International Airport. One would think there would be some very great argument in saying to the New South Wales Government that if it is not interested in coming to some agreement on exactly what should happen at the Sydney Airport complex we should look at making Brisbane the No. 2 airport in Australia or indeed, if need be, even the No. 1 airport. With the completion of that particular project it will have a lot of facilities going for it that, frankly, are not available in Sydney. One can look at the potential of what can be derived from a curfew free airport, which the new airport will be. One can also look at the prospect of putting into operation feeder services out of the Brisbane area to other parts of Australia. Certainly there is a lot of merit in this for the international operators. They can see some very real savings in the use of the new Brisbane International Airport complex. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again I would like to extend my thanks, and indeed the thanks of the people of my electorate, for that decision to continue with work on the new Brisbane International Airport and to go ahead on schedule. There is no doubt that aircraft noise has been a tremendous problem in the bayside suburbs of Wynnum, Manly and Lota and the areas of Coorparoo and Camp Hill in my electorate . It is good to know that the Government has acknowledged some of these difficulties and is prepared to go ahead and provide that sort of relief to the people of my electorate by continuing to complete that airport project.</PARA>
<PARA> Another area of the Budget which has raised quite a deal of comment in Queensland is foreign aid. Unfortunately, some rather prominent groups and personalities in Queensland say that perhaps Australia is spending too much on aid and we should be looking after our own first rather than developing some of the international aid projects. Whilst not coming into that argument, I was particularly perturbed at outbursts in the Press in Brisbane about the $10m that is being promised to the people who have been suffering in the Lebanon as a result of the war that has been continuing there since the early 1970s. In fact, the $10m that has been allocated I believe is a generous donation which will be used for humanitarian purposes. One can only support the Government in giving that aid and urge the people of Australia to give as much as they possibly can to help relieve the suffering that is happening at the moment in the Lebanon. </PARA>
<PARA> One would hope that following the withdrawal of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the election of a new President, Mr Beshir Gemayel, who takes up his new position in the next few weeks, at last the people of that strife torn country will be able to receive some sort of peace. They have not been able to enjoy any sort of existence there for the last 12 years. It was a war in which the Lebanese themselves were not involved. It was a war which a number of Arab factions from that part of the world decided that they would fight on Lebanese territory. It was amazing to know that in fact the PLO seemed to be fighting a number of factions, the Iraquis and the Iranians were fighting their own particular war and the PLO and the Kuwaitis were having exchanges from time to time with the people of Beirut, especially West Beirut, being virtually caught in the cross-fire. Nobody is denying that the new President of the Lebanon, Beshir Gemayel, has a very hard task in trying to restore some semblance of order to that strife torn land. We can only wish him the best and hope that in some way there can be a sense of national reconciliation in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Lebanon is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. It is a country that has recognised human rights for hundreds of years. It is a country in which people of different religions and persuasions have managed to live side by side in peace and harmony for the last 400 years. It was sad to see the dominance of human rights being torn apart by a war that was not of the making of the Lebanese people. We can only shudder in horror at the thought that elements in the Australian society would deny any aid we can give to that strife torn country. One would hope that the appeals for genuine welfare aid that are undertaken by the Lebanese community itself and the Red Cross organisation will be well supported. Of course, the Government has already acknowledged that donations to those campaigns will be tax deductible. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, and in conclusion, let me say that I thought the most significant things in this Budget were the recognition of the very great difficulties facing the families of this nation, the recognition that tax relief was needed-tax relief was given-and the recognition that high interest rates were affecting many young families. Tax deductibility for interest on home loans over and above 10 per cent will provide very real relief for the people who need it most. There was also a recognition that very great consideration must be given to the aged and the underprivileged in our society, and that was given. To a great extent the Budget was a humane Budget. It is one that should be welcomed by all the Australian community. It showed real compassion, while in very hard circumstances it gave room for people to make their own way in Australia once again and for Australia to take advantage of the world situation once it comes out of the recession that is causing havoc world wide.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government and its Cabinet are undoubtedly the most incompetent, arrogant, divisive and hypocritical in Australia's history. The Government's incompetence is matched only by its hypocrisy and arrogance. It has introduced a no-hope Budget masquerading as a welfare Budget. But its welfare aspects are long overdue. In most cases the welfare elements are inadequate. They involve simply the indexation of benefits, pension thresholds and tax scales that should have been introduced long ago. The question is: When is a tax cut not a tax cut? The answer is, firstly, when it has elements of simple application of the consumer price index for 1981-82 to the existing tax scales and, secondly, when the total of increases in sales tax and excise duty more than equals the cut of 2c in the dollar in the basic tax scale. All that has happened is that the 10.4 per cent CPI rise for 1981-82 has been applied to the first two tax scales, which lifted the threshold of the first scale by $400 to $4,595 and that of the second scale by $1,606 to $19,500. So that is only a simple application of the 10.4 per cent consumer price index rise for 1981-82. The cut of 2c in the dollar in the basic tax rate is the only real tax cut in the Budget but that is more than offset by increases in sales tax and excise duty. The cut of 2c in the dollar on the lower tax scale means a loss to revenue of $706m this financial year and $1,066m in a full year. That is almost precisely equal to the increase in income resulting from increases in sales tax and excise duty, which amount to $786m in this financial year and over $1 billion in a full year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The increase of 50 per cent to the income test threshold for age pensions is welcome but it is long overdue, simply being a recognition that no adjustment, at all had taken place since 1972. There is still no real increase, apart from the CPI adjustment, to base pensions. The unemployment benefit for single people is still well below the poverty line. However, behind the belated concessions that I have mentioned, if one reads the fine print of the Budget one will find a picture of unmitigated gloom. For example, the Budget Papers say that we can expect no real growth in non-farm output for 1982-83. Unemployment over the last financial year had risen by 100,000 to 460,500 as at 30 June last. The consumer price index rose in the last four years from 8.2 per cent in 1978-79 to 10.4 per cent in 1981-82. So after four years of this Government's vicious throttling of the economy the only result has been that unemployment has risen by 100,000 and the consumer price index has risen by 2.2 per cent. What is more, the prediction is that in 1982-83 the CPI will go up to 10.8 per cent. One per cent of this increase will result from the Government's increases in sales tax and excise duty. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last two years interest rates have gone up 4 per cent to the point where the Commonwealth Savings Bank rate on home loans is now a record 13.5 per cent, the building societies' rate is 15 per cent plus and the two-year treasury bond rate is 17.25 per cent. The balance of payments position is a complete trauma and disaster; the current account is $9 billion in deficit; and private capital inflow, on which the Government relies to balance its balance of payments books, is at a record $10.2 billion. The Treasury sees no hope of improvement. So despite seven long years of vicious attack on the Australian economy, what have we to show? We have increasing inflation over the past four years, no growth, exploding unemployment, record interest rates and an ever-deteriorating balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all this no hope, doom and gloom, in the fine print of the Budget, the Government still hoped to sell it as pre-election Budget. It was going to make one last desperate gambler's throw for three more years in office before the voters woke up-woke up to the fact that Australia is in deep recession, on the brink of depression. Of course, all that has now been frustrated by the astounding disclosures and incredible exposures of incompetence, irresponsibility and economic and legal mismanagement that Mr Costigan exposed in his report. We now see the incompetence in the Treasury, the Taxation Office and the Attorney-General's Department and a complete inability to combat the tax cheats. They have been able to pursue small, individual pay-as-you-earn income earners to the point of dragging working class pay-as-you-earn individuals before the courts, but they have gone in lightly on the big company crooks and on their crooked mates in the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the result? The result has been a loss to revenue over the past few years of $7 billion to $10 billion. Had that money been collected, every pay -as-you-earn taxpayer in Australia could now receive a $1,000 rebate cash in hand, which would not be a bad boost to the economy. Had this Government and the Attorney-General's Department, as requested by the Taxation Office, prosecuted as recommended by Brinsden J. back in 1975, these schemes would have been arrested. There would have been no need to peddle sales tax increases as a means of indirectly combating tax avoidance. There would have been no need for the Government to renege on its promise to implement full tax indexation. There would have been no disproportionate rise in individual pay-as-you-earn tax receipts compared with non-pay-as-you-earn receipts and no decline in company tax as a percentage of total taxes. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) say that they are not responsible and the people of Australia are supposed to be satisfied with the prosecution of three minor officials in Perth. What about the Ministers who have let this enormous loss to the revenue take place, and what about the person who was the Crown Solicitor in those years and who is now head of the Attorney-General's Department? What is the Government going to do about it? It will take no action at all against those Ministers and bureaucrats who are responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the House to contrast this sick record of economic failure, ministerial irresponsibility and incompetence with Labor's plans and policies for when it reaches the government benches opposite. That will not be before very long, I assure the House, because we are willing to fight an election, if the Government is game, at any time it likes. Our plans and policies include a return to centralised wage indexation, which will not only control unnecessary wage increases to very high income earners but also give justice to the one and a half million people who have not received any wage increase due to the Government's destruction of wage indexation early last year. We will go for real income tax reform-not fairy floss income tax reform, and a real crackdown on the tax rorts-and a fair system of financing State and local government through revenue sharing, through a return to the system of block and tied grants to finance essential social services such as health services, through a new consultative approach to Loan Council borrowing programs with the States and through the guarantee of total funds to the States. We will introduce a new health insurance scheme under which people and families will be asked to pay only 0.75 per cent of their taxable income instead of up to $16 a week which they pay now and which many families cannot afford under this Government. There will be new housing policies in contrast to the hopeless record of this Government in that area. I believe housing, after unemployment, is probably our biggest social problem, and this Government must take full responsibility for record interest rates, record rents and the collapse of public housing construction in Australia. The dimensions of the problem are enormous. I know that over 100,000 people are on the waiting lists of the State housing commissions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Families, I stand corrected by the honourable member for Reid, our shadow Minister for housing. Three times that number are in very poor accommodation, and we need at least 45,000 more starts a year than we are getting at present under this Government. Eighty per cent of new home seekers in this country cannot even get near raising loans at the minimum interest rate of 13.5 per cent that is required by the Commonwealth Savings Bank at the moment. Interest rates, as I said before-one cannot say it often enough-have gone up 4 per cent in two years. That means that someone paying off a modest little loan on a modest little house in an outer suburb of one of our great urban centres is paying $90 a month more than was the case two years ago. If this Government proceeds, as I am sure it will, into a deregulated Campbell situation we can expect an incredible increase of a further 3 per cent in interest rates, which will mean that such people will be paying another $70 a month on top of the $90 extra a month they are paying already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government presides over a high interest rate regime. Its Budget scheme recognised that the March home loan amelioration scheme was not sufficient. It recognised that only 28 per cent of people in the housing loan market obtained relief. Now the Government has introduced a scheme of giving a rebate of 30c in the dollar on all interest paid over 10 per cent on loans up to $60,000. But there is no ceiling on the interest rate that is to be paid and no ceiling on the size of the actual loan. This can push people into fringe banking organisations and encourage them to take higher interest rate loans. Only 10 per cent of home owners or seekers now are involved in this sort of finance. This scheme will encourage more and more of them into it, while it will do nothing at all for those who cannot even get a loan in the first place or who may be renting accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The private sector in the housing area needs a number of policy applications, the first, of course, being to hold and then to reduce interest rates. But then it needs special measures to attract funds for housing finance, and certainly it needs an improvement to the existing deposit assistance scheme that this Government has implemented. In the public sector this is the greatest disgrace of all because, in 1982-83 prices, only $318m goes to the State housing commissions this year compared with, in 1982-83 prices, over $900m in the 1975- 76 financial year. A substantial increase is required in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some environmental issues. The Government has maintained its low priority for environmental matters. This Budget is a 'do the minimum possible' Budget to match the Government's 'leave it to the States' policy. The manufacture, use, transport and disposal of hazardous chemicals is a major problem, yet for the third year in a row the Department of Home Affairs and Environment used 60 per cent of its meagre $40,000 allocation for hazardous chemicals. This year a staff of four will have to run a voluntary interim notification scheme for new chemicals-that is, less than one-third the number deemed necessary by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. I see that time is beating me, but as I wish to make some comments about the disastrous state of the steel industry I will have to cut short my remarks on environmental issues and return to them at a later date. However, I make the point that, despite this Government's alleged concern for the environment, only $19m, representing an increase of just 3 per cent, is to be spent on environmental matters this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that housing and unemployment were the great social problems of our times and that unemployment is a particular blight, especially for young people. It is stated in the Budget that the level of unemployment is now about 7 per cent and is expected to rise to 8 per cent in this financial year. That figure is definitely understated. I point out to the House that many great regional areas in Australia, particularly in the secondary industry and manufacturing areas, are currently experiencing unemployment rates not of 7 per cent or 8 per cent but of 12 per cent and 13 per cent. That is the case in the electorates of Macarthur, Hughes and Cunningham, in the great industrial area around Port Kembla. There is a crisis in the steel industry, a crisis caused by domestic recession, by import penetration, and by backward technology in the steel industry, which is a result of the steel division of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd in the boom years of the 1960s and early 1970s taking the money and running instead of reinvesting. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a falling consumption pattern. Imports have doubled in the last two years to one million tonnes of raw steel equivalent. In Port Kembla alone 2,000 jobs are already lost. This afternoon I spoke to the BHP steel division in Port Kembla. In the last year 2,000 jobs were lost, 1,425 jobs since June, and the loss of a further 2,000 jobs is expected in the next six or eight months in the steel mills and the ancillary rolling mills and metal shops. That adds up to a direct loss of 4,000 jobs. If we apply a conservative multiplier effect we are looking at another 4,000 jobs. That means that that area alone would lose 8,000 jobs in a little over 18 months to two years, on top of an existing unemployment rate of 12 per cent. When the Government knocked back the industry application to the Temporary Assistance Authority to restrict imports from such countries as Korea to 10 per cent or 15 per cent the responsible Minister said: 'We are looking after these 8,000 people who will lose their jobs through existing manpower programs run by the Commonwealth Employment Service in Wollongong'. He must be joking! I am no simple arch-protectionist, but I understand that in a time of recession and depression we must look after our own and what we have and then try to restructure over the long term. We should not say: 'We have a contracting market in steel and we are going to peg imports at 1981-82 levels, which are historically record levels'. How ridiculous that is. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a new approach to the industry and a new approach to steel. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) has not been game to speak out during this debate on steel. He has the hide to go back to the Illawarra region and say : 'Do not worry about it; I will ask the Government for more money for roads'. What we need is Government intervention in the industry. We need a role for the unions, government and steel management together, through a steel industry council. We need an inquiry into steel, a task force inquiry set up on a tripartite level-Government, union and company-to come forward with some long term industry planning policies. Industry assistance will be given in the short term by a Labor government while we restructure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is self-evident that Australia's long term prosperity as a trading nation depends greatly on the size and profitability of our export industries. These industries can be damaged by factors beyond our control, factors such as the present drought and depressed international trading conditions. They can also be damaged by factors which are very much within our control. Of these, the two which are crucial to the prosperity and long term development of our export industries are the effect of industrial action on our capacity to deliver to importers on time and the cost competitiveness of those industries. It is beyond doubt that our world-wide reputation for industrial disruption, especially in the ports and in the major natural resources projects, and the industrial facts of life which have earned us this reputation, have greatly damaged our export industries and have caused our major trading partner, Japan, which accounts for around 27 per cent of our exports, to look elsewhere.

The extent of our dependence on Australia's natural wealth is demonstrated by the fact that around 70 per cent of our export earnings come from agriculture and mining. It is notorious that over the last two decades the major source of growth of exports has been mining. Has that growth come too easily?</PARA>
<PARA> With the vast increase in mining developments over the last 20 years, the great interest that overseas investors have shown in those developments, and the high profits made by some in the good years, a kind of cargo-cult mentality has grown up in Australia. A good part of the community seems to hold the view that resource developments are a twentieth century money tree and that all one has to do to get money is shake the tree. Inherent in this mentality is the dangerously erroneous belief, to quote Mr Les Millen of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, that 'resource developments are so profitable that no demand, however extraordinary, need remain unsatisfied if only sufficient industrial muscle were applied'. It is almost an article of faith among many that Australia is so uniquely endowed with natural resources that foreigners, and especially the resource-poor Japanese, will continue to come to us no matter the cost, the inconvenience or the levels of industrial disruption they are forced to endure. Those who believe that resource developments are an endless source of money need look only at the recent catastrophic results of major Australia mining companies . </PARA>
<PARA> Those who believe that we are so uniquely wealthy that foreigners will continue to beat a track to our sometimes closed door should look hard at a few facts of our recent industrial history. Firstly, figures produced by the Japanese finance ministry's customs section show that in the six months to the end of June 1982 Australia's share of Japan's coke and coal imports fell to 35.5 per cent compared to 47.7 per cent for the corresponding half year in 1981. In steaming coal, our share of Japan's imports fell from 52.5 per cent for the first half of the calendar year of 1981 to 43.4 per cent for the first half of 1982. In sum, in the first half of 1982 compared to the first half of 1981 we lost 12.2 per cent of Japan's total import market for coal and coke and 9.1 per cent of Japan' s steaming coal market. Those losses were made good by our competitors, who will be determined to retain their increased share in this huge and lucrative market. In iron ore, as reported in the Australian Financial Review on 6 September, the story is the same. Our total share of the Japanese market has declined from a peak of 48.1 per cent in 1976 to 45.2 per cent last year, while our major competitor, Brazil, has increased its share of Japan's market to 23.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The last annual report of the ship owners Mutual Strike Insurance Association shows that insurance claims by ship owners for losses caused by industrial disputes in Australian waters exceeded the combined claims for the rest of the world. The figures for the 12 months to 31 January 1982 show that Australia accounted for an astonishing 51 per cent of all claims. Apart from Canada and the United Kingdom no other country accounted for more than 3 per cent. This was the fourth year in which claims for losses in Australian waters exceeded the combined claims for the rest of the world-testimony of some kind to the national urge to break records. If we keep breaking records in this area we may break the country as well. The direct costs to the Australian economy of this gold medal effort in industrial disruption were estimated by the Association to exceed $ 150m and the indirect costs could exceed $300m. The hidden costs are incalculable. </PARA>
<PARA> The gravity of the malaise affecting Australian ports was highlighted by the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) on 18 September 1981. In a statement made that day he pointed out that so far that year there had not been a single day in 1981 which had been completely free of strikes affecting at least some sector of shipping. but our international reputation for industrial instability is not based on port disputes alone. In the period 1975 to 1979, of the 15 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Australia rated fourth in the incidences of stoppages in all industries and services. The implications of these figures are clear. It is much easier to acquire an international reputation for industrial instability and unreliability in meeting contracts than it is to rid oneself of such a reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Contracts by Japanese companies to acquire what we mine involved the commitment of vast expenditures of money, often over long periods. Because Japan is virtually without any domestic reserves of raw material inputs which its industrial machine needs it is acutely conscious of its vulnerability to shipping delays caused by industrial unrest. There is no reason why the Japanese should have any special solicitude for our industria problems, nor why they should look at the delays that plague our export industries as being anything less than a mark of unreliability and irresponsibility. Given our recent track record it is only logical for Japan to move away from the very heavy reliance it has in the past placed on Australia as its primary source of raw materials for its industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who has visited Japan in the last 12 months and has talked to those involved in the import of those raw materials would have received, if he listened, a very clear message. With some incredulity that Australians could be so short-sighted, that we could wantonly inflict such damage upon ourselves, Japanese industry has made a conscious decision to reduce its dependence on Australia for its raw materials. If this trend persists-and there is no reason why other importers of our raw materials should judge us differently-it must bring several consequences. In the short term, it will bring losses in export earnings. These losses are already reflected in our balance of trade figures which, excluding invisibles, have moved from a surplus which we enjoyed through the 1970s to a deficit of around $3.4 billion in the 1981-82 financial year-a deficit which in turn contributed to a current account deficit of just over $9 billion or around 6 per cent of gross domestic product for that financial year. Of course, in the medium and longer term we face cancelled and deferred developments, a reduced export trade and diminished national prosperity. A drastic reduction in the effect of industrial strife on our export industries is not merely desirable but essential to our survival as a prosperous nation. We are all involved-employers, employees, the Government, the unions and the nation as a whole. We have a great deal to learn, a great distance to travel and little time. </PARA>
<PARA> The second of the factors that affect our export industry and one which we can control is cost competitiveness. It is directly and profoundly affected by the levels of wages and salaries. Wage restraint is central not only to our international competitiveness but also more generally to the prosperity and level of employment in our country now and in the future. By international standards and by any sensible reckoning we are living beyond our means. Recent wage settlements in the United States of America and West Germany demonstrate that employees in those countries are coming to realise the truth of the maxim: One man's wage rise is another man's job. In wage negotiations in West Germany this year unions agreed on pay increases which were less than the inflation rate . The same approach to wage increases has been shown by unions in the United States. The motor vehicle industry provides a striking example. Last April workers in the General Motors company voted to ratify a 2 1/2 year agreement under which the United Auto Workers Union agreed to forgo any pay increases during most of the life of the contract and to forgo progress towards a shorter working week. This followed a 'standstill' agreement with the Ford company and a 'give-back' agreement with the Chrysler company. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for restraint in wage demands and the acceptance in America of the necessity of increases less than the current rate of inflation were summed up by Mr Art Gundersheim, an official of the 400,000-strong American Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, as reported in the Bulletin of 20 April this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The worker ultimately feels the availability of a job is more important than his income level. It's a reasonable, rational trade off. In periods of great economic difficulty there have always been concessions. In Chicago in the 60s I can remember workers at one company voting for a 10 per cent wage reduction'. </PARA>
<PARA>By contrast to the common sense and restraint summed up by Mr Gundersheim we evince a lemming-like, national determination to use today's pay rises to destroy tomorrow's jobs and opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for the 1981-82 financial year show that average weekly earnings soared by 17.4 per cent-some 7 per cent above the rate of inflation and in real terms roughly 4 per cent above the increase in gross domestic product for that year. In the same period our rate of inflation was some 4 per cent above the average of our major OECD partners. This means that we are paying ourselves more than we can afford. Given the harsh economic conditions in which we live it is easy to find examples of where this kind of conduct leads. I will give two examples. First, the latest national accounts show that gross operating surpluses of trading enterprises fell by 4 per cent in the December quarter and by 14 per cent in the March quarter. Secondly, a short time ago, and within the space of three days, some 850 jobs were lost in New South Wales following three separate management decisions. The most significant of those decisions was that of Amco Wrangler Ltd to take some of its operations off-shore. This decision is but one example of an ominous trend. </PARA>
<PARA> In present economic circumstances no country can afford wage and salary increases that constantly exceed the rate of inflation. Any trading nation that adopts such a course can be perfectly sure of the medium and long term consequences. For Australia those consequences will be: Decreasing international competitiveness which will affect not only our export industries but also our whole manufacturing base as we become more vulnerable to foreign penetration of home markets; the shedding of labour by employers at an increasingly rapid rate; companies and jobs going off-shore, which means a permanent loss of jobs; and insolvencies and company collapses. What can we do? In the Budget the Government offers Australians a clear opportunity and a clear choice-an opportunity for wage and salary restraint in the interests of all, and a choice between community acceptance by Australians of restraint, or a re-run of Whitlam economics, which is what the Australian Labor Party proposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The sincerity of the Government is evidenced by its profound commitment to meet the needs of the average and middle wage earner, the family man and those in need. This commitment is demonstrated in this year's Budget by such unarguable benefits which are to become effective on 1 November as: The increase in the tax free zone to $4,595; the reduction in the standard rate of income tax from 32c to 30c in the dollar; the lifting of the threshold from $17,884 to $19,500 at which every extra taxable dollar attracts tax at the rate of 46c; the introduction of a 50 per cent increase in the family allowance for the first and second children; and the allowance of tax rebates at 30c in the dollar on interest payments over 10 per cent on housing loans up to $60,000. Other measures include: Assistance to pensioners and the handicapped; action already taken to counter tax avoidance and proposed action against tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> These are facts in place-commitments on the record. In return the Government asks, in the national interest, for wage and salary restraint and for no further reduction in hours of work. What is Labor's answer? Three days after the Budget was delivered the Leader of the Labor Party and the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions issued a joint statement. Stripped of its rhetoric the statement has two key elements. The first key element is the adoption, in a centralised system of wage indexation, of full cost of living adjustments, including maintenance in real terms of existing levels of over-award payments, together with a variety of other benefits. Such an approach ignores world economic conditions, ignores Australia's economic condition, ignores the cost to the economy and to Australia's future prosperity and ignores the plight of the many workers who will be thrown out of employment as a direct result of the adoption of this policy. The second key element is the adoption of statutory controls on prices and profits, thinly disguised as a pricing authority with legislative criteria to assess price proposals of corporations within its jurisdiction. Those corporations-the large ones will be the pace setters-will be reassured to know that under Labor they will be allowed to earn reasonable profits-meaning, no doubt, what a Labor government thinks they should get. They would be unwise to hope for generosity, sympathy or even a basic understanding of the economic and financial constraints under which they operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Of Labor's proposals it can only be said either that the Labor Party operates in a cocoon of economic ignorance and believes that God made special rules for the Australian economy or that deliberately, and with full knowledge of the economic damage inherent in its proposals, it is willing to put Australians out of work, to destroy future employment prospects and to erode the progress of any future economic recovery-all this in pursuit of putting together a program that it hopes to be electorally palatable. The danger of the mixture of full indexation and other benefits and statutory controls on prices and profits was clearly expressed by Monsieur Jacques Larosier, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, at a management symposium in Davos, Switzerland in March of this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is an urgent need for a more realistic alignment of wage demands with a prospective growth of real output and employment. The restoration of adequate profit margins-to provide the incentive and resources for growth-clearly requires that real wages be held below productivity gains for some time to come. A special problem arises in those countries where wage indexation schemes exist. Schemes of this sort are a many-headed evil. </PARA>
<PARA>It is precisely that evil that Labor proposes, and if Monsieur Larosier's criticisms had been specifically directed to Labor they could not have been more apt. The Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund realised the need for restraint. German and American unions accept that in present conditions- conditions not peculiar to Australia but prevalent throughout the world- restraint and acceptance of less than what is needed to keep up with inflation is necessary. Mr Wran, the Premier of New South Wales, to his credit a few weeks ago publicly acknowledged the need for restraint, but not the Federal Labor Party. Labor's answer to our economic problems, and specifically to our need to regain cost competitiveness, amounts to higher wages, increased government expenditure, government job creation-a policy which entirely overlooks the fact that jobs have to be paid for out of taxes or out of profits and that in the long run permanent jobs can be created only out of profits-and control of prices . Controls on prices are the last things we need. They are an active incentive not to invest, not to create jobs and to go off-shore. They stifle initiative, enterprise and profits, and without a profitable employer one cannot have a profitable employee. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU and the major unions have an historic opportunity to work with the Government and to achieve restraint in regard to salaries, wages and other benefits in the interests of all Australians. To refuse to do so is to consign an increasingly large number of the Australian work force to the bitterness and misery of unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anybody who takes the time and trouble to examine these statistics will see a clear picture of the Government's failure. The inflation rate in 1975 -76 was 13 per cent-these are the Parliamentary Library figures-and it is now around 11 per cent. There has been a slight reduction in inflation. The level of unemployment in 1975-76 was 275,900, and the latest figures show that it is over 470,000 and rising. The growth in the gross non-farm product area in the first three years of the Labor Government was 5.2 per cent, 4.2 per cent, one per cent and 2 per cent. Last year the figure was 2.3 per cent. We are told that there will be no growth at all this year. That is the result of the seven years of restraint and self-denial that has been asked of the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are facing an economic disaster. In this Budget the Prime Minister is saying this: 'We, the Liberal Party and the National Country Party, have failed miserably to fulfil any of our promises. Although we failed, it is not our fault ; the fault lies with the world recession'. State governments, trade unions, and even the weather are blamed for Prime Minister Fraser's mistakes. The one thing our beloved Prime Minister is totally consistent about is never accepting responsibility for anything bad that happens in this country. He is responsible only when something good happens. This Budget is an admission of total failure. Having admitted that the Government has failed and that he does not know what to do about the state of the economy, the Prime Minister, in a most incredibly cynical manner, offers a range of goodies to the voters to tempt them to trust him once again. Let me assure the Prime Minister that the old saying-I hate using cliches but one has to be used here-'You can fool some of the people some of the time but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time' was never more appropriate than at this moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian voter has a very high threshold of pain when it comes to Australian politicians, particularly conservative politicians, but that threshold was reached just a few months ago. At the last election enough Australian voters still believed that Malcolm Fraser had something up his sleeve besides his arm. They believed him when he said the resources boom which he, the Treasurer (Mr Howard), and the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) trumpeted from one end of the country to another was to eventuate. Enough people were still mesmerised by the pots of gold-the Australian El Dorado; the Liberal Utopia-to give him and his colleagues just one more chance. The Liberals well know that the result of the last election, their 23 seat majority, was very much closer if they look at it in terms of votes and not seats. Nearly all donkey votes in some extremely close results in a number of very marginal seats favoured the Government, but the Government knows as well as we do that a further uniform swing of a little over one per cent would have seen it in opposition. Since then the number of our seats has increased by one and the Government's majority has slipped even further. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact-I think more and more Government members are reaching this conclusion-is that time has run out. There is a point in the life of every government when the voter no longer believes in anything that it says. No government in Australian history has been given a fairer go than the Fraser Government. Three times the people of Australia have given it a mandate to deliver the promises that the Prime Minister made in 1975. For five years it has had massive majorities in both Houses. For the past two years it has had a comfortable majority in the House of Representatives, whilst in the Senate-I think I am right-only two Bills have been twice rejected. No one in his wildest flights of fantasy could claim that the rejection of either of these Bills has seriously affected the Government's economic policies. Therefore the Government cannot use the excuse that it has not had all the opportunities. It has had solid control of both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA> The point has now been reached when people's patience has simply run out. They now know that the Prime Minister has tried everything and blamed everyone but himself for failing to deliver the goods. Whenever the election is held, be it November this year or May or December next year, the people will deliver their verdict clearly and unequivocally. The only question now is the size of the Australian Labor Party's majority. It is well to keep reminding the Government and the people of Australia of the promises which were made by the Prime Minister in his 1975 policy speech. One would not think that it would be exciting to read that document but it is worth while doing so if only for its humour. I will quote some of the statements which were made in the superb document of 1975. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Let us all as Australians determine to restore prosperity, defeat inflation and provide jobs for all. The Liberal and National Country Parties have prepared a far-reaching programme to restore prosperity and to give effect to our philosophy of freedom, opportunity and concern for the individual. </PARA>
<PARA>The document further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> What can be done immediately, and must be done, is to establish-for the first time in three years-sound and honest management of Australia's affairs. </PARA>

I would really have some admiration for the Prime Minister if, just once, he would say: 'It is our fault; we take responsibility'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, an El Dorado. Now, as projects are being cancelled daily, the Prime Minister is strangely silent on these matters. If there is anyone in Australia who is responsible for workers demanding some share of the cake it must be the Prime Minister because he sold that boom to the people and they, not unnaturally, thought that if it is going to be so good they ought to get their share of it. So if there has been a demand for higher wages the problem can be sheeted right home to the people who sold that prosperity, that boom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, let me say that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and my colleagues have welcomed many of the new Budget measures which alleviate some suffering caused mainly by this Government's policies. Most Budgets contain some good things and this one is no exception. There are some things in it that I welcome. The increase in the family allowance is one. The single measure that I approve of most is the introduction for families on a low income, I think, of $ 184 a week, of a family income supplement of $10 a week for each dependent child . That is something that should have been introduced a long time ago by previous governments, both Labor and Liberal. I hope that my party, when we come to government soon, will expand upon that area because I think that that is the area of greatest need in Australia. Many other improvements have been made. The standard pension has been increased in line with the consumer price index. The amount pensioners can earn and the level of fringe benefits have been increased.</PARA>
<PARA> I have grave doubts about the benefits of a home loan interest rate rebate. Whilst people who are building or buying homes need some relief from the enormously high interests rates I fear that this rebate provides an opportunity for all sorts of people to rip the system off. That is a term I do not like but unfortunately that is what I fear will happen. As yet I see no reason why somebody who owns his own home cannot borrow $60,000 and use it to buy a boat or go on a holiday. This loophole must be closed up and there have to be much tighter controls so that the benefit goes to people who are most in need, who are genuine home owners and who are paying very large interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the cynical part of this Budget is that it benefits people who do not need assistance a great deal. No one is more abused about the salary he gets than a politician. I have had a look at this matter. I get a whole range of benefits such as the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance for my son, a family allowance for my first two children and the home loan rebate and the tax reduction. That is great but surely people who are on our level of income are not exactly in the needy bracket. We are reminded of that--</PARA>

This afternoon we heard one of the prize clowns of the Parliament, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). He has been here a very short time but he has become an expert on job creation schemes. Most of his time he spends berating the attempts of the Labor Government in 1972-75 to create jobs for the many fewer unemployed at that time. One of the tragedies of this Government is its refusal to acknowledge that job creation schemes can help. They can help; that is the point I stress. They are not and never have been a total panacea of the problems of unemployment. There are major problems such as a world recession which we are well aware of. The Australian Labor Party has never suggested that job creation schemes or schemes such as the Regional Employment Development Scheme are an answer to unemployment. They represent one of the weapons that a government can use.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a short term weapon which a government can use to alleviate problems particularly in areas which are badly hit. For the last two years we have had to listen to the unadulterated drivel in this place by the honourable member for O'Connor. Apparently he became involved in his area and discovered that people were ripping off the system. As he comes from Western Australia and he is a member of the Liberal Party, nothing surprises us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His simplistic Ayn Rand bulldust that he goes on with shows the complete lack of understanding of how the job creation scheme worked. These backwoodsmen come here with simple nostrums and shout and scream at everyone that the only answer to the problem is hard work and productivity. Let me just deal with that simplistic argument-that all one has to do is go out and work hard. I ask honourable members to look at the mining industry. One could work flat-tack at the moment mining everything and one would not sell an ounce of it. Nobody wants to buy at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at retailing. I happen to be in the retailing industry. I am one of the few people in this Parliament who are businessmen, who have business experience. How much harder do honourable members think one can work in the retailing sector and how much more money do honourable members think one can take if there is no demand and the consumers are not buying? One could stand on one's head and wave one's legs in the air; consumers are not going to buy anything. So do not tell me that that is a solution to the problem. The situation is the same in the agricultural sector. Most of the problem in agriculture is that when growers produce they overproduce and the price goes down. They lose money for that reason. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. Look at the manufacturing sector. If honourable members read the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday they would have seen an article by John O'Hara. The Minister of the future, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), has been writing some superb stuff showing that the future of Australia lies with our moving into the technological area and providing grants in the areas of manufacturing and technology so that we can take advantage of the inventiveness of Australia and keep new patents, new industries and new scientific and technological breakthroughs in Australia instead of their being sent to other parts of the world. The Interscan system is a particular example of our losing an Australian invention to overseas interests. It is just nonsense to say that the only answer is hard work and productivity. There is a whole range of answers. I find the attitude of these backwoodsmen like the honourable member for O'Connor who makes these sorts of nonsensical speeches in this place attacking job creation schemes quite sickening. No one in this House has had more experience with job creation schemes than I have had. In my electorate of Robertson I managed to get more job creation schemes into operation than in any other electorate in Australia. That is on the record. Back in 1974-75 I got $9m, which would be about $25m in today's prices. We had about 150 projects in that area. At one stage we reached a peak of 850 workers directly employed under the Regional Employment Development scheme. Over a period of 18 months 2,150 workers went through that scheme directly. All those people who were able to get a decent salary could spend some of that money, indirectly, that created hundreds more jobs. Left on the ground are the great benefits to the community. There were drainage and water schemes, sporting facilities, youth centres, tennis complexes, kerbing and guttering. What we did in that period was to advance the local government's programs in some areas by 20 years, according to the statements made by the local Wyong and Gosford shire councils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, mistakes were made. I took 12 months of my political life to analyse them. I produced a paper on and a reassessment of the RED scheme. Of course, mistakes were made. There would be no problem in eliminating 95 per cent of those mistakes from the experience that we had during the two years that the RED scheme operated. There were misconceptions in the minds of the public about how it operated. The media, of course, was quick, as it always is, to focus on one of the projects. On programs such as This Day Tonight or Nationwide it was said: 'Look, the whole scheme is rotten because here we have a case of it not working properly or efficiently'. Let me tell honourable members that in my area there were cases in which the local councils were embarrassed because the RED scheme workers were better than the council workers. We could not say that publicly at the time but they were doing the work faster and more efficiently than the council workers were. We found that they were doing it more efficiently than the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a Budget that the electors of Australia have been waiting for. It is a Budget for families. It leaves more money in the pockets of the taxpayers. For the first time it gives average Australians the incentive to invest in their own and their country's future. I am sure that a lot of people are saying 'It's about time too' on learning of the cuts in income tax. Tax cuts are what the Liberal Party stands for-letting people decide how their earnings should be spent rather than governments grabbing the money and doing it for them. Even critics of the Government have to admit that these cuts are substantial-an extra $7.65 a week for the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer on average earnings of $344 and the raising of the standard rate to $19,500 so that 75 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 30c in the dollar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is equally commendable that a special emphasis has been given to assisting those people who have come to feel that they are being left behind-the single income family with a mortgage. The higher spouse rebate, the increased family allowance payments and the extension of interest rate relief to all home buyers will together ease the burden of costs on these families. This does not mean that some of us on the Government back bench will not continue to advocate the splitting of sole breadwinners' incomes for tax assessment as the best long term means of securing tax justice for the single income family, but this Budget is a big step forward. </PARA>
<PARA> In the medium term, lower taxation and an increased family allowance give a real incentive for the wage earner and the trade unionist to reject higher wage demands. I appreciate very well that a family struggling with a mortgage and a high personal tax bite will not appreciate the finer points of the need for wage restraint. Now, however, the pressure should be reduced with a tax cut having the same effect as a wage rise. More and more electors are now realising that wages cannot keep rising so far in advance of productivity -least of all when growth is sluggish. High wage demands not only make our industry uncompetitive but also simply price labour out of the market. People become too expensive to employ. Despite the reception given by the Australian Council of Trade Union leadership, which seems more worried about the seizure of the initiative by the Liberal Government than concerned for the long term good of its members, I am hopeful that the rank and file unionists, the very blokes whom this Budget sets out to help, will take a different view. If with their co-operation the so- called trade-off works it will be a very strong blow against inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, more long term considerations that are equally important. Within the constraints of economic responsibility every Liberal-National Country Party Government has a duty to work towards the lowering of direct personal tax. We stand committed to maximising incentive and freedom of choice. Shifting some of the tax load to indirect taxation, as this Budget does, gives the taxpayer that extra discretion as to how his dollar will be spent. I have always been wary of sudden lurches into massive indirect taxation of the kind that could disadvantage the low income earner and hamper the small businessman with the weight of administrative bureaucracy. Hence, last year many electors of Forrest were concerned that the projected rise in sales tax was not matched by a reduction in direct taxation. This time, however, there is no denying that the modest rise in sales tax will be more than covered by the cut in income tax and the increases in social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not hurt to point out that Australia in the last available survey of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries ranked low in the scale of the proportion of gross domestic product consumed by indirect taxes-fifteenth on a list of 22, 8 per cent of GDP against a 10 per cent average . Direct taxation, however, accounted for 12 1/2 per cent of GDP. There is in my opinion some room for a gradual shift from direct to indirect taxation provided always that it will not increase the overall tax burden. At this juncture it is appropriate to stress an important advantage of indirect taxation-that it is harder to evade. So often we overlook the fact that the greatest revenue loss comes not through the notorious tax avoidance schemes; it comes through straight concealment of income in small amounts but on a massive scale-the underground economy. On one estimate, this was as much as 10 per cent of gross domestic product. If on both sides of the political divide we are genuinely concerned about tax evasion we cannot afford to condemn the idea of a gradual shift to more indirect taxation. It makes sense to me to curtail the underground economy in this way rather than to pursue thousands of tradesmen and contractors over concealed cash income. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a third main source of tax revenue, that is, tax on capital. This Budget is free of that blight, and the people I represent will say 'Amen' to that. As a Liberal I am totally opposed to any seizure by the state of the assets of a citizen and the crippling of his economic liberty that can only erode his freedom. It is one of the great differences that divide liberalism and socialism. I remind the House that it was this Government which in the last Parliament removed the cruellest of all taxes on capital-probate. The inspiration might have come from Queensland, but it was the Fraser Government that abolished it at the national level and thus thwarted the attempt of the Cain Government in Victoria to impose it on the people of Victoria. I will always be proud to have supported a government that has stood up for genuine principles on this matter. It will stand as a blot on the records of previous coalition governments that they tolerated the evil of death duties. People remember well the effect of probate on the farm and the small businessman, the intrusion of the tax gatherer at a time of private grief. </PARA>
<PARA> We should remember that when this House removed probate in 1978 the Australian Labor Party was not prepared to vote against such a popular move, yet Opposition speakers made it clear that they held strong commitment to both this and other forms of capital taxation. We heard then and we hear now complaints that Australia is one of the few Western nations without a significant tax on capital . Frankly, this is a fact that makes so many of us proud to be Australians. New Zealand is one of the few countries which are free of poisonous snakes. By the same logic, I suppose, there are people there bemoaning that fact and wanting to import a few. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make special mention of an important innovation contained in this Budget, that is, the rebate on the first $1,000 of dividend income, which is a saving to the investor of $300 in taxation. The anomaly of taxing company profits twice, first through company tax and then as income in the hands of the shareholder, has been highlighted in the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and in earlier inquiries. In terms of equity, such double taxation cannot be removed entirely as the practical effect of doing that would leave some fairly affluent people paying no tax at all. The Government, to its great credit, has recognised that the small investor is getting no encouragement to put his savings into Australian enterprises as opposed to real estate. It has for a long time been of concern to me that the average wage earner has thought of the stock market only in terms of speculative capital gain and not as a means of steady income support. There is, of course, a place for some speculation in helping to finance the work of oil and mineral exploration, but for the health of our economy it is essential that more small investors should have a stake in major national enterprises and prosper with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Some would say that tax exemption for the first $1,000 of dividend income is not much, but this, nevertheless, ranks as a vital first step. For the first time the small investor has his foot in the door because a Liberal government is acting according to essential Liberal principles. Many of those who will benefit from the rebate are age pensioners. As a society, we must encourage people to provide for their own retirement if we want to avoid a massive burden on taxpayers in years to come. This reform is a part of such a process whereby many people with quite modest incomes might now begin to build up investment portfolios which, by the time of retirement, could return a worthwhile supplement to normal superannuation, thus reducing their need for direct income support through the age pension. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to the well publicised aspect of the Budget, that is, the assistance it gives to the elderly. Those of us who try to listen carefully to our electors have realised for some time that the concern of many retired people is not so much the level of the pension, now that the Fraser Government's policy of indexation has been operating for some time, but rather the amount of other income they could receive before losing fringe benefits or paying tax. The rise in the other income limit, the raising of the tax threshold, and the pensioner's tax rebate will all help to lessen these anxieties. Of particular concern have been the modest, fixed superannuation payments that could actually disadvantage some age pensioners. The effect of these reforms will be to allow pensioners a total income of some $7,000 before tax is payable, to which we can add a further $1,000 if such income is obtained from dividends. This will enable a pensioner couple to receive $90 per week in other income before losing fringe benefits. In brief, we can applaud the incentive given to elderly people to retain private income. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the many changes in the social security policy and payments I would like to single out the new proposal for a family income supplement for the low income family which does not receive social security assistance. I am convinced that such families very often live in rural electorates and that they have found themselves in increasing difficulty in recent years. When this scheme becomes operative next year that extra $10 per dependent child will certainly help these family budgets. Taking a longer view, I consider that we have to get to grips with a fairer division of welfare expenditure. Whilst I am glad that the major spending increases in the social security area are geared towards the family, I cannot rest entirely easily with the fact that the effective increase in total spending for the Department of Social Security has risen some 15.4 per cent to 28.2 per cent of total Budget outlays. On both sides of the House we need to look at ways whereby some proportion of family allowances is directed away from the more affluent to those in need. This is a lot harder than it sounds. For a major saving we would need to place the income test at average weekly earnings which would hardly be a popular measure. Nevertheless, it would seem that some kind of carefully graduated income test must one day be used if we want to assist the low income family without adding to the tax burden and wrecking the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I stand firmly behind the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in his contention that any attack on poverty must not be made in the universal manner of increasing benefits right across the board, which is the essence of slothful, bureaucratic socialism. In calling for selective welfare to tackle what is being perceived as a growing problem, I do not see why the advocates of such a solution need be confined to the non-Labor side of politics. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) just instanced that type of approach in his speech. Selective welfare should appeal to anyone looking for a fairer means to relieve poverty. In the last few years, reality has dawned on the Liberal Party at the grass roots level that universal welfare can result only in national bankruptcy. Such reality may not, as yet, have caught up with the ALP. Certainly the Family Income Supplement Scheme, whatever its teething problems may be, has the virtue of trying to reach a special area of need on a selective basis. </PARA>
<PARA> As the representative of a rural electorate I appreciate the feeling that there is no special good news for the farm sector in this Budget other than the wiping off of the beef producers' debt for the brucellosis eradication campaign. Nonetheless, farmers are also taxpayers, family people and investors and their position can hardly be viewed in isolation. Total Budget outlays in the agricultural sector of $310m show an increase of some 40 per cent on the last financial year. I am also very confident that should the drought worsen on a national basis, as it is in the process of doing, unfortunately, the Federal Government has demonstrated that it stands ready to respond. The response it has given is very humane and justified. Furthermore, the farm sector remains hopeful that the Government will resist added protection demands which weaken our competitive position on overseas markets. I have some reservations as to the operation of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme on the grounds that it may involve cumbersome paper work without any great saving to the taxpayer. I also note comments by the fishing industry that such large users of diesel fuel would be carrying a major additional cost while awaiting the rebate. If indeed the new scheme proves unsatisfactory I would hope that speedy alterations might be made.</PARA>
<PARA> The increase in the retention allowance for private companies from 70 per cent to 80 per cent is welcome news for the small business sector and continues the process begun by this Government three years ago when the allowance was raised from 50 per cent. I am hopeful that small business will benefit from increased consumer spending that will more than offset the rise in sales tax and excise. One group of small businessmen in my electorate of Forrest who perhaps have cause to be satisfied with this Budget are the wine growers who have avoided the introduction of a wine excise. I am delighted that the Fraser Government has again shown the foresight to avoid such an imposition on an industry that is largely still establishing itself-that is, within the electorate of Forrest. It has been demonstrated in the south west of Western Australia that we can grow wines equal to those produced in any part of Australia, indeed the world. But it is still a fledgling industry in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, both as the member for an electorate where tourism is a major industry and as Chairman of the Government Members' Committee on Tourism I welcome the continuing support for the tourist industry by this Government. Not only has a record $9.7m been allocated for overseas promotion by the Australian Tourist Commission but the industry incentive package of last month extended a depreciation allowance of 2 1/2 per cent to all buildings in the tourist industry. This continues the initial advance made three years ago when the allowance was granted for accommodation buildings. In the same package the Export Market Development Grants Scheme was amended to raise the maximum grant to tourist operators to $200,000, to waive the minimum spending requirements of $5,000 and to extend eligibility. The fact that tourism is no longer the poor relation of more favoured industries is a sign that in this field, as in many others, the Fraser Government is keeping well up front with reality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has set the scene. The Government continues to give this country sound, honest management. Basically the future is in our own hands. It it up to us, every member of society, as to how much he or she is prepared to contribute as against how much he or she wishes to take out. I believe it would require very little effort on everyone's behalf to turn our economy into a vibrant, healthy, fully employed economy with a secure future for all of us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) which forms the major thrust of the Government's Budget presented to the Parliament three weeks ago. The 1982 Budget is a reversal of recent previous Budgets in that it proposes to loosen the tight monetary rein for politically expedient reasons in an attempt to give the Government the advantage in the forthcoming election. But the Australian people have been down this road before. They have experienced similar deceptions in the 1977 Budget which was brought down only months before an election was called. The Government offered tax cuts, it maintained tax indexation and offered a range of goodies. These supposedly responsible economic managers estimated that the cost of all those Budget measures would lead to a Budget deficit of only $1.4 billion. Three months later the Government went to the polls and won. Almost immediately after it became apparent that the Budget had blown out. The deficit was heading towards $2.5 billion. The Government had given the electorate the goods before the election but had wrongly calculated the costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the 1978 Budget the Government took back its tax concessions, it backed down on its promised full tax indexation and it introduced the oil levy so that in one year the Government's revenue from oil and liquefied petroleum gas jumped from $800m to $1.3 billion. Medibank was dismantled and health insurance became more expensive, excise taxes were increased and there were further increases in sales tax and other indirect taxes. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) estimated that these measures put an extra 2 per cent on our inflation figure each year. People were told to tighten their belts, that life was not going to be easy. They experienced further deception in 1980 when the Government fabricated the resources boom. Suddenly they were told that Australia was once again the lucky country and that all Australians could expect to share the benefits of exceptional growth and national development. But the resources boom collapsed soon after the 1980 elections. Many big projects were either shelved or cancelled, for example, the Rundle shale oil project, the Alcan, Lochinvar and Portland aluminium smelters and the now ironic proposal to expand the Newcastle steel works. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people are awake to the Fraser Government's not having a sound economic framework as the basis for its policy decisions. They are awake to the reality of the Government's lurching from one election to the next, trying to bring down the policies which may get it re-elected but which will not get Australia out of its chronic economic malaise. I think the Australian people are awake to the fact that the Budget now before Parliament is another cynical exercise in political expediency. </PARA>
<PARA> The scenario for this situation was devised some months ago. First, we saw the Government introduce some incentives for the business community by way of increased depreciation allowances and plant investment allowances, et cetera, prior to the Budget so that maximum publicity could be obtained for those measures. I shall deal with these measures a little later. Secondly, we have the present Budget which provides, on the face of it, a basketful of goodies for the middle income earner, the swinging voter and some relief for our pensioner population. It is a Budget designed for an early election because of the hand- outs it proposes and because it lacks any provision for a reversal of the present poor economic condition of our country. It is a Budget which will do nothing to get the economy moving again. By the admission of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) we will have virtually no real growth and increased unemployment. It is a hotch-potch recipe for economic disaster for Australia in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Leader of the Opposition has stated, in this Budget the Government has again used rubbery and downright deceptive figures. By understating expenditure and overstating income the Government is attempting to show that the deficit will be only $1,674m. This is an act of downright deception which will be seen by the community in its true light at the end of this financial year. That is another reason why the Government is so eager to have an election. It could then do what it did in 1978 after the election in 1977-take back the tax cuts six months after they were given. Even the so-called basket of goodies is deceptive. Three major problems facing my constituents in the electorate of Banks-and I am sure facing most Australians-have, according to the Treasurer, been addressed in this Budget. They are taxation, housing and unemployment. A closer look at the Government's Budget measures shows that the basket of goodies has a false bottom or does not address the real problem. </PARA>
<PARA> First, I will deal with the tax measures. What are these tax measures? The Government has said that from November 1982 it will increase the tax threshold from $4,195 to $4,595 and the 46c tax threshold from $17,894 to $19,500. As well , the 32c in the dollar tax scale will be reduced to 30c. Accompanying these changes indirect taxes will be increased. On the face of it the measures, excluding the indirect tax increases, seem favourable. For a long time the Australian Labor Party has been urging the Government to grant some compensation . In context, however, the Government offers very little to most Australians. I have two major areas of complaint. First, the measures offer only little more than what full indexation would have given them. Secondly, it offers only a small reversal of the seven years of a regressive tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first point, the tax concessions announced with such grandiosity in reality amount to only a little over what the taxpayer would have been entitled to under promised automatic tax indexation. The cost of the concessions in 1982- 83 is estimated to be $1.6 billion, whereas the cost of full indexation is $1.5 billion. The Liberal Party praised the merits of tax indexation in 1975 when it promised to reform the tax system. Tax indexation it said would make government more honest with taxpayers' money because government would no longer be able to rely on the secret tax increase of inflation. These words were spoken by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1975. Yet over the proceeding years that commitment was rarely met. For the six financial years from 1976-77 to 1981-82 inclusive full tax indexation was applied only twice. In three of the remaining years half tax indexation was applied and in 1979-80 there was no tax indexation at all. Seen in this context, this Budget's tax concessions do not give much to the taxpayer; they simply stop the practice of automatically taking the hidden tax increases that inflation permits. I seek leave to have a table showing benefits of the Budget measures incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Over the past seven years the lower the income of a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children, as shown in the table, the greater proportion of his income he has had to pay in tax. For example, a person who now earns $12,062 pays 6.4 per cent of his income in tax. In 1975-76 he paid 1.6 per cent. The proportion has increased in this period by 300 per cent. I compare this with a person earning $36,187. He now pays 30 per cent of his income in tax. In 1975-76 he paid 29.3 per cent. The increase is only 2.3 per cent. It is only when we get into even higher income groups that that percentage has decreased. We now see that when the Prime Minister said in the 1975 election campaign that his Government would reduce the tax burden he must have meant that the burden would be reduced for only a very select group of taxpayers, that is, the richer ones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So much for the Budget's tax cuts. What about the housing measures? The Government has said that this Budget addresses the housing problem. I dispute this claim for several reasons. First, what is the housing problem? There are three main groups in our community who are experiencing a housing problem. Firstly, there are those people who are in the private rental market and are unlikely ever to be in a position of purchasing their own homes. This is the long term housing problem which faces the lower income groups in society. Secondly, there are those people who are in the private rental market and who are likely to be able to afford their own homes. These are the people currently faced with the deposit gap. Thirdly, there are those people who have already committed themselves to the purchase of houses but who are currently experiencing cash flow problems as a result of rising interest rates. This group , comprising primarily middle income earners, is in need of short term assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done for the first group? All the Budget does for this group, which makes up 25 per cent of the population, is to allocate $10m in rent relief assistance. This compares with the $562m package to home purchasers who represent approximately 25 per cent of the Australian population. The Government has also increased supplemenatary assistance to pensioners in rented accommodation but by a mere $2 a week. Rentals are rising at an annual rate of more than $10 a week. If the Government were serious in alleviating the housing problem for this group it would extend considerably the access to public rental housing. The Government-I give it credit for this-has increased the welfare housing share in this Budget but over the past eight years in real terms the money it has spent on welfare housing has declined, in 1982-83 prices, from $ 975m in 1974-75 to $290m in 1982-83. The cumulative real reduction in public housing funding over that period is a staggering $3,740m. </PARA>
<PARA> The second group comprises those people who are unable to bridge the deposit gap, that is, the people who are eligible for the maximum home loan which is far exceeded by the cost of a home. Only two courses of action are open to a person in this position. Either he rents accommodation until he can save the deposit or he obtains a second mortgage. For the person who takes the first option this Budget offers little to no help. He will still be paying $90 to $100 a week in rent and if he has enough money to save he will pay tax on the interest his savings earn. The person who takes the second option will receive some assistance through the interest rebate, which I will deal with later. But his more basic problem, that of having to obtain a second mortgage, is not recognised at all. By tightening the money supply the Government is, in fact, making it harder for him to get finance. </PARA>
<PARA> The third group comprises the people who purchased houses recently and are now finding it difficult to cope with interest rate rises. Many people within my electorate are experiencing such a problem. In recent years several new subdivisions have been opened up to home buyers in the Milperra, Padstow Heights and Lugarno areas. Those who thought they could afford to buy homes in early 1980 have had to evaluate their positions. Since then savings banks' interest rates have risen from 9.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent. This 4 per cent increase has meant that repayments on a $30,000 loan have risen from $262 a month to $350 a month-an annual increase of $1,056. Many home owners are struggling to maintain their mortgages. Statistics on mortgage defaults from the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation show that between 1970-71 and 1979-80 mortgage defaults have increased from 4 per cent of total premiums to 35 per cent. The people in this group get perhaps the most benefit from this Budget-a rebate of 30c in the dollar on interest payments above a rate of 10 per cent on loans up to $60,000 no matter what their incomes or the sources of their loans. But whilst the measure is welcome, it goes only a fraction of the way to reducing the $1,056 in extra repayments that a person who purchased a home in 1980 with a loan of $30, 000 is enduring. Under the March scheme the maximum rebate he could anticipate was $300 this year. Under the Budget rebate scheme this amount will be $377.50. The measure also assists home buyers who may not be in need of government assistance at all. Over half of the estimated cost of the interest rebate will go to home buyers with incomes in excess of 150 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time I have left in this debate I want to say something about what this Budget offers for the unemployed. There has been a very real deterioration of the employment market in this country. In July this year there was no employment growth. The unemployment rate was 6.6 per cent. It is expected to top 10 per cent in February 1983. In my electorate of Banks many firms are literally going to the wall. I have prepared a table showing some of these companies which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. As this table shows, retrenchments have grown dramatically this year in my electorate, hitting not just young apprentices but also middle aged bread winners who sometimes have been with a company for many years. The list I have given is by no means absolute. It records only significant retrenchments by major employers. The number of small scale retrenchments is not known, but, according to the manager of the local Commonwealth Employment Service at Revesby, it is very considerable. Jobs are being eradicated from industry, not temporarily, but on a permanent basis. We will not get them back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the Fraser Government doing about it? Firstly, it announced with much bravado an investment package for industry. The package, according to the Treasurer, will assist industry with investment and will thereby retain jobs and increase employment. I contend that it will do the opposite. The package, in fact, will encourage industry to invest in capital intensive, not labour intensive, measures. Clearly, the Government has not even read its own commissioned report on technological change. This report clearly indicates the transformation of industry from labour intensive investment to capital intensive investment. The Government's package simply speeds up this process. Let me add that I concede that the new technologies may be necessary if Australian industry is to remain competitive. In fact I believe the Government is not doing enough to encourage research and development of our own technology or to back our local inventions with venture capital. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Secondly, the Government delivers a Budget which has a no-growth strategy as its basis. By budgeting for a $240m domestic surplus the Government is taking money out of the pockets of wage and salary earners and out of the profits of firms facing severe liquidity and investment problems. The foreign deficit does nothing to generate jobs in Australia. By restricting the growth in the money supply to 9 per cent to 11 per cent, just enough to accommodate the expected inflation rate of 10.75 per cent, it provides no capacity for growth. To hold unemployment at its present level we must achieve an annual growth of at least 3 per cent. This means aiming at a domestic deficit and an increase in the money supply-the reverse of the Fraser Government's policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Government says that it is increasing its manpower training programs by 21 per cent for 1982-83. On the face of it, it is a welcome increase but when seen in the context of the overall Budget, which forecasts no employment growth in 1982-83, it is ludicrous. The Government can talk all it likes about grandiose schemes to retrain the unemployed, but the reality is that the jobs are not there even when they gain the skills. Fourthly, and it is hardly worth mentioning, the Government has increased the unemployment benefits in the Budget. The increase of $4 a week in benefits for the under-18-year-olds represents an 11 per cent increase in seven years. For those unemployed who are over 18 years their benefit of $64.40 is still $26.70 below the poverty line. These measures are a total insult to those unemployed because of the Government' s own economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me say that I am disappointed with the Government's strategies in managing the Australian economy. Where we should have seen increasing productivity and employment, we have instead seen low growth and increasing unemployment. The Government has blindly followed the United States of America and the United Kingdom down the Friedman economic path of recession and depresson. The world is now on the brink of economic depression because the major countries of the West have pursued wrong policies-policies that were based on political expediency. In Australia we need a government of vision, a government that has faith in the future, a government that is willing to forgo short term, stop-go policies of expediency in favour of long term economic stability which will improve our people's standard of living. We need a leader who will unite our people in a true nationalistic spirit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw to the attention of the House a Press statement issued by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) on 27 August 1982 in which he indicated the Government's support for the proposition of greater uniformity in liability in repatriation legislation. He indicated that it was the Government's intention that repatriation legislation be amended to provide greater uniformity in Commonwealth liability to provide benefits to veterans and their dependants. He specifically indicated that the proposed amendment was designed to remove existing anomalies within the legislation which deprived veterans, particularly those who had taken part in the Vietnam war, of entitlements equivalent to those for those veterans who had fought in earlier conflicts on behalf of this nation. Of course, that was basically an endorsement of the policies and of the views which had been argued for and on behalf of the Opposition in this House in April of this year. Not being one who would ever want to look a gift horse in the mouth and not wanting to be churlish about this matter, I would have been perfectly happy to compliment the Minister and the Government on this much needed amendment had it not been for what seemed to me to be an exercise in politicking by the Minister at the end of his Press statement. I rather suspect that he said what he did at the end of the statement out of a feeling of guilt. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has needed no prodding on this issue and it is significant that the legislation changes it proposes are broader than those proposed by other parties. </PARA>
<PARA>To say that the Government needed no prodding on this issue is, I suggest, an indication of the guilty mind of the Minister. In March of this year there was before this House a Repatriation Amendment Bill. An amendment was moved on that occasion by my colleague the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) which was seconded by me. That amendment contemplated the very amendment which is now contemplated by the Minister. On that occasion the Minister handling the Bill on behalf of the Government in this House indicated that the Government could not accept that amendment. A division was called and every honourable member on the Government side of the House followed the view expressed by the Government and cast his or her vote against any changes in the legislation. I indicated that I thought this was the kind of amendment which should have attracted support from both sides of the House and I urged the Government to examine what seemed to me to be the justice of that claim while the legislation passed between this place and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill was debated in the Senate in April 1982 and the very same amendment was moved in the Senate. On that occasion Government supporters again used their numbers to reject any such proposal. Some four months later the Government has suddenly changed its mind on the very issue which its members were not prepared to consider appropriate or just in March or April of this year. Yet the Minister says: 'We did not need any prodding'. What caused this change was the decision of the Vietnam Veterans Association to campaign in marginal seats for what was plain justice. I commend it for its actions and decision. I salute the result it has already achieved for its members from its action. I can only hope that the Minister, having conceded the justice of this occasion, will now consider the claim for further justice and grant these people the judicial inquiry they have sought for so long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 March 1964 a British court in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, convicted 10 men for their involvement in the #2.5m 1963 British mail train robbery. They were sentenced by Mr Justice Edmund Davies on 16 April of that year to prison terms ranging up to 30 years. Explaining the severity of the sentences Davies said to those he was sentencing:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Potential criminals . . . dazzled by the size . . . of the prize must be taught that punishment will be proportionately greater; let us clear any romantic notions . . . it is . . . a sordid crime of violence inspired by vast greed . . . it would be an affront if you were at liberty in the near future to enjoy these ill-gotten gains. </PARA>
<PARA>Those convicted included Ronald Arthur Biggs, then 34 years, a carpenter. Biggs, a member of the gang that executed that robbery, escaped from Wandsworth prison in London on 8 July 1966 with three other prisoners. Of course, we know the record of his activities in Australia where he lived for some time under an alias. We know that the police suspect Biggs of having been involved in robberies in Australia. We know that he fled Australia leaving his wife and family to fend for themselves. We know of his history in the West Indies and in South America. We know that he fathered a child to a Brazilian woman so that he could remain in Brazil and we know that the many attempts that were made by the British authorities to have him extradited to Great Britain have failed. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days we have seen in newspapers in Australia the same Ronald Arthur Biggs advertising a particular brand of coffee. The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations refused to accept the commercials that featured Ronald Biggs selling that coffee, but unfortunately full page advertisements have been run in some newspapers suggesting that people buy the brand of coffee Cafe de Rio. I just hope that when people take notice of that advertisement and think that it is very clever-obviously it was a good idea on the part of the advertising agency-they will remember that the guard on that train lost his life to make Biggs notorious to an extent that he could be hired by an Australian advertising agency, no doubt at very great cost, to make this commercial. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that Ronald Biggs has featured in Press advertisements and television advertisements which were never shown. The latest estimate that I can gain on what he may have been paid to undertake this promotion was in excess of $A35,000 . I believe that the advertising agency should be condemned and that the manufacturers of that brand of coffee should also be condemned for even considering having this man involved in the promotion of their product. I make a plea to the people of Australia: The next time they are in a supermarket and see the coffee brand Cafe de Rio, avoid it like the plague. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) announced the grants for aged persons homes and homes for handicapped people. I have been very pleased to obtain a grant of $268,168 for the establishment of a retirement village in my electorate for the Illawarra Retirement Trust at Towradgi which is a community north of Wollongong. The point I make about this grant is that the Towradgi village is in a state of turmoil at the moment because an application has been lodged with the Council of the City of Wollongong for the development of a leisure centre next door to this aged persons village. The leisure centre is to be an enormous multi-million dollar complex that will include a great variety of facilities such as a miniature train that will traverse the multi-acre site, canals, lakes and bumper boats, six large water slides, places for electronic games, a flea market, barbeques and a rock concert facility that will accommodate 3,000 people. I have received personally representations from over 180 residents of this village, upon which the Commonwealth has already spent some $735,000 and upon which it is now proposed to spend an additional $268,000 bringing total Commonwealth expenditure to over $1m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made a request of the Minister for Social Security that he have regard for the welfare of the residents of this aged persons village and, indeed, for the taxpayers of this country who have invested in excess of $1m in it, by demonstrating his interest in this leisure centre proposal. The residents contend that the peace and tranquility which they seek in their retirement and their old age is now to be put at risk. One can imagine the effect of a rock concert attended by 3,000 people. Inadquate parking facilities are proposed which will result in a great spillover into the areas surrounding the retirement village. </PARA>
<PARA> I have asked the Minister to institute inquiries to ascertain whether the complaints of the residents are justified. That is all I have asked. I have received a response from his secretary-I deplore and disparage the practice of a secretary sending a response to any member of Parliament-who told me that the matter is not one for the concern of his Minister but is one for the Minister for Planning and Environment in New South Wales. I refuse to believe that this Federal Minister is so irresponsible or so discourteous as to fail to take an interest on the one hand and to fail to respond to me on the other hand. I call on him to disregard the advice that has come from his Department and the decision that has been taken by his staff and some of his advisers that he can wash his hands of this matter. I think he should become actively involved by way of instituting an inquiry to ascertain whether the peace and tranquility of the residents of this village are at risk in any way. Of course, if there is a prima facie case to that effect, the Commonwealth would have an appropriate role in opposing the application when it comes before the Council of the City of Wollongong and, if necessary, joining the residents in a legal action to oppose the application and cause them to be underwritten by the resources of the Attorney-General's Department. I think it would be stupid for the Commonwealth to spend over $1m on a retirement village into which people are enticed to enjoy peace and tranquility for the rest of their lives and then to sit idly by while the whole thing is sabotaged and undermined through the Commonwealth's indifference. The Commonwealth should safeguard its investment and, indeed, honour its obligation to this very large number of senior citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I desire to raise a matter which has caused me quite some concern and on which I have had a number of representations. The alert and the observant will have already noted that I have asked a question on this matter. Student benefit guidelines propose that no unemployment benefit payments will be made to tertiary students during university and college recess. Those guidelines contemplate a recess of two or at the most three months. I agree with that general principle, although I recognise that there can be difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to raise particularly the case of Griffith University. We have a situation there that I believe is most unfortunate. The Griffith University is very close to the Commonwealth Games Complex. The campus and the buildings are being appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth Games. For that reason the educational year started early at Griffith and it will end this month, September. I believe that there will be no resumption at that university until the end of February; so the recess will last for about five months. This poses a very great difficulty for those students who are not able to get the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance. Vacation jobs are very difficult to obtain. The observation of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Social Security (Mr Wilson) this morning that the longer recess will provide an opportunity for students to obtain vacation jobs to supplement their incomes and to gain experience is fine but it is not realistic because jobs are just not easy to obtain, particularly in the electorate which I represent. If they were easy to obtain, I would have no complaint and I would not be raising this matter in the House tonight. In the cases that have come to my notice, the parents' resources are severely strained. Indeed, the students who have spoken to me feel very poorly about putting so much of a strain on their parents for so long a time. Students continuing their studies are in a position that I believe was not comprehended when the guidelines were set. Such a long period of recess was not envisaged. This is not the fault of the students. The action was taken to hold the Commonwealth Games and the Commonwealth Government has supported requests for assistance from the State Government and the Brisbane City Council. We have given that help. But continuing students, through no fault of their own, are having their semesters altered and their recess elongated. They face a serious problem. They are like the ham in the sandwich. I appeal to the Minister to look very closely at the problem which has arisen to see whether there is any element of injustice and whether there are grounds for considering a variation of the guidelines for the continuing students at Griffith University. This year they have a long recess and will be in a once only position of being unable to get vacation jobs. The difficulties are serious. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was very interesting, as the honourable member will hear in a moment. We were interested to look at several of the issues involved there: Firstly, the situation of the Aboriginal people; secondly, the effect of uranium mining on the area; and thirdly, what was actually happening to the park. There is a conflict of interests in that area. From my observations and from discussions I had with, for example, the rangers in the park, Aboriginal people, and the people involved in uranium mining I believe that this conflict will become more accentuated in the future. There seem to be so many different concepts of the future of that area and what will happen to it. I wish to deal firstly with the proposed uranium mines at Jabiluka and Koongarra, which are massive projects. One of those projects has been approved by the Northern Territory Government. That approval was obtained after supposed extensive discussions with the Aboriginal people in the area. In my discussions with them I found that tactics of intimidation and attempted bribery had been used over those people to attempt to force them into a position where they finally gave way to the demands from the companies involved in uranium mining at Jabiluka.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to contrast that situation with the situation in an area further south but still in the park-the Koongarra mine. The Aboriginal people there, organised by the Gagudju Association, have rejected the proposals for uranium mining in the area and in rejecting those proposals they have created a crisis for the Northern Territory Government. To this stage the Northern Territory Government has been able to use one technique or another to force the Aboriginal people to accept these kinds of mining leases. Some of the reasons why the Aboriginal people rejected the Koongarra mine apply to all of the mines in that area. In fact, some of those reasons apply to the problems faced in the whole park area. The first and major reason is that the Koongarra mine is close to a major sacred site, the home of the lightning god of the Aboriginal people in the area. Given that situation, they are understandably very reluctant to allow mining in that place. If one visits that area one finds that is an absolutely beautiful part of Australia that would be totally ruined by a uranium mine, especially when one takes into account the weather conditions that exist and the roads and other works that would have to be built. </PARA>
<PARA> Already in the middle of the Kakadu Park is a town called Jabiru and it is anticipated that in the next six months to 12 months Jabiru will have a population of 1000. It is a quite extraordinary contradiction to drive through a park which has Aboriginal settlements and so forth and suddenly to come upon this town, which is like a suburban shopping centre in the middle of a city such as Sydney or Melbourne. It is such a total contradiction and it is so out of place in that area. If the uranium mines go ahead, it is intended that the town will have-these are not my words but the words of the people at the Ranger mine- a population of 10,000 people; that is to say, more than 10 times the total Aboriginal population of the area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I questioned the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) on a matter of great concern to me and to the people of my electorate. I refer to our tariff laws and a situation of a tariff in reverse. The Phillips tractor company of Merredin is situated in a town approximately half way between Perth and Kalgoorlie, 260 kilometres from Perth. It is central to the eastern wheat belt of Western Australia and has a population of approximately 4,000 people. It is a relatively large town in Western Australian terms. Laurie Phillips, who has been a resident there for many years, commenced manufacturing four wheel drive agricultural tractors in 1975. His decision to choose the town of Merredin could be justified only by its proximity to the customers. As a present day employer of 50 people, Mr Phillips stands as my ideal of an operater of a successful and decentralised business. He is taking advantage of the position but, more importantly, he is creating work for people who choose not to work in city areas but wish to gain some of the benefits provided by country living. His production over the first five years averaged 13 tractors a year. This was caused more by his lack of working capital than by a lack of orders. He just manufactured to order, factory direct, as he could neither afford stock on hand nor agent's commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1980 Mr Phillips took a partner and appointed agents both in Western Australia and interstate. These moves saw sales rise to 47 tractors in 1981 and to a predicted 70 tractors in 1982. His range of tractors has also increased and now varies from a 249 horsepower, four wheel drive, manual drive machine at a price of about $70,000 to a 515 horsepower, power shift model at $251,000. Laurie has tended to keep ahead of imported tractors both in horsepower and in equipment such as power shift. I can tell honourable members that, from observing his tractors myself, they are advanced models which are attractive to the farming community in this day and age of big equipment. Nevertheless, it is natural with such a small volume producer that Phillips utilise imported mechanical components such as Mercedes engines and Japanese transmissions and axles. The success of his combination is evident from the fact that the first machine sold is still in active service although the purchaser now owns a second machine. That gentleman has resisted all overtures to sell the original machine back to the Phillips company. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a problem. The Federal revenue duty of 2 per cent is applicable to all his imported components. This represents a cost of $600 to $900 a tractor and, in terms of the Phillips production level, about $1,000 a week. Unfortunately for this small and viable four wheel drive tractor manufacturer his competitors, who are importing fully built up four wheel drive tractors from the United States of America in particular, do not pay this duty. In fact they pay no import duties at all. A General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade conference of the past, no doubt recognising that Australia had no manufacturers in this area, saw a duty-free deal in fully built up, four wheel drive tractors as a logical trade -off for concessions overseas in other trade areas. Mr Phillips is quite happy to meet head on and on equal terms the competition from the big time overseas competitors. However, because of this GATT agreement his competitors escape the 2 per cent revenue duty. In addition, the percentage of imported components denies him access to the tractor bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently the Government announced that it would dispose of the 2 per cent revenue duty for ships manufactured overseas and imported into this country. I am therefore at a loss to know why for 18 months the Government has constantly advised me that there is no way in which a similar arrangement can be made for people in this manufacturing area. It is unbelievable that such a simple solution cannot be provided. In a highly protected nation such as ours we have a situation where some local manufactures are actually being hit by duty which is not applicable to imported components. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (3). No comprehensive medical examinations beyond those included in the appointment process are conducted routinely. Medical examinations are, however, arranged when officers or employees report symptoms of apparently job related illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA> The significance of repetition strain injury as an occupational health problem has only recently been recognised. My Department has reacted promptly in researching the problem and it is expected that a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Occupational Health Guide will be issued in the near future.

<PARA> My Department is continuing to consider this problem and to seek advice from relevant authorities on suitable working environments for operators where the possible existence of health hazards is suspected. Existing work places have, of course, been designed, fitted out and equipped having regard to recent Government and State safety regulations and relevant standards and guidelines issued by such bodies as the Standards Association of Australia, the NHMRC and the Department of Science and Technology.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Guidelines on Technological Change issued by the Public Service Board, my Department is consulting with staff associations regarding re- equipment programs in some of its major processing areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Public Service Board memorandum 81/418 has been brought to the attention of all supervisors and operators in the Department. Copies of the memorandum have also been provided to the statutory authorities for which the Attorney-General has responsibility; although it should be noted that some of those authorities have autonomous powers in relation to the matters in question. Operators in the Department, in consultation with supervisors, take regular breaks from operating this equipment to perform other tasks or to take basic rest periods.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The percentage of the working day spent on operating duties depends on the nature of the task being performed and it is therefore difficult to give a precise answer. However, experience in the Department indicates that no operators spend more than 75% of their day on operating duties.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) The general practice in the Department is for the output required of an operator to be determined by the nature and complexity of the task being performed and there is no requirement to complete a number of keystrokes within any specific time frame. Operators are expected to complete a reasonable number of keystrokes according to the task being undertaken. (ii) No statistics are maintained by the Department on keystrokes completed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) operators have been made aware of the need for breaks by supervisors and/or by circulars and are permitted regular breaks from operating their equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The percentage of the working day occupied on operating duties varies considerably depending on the system utilised and work organisation. Where operators spend 100 per cent of their working time on operating duties they are allowed regular breaks additional to lunch and morning and afternoon tea. In systems where operators spend a substantial proportion of their time on other duties the work arrangements themselves provide time away from equipment operating duties.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The type of equipment and the processing system used influence the rates of output expected from operators. Operators who use screen based equipment for processing medical benefits and similar claims are expected to complete, on average, 48,750 keystrokes per 6 1/2 hour day (7,500 per hour). The 6 1/2 hour day is based on a 7 hour 21 minute day less morning and afternoon tea breaks and rest breaks. Actual keystrokes rates vary between approximately 7,500 per hour and 12,000 per hour. In a number of operational systems there is no requirement to complete a set number of keystrokes per day because of the nature of the work involved, for example, checking the information shown on a visual display unit.</PARA>

The average cost estimate used by the Advanced Education Council was approximately $4,000 per equivalent full-time student (EFTS), which represented a 5.5 per cent increase on the existing level of support. The figure is expressed in estimated December 1980 costs levels. The CTEC did not support in full the Advanced Education Council's funding proposals (see paragraph 8.52 to 8.57 of Volume 1 Part 1 of the Commission's Report). It recommended a level of general recurrent funding some 5 per cent below that sought by the Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In accordance with long standing arrangements, recurrent grants to higher education institutions are allocated by the Commonwealth on the basis of a block grant. The expenditure of that grant, including the allocation of funds to particular disciplines or areas of teaching, is a matter for the institution to determine. Consistent with this policy, the CTEC does not publish cost parameters used in developing its recurrent grant recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of colleges of advanced education, these recommendations are based on advice from State authorities, in accordance with an agreement between the Commonwealth and State Ministers for Education made in June 1979. Under this arrangement, the allocation of funds for recurrent purposes in the advanced education sector by the CTEC is based on the folowing procedures:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The total number of advanced education students and their mix in terms of individual institutions and fields and levels of study in a given State will be determined by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission on the advice of the Advanced Education Council after consultation with State authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Commission, on the advice of the Advanced Education Council, will allocate the available funds to individual colleges after advice to the Council from the appropriate State authorities. As the development of individual colleges is largely a matter for the States in the light of co-ordinated State plans for advanced education, the Council will generally follow the recommendations made by the State authorities.</PARA>

<PARA> The general issue of the development of a national language policy is one that has been referred to a Committee in another place for investigation. The resolutions of the Victorian and New South Wales Ethnic Communities Councils Conferences on a national language policy, together with those from other State and Territory conferences, will form an important input to a national conference sponsored by the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils in Canberra in October 1982.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TE7">Mr Hodges</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) When the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters (NAATI) was established in 1977, it was envisaged that responsibility for the profession would, within five years, be assumed by a successor-body or bodies. Planning is under way for the devolution, at the beginning of 1983, of NAATI's functions to a national registration body and a national professional association.</PARA>
<PARA> The national registration body will have responsibility for the maintenance of standards-corresponding with the five levels of accreditation established by NAATI-for testing and other forms of assessment, for accreditation and for registration. The registration body, which will be incorporated as a company, will aim to become self-funding as rapidly as possible, but in its early years of operation will require government subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA> It is envisaged that the main functions of the national professional association will be to protect and further the interests of the profession, and represent its views, to maintain discipline within the profession and uphold professional ethics, and to maintain liaison with the national registration body on all matters affecting the profession. No governmental action will be required towards the establishment of the association, but NAATI will do all that it can to encourage the emergence of an association, possibly based on a federation of existing association.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) NAATI has encouraged the establishment of courses for interpreters and translators by maintaining contact with educational institutions, with the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission and, where appropriate, with State and Territory post-secondary education authorities to advise on the need for training courses. The Authority is not in a position to fund educational programs, apart from occasional intensive training workshops designed to prepare candidates for NAATI tests.</PARA>
<PARA> Panels of experts composed principally of NAATI members and, where necessary, consultants with expertise in the language/s concerned examine each course in person advising on the course content needed for NAATI approval and, where those standards are met, recommending the course to the Authority for approval.</PARA>
<PARA> Four training courses for interpreters and translators were being run by institutions at the time NAATI was established. A list of the eighteen courses now being conducted or which institutions plan to introduce in 1983 is given below.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr Fife</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Schools Commission's Planning and Finance Committee in New South Wales, the body responsible for making recommendations to the Commission on the capital needs of non-governemnt schools received an application for assistance from All Hallow's School on 16 June 1982. The school subsequently, on 20 July 1982, submitted a revised application which sought assistance with the demolition of the existing school and the construction of a new school.</PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Committee, which considers each application on the basis of the relative educational and financial need, visited the school on 29 July 1982 to discuss the application. A building consultant has also visited the school to discuss the various planning options with the school authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> It is anticipated that the school's application will be considered at a full Committee meeting in late August 1982. It will be appreciated that, in order to assess the relative claims of all applicant schools, the Committee must undertake a detailed examination of each school's application to assess the relative educational and financial need of each school. All Hallow's can be assured that the process of making a decision in relation to its application will be undertaken as expeditiously as possible. As soon as a decision has been made, the school will be advised accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member should be aware that demand from non-government schools for Commonwealth capital assistance far exceeds the funds available. The Commonwealth Schools Commission recently reported that in 1981 the New South Wales Planning and Finance Committee received 143 applications from non- government schools for capital grants. The applications involved grants which amounted to $53.1m. Seventy-two of the applications, that is 50.3 per cent, were rejected due to lack of funds, even though 10 of them, involving grants worth about $4.6m. were given an A rating (top priority) in terms of both educational and financial need.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) I am informed by the Australian Statistician that there are no official statistics which show that in January 1982 unemployed workers in the 60 -64 year age bracket were expected to remain unemployed for an average of two years.</PARA>
<PARA> The monthly labour force survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics produces estimates of the actual duration of unemployment up to the time of the survey-not the expected duration-for the following four age groups: 15-19; 20-24; 25-34; 35-54.</PARA>
<PARA> Information is compiled by the ABS for certain other age groups but, because the number of people in these categories who are selected in the sample is very small, the figures are not reliable because of the associated large sampling errors.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The most recent statistics available on persons, classified by the ABS as ' discouraged job seekers' (that is, persons who wanted a job but were not actively looking for work because, for a variety of reasons, they believed they would not be able to find a job) were collected in September 1981. It is estimated that in September 1981 there were about 9,100 discouraged job seekers 55 to 64 years of age who thought they would be considered by prospective employers to be too old to work. Source: ABS Supplementary Labour Force Survey, September 1981 (unpublished data).</PARA>
<PARA> (4) My Department is currently undertaking an examination of the position of older unemployed job seekers registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service so that appropriate assistance can be given. In addition, my Department's Bureau of Labour Market Research is planning a major study of unemployment among older workers which is due to be completed by June next year. This information will further increase my Department's capacity to develop soundly-based measures of assistance to counter employment disadvantages suffered by older workers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) is governed by a Congressional Board consisting of six senators and six members of the House of Representatives . An Advisory Council of ten public members eminent in science, technology and education advises the Board on OTA assessments and other matters. The OTA has an in-house staff of 80-90 professional officers.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) On 18 April 1980 the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia reported to the Prime Minister. The Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> that a Standing Committee of ASTEC be established with representatives from industry, the trade unions, scientists and technologists and government ( including State Governments on a rotating basis), and with terms of reference as follows: to review on a continuing basis the processes and trends in technological change in Australia and elsewhere; and to evaluate and report on the direct and indirect effects of technological change at the national level ( Recommendation 28)</PARA>
<PARA> that a Council of Technological Change be established comprising Commonwealth and State Ministers (Recommendation 29).</PARA>
<PARA> In the Government's response, Recommendation 28 was accepted and the Technological Change Committee is now in operation as a standing committee of ASTEC. Recommendation 29 was not accepted, rather it was decided to draw the attention of existing Ministerial bodies, such as the Commonwealth-State Labour and Industry Ministers' Conferences, to the need for adequate consultation and co-operation in matters relating to technological change.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The submission referred to has been received by the Treasurer and has been considered.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is appreciated that electric-powered motor vehicles can have a number of advantages over petrol-powered alternatives. Most of these advantages would, however, benefit directly the purchaser of the vehicle who can be expected to weigh such benefits against the relative purchase prices of the two types of vehicle. It is relevant here that the Government's policy of import parity pricing of crude oil is itself broad encouragement to shift from petrol-powered vehicles to those using alternative sources of energy. In the circumstances, there appears to be no need for additional incentives to encourage the use of electric power in the transport area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2334) Mr Hayden asked me a question without notice concerning two reports by a person who was formerly an Army Investigator. He asked whether I was aware of the existence of a second report which, he indicated, dealt with illegal activities by Nugan Hand, their associates and other persons who are prominent in public life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I advised on 6 May that I was aware of the existence of one report and undertook to check further to see whether there was a second report.</PARA>
<PARA> A copy of the second report has since been located. It is dated 17 February 1971 and was a follow-up report to the first report dated 19 January 1971. The first report had dealt primarily with some Army personnel involvement with black marketing; the second report had dealt with civilian personnel that came to notice during the black marketing investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that careful examination of the report has failed to reveal any such mention or evidence of any connections with Nugan Hand, their associates or other persons prominent in public life. This view has been reached after enquiry into the appropriate Department of Defence records and enquiries to the Commonwealth/New South Wales Joint Task Force into Drug Trafficking. Furthermore, I am advised that an outline of the two reports appeared in the Melbourne Sun Herald of 13 March 1971.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the requested information on action taken by the authorities following receipt of those reports, I have been advised by my colleague, the Minister for Defence, that the first report resulted in subsequent disciplinary charges against certain members of the Australian Army. In respect of the second report, my colleague advised that the report had been requested by an officer of the then Department of External Affairs on 23 January 1971 and had been forwarded to the Secretary of that Department on 3 March 1971, for any further enquiry by that Department in relation to the Australian Embassy in South Vietnam.</PARA>
