<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the National Director of Community Aid Abroad has suggested that Australia's aid program will be underspent to the extent of $100m this year. This suggestion is completely wrong. The so-called freeze on expenditure in respect of aid funds was lifted some time ago and all programs that have been agreed and adequately developed are proceeding. It is anticipated that there will be only a minimal shortfall in aid expenditure this year. If this does occur it will amount to only 2 per cent or 3 per cent of the program. Arrangements have been made for any unspent funds to be carried forward to the 1982-83 aid program without prejudice to the size of that program. Some funds have been transferred from bilateral project aid to bilateral food aid because of the difficulties that were being experienced by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau in having adequate time to assess projects that had been put forward this year. The Government regrets that Mr Martin has misled the public on this very important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot confirm or deny the statistics that the honourable member put forward. I point out that under the new health funding arrangements brought in by the Federal Government a considerable amount of money has been made available to each of the States. This amount is based upon the actual expenditure last year plus an escalation factor of 10 per cent, which applies also to community health and to the school dental service, to pay for the cost of the continuation of those schemes. I say, because this afternoon two questions have been directed to me concerning the state of the health system in Victoria, that over the years, under the administration of Liberal governments in that State, the Victorian health system has really been quite an example to the rest of Australia. It certainly has not exemplified the wastage which is characterised in the New South Wales health system and which is currently bringing about a situation of quite severe strain in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Communications: Why has Australia Post banned overtime for its employees in Perth? Is that ban general throughout Australia? What is the current loss per day of Australia Post? How far is it currently in deficit? Is it a fact that Cabinet has deferred consideration of a rise in postal charges? If so, is it to be anticipated that a Cabinet decision on the matter will not be made until after the Victorian State election?

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1314" SPEAKER="Sinclair The Rt Hon I.McC." NAMEID="5E4" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="NEW ENGLAND" MINISTERIAL="LEADER OF THE HOUSE; COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague, the Minister for Industrial Relations, has often told this House of the ills that have befallen the whole Australian community as a result of industrial stoppages and other matters of that ilk. I think the statements made in this place yesterday and the community reaction in New South Wales further demonstrate that in one other area there has been real concern as a result of industrial troubles-in that instance, in the power stations in New South Wales. In Australia Post about $7m was lost as a result of the pre- Christmas industrial action. That amount of money very significantly affected the cash flows of a statutory authority which is charged with the responsibility of covering the costs of the services that it provides throughout Australia. As a result, Australia Post is concerned about its present financial position. It has taken a series of steps to try to contain its outlays and to ensure to the maximum that services to the public are not affected, while the amount of money that it spends in trying to provide the services is no more than is absolutely necessary in relation to the overall high labour cost that affects it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might add that in Australia Post about 80 per cent of the costs of providing mail services in this country are affected by those costs directly related to labour input. As people would know, the combined costs of wage increases and, in some industries, the reduction in working hours have led to about a 20 per cent increase in labour costs in Australia in the last 12 months. To an organisation such as Australia Post, which is very heavily dependent upon labour, obviously that factor is very significant. Australia Post, over the last few weeks, has increased the charges that it is applying to parcels. It is certainly very conscious of the need for it to generate sufficient revenue to provide adequate services to the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. I think he would be aware of a very fine adjournment speech which was made last night on the matter of transport. My question is: Does the Minister have power to prohibit smoking in public transport, particularly domestic aircraft? If the Minister has such power, does he intend to exercise it? Is he aware that Scandinavian Airlines System, SAS, has banned all smoking on Swedish air routes? Can he persuade the Australian airline companies to have consideration for the civil rights of the 70 per cent of the population who are non-smokers by prohibiting all smoking in their aircraft?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There appears to be some doubt as to whether the Commonwealth does have power or authority to ban smoking in aircraft. It does have a power in respect of safety in aviation and that power, of course, has been exercised. I have asked my Department to seek further legal advice in respect of this matter because of the number of representations I have had from non-smokers or from people who are offended by the smoking of other people while travelling on aircraft. I do consider that operators should reflect community attitudes and expectations in this regard. I am advised that the airlines continue to monitor the demand for seats for smokers and non-smokers and remain sensitive to any alteration to the demand. Indeed, I wrote to both airlines, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines, suggesting that they might review the number of seats for non-smokers available to people seeking such seats as soon as possible. I think it is very important for the airlines to show sympathetic consideration for the travelling public, of whom I think 70 per cent are non- smokers. I am not aware of Scandinavian Airlines having exercised a power to ban smoking on its aircraft. I will, however, investigate that report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Prime Minister. I refer to my questions last week concerning the activities of the Nugan Hand group. The Prime Minister will recall that last week the Minister for Administrative Services said that he knew nothing of departmental reports which showed that an agency of his Government was informed five years ago that Frank Nugan and Michael Hand were 'bigger than anything you have ever seen here in the heroin game and are said to be part of an American security organisation'. Is the Prime Minister concerned that apparently no action was taken by his Government on this information? Has the Prime Minister consulted his colleague, the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and now Minister for Education, as to whether he knew of these reports at any time during his period of ministerial responsibility for the Australian Narcotics Bureau? Is the Prime Minister aware that this information concerning Nugan and Hand was given to the Bureau in May 1977, just two months before anti-drug campaigner Mr Donald Mackay, of Griffith, disappeared? Is he also aware that six months later, in November 1977, information was passed on to the Bureau alleging Nugan Hand's connections with identified United States security personnel and Nugan's involvement in the smuggling of money out of the Griffith area hidden in wine casks?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; There is a joint task force established between the New South Wales police force and the Commonwealth police force and there has been very close co-operation between the two governments and the two police forces. In addition, there is the royal commission into related matters. The first report of the task force is available. I have offered to make a copy of that report available to the honourable gentleman if he wishes to have it and an officer of the department, if it has not already given the honourable gentleman a copy, will be waiting upon him to give him a copy for his perusal after Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The task force itself recommended that the report not be published because of pending matters. That is plain from the statement that I tabled, which was in fact drafted by the task force. The same reasons were referrred to in a letter from an officer of the New South Wales Premier's Department to me. A copy of that letter will also be made available to the Leader of the Opposition. I mention these matters because this Government was responsible for approaching the New South Wales Government to see that the terms of the task force were widened to make sure that it would be able to look at matters that might offend Commonwealth law as well as State law. That was done on our initiative and the letters in relation to that, Mr Wran's response and Mr Anthony's further response, have been tabled in the Parliament. Therefore, the examinations that are under way by the task force are very much a result of initiatives of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Against that background, I have no intention of going into the details of papers on things that might have occurred some time ago, because if the honourable gentleman believes that there are certain matters that need examination he is fully at liberty to bring those matters to the attention of the task force, which is composed of police from the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth, or, if he prefers, to the royal commission. He would be able to make the papers available to those bodies. If there is anyone speaking to him who he believes has evidence that has not properly been brought before the police task force and/or the royal commission, that person should be persuaded to go forward and give that evidence. If there is a question of protection being needed, protection would be given if necessary by both police forces to that person. But if the honourable gentleman continues just to try to dribble out in this Parliament for political purposes matters that are alleged to be secret, concerning several years ago, then so be it. He will do himself no credit because governments have established the appropriate means for examination of these matters, through either the royal commission or the joint police task force.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons-this, again, should have been plain from the statement that was tabled-why the first report of the first task force is not to be published is that it would prejudice certain matters that could or should lead to prosecution. That obviously means that the police task force has real teeth and is getting about its business in a proper way. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to enhance the cause of justice in Australia, he will make whatever evidence he has available to the task force and/or the royal commission and persuade anyone who might be feeding him with bits and pieces to do the very same thing. We have established the means of examining these matters. This Government took the initiative in widening the terms of reference so that no matters could be excluded. The Leader of the Opposition has no justification whatsoever for keeping information that he might believe to be relevant private to himself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the operation of the scheme is controlled by the Snowy Mountains Council, a body to which the Commonwealth Government, the Government of New South Wales and the Government of Victoria are signatories. In general, the scheme is designed to ensure the maximum use of the water resources of the Snowy, taking into account the two principal areas to which the water is directed, one being the irrigation scheme and the other the provision of water for electricity generation. The amount of water released from the Snowy scheme to alleviate the present electricity shortage in New South Wales, I am told, has been well within the amount agreed by the Snowy Mountains Council as late as December 1981. Some 300 gigalitres of additional water have been made available for electricity generation during the operating year to 30 April 1982, as a result of fairly heavy snowfalls last winter, but the balance, another 300 gigalitres, is being provided on an overdraw basis subject to specific conditions, including payback in the following year to minimise any potential future loss of water to irrigation purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am told that the scheme is being operated within its design capabilities but that its main storages are at present, regrettably, only 45 per cent full. The concern must be to try to balance the two committed end uses of the water to ensure that there is no prejudice to either the water supplies on the Murray and the Murrumbidgee river systems, on the one hand, or electricity generation, on the other hand. I shall draw the attention of the Council to the honourable gentleman's question, but I assure him that, as far as the Federal Government is concerned, while it will do all that it can to assist those who are so hard pressed as a result of the industrial irresponsibility of the New South Wales Government, it accepts its continuing responsibility to water consumers on the Murray and Murrumbidgee river systems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I draw his attention to an article in the Bulletin of today's date at page 100, called 'The Robots are on the March', described as being by one Phillip Lynch, who is described, with an asterisk, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, which advocates that Australian factories should adopt robotisation as soon as possible. Does this article represent a considered Government view, or is it the Minister's personal opinion? Has he discussed the issue with the Prime Minister and other related ministerial colleagues, particularly the Minister for Industrial Relations? In view of Australia's unemployment now standing at 7 per cent, does he agree that this is a singularly inappropriate time for a senior Minister to be advocating robotisation? Finally, does this represent a fourth example of the Minister expressing a personal view, following his recent highly publicised and controversial statements on pensions, public sector spending and company tax?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is absolute rubbish. If the honourable gentleman knew anything about the needs of Australian manufacturing industry at present, he would know full well that it needs to continue developing its competitive edge, and that that requires that industry should use the latest technology available, whether here or overseas, and that technology should certainly include the application of industrial robots at present. I should have thought that the honourable gentleman, with his understanding of science and technology disciplines, on which he has spent some considerable time, would know that robots are one of a number of computer-based manufacturing techniques which are achieving increased application world wide. As the honourable gentleman should know full well, they are achieving increasing acceptance within Australia. I say here in clear terms that, whilst the understandable concerns of employees must be considered, there is no option but for those sections of industry which have a capacity to robotise to in fact do so because it is the development of the competitive edge of Australian manufacturing industry that will help, as I hope the honourable gentleman both understands and acccepts, to build job security within Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member's xenophobic attitudes on these issues are well known. The fact is that, if industry in this country does not employ those advanced technological techniques which are now available to industry in other countries, of course we will lose the competitive edge and as a direct consequence of that the job security provided by those companies and those firms will be threatened. That is the serious point that I put to the honourable gentleman. Technology, in the view of this Government, builds jobs. I recognise that there is understandable concern at times on the part of the work force but unless we become more competitive we will not be able to continue to employ those Australians seeking jobs at present. That, of course, remains a cardinal and significant objective of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last August, on a motion of the honourable member for Mackellar, the House expressed its concern about the situation of Baha'is in Iran. I am pleased to say that since the introduction of our special humanitarian program it is now possible for Baha'is who get out of Iran to be processed and accepted in Australia. Of course there are obvious difficulties in reaching people who are actually in Iran but quite a number now in neighbouring countries are being processed. Many have been accepted. We are doing all that we can to assist them in their plight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, the migration procedures are available to Baha'is elsewhere in the world and many of those are receiving support from the community in Australia. As well as that, I know the Foreign Minister has certain initiatives in mind. We are actually participating through the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to do what we can to alleviate what is a very grave situation. They are settling very effectively thanks to a wide community support structure here and I can assure the House that it is one of the priority areas so far as our special humanitarian program is concerned.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI7">Sir PHILLIP LYNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was no need to do that. I welcome the opportunity to comment on a matter which was raised on both sides of the House yesterday because I think the facts of the issue ought to be very clear to both sides of the House. The Government very shortly will be considering the Industries Assistance Commission report on budgetary assistance for industry and that will require the Government to look at the question of corporate taxation which clearly comprehends both sides of the Government's balance sheet. We take from companies by way of company tax and at the same time companies, Australian industry and commerce generally are the recipients of major areas of government support. All that statement at the Bureau of Industry Economics conference represented was a clear indication that those matters will be before the Government when we look at that IAC report. I invite the honourable gentleman, who I think will look at the plain words which have been used, to look at that speech and to make the same judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a matter which has been on the public record for some considerable period. We announced the IAC reference some months ago. We said then that in a normal management sense it was the compelling objective of this Government to say to industry, through its capacity to respond to the normal inquiries of the IAC, what would be the most cost effective program of assistance which we could provide to industry given its particular needs at this time. It is simply a question of priorities and those priorities will be before the Government. Therefore, for me to assert that these issues to which the Government would need to give close consideration was in fact to recall the statement which was originally made and which in quite clear terms set out the Government's need to be informed by industry on the recommendation by the IAC as to what those priorities in fact ought to be.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman should be the last man in this House to talk about support for industry or the corporate sector. He knows that the policy of the Australian Labor Party, more radical now than it was when it was in government, would seek to withdraw the investment allowance and at a critical time in the history of this country, given the economic circumstances, the honourable gentleman would seek to put further pressure on wages and would apparently give support to a reduction in the working week. I am yet to hear the honourable gentleman say anything about those strikes which have created such havoc in Australian industry and which are creating havoc in New South Wales at present. These are the issues to which the Leader of the Opposition ought to give consideration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; by leave-Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement to the House on the meeting of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Employment Ministers in Paris on 4 and 5 March 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This meeting was held at a time of growing concern in OECD member countries about the problem of unemployment. Estimates prepared by the OECD Secretariat indicate that the level of unemployment in the OECD area as a whole will reach 28.5 million by the end of 1982, which represents 8 per cent of the labour force , and will remain at that level until at least the middle of 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members may have noticed the news report today that, according to statistics just issued by Eurostat, the European Economic Community statistical agency, unemployment in the European Community shows 'an upward tendency' and that the underlying trend of the figures was for a worsening labour picture. It was not, then, surprising that the OECD meeting saw an active debate on the causes of unemployment and proposals to cure it. The impact of unemployment on disadvantaged groups in the labour market, particularly youth, was a special matter of debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, differing opinions were expressed during the meeting. Each country had the opportunity to elaborate its position, to seek reactions to that position, and to question other members on their labour market policies. This process of free discussion resulted in a very effective exchange of views. More importantly, it facilitated the development of a consensus among member countries on some key employment issues facing the OECD area. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that there is not universal agreement amongst all OECD member countries on all matters relating to employment. This is apparent from the communique issued after the meeting where, on certain issues, reference is made to the views of 'some ministers' or 'a number of ministers'. However, there is agreement on the basic economic issues and this is equally apparent from the communique. </PARA>
<PARA> The communique is therefore a significant document and I commend it to the attention of honourable members. I ask leave to incorporate the communique in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>MEETING OF THE OECDMANPOWER AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEEAT MINISTERIAL LEVEL4th- 5th March 1982</PARA>
<PARA>COMMUNIQUE</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Manpower and Social Affairs Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development met at Ministerial Level on 4th and 5th March 1982 under the Chairmanship of Mr Johannes Marten den Uyl,-Minister for Social Affairs and Employment and Deputy Prime-Minister for the Netherlands. Vice- Chairmen of the meeting were M. Jean Auroux, Ministre du Travail for France; the Honourable N.A. Brown, Q.C., M.P., Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs for Australia; the Honorable Raymond J. Donovan, Secretary of Labor for the United States; and Mr Ingemar Eliasson, Minister of Labour and Energy Affairs for Sweden. </PARA>
<PARA>I-GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR INCREASING EMPLOYMENT</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Ministers recognised that the process of recovery from the economic difficulties of the 1970s had been slow and is likely to be protracted in many countries. Unemployment in the OECD area as a whole is forecast to reach 28 1/2 million by the end of 1982, corresponding to 8 per cent of the total labour force, and to remain at that level until at least mid-1983. It is recognised that the extent and persistence of unemployment varies from one country to another. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Ministers expressed their deep concern about the human and social implications of the extremely grave economic and social problems induced by such high levels of unemployment. They expressed their firm determination to combat unemployment in the short and medium term and to contribute to speeding up the creation of jobs in various sectors of the economy, as well as a more even distribution of jobs among the working population. They underlined that such efforts could only be pursued with success in the framework of a concomitant and effective combat against inflation, as well as in the context of active international co-operation and open trading relationships, bearing in mind the conclusions of the OECD Council at Ministerial level. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. In seeking solutions to these problems, Ministers recognised that employment is affected both by factors common to all Member countries and by features special to individual countries. For all countries a better employment performance will inevitably be conditioned by a better economic performance, involving a wide range of macro-economic and labour market policies. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Ministers expressed their concern about high interest rates, but recognised the need to continue to fight against inflation, and to keep industrial costs in check, so as to contribute to the expansion of employment. In that context they noted the desirability for the parties to collective bargaining in many countries to take into account constraints on the growth of real incomes under present economic conditions, bearing in mind the need for maintaining an equitable distribution of income. This together with appropriate action to contain non-wage labour costs and social benefits, would foster productive investments. It will also enable governments, where appropriate, more readily to take measures to accelerate the pace of economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Having regard to both the challenge and potential of technological progress Ministers stressed the need for the creation of sufficient new jobs to absorb the growing labour force and reduce present levels of unemployment. They regarded the encouragement of investment as an essential basis for employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Ministers emphasized that labour market policies are an important form of investment, notably those which improve the quality of human capital, productivity and mobility of the labour force. There was a clear need for such labour market policies to augment the productive potential of the OECD economies and thereby to promote non-inflationary growth. Quite as important as the question of more resources is the reallocation and effective management of existing resources, given constraints on the growth of public expenditure. Ministers also emphasized that expenditure cuts should not undermine those social programmes which they deemed essential for social solidarity in difficult times. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Ministers agreed that the success of policies to combat unemployment would depend, to a considerable extent, on active co-operation by working people and employers. Realism about trade-offs between wages, social benefits and employment-creating investment is necessary if a sustained recovery leading to higher levels of employment is to be achieved. They therefore welcomed the frank and positive discussions which took place in the consultations with trade unions (Trade Union Advisory Committee) and employers (Business and Industry Advisory Committee) prior to the meeting, and agreed that it was important in the present economic and social situation to promote a climate of co-operation between governments, employers' organisations and trade unions, both nationally and internationally; to improve the quality of information exchanged between the parties; and in other ways to help to create the conditions for an effective social dialogue within firms and in society at large. </PARA>
<PARA>II-THE ROLE OF LABOUR MARKET AND SOCIAL POLICIES</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Bearing in mind the above fundamental conditions and constraints, Ministers agreed that employment, manpower and social policies had an important role to play, in the short as well as medium term, in efforts to achieve:</PARA>
<PARA> sustained non-inflationary growth as a basis for returning to full employment;</PARA>
<PARA> labour market flexibility so as to facilitate positive adjustment to rapid structural change;</PARA>
<PARA> a more equitable distribution of employment opportunities;</PARA>
<PARA> adequate standards of social protection, whilst ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of social policies;</PARA>
<PARA> a climate of co-operation between working people, employers and governments. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Recognising the differences between Member countries in the methods used to solve their problems, they agreed that Member countries should consider and, where appropriate, develop national policies in the following areas, whilst at the same time respecting the need for international co-operation in economic, labour market and social policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Assisting a Non-Inflationary Recovery</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Ministers noted the efforts of several Member countries to introduce a variety of policy measures to fight unemployment, including comprehensive employment plans. They agreed that the emphasis should now, wherever possible, be on measures to underpin a non-inflationary economic recovery by reducing industrial costs and encouraging investment, and particularly on those to create new jobs and assist workers to adapt to new skills, new locations and growing sectors of the economy. The relative merits of specific tax-cuts, selective employment subsidies, incremental investment subsidies and the reform of payroll taxes were discussed. It was recognised that each country would need to design measures to meet its own economic and political circumstances, but also to avoid distortions in both national and international competition. Ministers also agreed that it is now important and timely to reinforce skill training programmes and to develop more flexible and responsive education and training arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Ministers discussed whether the big and growing expenditure on unemployment compensation could in some degree be more productively used to provide jobs and training for the unemployed, without however undermining its role as a safety- net. They recognised, however, that such measures would have in some cases a net cost. They agreed that it was worthwhile to discuss the merits of partly using these funds for training schemes to help the unemployed to get into new jobs; short-time work combined with partial unemployment compensation; temporary public jobs with a strong training element; subsidies for net additions to employment; and financial support for unemployed people who wish to create their own enterprise. </PARA>

<PARA> 13. Ministers considered the far-reaching employment implications of new patterns of economic growth resulting from structural change of an economic, technological and social nature. They agreed that it is highly important to ensure that the employment potential of new patterns of economic growth is fully exploited as part of a medium-term policy for returning to full employment. For that reason public authorities should give some priority to the employment effects of policies for which they have a major responsibility such as energy, technology development, transportation, urban renewal and community social services. This could be accomplished either through direct public investment or support to private investment. More generally, taxation and the composition of public expenditure have significant employment effects, and should be taken into account in decisions. In some countries, public authorities are exploring ways and means of stimulating efficient, small-scale business enterprises on a local or regional basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The Redistribution of Working Time</PARA>
<PARA> 14. Large-scale unemployment has raised the question in some countries whether those employed could not work less in order to permit the unemployed to work more. This is not only a question of lower weekly hours, but whole range of possible measures such as early retirement, longer holidays, restrictions on over-time work, shared jobs and part-time work. Ministers underlined that where the redistribution of working time takes place, it should be achieved without increasing production costs, so as to avoid harmful inflationary and employment consequences. Such a non-inflationary approach could be facilitated if workers have a wider range of choices for trading-off leisure against income. A more ambitious objective in some countries could be that, on grounds of solidarity with the unemployed, workers and their representatives would opt for taking substantial parts of achieved productivity gains in the form of leisure and improved working conditions rather than real income. If reductions in working time were implemented they should permit a more flexible use of both capital and labour, thereby improving enterprise efficiency and labour market flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. Ministers saw this as a very complex question and some of them expressed caution about the feasibility of worksharing in their countries. Some strongly emphasized that because economic circumstances, productivity growth and technical production requirements vary substantially from sector to sector, any redistribution of working time will need to be developed through collective bargaining and on an industry and enterprise basis. However, a number of Ministers pointed to the need for national policy guidelines so as to avoid inequities between sectors and others to the need for studying the possibilities of internationally co-ordinating such measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Promoting a Dynamic, Flexible and Efficient Labour Market</PARA>
<PARA> 16. Ministers recognised that slow growth had weakened the propensity of workers to change jobs, regions and occupations, and of firms to invest. Despite this, they stressed that it was vital for structural adjustments to changing economic, technological and trade conditions to be actively pursued and they discussed possible impediments to labour market adjustment of some labour market policies. A number of possible measures to support adjustment were considered: more active involvement of workers and employers in the process of change, including profit-sharing in some countries; more extensive and flexible vocational education and training, involving systematic co-operation between education and labour market authorities and the social partners; measures to reinforce labour mobility within and between firms, in balance with policies to foster capital flows into labour-surplus areas, e.g. by establishing enterprise zones, and by improving housing conditions. Ministers recognised the key role of public employment services in providing up-to-date labour market information, counselling and placement services. They also stressed the importance of the employment services in assisting employers to improve personnel practices and in adapting employment and manpower policies and programmes to local conditions in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. Ministers discussed the rapid growth of temporary and precarious jobs which resulted, in part, from high unemployment and growing non-wage labour costs. Some Ministers expressed the view that labour markets sharply segmented between a rigid, highly protected sector and a flexible and insecure sector are socially undesirable and a source of growing inequality. This underlines the need not only to achieve more flexibility in the labour market, but also combat the undesirable aspects of certain employment practices. </PARA>
<PARA>Sharing the Burden of Economic Slack</PARA>
<PARA> 18. Ministers stressed the particular seriousness of youth unemployment and underlined the importance of assisting the proper and equal integration of young men and women into society and the labour market. They recognised the important role to be played by education and training. Ministers discussed the relative merits of private v. public training and the appropriate level of remuneration for trainees. They noted the commitment of some countries to a ''youth guarantee '' whereby unemployed young people are guaranteed an offer of training and work experience as soon as possible after leaving school and becoming unemployed. They also agreed on the need to ensure adequate provision for young adults who are experiencing special difficulties in securing stable employment. Some Ministers stressed the need to encourage more realism in the setting of wage rates for young people. Others underlined the importance of a system combining work and training so as to facilitate the transition of young people into the labour market before they become eligible for adult wages. </PARA>
<PARA> 19. Ministers also reaffirmed the commitment of their governments to the OECD Declaration of April 1980 on the employment of women which emphasized that governments should ''adopt employment policies which offer men and women equal employment opportunity, independently of the rate of economic growth and conditions in the labour market''. Such policies are particularly necessary in a period of slow growth in those countries where women are disproportionately represented among the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. Ministers felt that due attention should be given to help, according to national circumstances, those groups which are particularly vulnerable to long- term unemployment, notably ethnic minorities, the disabled, older workers including women re-entering the work force. However, Ministers stressed that in order to avoid merely transferring employment problems from one group to another , policies increasing overall employment have to be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. Ministers agreed that migration between OECD countries, particularly within Europe, had helped and, in a balanced and equitable form, could continue to assist the promotion of dynamic and flexible labour markets. It was noted that foreign workers and their families should not be allowed to become a reserve of insecure labour simply to compensate for increasing labour market rigidities. They emphasized the importance of economic and social integration measures particularly for women and second-generation youth, and their co-ordination with other manpower and social policies. Taking into account the difficulties of less industrialised Member countries, Ministers emphasized that one of the conditions supporting the voluntary return of migrants is economic development and employment creation in the countries of origin, as well as maintaining the cultural and linguistic identity of their children. Ministers agreed that continued co-operation between the Member countries concerned would help to assure a better concertation of policies on migratory movements. </PARA>
<PARA>Improving the Interaction between Social Policy, the Economy and Labour Markets</PARA>
<PARA> 22. Sluggish econonic growth has placed an increasing burden on the provision of social services and benefits, in particular unemployment benefits, and at the same time constrained the resources to finance expenditure on social welfare. These developments have led to the political debate about whether the continued growth of social benefits can be afforded, whether social policies are efficient in achieving their goals, and whether desirable market incentives to save, invest and work are being helped or hindered by the side effects of social policies. Ministers agreed that there was a common will to recognise the human costs of economic and social change, and to ease the financial and personal burdens on individuals. Social and labour market programmes were even more necessary under conditions of low growth and rapid structural change. It was also recognised by some countries that there was a need for redrawing of priorities, for efficient management and for adequate level of social benefit. This was not only a matter of national solidarity, but also of decentralisation in some countries where feasible, so as to harness the energy and imagination of local communities. </PARA>
<PARA> 23. Recognising the need to achieve a balance between equity and efficiency, Ministers discussed the unintended labour market effects of a variety of social measures, reaching the conclusion that there is no definite evidence as to the nature and size of distortions. However, reforms are desirable and being made in some of these measures, in accordance with national conditions and needs, so as to sharpen their effectiveness. Some countries relying heavily on payroll taxes for financing social security, are considering modifications to alleviate the cost to enterprises. Some Ministers noted that job security and minimum wage provisions, while designed to protect the majority of workers, can act to exclude weak groups, like youth and women, from employment, expecially when there are insufficient employment opportunities. They also felt that while the level and duration of benefits for the unemployed should be adequate, they should encourage, not inhibit, the search for and acceptance of available and suitable jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>Strengthening Consultation and Dialogue between Workers, Employers and Governments</PARA>
<PARA> 24. While the methods and content of consultation and dialogue would differ between countries, Ministers agreed that it could help to create the conditions for a resumption of non-inflationary employment growth nationally and in the OECD area as a whole. It was agreed that consultation and dialogue could include a wide range of topics including many of those discussed above. </PARA>
<PARA>III-FURTHER WORK OF THE MANPOWER AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE</PARA>
<PARA>25. During the meeting it was suggested that the future work of the Manpower and Social Affairs Committee should reflect not only the areas of work and priorities which emerged at the meeting, but also, within the framework of the Programme of Work and Budget of the Organisation, the following issues;</PARA>
<PARA> (i) measures to promote the access of women to the labour force;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the effectiveness and efficiency of selective labour market interventions;</PARA>

<TITLE>The Economic Context</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The discussion by Employment Ministers of the conditions for employment growth inevitably moved into the wider area of economic policy. The priority to be given to the control of inflation at a time of high and rising levels of unemployment was closely examined.</PARA>
<PARA> This discussion is significant in the light of the policies being pursued by the Australian Government. The communique records the view of OECD Ministers that efforts to combat unemployment can only be pursued successfully in the framework of an effective anti-inflationary policy. Active international co- operation and open trading relations were also identified as other fundamental conditions for success in defeating unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> The control of inflation is fundamental to the economic policies of this Government. OECD Ministers have confirmed that that is the only way to defeat unemployment. Australia is on the right track in creating the conditions for a reduction in unemployment. It is the only way of defeating unemployment and we will not defeat it until all sections of the community come to accept this basic fact. Substantially, this means that we must keep control over our wage costs. Both the direct cost of wages and salaries and the costs that come from shorter working hours and industrial disputes. There should now be no doubt in anyone's mind that if wage costs escalate and do so too quickly, employment will suffer. There should be no doubt in anyone's mind that we have seen in Australia exactly that situation. We have seen successive wage increases, both in direct wages and salaries and in the cost of shorter working hours and the cost of industrial disputes. We have seen all of that followed by increased unemployment. We will defeat unemployment when those responsible for it stop pricing workers out of the market.</PARA>
<PARA> OECD Ministers have recognised this and expressed their concern. I trust that all sections of the Australian community accept this timely warning and act accordingly. Ministers were quite specific about this. Thus the communique contains the following statement which makes this quite clear:</PARA>
<PARA> Ministers expressed their concern about high interest rates, but recognised the need to continue to fight against inflation and to keep industrial costs in check, so as to contribute to the expansion of employment.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that need will be widely recognised in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Unless wage increases and claims for shorter working hours are restrained and unless industrial disputes are greatly reduced, the outlook for employment in this country will be very bleak. This should concern not only the unemployed but also young people who have yet to enter the labour market, those who have jobs but whose job security cannot now be guaranteed and indeed the whole community. To put it bluntly, unemployment in Australia will probably increase if, as a nation, we continue to price ourselves out of jobs by inflated wage costs, by the increased costs of shorter working hours and by the costs of industrial disputes. There must be restraint and that restraint must be shown by those who make the claims and those who grant them: By trade unions, employers and industrial tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA> This is an appropriate time to say that my experience of the OECD meeting, and the associated consultations with the Trade Union Advisory Committee that preceded it, suggest that Australian trade union leaders would do well to strengthen their links with their overseas counterparts, and should participate in OECD-related discussions. it is unfortunate that the Australian trade union movement did not have the benefit of direct participation with employment Ministers at this conference. Australian employers were represented at the pre- conference consultations and by their representative took an active part in proceedings. I believe that Australian trade unions would have a better understanding of the wider issues affecting employment if they were to take part in these consultations and I would urge them to do so in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be a much greater degree of awareness in the union movement in Europe and the United States of America of the economic consequences of excessive wage increases and other labour costs than there is in Australia. It is little wonder that overseas investors and traders are increasingly looking askance at the behaviour of Australian unions, when considering the prospects of trading with Australia or establishing businesses here. Overseas investors and traders could be excused for thinking that the Australian trade union movement is either ignorant of the economic consequences of its actions or does not care about them.</PARA>
<PARA> A final related point that should be made on the economic issues covered by the conference is the recognition by OECD Ministers of the need to recognise investment as an essential basis for employment growth. This view again supports the policy of this Government to encourage investment and by that means generate employment.</PARA>
</PROCTEXT>
</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1326">
<TITLE>Youth in the Labour Market</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The second key area of the ministerial meeting relates to the problems faced by disadvantaged groups in the labour market. This discussion focused particularly on the problems faced by young people, in the context of the OECD secretariat forecast that youth unemployment could reach 17 per cent in the area by 1983. In recognising the seriousness of the youth unemployment problem, Ministers canvassed a number of policy approaches through which young people might be assisted. There was ready acceptance of the important role of education and training, a role which this Government has implemented by the School to Work Transition Program, the Special Youth Employment Training Program and related measures. There was also concern expressed about the level of youth wages, relative to those earned by adults.</PARA>
<PARA> Training opportunities for young people was an area of wide discussion. The dual system of training used in Germany, Austria and Switzerland received special attention in the debate and it is probably not insignificant that those countries have low rates of youth unemployment. The dual system combines schooling and on-the-job training and work experience in a wide range of occupations. After the conference I was able to examine the situation at first hand in West Germany. After doing that I consider that the dual system is well worth serious consideration for possible implementation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The role of the education system in preparing young people for entering the labour force was an area of discussion which I was particularly pleased to foster. The need to integrate better the efforts of the compulsory education system with post-school training and work experience schemes was fully recognised in discussion. The specific and substantial problems of youth unemployment were therefore recognised at the conference and there was a special commitment to tackle this serious economic and social problem. I hope there is no doubt about the Australian Government's commitment to that cause because it is genuine and unqualified.</PARA>
</PROCTEXT>
</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1326">
<TITLE>Apprenticeship and Skills Training</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This leads me to the third area of the meeting to which I wish to draw honourable members' attention. The maximisation of training opportunities for young people is heavily dependent on the capacity and flexibility of the training system itself. With the rigidities of the Australian apprenticeship system in my mind, I raised the need for reforms in the training system to ensure that training is consistent with the aspirations of young people and the requirements of employers. As the communique indicates, Ministers accepted this theme and agreed that skill training programs should be reinforced; and, that more flexible and responsive education and training arrangements should be developed. This, of course, includes where appropriate the provision of opportunities for training and retraining for adults, as well as for young people.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this international encouragement to reform is followed through in Australia in co-operation with trade unions, employers and State government authorities who have the principal reponsibility for the apprenticeship laws of this country. The scene for this work has been set by the work which the Commonwealth and States have done over the last 18 months following the report of the Departments of Labour Advisory Committee on prospective demand for and supply of skilled labour 1980-83 with particular reference to major development projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a very real need to modernise our training methods, and to enlarge the range of occupations for which training is available. This will not only provide a better capacity for economic growth but will particularly help the present unemployed and future school leavers to acquire skills and so enhance their job prospects.</PARA>
<PARA> I should like to add that it is really no exaggeration to say that the apprenticeship system in Australia today is quite antique and is in need of very substantial reform. Firstly, there is a need for far more scope for adults to undertake apprenticeships. Secondly, there is a need to relate the term of the apprenticeship more directly to the skill being acquired rather than simply slavishly following a fixed term for an apprenticeship. A third area of reform which is one to which my Department has given particular interest and attention is to encourage more female apprentices because the apprenticeship system in Australia is still one that is almost exclusively confined to young men as a vehicle for training.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that with this international encouragement that has come from the OECD Ministers' conference, an encouragement to look for flexibility in training, we can now go forward in a bipartisan way and try to introduce some of these reforms into the apprenticeship system of this country.</PARA>
<PARA> The meeting of OECD Employment Ministers was a very valuable one. I am pleased that I had the opportunity to participate in the meeting as Australia's representative. The Government is encouraged by the broad support which the meeting gave to its policies to encourage employment growth and reduce unemployment. Many other matters emerging from the conference should provide material for stimulating debate in Australia. Finally, I place on record the assistance I obtained from our Ambassador to the OECD, Mr Humphreys, and members of his Embassy staff and the assistance of Mr J. Bowdler, First Assistant Secretary to the Department, whose contribution to the conference and particularly to the work of the drafting committee was of very great value indeed. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA> OECD Employment Ministers Meeting-Ministerial Statement, 24 March 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Nixon) proposed:</PARA>
<PARA> That the House take note of the paper.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is at the outset a point with which I can concur wholeheartedly with the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown), who has just spoken; that is when he said in his speech that the communique from the meeting which he recently attended was a significant document and he commended it to the attention of honourable members. I agree with that statement. But one must say that, whilst the Minister has been a good messenger in bringing back the document, he has been somewhat perverted in his interpretation of what in fact happened at that meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to spend the very brief time that is available to me in looking dispassionately at the communique which came from the meeting rather than, as I say, at the somewhat perverted version which has been given to the House by the Minister. If we look at the document we will find that the Ministers gave a very balanced view of those factors and considerations which should be taken into account if we are to address ourselves to what is, admittedly, one of the very serious problems facing this community and, indeed, facing all other communities in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development area. I refer to the general issue of unemployment and, in particular-the Minister alluded to this and the ministerial meeting gave attention to it-the matter of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> As distinct from the attempt by the Minister to concentrate wholly upon trade unions, excessive wage claims and industrial disputes-they monopolised his statement-if we look at the communique we find, as I said, a very balanced approach to these issues. Therefore, rather than my addressing myself directly to the Minister's statement, it seems much more sensible to turn to the communique. If one does that one finds that the Ministers, after indicating the magnitude of the problem confronting the OECD-28,500,000 people, a figure of enormous magnitude, are expected to be unemployed in the OECD area by the end of 1982-directed themselves to the sorts of things which need to be taken into account in trying to think of solutions to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> At the very beginning of the communique, in paragraph 3, there is reference to the need, within an overall framework of approach to this issue, to think about 'the creation of jobs in various sectors of the economy'. Those are the exact words used. It is a matter of very keen interest to us, on this side of the House, that as we go through the communique, we find in various paragraphs specific reference to the need for governments to look at and to seriously consider undertaking specific job creation programs. We of the Opposition say that because there has been an attempt by the Minister and the Government to pooh-pooh this question of specific job creation programs. I repeat what I have had cause to say before: If the Minister looks at the analyses that were done by his Department in 1977 in regard to the Regional Employment Development scheme that operated in this country he will see that whilst criticisms were made of that scheme, and legitimate criticisms, the analyses suggest that basically the problems were administrative and that when job creation programs are undertaken in the context of an overall macro-economic approach they can, as the experience of a number of European countries has shown, make a positive contribution to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I plead with the Minister not to close his mind to the positive place that job creation programs can have. I should think his discussions with the Ministers when he was in Paris would have led him to the conclusion that there is a place for them but they should not be looked at as panaceas, as answers by themselves. They should be seen as having the capacity to play a part, within a general macro-economic approach, in reducing the economic and social problems of unemployment. I plead with the Minister not to take some blinkered ideological position on this issue but instead to ascertain from his Department whether in fact there is not in this country, as there has been in other countries of the OECD, a positive place for these programs. As I have said on occasions, the resources of this side of the House are available in a co-operative and constructive way to look at those sorts of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I go from the opening paragraphs of the ministerial communique to look at other issues that are mentioned in the statement. In paragraph 4 of the communique the point is made by the ministerial spokesmen that if one looks at this phenomenon of unemployment in the Western world one will see that there are certain features of it which are common to all the countries concerned and that there are features which, as they say, are special to individual countries. They say:</PARA>
<PARA> For all countries a better employment performance will inevitably be conditioned by a better economic performance, involving a wide range of macro- economic and labour market policies. </PARA>
<PARA>It is in that sense that I would again plead with the Minister and the Government to understand that it is of no use just bleating as they have done for the best part of seven years and saying: 'Our policy on this issue from Alpha to Omega is to fight inflation. Let us fight inflation. If we beat it, we are going to cure the unemployment problem'. It is simply not enough to utter words like that. It is to be hoped that the experience of the Minister in discussions with these other Ministers in Paris and in informal discussions will have brought home to him that Ministers in other countries understand that concern with inflation is important but if governments are to discharge their obligations to the community it is not enough just to parrot cries about fighting inflation. Governments have to undertake quite specific packages of policies which include labour market policies if they are to address themselves effectively to this question. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me nail at the outset the proposition which tends to fall from the lips of the Minister and other spokesmen for the Government that nothing can be done. The experience of certain countries in the OECD area has shown that in fact one can get a much better position in regard to unemployment rates than anything like the average for the OECD or this country. For instance, I would like to compare the unemployment rates in Austria and Sweden with the rates in Australia from 1976 until 1981. In Australia in 1976 the unemployment rate was 4.7 per cent. In Austria it was 1.8 per cent and in Sweden it was 1.6 per cent. In 1977 the unemployment rate in Australia was 5.6 per cent. In Austria it was 1.6 per cent and in Sweden it was 1.8 per cent. In 1978 the unemployment rate in Australia was 6.2 per cent. In Austria it was 2.1 per cent and in Sweden it was 2.2 per cent. In 1979, the rate in Australia was 6.2 per cent; in Austria it was 2.1 per cent; and in Sweden it was 2.1 per cent. In 1980, Australia's rate was 6 per cent; in Austria it was 1.9 per cent; and in Sweden it was 2 per cent. For 1981, the average for the first three quarters for Australia was 5.5 per cent; for Austria, for the first three quarters, it was 2.4 per cent; and for Sweden, for the same period, it was 2.3 per cent. I read those figures to show that it is simply not true to say that, if governments direct themselves in a comprehensive way to the problems associated with unemployment and see that it requires an approach which does not concentrate on inflation alone but includes proper job creation programs as part of an overall labour market policy, in the context of appropriate macro-economic policies, they cannot do something about this problem. Those figures prove that it can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> To show the quite partisan nature of the Minister's statement, one only has to turn to that part of his speech in which he talked about the question of costs which arise out of wage increases and the like. He said that Ministers were quite specific about this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Thus the communiqu'e contains the following statement which makes this quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA>He quoted, and this was his quotation:</PARA>
<PARA> Ministers expressed their concern about high interest rates but recognised the need to continue to fight against inflation and to keep industrial costs in check so as to contribute to the expansion of employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Having quoted that part, the Minister then built his thesis about how the unions alone, virtually, were responsible for inflation and, therefore, for prejudicing employment opportunities. It would have been good if the Minister had had the decency to read the whole of the paragraph. If he had done so, his thesis would have fallen to the ground, because that paragraph, paragraph 5 of the OECD Ministers' communiqu'e, went on. Let me read the rest of the paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA> It said:</PARA>
<PARA> In that context they noted the desirability for the parties to collective bargaining in many countries to take into account constraints on the growth of real incomes under present economic conditions bearing in mind the need for maintaining an equitable distribution of income. This, together with appropriate action to contain non-wage labour costs and social benefits, would foster productive benefits. It will also enable governments, where appropriate, more readily to take measures to accelerate the pace of economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> All that we get is the reading out of the impact of wage costs. What the Ministers were concerned to talk about was not simply the impact of wage costs. That has an importance; I am not denying that. But at least they were broadminded enough to take account of the other considerations. However, what does this Government do in terms of the instruments readily available to it to do something about the equitable distribution of income? I remind the House of what the Government does with a very specific instrument of taxation which is available. In terms of fundamental economic analysis, one must understand that, if we are talking about wages and wage increases, for God's sake let us not be myopic about wages and think of them as one-dimensional. To hear members in this House and Ministers of this Government talking, one would think that wages were to be seen only as a cost. Certainly they are a cost, but I have been trying for years to get it into the minds of conservative governments and conservative Ministers that one does not undertake proper economic analysis if one thinks of wages simply in one-dimensional terms. At one and the same time as wages are a cost, the impact of which needs to be taken into account, they are also an income. A wage is at one and same time a cost and an income. If we talk about it just in one-dimensional terms and emphasise the cost element of wages, one has not undertaken one's task properly. </PARA>
<PARA> We must remember that, for the great majority of Australians, wages are the only source of income. If the real purchasing power and the real value of wages are allowed to decline, people will not be able to purchase the output of our factories, of our employers, gathered together. The interests of this country are properly to be seen not just in analysing wages as a cost. I am not trying to deny that we must take account of that. But as I said, for God's sake at the same time we must also understand the economic significance not only for employees but also for employers and manufacturers of the importance of maintaining the purchasing power of the people of this community. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another way. We do not have to look at wages only in terms of money wages and their relevance to this question of purchasing power. One action which is available to government to affect the real disposable income of people in this country is to see what can be done about taxes, in terms of the wording of this communique, about equitable distribution of income. But this Government has taken the opposite course of equity and of good economic sense by imposing through its period in office an increasing burden, in terms of tax, upon wage and salary earners. I quickly in the brief time I have give the aggregate figures available. Between 1975-76 and 1981-82, total tax receipts will have gone up by 124 per cent. But, within that period, pay-as-you-earn taxation receipts will have jumped by 146 per cent while non pay-as-you-earn tax receipts will have gone up by only 109 per cent. In aggregate terms, that is merely a reflection of the fact that this Government has deliberately, by way of taxation , taken a bigger bite out of wages and salaries and in that way has reduced the equity of the distribution of income in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 30 seconds or so I have left I make the point that this communique says that it is very important to maintain the availability of a whole range of statistics which show the overall and geographical position in regard to employment and unemployment. This Government, by abolishing the Commonwealth Employment Service statistics, deliberately took away that instrument from itself. Overall, the document of the ministers is a very valuable document. I believe if people look at it in its totality they will see the pointing of the paths which can be taken in a constructive way with the emphasis the Ministers place upon the need for co-operation within the community. This Government does not foster co-operation; it fosters confrontation. </PARA>

I am sure that the Minister 's contribution to the conference was a most significant one and I am sure we will find not only the communique but also the other information that the Minister would have brought back to Australia to be of increasing value to this country and to the Government in planning various policy propositions in the future that will affect our employment levels. Having said that, I must admit that I was somewhat confused at the contribution just made by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke).</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I was. I listened with a great deal of interest and I tried to understand it from a layman's point of view. I must admit I was left completely in the dark. The last statement made by the honourable member for Wills was that wages should not just be seen in one dimension, that wages are both a cost and an income. That is very true. If I understood him, he seemed to imply that wages should be seen in the income context as part of the spending power within the community. I can understand the honourable member for Wills putting forward that proposition. During his time with the Australian Council of Trade Unions he consistently put that proposition to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It struck me at the time he put that proposition on behalf of the ACTU-and even now-that he failed to understand that if the cost element of wages becomes outlandish then there is no income because the person is not working. That, I think, is where the argument of the honourable member for Wills completely comes unstuck. If the cost element becomes so great the employer goes bankrupt, then there is no job; there is no income. That is the end result of the ever escalating impact of wages. We must clearly understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not dispute the statement by the honourable member for Wills that the two- dimensional impact of wages needs to be taken into account. I agree with him on that point. But we must also recognise the capacity of the employer to pay. That consideration must be taken into account because clearly in Australia the majority of employment is provided by what we might loosely call small business, by small employers; not large multinationals. Whilst wages in this country may be fixed to suit the economics of the large corporate factories and companies, that arrangement does not suit the small employer who does not have the same capacity to pay. The only way he can remain in business is by shedding some of his workers. That is where we get to the root of unemployment. I think it is rather fatuous of the honourable member for Wills to say that wage costs do not have an impact on unemployment. Clearly they do. I agree with the claim by the honourable member for Wills that wages are not the only impact on employment. He is quite right in that respect. But in saying that, we should not fatuously dismiss the idea that wages do not have a most significant impact on the unemployment problem in Australia, particularly in the small business area. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other things that the honourable member for Wills claimed-I think this may have been mentioned in the communique from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development conference-was that governments in fact should embark on job creation schemes. The honourable member in his contribution referred to the former Regional Employment Development scheme which was in operation under the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975. The honourable member for Wills quite rightly said that that scheme in fact was discredited during this term, that there were great difficulties with it and therefore it had to be abandoned. I think what also needs to be understood--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do apologise, but this was clearly understood. As I said, I am a layman trying to undertand an academic. I clearly tried to understand the honourable member but I am a layman, not an academic. I freely admit that. We need to understand that if it is suggested that governments should embark on job creation schemes per se what is being said is that governments should raise taxes so that money can be made available to create jobs in some form or other. The fundamental experience of the RED scheme was that in the course of raising taxes to enable governments to create jobs such pressure was put on the private sector, particularly the small business sector, that workers had to be laid off. What we were doing on the one hand was trying to employ people through government job creation schemes and on the other hand putting such pressure on the private sector that for every job created two were lost in the private sector. That is not an advancement; that is going backwards. That was the experience with the RED scheme. So clearly such a scheme does not work in a mixed economy such as exists in Australia. It may work in a socialist economic system where governments control the economy. But we have to remember at all times that roughly 75 per cent of employees in Australia are employed by the private sector and pressure cannot be put on the private sector in order to create jobs in the government sector. If we do that we lose out in the long run because more people will be put off in the private industry sector. That point must be borne in mind at all times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills quite correctly mentioned in his contribution that in Austria the current rate of unemployment is around 2.4 per cent which is very creditable to that country. In January of this year I too was in Austria and was most intrigued as to how that country achieved a rate of 2.4 per cent in unemployment, particularly when it had large numbers of people coming across the borders from communist countries, in particular from Poland. I also inquired of the Government officials I was talking to as to why their rate of unemployment was so low and their rate of productivity so high. Government officials I talked to explained to me that they simply could not remember when they last had a strike. They thought it was somewhere in the early 1950s but they could not remember when the last strike was. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the impact of industrial relations in this country is a major influence on the level of unemployment. It puts this country's market potential on international markets at a tremendous disadvantage. It is irresponsible of anyone in this Parliament or outside this Parliament to make a claim that it does not. If the level of industrial disputation in this country could be reduced, it must open up employment opportunities for more people. We should never lose sight of that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member need not worry; I will get to his point. Many of the industrial disputes in this country-this was mentioned in a debate here last week-relate to wage increases in one form or another. But, as Mr Frank Crean correctly identified, one man's wage increase is another man's job. At the moment, many unions are insisting increasingly on higher wage increases and in doing so they are forcing their work-mates out of the work force. Clearly, that is unacceptable. I agree with the honourable member for Wills-this was also mentioned in the Minister's statement-that governments have a very real responsibility to introduce policies that will put more of our people in the productive work force, but we also need to recognise that that responsibility is not just with governments alone. That responsibility must be shared equally by employers and the union movement, the various union organisations. They, too, have a responsibility and they cannot shed that responsibility by accusing the Government of being the reason for everyone's ills. That is not the case and it never can be. The Government has a responsibility to introduce policies that will help in training people and getting them into the work force. But so, too, do the unions and the employers have a responsibility to embark on policies that will have more people employed and not simply have those people who are employed receiving more money at the expense of others who cannot find a job. That is unacceptable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister, in his statement to the House, mentioned a number of things. I was pleased to hear him mention that one of the major policies that this Government has been following since it came to office has been the control of inflation. That is a key element in creating new employment positions and new investment in this country. The honourable member for Wills correctly pointed out that, while the control of inflation is an important element in economic management that will create new investment, it is not the only element. Other economic factors must also be taken into account, wages being a key one. That should never be forgotten. I was also delighted that the Minister made mention of the various training schemes that were being discussed at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development level. </PARA>

I was delighted to hear the Minister say not only that the Government is getting involved in trade apprenticeships young people who are leaving the school system and going into the work force for the first time but also that it is retraining other people. There are adults in apprenticeship training who are being retrained in other skills that are in demand or who at a late stage in life have a desire to learn a skilled trade. This is most creditable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the honourable member that we were in a hell of a mess in 1975 because at that stage we had inherited problems from an earlier government. The next element I would like to mention was not referred to in the Minister's statement but was in fact contained in the figures released by the Minister last week about unemployment in Australia. It is gratifying to note that in the previous year-1981-the employment rate in Australia increased by 102,000 over the year-an increase of 1.6 per cent, which is most creditable. It concerns me that over the year to January 1982 there was a decrease in teenage employment of 23,200 or 3.3. per cent. This is of most concern and I urge the Government, in looking at employment policies for the future, to give consideration to the factors that impinge upon young people getting into the work force for the first time. A considerable number of factors are involved. They include the standards and levels of education, the demands that are made on our young people, and the fact that full rates are paid at 18 years of age.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with the statement of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown), I would like to indicate, firstly , that any resemblance between the major thrust of the communique and the thrust that the Minister has placed on the issue in his statement is purely coincidental. The fact is that, in looking at the economic climate today and considering the very serious issue of unemployment in general, in particular youth unemployment, we have to place responsibility for the economic situation at large at the feet of the Government. Having had all the great programs that we have had since 1975 to transform the social and economic situation in Australia, having gone through the whole process of putting pressure on unions, bashing hell out of them day after day in this place, and having gone through all the restrictive and contractionary Budget strategies that one can imagine, what do we have in March of 1982?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Inflation is taking off and interest rates in Australia are higher in real terms, as has been pointed out, than those in any of the other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Unemployment is at the highest level ever recorded. Given the expected rate of economic growth over the next 12 months, we could be looking down the barrel at an unemployment rate in this country of 10 per cent. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) illustrated quite clearly the way in which, in that context, the communique has been twisted by the Minister in order to mislead people. He will not succeed. The honourable member for Wills gave, to the extent it was possible to do so, a balanced view of the situation in the light of the communique, which I too have read. </PARA>
<PARA> The process which ought to be undertaken in order to try to come to grips with unemployment in general and, very importantly, youth unemployment, involves a number of factors. It is no good for the Minister to say that he will follow dogmatically a program of putting his faith in private enterprise in the belief that that will solve the unemployment ills of this country; it will not. In a moment I will demonstrate that the debates which have taken place over a number of years have clearly indicated that other aspects should be considered. For example, a major contribution should be made by the public sector. We have looked at employment growth in the economic context. The Government's programs are worsening the situation. As has been pointed out, any advance upon a growth expectancy of one per cent will be a bonus. If that is to be the case, the unemployment situation will become disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of the youth labour market. Again, the Minister has talked about school-to-work transition programs and we have been reminded of the expectations of young people under all of the schemes that have come and gone since 1975. Before the Minister snuck out of the country, he put the axe to certain programs, such as the Community Youth Support Scheme which, although they were not the total answer to the problem, were valuable. Nevertheless, they went by the board. The Minister is shaking his head. I point out that the Aboriginal CYSS scheme in any electorate, for instance, and others, have not been replaced. Children-Aboriginals and others-in the most disadvantaged areas of the country, upon leaving school suffer greatly as a consequence of the Minister's actions. He said that such projects would be replaced. They may be replaced in the sweet by and by but a gap will be left that will never be closed . So much for the sincerity of the Minister! Time after time he has carried out the union bashing exercise to which he is prone. He talks about close-knit union protection and unions projecting particular policies-although these, as the honourable member for Wills has outlined, are merely designed to overcome the economic disadvantages which flow from Government policies. At the same time, the Minister is a member of the legal profession, which is one of the most close -knit unions in the country. Before he came into the Parliament his standing in the legal profession would have netted him $300 a day. Yet he stands here blithely running the rule over unions which endeavour to maintain the gap between nominal and real wages. We have here a new Messiah who comes as a messenger boy from the OECD countries, knowing nothing about the industrial background in Australia and proposing that it be handled in a way that would be disastrous for the unemployed. I am sure that there must be other solutions of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Attention has been drawn to the reference in the communique to the economic cost of wage levels, but it also mentions other ways of obtaining labour market flexibility so as to facilitate a positive adjustment to rapid structural change . If that is to occur, we must have technical education at a higher level and use the resources available to us to cope with those changes. In 1965 the Minister's predecessor, Sir Phillip Lynch-who is now the Minister for Industry and Commerce-when Minister for Labour and National Service convened a meeting in Canberra to study education for work in industry and commerce. A blueprint was laid down. The Minister is shaking his head, but he should look at the blueprint that was laid down for the purpose of issuing a warning about the development of technical training in this country. Unions, employers and the Government agreed upon a blueprint to meet future industry requirements. Nothing has been done about it. The reason we are in diabolical trouble with technical training in this country is once again the fault of this Government, the Minister and his predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another matter that is directly related to the matters mentioned in the communique. The Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) referred rather blithely at Question Time to defence expenditure. He talked about offset programs and their being the saving grace of technical training in this country. He mentioned that 30 per cent of the work would be guaranteed to industry. That figure has been cited over the years. In 1980-81 we reached the amazing target of 8.6 per cent. So much for the 30 per cent offset policy! If nothing more dramatic happens in future the opportunity to develop technical training in this country will be once again lost. I put it to the Minister that one of this country's great facilities is the resources that we already have. The defence establishment and other areas of technical training provide a field in which apprentices and other trainees should have been developed over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has just been to the OECD countries. He has suddenly awakened. He has emerged from the darkness to project a view that has been held generally by anybody who has had anything to do with industrial relations over the last decade or so. He has projected the view that we should have been training people in the areas I have mentioned. I hope that the offset programs will be referred to Australia to undertake, as they should be. I refer not to the construction of concrete blocks for developments in the defence area, but to projects that will enable technicians to be so trained that we will not be at the mercy of overseas producers and people on whom we rely for our defence equipment. If they are not trained under those circumstances, we will lose our offset advantage by default. If we cannot obtain the technicians to carry out the work, we will not be able to do it. That is clearly the situation in some of the major technical areas at the moment. Recently I was present at a hearing at the Wagga Wagga Royal Australian Air Force base which concerned how technical training in the higher areas would be needed for the tactical fighters based in Darwin and the necessary maintenance of the equipment which will go hand in hand with it. The Air Force is madly rushing around trying to train people in those special areas. Unless that program is developed to a higher degree, we will be left to lament once again. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the hypocrisy about introducing women into the industry. In fact, 300 positions were vacant in the area. In the first year the intake was 110. Thirty positions were vacant, yet not one female was interviewed. Defence Force policy under those circumstances is not to have females in those highly technical areas. That is what we are told. We are also advised: 'Well, maybe the program will improve in the future'. I genuinely hope it will. If we are going to apply those sorts of principles to the development of apprenticeships in general and the inclusion of a range of people who are available, including females, we will have to do a lot better than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect was conveniently ignored by the Minister in what he had to say in once again heaping the blame on the unions. What the honourable member for Wills has said is correct, one cannot be isolated and narrow in one's thinking as to what areas are available for controlling the overall economic situation. Amongst other things, under the heading 'Improving the Interaction between Social Policy, the Economy and Labour Markets', the communique said:</PARA>
<PARA> Social and labour market programmes were even more necessary under conditions of low growth and rapid structural change. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say that there is a need for national solidarity. This Government can get national solidarity only if it is prepared to accept the unions on the same basis as it does the people whom it represents in this place. It is no good criticising organisations for not participating in the program. If the Government is here lambasting them day after day and heaping all the economic ills on their shoulders, then the Government will get the same repercussions from people in that area. If they are going to fall by the wayside economically, by virtue of the policies of the Government, more power to their arm if they are going to go out and fight for it. But there are other ways, if the Government is prepared to participate as a government in securing jobs by creating jobs. In the defence area, what is wrong with opening up the technical training areas for some of the migrant children here instead of going overseas and recruiting tradesmen for the same purpose? Surely there is an advantage in doing that. I am not opposed to bringing migrant tradesmen here but sons and daughters of migrants and Australians are falling by the wayside on the dole market, thrown aside, left to their own devices and ignored by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs while at the same time job opportunities go begging. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish the Minister would be more constructive about the communique. From what we have learnt about him, his attitude is par for the course. I hope the Government allows this debate to continue under different circumstances. A general statement ought to be made by the Minister so that all these issues of the training and the participation of the unions can be brought into this chamber. It is not good enough for the Minister to attend the conference like a school boy, run back here on his errand, deliver a communique which he misinterprets and then falsify the situation in this Parliament. Indeed, there needs to be co-operation; the Government will get that co-operation if it takes steps to co-operate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join with other honourable members who spoke this afternoon in saying something concerning the statement made earlier by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown). I commend the Minister for the statement. I believe it is a very comprehensive one and undoubtedly one which sets out the opinions of the Ministers from those Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries who attended the conference. I know that this afternoon certain criticisms and certain favourable remarks must be made within this debate in relation to Australia's economy, the unemployment situation within Australia and all the other factors that we believe concern us here so far as employment is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the interesting thing that the Minister said this afternoon is the fact that the other countries did, in principle, agree with the statement that he made today. In other words, they have expressed concern that there are a possible 17 million unemployed youth within the OECD countries. They acknowledged the fact that the problems we have in Australia are very similar to those being experienced in the other free countries. I do know a little bit about the European scene. I was there in 1979 when Europe generally was short of tradesmen. In fact, tradesmen-carpenters, engineers, plumbers, drainers and others-were receiving more than a teacher received because manufacturing industry, which was supported by the European Economic Community was going ahead . But apparently there has been a change. As we know, a change is taking place in Britain. Over the years Britain has run down. There are certain reasons for this. The problem today is getting those nationalised industries back into free enterprise so that they can expand their wings and employ the young English people. I think we ought to take note of what has happened in Britain. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in Japan with a delegation about a month ago. I want to say something about Japan because I believe it reflects upon Australia and the problems that we have. I think everybody knows that after the War Japan formed a new constitution-the constitution of 1946-which was based upon very democratic lines indeed. It is of interest to note that in Japan at present the inflation rate is only 4 per cent, interest rates are 6 per cent and unemployment is 2 per cent. If we ask the Japanese 'Why can you do this in your country and other countries cannot?', the answer they will give is: 'We have small government'. Free enterprise is doing the work. The railroads are practically all owned by free enterprise. Free enterprise is building roads. The government departments are small. They put their work out for people outside government to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even though the honourable member for Wills interjects that there is more government intervention in Japan than here, if he were to ask the Japanese what the effect of automation has been on their country they would reply that it has created more work. I ask honourable members to think of the opportunities that this country of ours has with our natural resources, with the abilities and the attributes that our workers have and with our primary industries. What an opportunity we have to expand our natural resources and our manufacturing industries to feed the world from the great soil that we have. What are we doing about it? I have never been a union basher at any stage of my 15 years or 16 years in the State and Federal Houses and I do not intend to be. I do not in my local Press condemn the unions for what they are doing, but I do appeal to Opposition members who sit here today, including the honourable member for Wills , who was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, to have a little bit of common sense. I appeal to them to have some reasoning as to where this country of ours stands and to accept the tremendous responsibilities we have to our people and to the people of overseas countries, including the Third World countries that the Opposition often talks about. Does the Opposition's sympathy lie with them or with the New South Wales electricity people-the 170-odd-who will not work and who put hundreds of thousands of people out of work in New South Wales at this very moment? None of the Opposition member's will say anything about that. What about the fellow workers of those men? I will not take the matter any further. But the facts are there and cannot be avoided if Australia and the Government is going to look from the practical point of view at what we are going to do to create work and to train young people in this very great country of ours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I sound another warning and go back to the Japanese situation once again. Japan is important to us. I believe Japan is our second biggest trader. It is important to our coal industry, our iron ore industry and our beef markets. We should go back and talk to the Japanese. Why, after 1974, did they start to find alternative methods of energy? It was simply because of the price of oil in the Middle East and simply because there was some doubt as to whether they were going to get the supply. So they looked to Australia for coal-steaming coal and coking coal-and iron ore. They looked to Australia for uranium and for liquefied petroleum gas supplies in the future. If the Government were to talk to the Japanese now, who, I know are very courteous, they would say: 'We want a reliable trading partner'. Is Australia reliable? Are we a reliable partner in trade with the Japanese, the Indonesians, the Americans or members of the European Economic Community? Is Australia a reliable trading partner when meat and natural resources cannot be loaded for export and when thousands of people are out of work because they are not permitted to work?</PARA>
<PARA> I hope this situation does not continue because the current markets for our natural resources may not be there in the years to come. Technology is such that today the Japanese are looking at building their motor car engines from ceramics . They have almost perfected that technique. They are building car bodies out of strengthened plastic. Last year Japan produced 20 per cent less steel. Let us think about this situation. This is all involved with the report presented by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. He went overseas to consult with other countries. There must have been times when the Minister was perturbed and when he sat back quietly and thought: 'These countries have massive populations, technologies and expanding manufacturing industries behind them. They have hundreds of years experience behind them. Yet Australia, with barely 200 years of experience, has the resources of people, soil and energy. We should be able to help these countries and we should be able to learn from their mistakes'. This is the important fact. We should be able to learn from mistakes made in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe a need exists for very close co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States, particularly in the field of technical and further education. A need exists for more co-operation between employers and employees, as was stated earlier. The employers should understand the need for tradesmen and the need for them to expand their own works. It is no use creating training opportunities within the community if there are no jobs for young people, whether they are male or female. There is no point in training people unless work is available. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to look at the educational side of this problem. We have to look at our technical colleges. If we examine the Commonwealth reimbursement figures to the States we will find that in the last few years the Commonwealth has greatly increased funding for technical and further education in the States. One has only to look at the figures to realise that there has been an upsurge in the provision of Commonwealth funds. I am not qualified to say whether, as the Minister himself indicated, this increase in funds is being used to provide the positive training we think should be encouraged. I am not qualified to say and many other members are not qualified to say whether the funds are being used in the right direction. The fact of the matter is that this situation must be examined. I have always felt that in the field of secondary education, those who want to go into a trade, to learn to work, should have the opportunity in their third, fourth, fifth and sixth years at school to attend a technical college, to go out on a farm or to go into an industry to find out what work really is about . In that way they could make up their own minds as to what work they want to do in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we must make sure that our technical training in Australia is proceeding along the right lines, that it is broad enough to envelop the men and women who want to become involved in it in the years to come. The work is available. Running hand in hand with this training must be the fact that we have to continue with our economic policy-I agree with it wholeheartedly-of encouraging the private sector to expand. Unfortunately in my electorate and in the bush today there is a very deep concern about where this country is going. There is deep concern because of the attitude of unions. That is a fact. People are concerned about the attitude of unions, their unreasonable demands and their wage demands. In New South Wales the other day the State coal miners were given a pay rise equivalent to $65 a week. This flowed on to the private mines throughout Australia. The Japanese and other people who import our goods will say, 'We can buy cheaper goods elsewhere. We have better facilities in Queensland and New South Wales.' These are important points. We have to appreciate what the situation is.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us not overlook the fact that a number of training and retraining schemes are available today not only to young people but also to middle-aged people the community. The Commonwealth Employment Service provides lists of the training or retraining schemes available. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, who is responsible for this area, knows that such lists are available now. However, some of the technical colleges which are the responsibility of the States do not have the facilities-because of lack of accommodation or for other reasons are unable to accommodate these particular demands. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Community Youth Support Scheme was criticised a while ago. I believe that CYSS, as it has been rejuvenated, is a much better scheme. Not only can young people go to centres to talk to each other, to talk about employment, to talk about other factors or to learn some kind of trade but also they go there now in co-operation with the CES. They train and they direct themselves towards employment in industry. I come from a country town and I believe that from the businessman's point of view and from the point of view of persons involved in industry that there will be much greater co-operation with CYSS than there was previously. I do not condem it. I will co-operate with the scheme because I believe that it will do a great deal to encourage and direct young people into trades. We must not be critical of our younger generation. I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the House are not critical of our younger generation. We have a wonderful group of young people in Australia, young people who are better educated and who are deeply concerned about the work they will do in their future lives. They are our future mothers and fathers in the community. They want to rear families and to have a better Australia. These are the people who I believe we have to encourage. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, we have to approach this whole matter in a very commonsense way. Let this be a start. I say to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) and honourable members on both sides of the House: Let us take note of the experience of the Minister, what he has seen and what he has reported to us from overseas. Let us have a look at our retraining programs. Let us have a look at the direction in which technical and further education is going. Let the unions examine themselves and adopt responsible attitudes today. Unions should not keep men out of work; they should encourage men to work and co-operate. There should be general co-operation between employers and employees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs ( Mr N.A. Brown) has tabled in the House today the communique from his trip overseas to attend a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. He said that it was a significant document and he commended it to the attention of honourable members. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I turn now to consider the three main issues referred to in the communique. These are: The economic context for employment growth; the position of youth in the labour market; and the capacity of education and training systems to meet manpower requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to take issue with the three points that he has raised in the context of the Government's position. I refer firstly to the economic context for employment growth. We all know that if ever a country should be in a position to be able to take advantage of great benefits, it should be Australia. The Fraser Government over the last five years since it came to power has been the recipient of a taxation boom which no other government in the world has been able to achieve. I refer to the petrol levy which has returned this Government each year in excess of $3,000m. The Minister indicated that he was going to talk about the economic context for employment growth. What he meant, of course, was a framework of effective anti-inflationary policies. He said that Australia is on the right track in creating the conditions for a reduction in unemployment. The Government has been saying that for six years but we are seeing very little evidence of that occurring, particularly when we consider that, as I said, this Government has had the greatest opportunity of any government to put those types of statements into practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the policies of the Government. Its approach to the economy is directly related to unemployment because it is definitely using unemployment as an economic weapon. In the fight against inflation, as in all wars, the Government has sent the 18-year-olds, the young people, to the front first. We have had a tremendous increase in unemployment, particularly amongst our young people. What the Government has failed to do in its economic management is to see that other sectors of the community pay their way. Had the Government followed its natural instincts and philosophies it would have had no need to go into the market place to borrow the excessive funds that it is having to borrow at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has allowed people in this country to avoid paying their rightful taxes. It has been estimated that the amount of money not being paid in taxes is equivalent to the amount that the Government is collecting by way of the petrol levy. Therefore, we have a situation in which the Government has gained in one sector and has missed out badly in another. With regard to the Government's monetarist policies, following that through to its logical conclusion, the Government is now back in the market trying to borrow money; hence we have the ridiculous situation of interest rates going up as a result of Government pressures as much as anything else. Also we have a squeeze on funds to retain the money supply. Young people and the unemployed are the ones who have to suffer because of the economic policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When we take those factors into consideration we see that the Minister was not being realistic when he said in his speech-I mentioned this earlier-that economics is one of the major issues expressed in the statement from the OECD. But it was not expressed in the context that the Minister used. He said that the Ministers of the OECD were quite specific about this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Ministers expressed their concern about high interest rates, but recognised the need to continue to fight against inflation and to keep industrial costs in check, so as to contribute to the expansion of employment. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Ministers definitely did not say that it should be a government policy to allow taxes to go uncollected from those who are avoiding their responsibilities. They said it in a completely different context. The Minister is trying to put the blame on wages. He is saying that wages are the main cause of the problem. We know that interest rates, the health costs which have been shoved back on to the people and State charges are all contributing towards inflation as much as, or more than, wages. I believe that the Minister's statement in that regard is not a true reflection of what he has brought back from overseas. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0G4">Mr CUNNINGHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wages do not increase the level of unemployment when we have a society, as we have at the present time, in which nobody is investing because there is a lack of demand. The world economy is in a state of depression. No businessman will buy new machinery and make investments when he cannot sell the goods that he is already producing. It is only common sense that we will not get an investment-led recovery-we have been hearing we will get one year after year- until we get some demand back into the economy. I would have thought that the Minister would have learned that because in his statement he does say that some countries are doing better than others. If he had had a good look he would have seen the reasons for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the Minister's second statement. It related to youth in the labour market. Once again we get back to the situation of the young people being the main sufferers of the problems that this Government has created. That is the situation in all capitalist countries. The young people are the ones who are suffering. What is the Government doing about it? I do not believe that the Government is doing much. I do not think that any government can do a great deal constructively until jobs are created. There is not much doubt about that. We cannot put people out to work if there is nothing for them to do. We can train them until we are blue in the face but without a job they cannot go to work. That is a clear indication that once again the Minister will not face up to the fact that without work opportunities we cannot put people to work. He will not even consider job creation programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter he talked about was apprenticeships and skills training. There is not much doubt that this is one of the areas in which Australia has really lagged. We are in real difficulty with skilled tradesmen. We are short of skilled tradesmen at a time when we have massive unemployment. I refer to the 1980 annual report of the National Training Council, which advises the Commonwealth Government on the development, operation and promotion of national manpower training strategies. The report of the Council had this to say in November 1980:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Council issued the following public statement urging employers to train more Australians:</PARA>
<PARA>'The National Training Council . . . has called on employers and resource developers to begin training more Australians now to avoid shortages of skilled labour in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>'Council said that while it was aware that many employers were making special efforts to train for their manpower needs, much more needed to be done. </PARA>
<PARA>'The Council resolved to urge employers and resource developers to provide more employment and training opportunities for Australians in the 1980s. Council said that without a concerted effort there could be: project disruption, delays and fewer jobs; unnecessary and counter productive competition for skilled labour;-</PARA>
<PARA>We are definitely facing that situation now-</PARA>
<PARA> 'poaching' from Australian companies who had invested in training;-</PARA>
<PARA>If anyone wants any proof of that he should come to the Latrobe Valley and see what is happening there, with Australian companies training young people only to have them poached by the big resource project. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA>shortages elsewhere in the labour market; increased and unnecessary pressures for immigration at a time of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment;-</PARA>
<PARA>This was the warning in 1980 and these are the very things that are happening today-</PARA>
<PARA>increased inflation</PARA>
<PARA>The National Training Council believes that if benefits of the major development projects are to flow through to Australians in the form of jobs, and increased skilled workers, developers should adopt appropriate measures:</PARA>
<PARA>to train sufficient people for their needs and be prepared to train in anticipation of demand;</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA>to train sufficient people for their needs and be prepared to train in anticipation of demand; and not expect assistance with immigration of skilled workers, if they have not made an effort to meet their own needs in a timely manner. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister will probably refer to the fact that last year he introduced a skills program-an employment and youth affairs program for 1981-82. Many aspects of that program are to be commended. They would be very good if they were carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the results. Just prior to last Christmas the Victorian Minister for Employment and Training, Mr Dixon, announced a big employment program for the Latrobe Valley, under which 120 people would be trained to be skilled tradesmen. He said his Government would set up a Latrobe Valley skills centre. That is all very well. The next question was whether the unions would co-operate . The Government had no difficulty with that. The unions immediately co-operated and they are not backward in putting their policies forward. If any honourable member cares to read the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress 1981 on labour resources planning he will see that that Congress clearly outlined what was required to train people and outlined training and retraining schemes. Perhaps the Minister, instead of bashing unions, might care to look at some of the constructive things the Congress had to say in that report. But what has happened with that training program? Everything was all set to go. There was union involvement and education involvement. But on 2 March 1982 this article appeared in the Latrobe Valley Express. </PARA>
<PARA> The Latrobe Valley has missed out on 120 future skilled tradesmen because of delays in establishing a training company to run the proposed LV Skills Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> This message was spelt out in Yarram on Friday by the SEC's Area Administration Manager, Mr John Hutchinson, in a Latrobe Valley Consultative Committee workforce sub-committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hutchinson said commitments from potential trade employers had been insufficient to ensure the scheme got started. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of support and guarantees of employment for the apprentices as well as the question of who should staff the centre-teachers or qualified tradesmen-had led to a stalemate, he reported. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Minister, after a trip overseas, after looking at what was going on, came into this House and the best he could do was blame the unions. After all the machinery for the skills centre has been set up, we have a clear indication that it cannot get off the ground because the employers will not play the part proposed for them by the Minister. He put the training scheme forward on the understanding that employers would do what was expected of them. But they are not doing it. Employers have no more confidence in this Government than they have in the Victorian Government. They see that there is no demand. They do not intend to train, as is said in this report on training, in anticipation of an increase in demand because they have lost complete confidence in what is going on in the economy. There is very little point in talking about training programs , unless the Government is prepared to generate job opportunities and to endeavour to see that the economy is stimulated so that work will be made available. I will refer to the only constructive comment made by the Minister. On page 8 of the statement he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Training opportunities for young people was an area of wide discussion. The dual system of training used in Germany, Austria and Switzerland received special attention in the debate and it is probably not insignificant that those countries have low rates of youth unemployment. The dual system combines schooling and on-the-job training and work experience in a wide range of occupations. After the conference I was able to examine the situation at first hand in West Germany. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister probably should look at the position in Austria and Switzerland as well and ensure that the experience in those countries is brought to Australia so that jobs are created. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would be quite prepared to see him out of this country if he could do something about the situation. But if he comes back here and puts to the House statements like the one he has put down today there is not much hope that he will do anything constructive. He did not mention the communique. He has gone on to the usual tack of bashing the unions. Let us look at page 3 of the communique and see what it says should be done to get co-operation and to get things going. The communique states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ministers agreed that the success of policies to combat unemployment would depend, to a considerable extent, on active co-operation by working people and employers. Realism about trade-offs between wages, social benefits and employment-creating investment is necessary if a sustained recovery leading to higher levels of employment is to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear from what the Minister has had to say that he has not truly represented his trip overseas and what the Ministers have had to say in the communique. He did not mention once in his speech job creation programs, which, of course, are against the policy of this Government. He has come back with the usual rhetoric of blaming the unions and blaming wages. However, clearly the communique says governments need co-operation between working people and employers. The Minister will not get co-operation by coming into this House and trying to create the impression that the problems exist only on one side. This is a major problem. Young people around the world are in desperate trouble. We definitely need the sort of co-operation that this communique says we need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that it has been possible for a debate to take place on this matter because it has put into sharp relief the differences between the approach taken by the Government and the approach taken by the Opposition to this important matter of employment growth and unemployment. If I may, I will deal at the outset with what I apprehended to be the first criticism made by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). It was along the lines that it was unfair of me, on the part of the Government, to highlight the fact that Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Ministers themselves emphasised the importance of a non-inflationary policy as the proper framework for reducing unemployment when there are other ways of doing it. He said, in further elaboration of that argument, that the other ways of doing it are job creation schemes and other special types of schemes which can lead to a reduction in unemployment and presumably an increase in employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say something about that matter. The first point is that at the conference in which I participated there was certainly no evidence that persuaded me that there was a job creation scheme of a public nature or of the general sort that we understand when we are talking about job creation schemes that could hold out any hope at all of providing jobs in the numbers in which this country needs them and the numbers in which European countries need them. There is no evidence--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may continue, I repeat the point that the honourable member for Wills, as I apprehended what he said, said that there were other ways of resolving the problem and the way of resolving the problem was to have regard to what he described as job creation schemes. I say in reply to that--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hawke" NAMEID="YD4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As part of an overall approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If he will keep quiet for a moment he will hear the Government's reply. I say in reply to that that if that was the view of OECD Ministers from European countries, from the United States and from Japan, is it not reasonable to expect that they would have said so, that they would have shared their experience, that they would have given evidence showing that there were job creation schemes of a government nature which have had some prospect of success? That evidence was not forthcoming. Further, the honourable member for Wills pointed to the specific situation of Australia. He said that one has only to look to Australia to see that a job creation scheme can work and in support of that he cited the Regional Employment Development scheme that existed under the Labor Government. That is, as I apprehend it, the only evidence that he is able to advance in support of the proposition that there are job creation schemes which are a better way of reducing unemployment than by tackling it through an anti-inflationary policy, which is the Government's position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at what evidence there is of the success or otherwise of the so- called RED scheme that existed under the previous Labor Party Government. During 1974-75 the then government created-that would be the word that Opposition supporters would use-64,300 jobs under the RED scheme at a cost to the taxpayers of over $60m. Not one of those jobs created under the RED scheme was a permanent job. Probably not one of them even exists today. Labor created 64,000 so-called jobs at a cost of over $60m. What happened at the time that scheme was on foot? Between August 1974 and August 1975 when the scheme was abolished by the very government that had introduced it, total employment fell by 13,900 and full time employment dropped by 18,000. In fact, during the same period unemployment in this country doubled and the number of people employed, for example, in the manufacturing sector of industry fell by over 100,000. The honourable member for Wills says that here is evidence of the great success of a job creation scheme. He says: 'Look at the RED scheme and its success in Australia'. When we look at what happened to employment while that scheme was in operation in this country we find that employment actually dropped and we find that unemployment doubled during that period. There is no evidence whatsoever that a scheme like the RED scheme would have any hope of success today. It failed then. Similar schemes have failed overseas. Similar schemes would fail if they were introduced into this country today. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come to the basic point about the communique of the OECD Ministers and the reason why I want to make it plain to the Australian people that such a communique was issued and make it plain to the Australian people what in substance was contained in that communique. The point is this: If one looks at the communique one will find, of course, a lot of references in it to the policies and approaches which are not the policies of the present Government. I made it plain in my statement that that was the case. I said at the end of my statement that there are many other matters emerging from the conference which should provide material for stimulating debate in Australia. I hope that I made it plain by those words that there were other matters in the communique and other matters discussed in the conference which are certainly not consistent with the policy of this Government. But they are not matters upon which all OECD Ministers agreed. All OECD Ministers did, however, agree upon the basic and substantial economic issue, which was simply that countries will have no hope of reducing unemployment unless they tackle that in the context of an anti- inflationary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me reiterate the words that the Ministers used:</PARA>
<PARA> They underlined that such efforts-</PARA>
<PARA>Efforts to reduce unemployment-</PARA>
<PARA>could only-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word 'only'-</PARA>
<PARA>be pursued with success in the framework of a concomitant and effective combat against inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>The sentence then goes on to refer to the attractions of open trading relationships and the importance of active international co-operation. We agree with that. But let me reiterate it, lest there be any doubt, that OECD Ministers are supportive of this Government's policy, which is that the only way of tackling and solving the unemployment problem is to defeat inflation. If we do not defeat inflation, we shall not have the sound basis that we need in this country to build employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been accused by the honourable member for Wills and others who have spoken in support of him that in some way I have misinterpreted this communique. Let me briefly indicate two things. First, I am still waiting for someone from the Opposition-perhaps the next speaker will do it for the Opposition-to point to those parts of the communique about which it is said that I have misinterpreted what the Ministers have said. The second thing I indicate is these words:</PARA>
<PARA> Ministers expressed their concern about high interest rates but recognised the need to continue the fight against inflation and to keep industrial costs in check so as to contribute to the expansion of employment. In that context they noted the desirability for the parties to collective bargaining in many countries to take account constraints on the growth of real incomes under present economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government says exactly that. We must take into account constraints on the growth of real incomes under present conditions. If we do not do that, we shall fail to do it at our peril and unemployment will increase, as we have seen in this country. The Ministers went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This, together with appropriate action to contain non-wage labour costs--</PARA>
<PARA>And again that is a point that the present Government of this country emphasises -the importance of containing non-labour wage costs-</PARA>
<PARA>and social benefits, would foster productive investment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Ministers went on to say, in paragraph 6, that they regarded the encouragement of investment as an essential basis for employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) seemed, in the declining hours of his parliamentary life, to have lost all sense completely. He does not seem to be able to read the document. let me read what the honourable member himself should have read out:</PARA>
<PARA> Sustained non-inflationary growth as a basis for returning to full employment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Ministers want to achieve. That is what OECD countries want to achieve. I should have thought it was what the Australian Labor Party wanted to achieve in this country-but apparently not. </PARA>
<PARA> I am prepared-I suppose that it is a situation that one has to face in politics -for the Opposition to reject everything that I have said. But I ask Opposition members whether they reject-and I particularly ask the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), who has spoken in the debate, whether he would reject- this statement. I have had occasion to use it in Parliament before. No doubt I shall have occasion to use it again. These are the words:</PARA>
<PARA>if wages explode too fast. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there is a new sentence beginning:</PARA>
<PARA> Because there is no doubt that if wages do explode too quickly it can have adverse economic impacts on unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat it:</PARA>
<PARA> Because there is no doubt that if wages do explode too quickly it can have adverse economic impacts on unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>I put that to the honourable member for McMillan, and he denied the proposition. He should take it up with the honourable member for Wills, because that statement was made by him. It was made at a time in Australia when the employment and unemployment figures were looking very healthy indeed. At that time he warned-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Would you kindly ask the honourable member for Wills to keep quiet, Mr Deputy Speaker? The honourable member for Wills said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because there is no doubt that if wages do explode too quickly it can have adverse economic impacts on unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>How prophetic that comment was. At the time when the honourable member made it, employment and unemployment were looking very good. Today, to make political capital out of the current position, he denies the very statement that he made last year. But it is as true today as it was true when he made it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me try to summarise this matter in this way. As regards employment and unemployment, this country is at the crossroads. What we look for is responsibility from all parties concerned with wage fixation, because wages have an impact of a very substantial nature and degree on employment. I have not said in this debate-and I have been grossly misrepresented-that the trade unions are solely responsible. Lest there be any doubt about it, let me repeat what I said on page 5 of my prepared statement:</PARA>
<PARA> There must be restraint and that restraint must be shown by those who make the claims and those who grant them, by trade unions, employers and industrial tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA>We look at all of those sections of the community for support on this matter. If we do not get support along those lines, unemployment will increase. Let there be no doubt about that. The honourable member for Wills summed it up so accurately last year when he said that, if wages got out of control, workers and their representatives will price workers out of the labour market. This country will be priced out of international markets. Employees will be priced out of their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The OECD has made it plain; we make it plain to the people: What we look for is some support such as we have seen recently from the German trade union movement. It was presented to that trade union movement that it was expected that the inflation rate for the coming year would be 5 per cent, and the Germans settled on wage increases of 4 1/2 per cent, less than the expected rate of inflation. That is the sort of example that a trade union movement can set. It is the sort of example that, when set, contributes substantially to employment growth. If that sort of example were set by Australian trade unions, they, too, in partnership with us, would be making a very substantial contribution to increasing employment and reducing unemployment. </PARA>

There was a deliberate or unconscious misrepresentation both of what I had said and of what the honourable member for McMillan had said. There was a juxtaposition of two separate things. What I had said in the radio interview was not what was put to the honourable member for McMillan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I heard today that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) was going to come into the House and make a statement in regard to unemployment, I was fairly cheerful and I felt that at last the Government had woken up and we would hear some constructive views in regard to unemployment in this country today. All we heard in his statement today was a rehash of the usual diatribe of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) because nine of the 10 long pages of the Minister's speech really related strictly to industrial relations and how the wicked unions and the dreaded workers with their wages push are ruining the country. We hear often from the Minister for Industrial Relations about the big stick which we need to beat the unions with. I honestly thought he would trip into the Parliament after the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs had spoken, second the motion and speak to it. Heaven help us, we were saved from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement made today has not one constructive sentence in it. It will not really add to a constructive debate on employment or unemployment, whichever way one wishes to look at it. It is up to the Government and the Minister to lead in that debate. As I have said many times in this Parliament, the range of policies that reflect industrial relations and employment is great. We cannot look at just one area and say we will put X amount of money into a training scheme or whatever and think that that alone will work. As I have mentioned in this place in several speeches, a whole range of policies, including economic policies involving such things as family allowances and interest rates, all affect the monetary situation. Those two things that I specifically just mentioned affect the monetary situation because they do not come into the calculation of consumer price index increases. Because they do not come into the CPI increases, workers are increasingly having to go to their union officials and say: 'Look, we cannot live; we must have more money'. Subsequently there is a wages push, but a justified one when we look at the whole context of the economic policies of the Government. For instance, we have just seen a one per cent rise in interest rates. I am glad that the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) raised the point about small business. Of course, buried in that one per cent rise that the Government has just inflicted on us is a one per cent rise in overdrafts, too. Many small businesses are now closing their doors or are about to close their doors because they have been hit yet again. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GF4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Especially in Victoria. The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) often says that Victoria is a wonderful State. It is a wonderful State. However, he neglects to tell us that it is on a downward slide so fast that it is not funny. I hope that that slide will be eradicated in a few weeks' time. There is a rundown in business. Overdrafts have gone up right across the board, which mainly affects small businesses. This in not good for the whole economic environment in which we now find ourselves. One last point in that regard is that in the last Budget according to the Government's own figures, of course, wages were to rise by 13 1/2 per cent and pay-as-you-earn tax which is paid by the vast majority of workers in this country, was to rise by just on 22 per cent. Many people for their own convenience forget that little aside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On page 9 of the Minister's statement he mentioned one word that we have never really heard from this Government before. Let us not forget that a conservative government has been in office for 30 of the last 33 years and the two Labor governments-there was not one Labor government of three years, but two of 18 months-could not really solve all the problems in that time. Let us look at the 30 of the last 33 years. On page 9 the Minister mentions the word 'retraining'. Training and retraining is something that we on this side of the House have been talking about for a long time. It is amazing that the Minister had to travel to Europe, some thousands of miles to the other side of the world, before he could find the word 'retraining'. It is quite incredible. In fact, training and retraining has been going on in Canada for many years. Numerous sources would have told the Minister about that and saved him having to go 20,000 miles to Europe and back. In Canada the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission operates a network of more than 400 Canada employment centres. Canada has numerous programs for training and retraining. The Commission helps employers to train new workers or to retrain existing employees under the Canada Manpower Industrial Training Program. It has such schemes as the Canada Manpower Mobility Program. Such mobility programs include exploratory assistance which allows workers who have no reasonable chance of finding a job locally to travel to another area. Relocation assistance helps workers who must move to another community to find a full time job. Special travel assistance allows workers to take advantage of employment services not available locally. Assistance is given in respect of some of the costs associated with agricultural workers who travel to take seasonal jobs. Trainee assistance is also provided. The scheme provides for employment development programs, creative jobs and search techniques programs. This is all happening in Canada. This scheme did not start in the last year or two; it has been going on for many years. In fact, a very high percentage of people in Canada retrain. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems funny that the Minister has had to travel from one side of the world to the other to find that word 'retraining'. Although the word is in his speech, it appears only once in 10 long pages. Many honourable members on this side of the House have been talking about retraining because we believe it is the crux of the whole employment and unemployment area. </PARA>

In talking about training and retraining, we have heard so much about how the communique has been misrepresented. The Minister has said that he has not misrepresented the situation. Let me put it this way: He may not have misrepresented the situation but he has carefully left out some of the very fine and good points. The following statement is made on the second page of the communique:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ministers expressed their deep concern about the human and social implications of the extremely grave economic and social problems induced by such high levels of unemployment. They expressed their firm determination to combat unemployment in the short and medium term-</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to listen to this-</PARA>
<PARA>and to contribute to speeding up the creation of jobs in various sectors of the economy-</PARA>
<PARA>Also on the same page the following statement was made:</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to both the challenge and potential of technological progress, Ministers stressed the need for the creation of sufficient new jobs-</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister left that out of his statement but it was in the communique. I would like to reinforce the Minister's statement by reading what was said at the bottom of the third page of the communique. I am sure that this part of communique was accidentally left out of the statement. The communique stated:</PARA>
<PARA> They agreed that the emphasis should now, wherever possible, be on measures to underpin a non-inflationary economic recovery by reducing industrial costs and encouraging investment-</PARA>
<PARA>Which this Government is not doing, of course-</PARA>
<PARA>and-</PARA>
<PARA>This is the point-</PARA>
<PARA>particularly on those to create new jobs-</PARA>
<PARA>Further on the following statement was made:</PARA>
<PARA> They agreed that it was worthwhile to discuss the merits of partly using these funds for training schemes to help the unemployed to get into new jobs; short- time work combined with partial unemployment compensation;</PARA>
<PARA>This aspect is mentioned again-</PARA>
<PARA>Temporary public jobs with a strong training element-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think he read it either. The manpower and training policy of this Government is virtually non-existent. Total Government expenditure on manpower training and support schemes has fallen in real terms by around 44 per cent of Budget appropriations between 1975-76 and 1981-82. In fact, I will quote from a speech that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) made on 16 March which sums up the situation very succinctly. The honourable member said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amount of expenditure by the Fraser Government on all manpower training and support programs has fallen in real terms by over 50 per cent between 1975-76 and 1980-81. Even with the increased Budget allocation of 1981-82, the decline in real terms over the life of this Fraser Government has been 44 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Job creation and employment growth have also slumped despite attention that has been given to youth programs for which there was an increase in real terms of 11 .5 per cent in the 1981-82 Budget. But such programs have had no real effect; nor have they resulted in any lasting improvement in teenage employment. Teenage unemployment has been increasing on an annual basis since November and is now over 20 per cent. It is well over 20 per cent in my area. In fact, in my electorate of Isaacs there is an unemployment rate of 12 per cent and a youth unemployment rate which well exceeds 20 per cent. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GF4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member. The Minister said that he expected youth unemployment world wide to rise to 17 per cent. In Australia we are far in excess of that already. We are 4 per cent to 5 per cent over the world figure which was set out in the Minister's statement. Teenage employment has been falling absolutely since around the middle of last year. In January the fall in fact was 23,200 or over 3 per cent and three-quarters of these young people were in full time jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United States of America and the United Kingdom have employed monetarist policies. In those countries the situation under President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher has become worse. The United Kingdom has three million people unemployed. As recently as today an announcement has been made that this figure has dropped fractionally because the British Government has loosened the purse strings a fraction. We on this side of the House are saying that such action should be taken here. I think the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) said yesterday that we are at least six months behind what is happening in the rest of the world. At least Mrs Thatcher has woken up to the fact that unless she does something she will go down the gurgler and that instead of three million people being unemployed there will be more like 13 million. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Industrial Relations, who I am surprised has not tippy-toed in here to speak on this matter, had better wake up to what is happening and bring forward some comprehensive and constructive policies to help this country out in the whole area of the economy, wages, prices, incomes policies and the like. We just cannot isolate one from the other . Employment growth peaked at around 3.5 per cent on an annual basis in the September quarter of 1980. This was associated, of course, with escalating growth in average weekly earnings and the easing of tight government policies. I have just indicated that the British Government took such action. However, the reversal of those two influences and the tightening of the reins again after the 1980 election have been associated with a collapse in employment growth to around 1.5 per cent. So growth in this area has halved in the last 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies of this Government are in an absolute shambles. The Minister has come into the chamber with a rag bag collection of thoughts and cliches. He has not even quoted properly from the communique that he went 20,000 miles across the world to help formulate. I think it is an absolute disgrace. I am glad that the Minister is hiding his head because he should. The sooner this Government can bring forward some constructive economic policies which can be applied right across the board, especially in the prices, wages and incomes area, the better off will be Australian families and unemployed people who are fighting for survival under this Government. The Government should take the lead and put forward some constructive debate. Unfortunately the Government will be in office until the next election which hopefully will be held sooner rather than later. Therefore, the Government should get some good thoughts on this matter. The honourable member for Wills made an offer and we are ready to take the Government on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia, in a very direct sense, is being de- industrialised by the Fraser Government. Over the past 12 months, the Government 's policies towards manufacturing have further worsened. The exchange rate has been overvalued. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has called for a devaluation. Programs of incentives have been cut or threatened. Great uncertainty has been created by references to the Industries Assistance Commission which have been completely mistimed and also misconstrued. The influence of the inquiries of the Jackson Committee to Advise on Policies for Manufacturing Industry and the Crawford Commission to Advise on Assistance to Industry is virtually non-existent. Government-industry consultation has been completely downgraded and, instead of earlier commitment to productivity and capacity expansion, we now have the ideology of the free market, the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and the free trade fantasyland of the back bench 'dries'. None of them is in the House at present. I wish we could have them in a debate such as this so that we could take them on head on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is only part of the present list of woes. But is it any wonder that the survey of industrial trends conducted by the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Bank of New South Wales reveals that this severe downturn has occurred in the Australian manufacturing sector. At this stage I will say something about the survey. It was released last Sunday and it reveals that new orders, output and employment have fallen in the last three months. The respondents to the survey-those who helped by answering the various questionnaires-were extremely pessimistic when asked to look to the period ahead ; in fact, the most pessimistic for over eight years. The worsening economic situation revealed by this survey, which is also evident from a variety of other indicators-we do not have to rely only on this survey-is without question the result of the ineptitude and the mismanagement of the Government from which this country is suffering at present at the national level. On virtually every count it is a failure or an absence of Fraser Government policy which has led to the downturn in the survey, despite the continuing advantages and the long term prospects of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the last Federal election, the Government was busily convincing itself and trying to convince everyone else-sadly, too many were convinced or the majority would have been on my side of politics with the Australian Labor Party governing this country-that the Australian economy was on the way to a boom decade in the 1980s. Surveys of resource and manufacturing projects were regularly compiled, each showing growth of billions of dollars in the total value of anticipated projects. We have not seen one of the projections for some time. The Government is now selling a very different image of the economic situation. It is trying to lower expectations to prepare Australians for harder times ahead. It is particularly concerned to create an attitude whereby the various hard pressed sections of the community will reduce their demand for what could well be a fare share of national income and government services. </PARA>
<PARA> These swings in the Government's rhetoric from the talk of the boom decade of the 1980s to the gloom that we are hearing now and these swings in the images that the Government paints of our economic prospects are themselves part of the economic mismanagement of the Government. The periodic raising and lowering of public expectations has done enormous damage to the social consensus in this country. Moreover, it has tended to worsen the economic cycle because the Fraser Ministry is so vulnerable to short term developments. The complete lack of longer term thinking and the complete lack of planning have meant that the Government has merely reacted to events. It is not in any way properly ordering those events. </PARA>
<PARA> When the economy began to experience the early benefits of resource development , the Government acted dramatically to raise expectations further, with consequent inflationary implications. Then, in a mad retreat from that, which was, of course, associated with the 1980 election, the Government instituted the tightest economic policies of its six-year period of office. Last April, almost a year ago, we had the cutbacks in the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee-the razor gang. Since that time, we have had a sharp increase in health insurance charges; we have had higher income and sales taxes; we have had the collapse of a wages policy; we have had a stringent Federal Budget; we have had severe cuts in loan funds for the States; we have had a further marked tightening of monetary policies; we have had an increase of about 2 per cent in most interest rates; and on top of all that, we have had a deliberate policy of maintaining a high value for the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> In his Budget Speech, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was honest enough to say that these stringent measures were aimed at reducing inflationary pressures and would have implications for the level of economic activity and employment. There can be no doubt that the Government decided to slam on the brakes because it had absolutely lost its credibility with its deceitful wage, tax and pricing policies. It had only one weapon against inflation and that was recession. The fact that we now have entered this recession is undeniable. Twelve months of orthodox monetarist ideology has been rigidly pursued at the same time as the Government's long term commitment to manufacturing industry has been steadily diluted and now has been virtually deserted. It is complete hypocrisy for the Government now to claim that either wages or international circumstances are the major causes of the new recession. We had another attempt at this sort of selling--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AV4">Mr HURFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had another attempt at this buck passing, as the honourable member for Canberra says, in the previous debate when the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) sought to do just that. Real wages in Australia have grown by barely one per cent in the year to December 1981, yet Australia's international competitiveness was eroded by over 10 per cent as a result of many factors including the appreciation of the exchange rate of the Australian dollar. Of course, Government budgetary decisions further directly eroded our competitiveness by a further 2 to 3 per cent during 1981. This feature that we now have of a lack of competitiveness is Government-induced to an enormous extent, yet the buck passing is such that the Government is seeking to persuade the community that the blame lies in other places. To blame wages for the collapse of confidence is ridiculous when these relative factors are considered. If there is any merit at all in the argument that future anxiety about wage levels is a problem, that can also be sheeted home to the Government. There is no wages policy in Australia and the uncertainties following the collapse of wage indexation have not led to any sensible efforts by the Government to restore any sort of wage order. Instead, even greater uncertainty is promised through the desperate politics of industrial confrontation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is equally deceptive in its attempt to blame international factors. This Confederation of Australian Industry and Bank of New South Wales survey asked the respondents to that survey to state the single most important factor limiting their production. The overwhelming majority pointed to a shortage of orders; that is, of course, inadequate demand. That is the real cause of the downturn at present. The latest statistics show that this slackness in demand exists in the domestic economy, which accounts for about 85 per cent of total demand. In the year to January retail sales grew by 1.2 per cent in real terms. That is a fall in per capita spending terms because of the growth in our population. In January private dwelling approvals were down 3.3 per cent on the previous year. Figures for the first two months of this year reveal a fall in motor vehicle registrations. There may have been a little bit of optimism in this area at the end of last year, but I repeat that for the first two months of this year the position is that the number of motor vehicle registrations is down . </PARA>
<PARA> As a direct result of Government policy, public sector consumption and investment spending are stagnant. These areas of spending account for more than two-thirds of the national economy. In regard to exports we have heard more of the buck passing that has been mentioned by the honourable member for Canberra ( Mrs Kelly). If it is not about wages, it is about international factors affecting the situation. That is correct to a certain extent, but the fact that exports are not growing is related to only 15 per cent of the economy and is more than offset by the one bright spot-investment in future export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, it is the series of recessionary measures taken over the last 12 months by the national Government that is at the heart of present economic difficulties. In turn, these measures can be seen as the result of two more fundamental failures. The first is the failure to develop any effective anti- inflation strategy, including a prices and incomes policy. The second is the failure to take a long term view, to plan for future growth and to see periods of limited demand as opportunities for investment and training for future needs.</PARA>
<PARA> It is in these respects that the Fraser Government has been such an abysmal economic failure. It has a time horizon of only a few weeks. To this Government, the long term is just a series of short terms, usually with political problems rather than economic opportunities as the major focus of attention. There is every reason to expect an international economic recovery towards the end of this year or early next year; there should be. Energy prices are unlikely to fall; in fact, there remains a world-wide longer term expectation of higher energy prices, increasing by 2 per cent to 3 per cent in real terms each year, so the energy equation will begin to work in our favour.</PARA>
<PARA> Thus there is no reason why, apart from domestic mismanagement, Australia should not be planning and pursuing a much stronger growth path right now. I only wish that this Government would exhort President Reagan and those who are running the economic policies of the United States to follow a more appropriate economic policy in that country, which so governs the level of economic activity in the world. Instead, because that exhortation is not given and because of wrong economic domestic policies, the economy is languishing to such an extent that we are forced to listen to stories of gloom and more gloom from Government Ministers. We are also being exhorted to batten down the hatches. The Government is making the situation worse by encouraging this jawboning on the part of its Ministers and supporters. </PARA>
<PARA> The manufacturing sector is particularly disadvantaged by the Government's incompetence. Recent research by the Bureau of Industry Economics reveals the startling fact that in real terms there has been a net disinvestment in the manufacturing sector during the term of office of the Fraser Government. Even research and development funding has now been cut. The Budget allocation already represented a reduction in real terms, yet now it has been slashed from $50m to $33.5m. Where is the logic in a cut in industrial research funding of more than 40 per cent in real terms in a single year? This is a classic demonstration of the ad hockery and ineptitude of this Government. It also illustrates how far the Government is from governing for all Australians. Its current policies are particularly damaging to those States in which manufacturing is of vital importance. This applies in particular to Victoria. </PARA>

The Victorian Chamber of Commerce submission to the Industries Assistance Commission inquiries in December stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Victorian economy is very sensitive to variations in the level of industry assistance . . . the Victorian economy is more likely to suffer employment losses associated with protection reductions than the Australian economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>The mismanagement of the exchange rate and the open-ended references to the IAC have generated great pressures on the Victorian economy. One-third of manufacturing is located in that State. No fewer than 175,000 Victorian workers are employed in industries with effective rates of protection exceeding 30 per cent and 240,000 in industries with over 20 per cent protection. The Fraser Government has threatened these jobs. Clearly, we need a long term policy for the preservation and enhancement of these and other jobs. We need certainty, stability and commitment to the manufacturing sector. The Fraser Government is willing to sacrifice them all for the sake of a blind ideology and a commitment to an economic policy which is failing for its seventh consecutive year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will preach gloom and doom at the drop of a hat. Today it has put forward for discussion in this House as a matter of public importance the 'worsening economic situation'. But the changing economic situation needs to be seen in perspective. The Opposition did not make any reference to the fact, as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report recently pointed out, that from 1978 to the end of last year the real rate of economic growth in Australia-as reflected in total production, gross domestic product-was twice that of the average of the OECD countries. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), who is the Opposition spokesman on this issue, made no reference to the fact that over recent years employment- generated by the Government's economic policies and the enterprise and initiative of the private sector-has grown by 100,000 to 150,000 jobs per annum, or a total of some 400,000 new jobs over the past three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the background against which the current slow down in economic activity , which is not in dispute, should be seen. The slow down was absurdly attributed by the honourable member to the policies of this Government. In fact, the causes of the slow down are manifold and complex. Some are internal to Australia. I refer, for instance, to the unacceptably high level of industrial disputation, the recent veritable rash of strikes and bans which have added to costs, have held up export deliveries and have slowed the bringing to final agreement of major resource projects such as the North West Shelf project. It has, generally, undermined the investment climate, perhaps most notably in New South Wales. As has been exhaustively discussed in the House this afternoon, there are also excessive wage and salary claims and the push to achieve shorter working hours. If ever there was a time to shout from the roof tops the dictum of a former Labor Treasurer, Frank Crean, that 'one man's excessive wage increase costs another man his job', that time has arrived. There is indeed a heavy responsibility on the part of not only employees but also employers and wage tribunals to contain excessive cost increases. In comparison, it is worth pointing out that in the United States of America there have been recent settlements in which employees have accepted actual wage cuts in return for job security. It has never been more imperative, with both inflation and activity falling overseas, to contain any further upsurge in costs in Australia. These are some of the internal factors in the current slow down. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also external factors to which the honourable member for Adelaide made only the most passing reference-factors stemming from the state of the world economy-which adversely impact on Australia. While there is a slow down in Australia, there is a much stronger downswing in the world economy generally and in the United States particularly. This has seriously affected our export trade in commodities. The profitability and investment in export industries is thereby reduced; in turn this has multiplier effects which flow on to other parts of the economy. In addition, it causes difficulties with the balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor which has been widely recognised is the stabilisation of the world price of oil-in real terms, it is falling. Whilst that is advantageous in some respects it has a restraining effect on decisions in respect of some major new resource projects in the energy field, causing a slow down in the speed of development and, in some cases, even deferment. Again in the recessionary world market Australian manufacturers, to whom particularly the honourable member for Adelaide directed attention, are undoubtedly suffering from serious dumping and marginal pricing and loss-taking competition in manufactured product markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I would mention only one other major factor largely stemming from overseas, namely interest rates. The high level of interest rates, particularly those in the United States, inevitably impacts on interest rates here. Continuing high interest rates-which this Government, through its budgetary policy, has done everything possible to ameliorate-affect economic activity in all sorts of complex ways. High interest rates are certainly accepted on all sides as a major factor in the current weakness of the housing industry. The lower levels of activity in that industry spread out and affect many other sectors of the economy; such as the demand for furniture, consumer durables and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, there is a slow-down in activity. That is not in dispute. Its causes are manifold and complex. What is not true, as the Opposition in proposing this matter tries to imply, is that the total responsibility for it rests with this Government. That assertion is absurd and cannot be logically sustained for one moment. I do not suggest that the Government has not made mistakes, as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) conceded the other day. I do not suggest that there are not things which could not have been done better. In my view some things would have been done better if they had been done differently. For example-this will not please the Opposition-I would like to have seen the Government move much earlier than it has to broaden the tax base through a broad-based indirect tax with off-setting cuts in personal income tax and company tax. Had the Goverment done that, in those circumstances it may well have been in a position to retain the Trading Stock Valuation Adjustment. That would have alleviated the present very serious erosion of companies' real profits, which affects both the incentive and the capacity of companies to invest. Again the honourable member for Adelaide made reference to the significant up-valuation of the Australian dollar to last August-September. That has since been largely reversed but in the meantime it did contribute, along with the upsurge in wages, industrial disputation and the shorter hours push, to reducing the international competitive position of Australian industry with adverse consequences for activity and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said those things, what I do assert is that the overall thrust of the Government's policy strategy has been right-and that the Government's policies have been basic in contributing to the very good performance of the Australian economy, way out in front of most of the other leading industrial nations in recent years, as I said at the outset, and still out in front, albeit currently experiencing a slow down. That is the point I want to underline. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I want to underline is that in contrast the Australian Labor Party has not today in here or anywhere else offered any credible or believable alternative strategy, a point to which I will return. If there is a slow down it would have happened much earlier and would have been much worse under the economic policies that the Labor Party proposes. Further, in coping with the current difficulties and in looking ahead, if the Opposition had been dispensing things, if it had been in government, we would have been working from a much less sound, less solid and effective base than presently exists. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me elaborate on that. The key driving force behind the growth of the economy and the growth in employment, to which I have referred, has been the upsurge in investment spending, by which we mean spending on building new factories, new mines, resource projects and new roads and all the infrastructure that goes with them. It is that investment which is the only route to sustainable, eventually non-inflationary, long term growth and to increases in the number of jobs for Australians. I stress that this growth of business investment in recent years has restored private non-dwelling investment as a percentage of total production in the country, total GDP, to what it used to be in those high employment, strong growth, halcyon days that prevailed before the early 1970s. Last year for the first time for a decade private non-dwelling investment at about 12 per cent was on line with the long term historical average, compared with a level of 9 per cent of GDP to which it fell under the onslaught of the previous Labor Goverment. When it did so fall that meant, in the case of manufacturing industry in particular, to which the honourable member for Adelaide referred, that the capital stock in manufacturing actually fell. What I am saying is that yes, there is currently a slow down. But with this higher investment adding new and additional capital stock, and thus an enhanced supply capacity of the economy, and with the other settings right-in particular a taut monetary and fiscal policy to control inflation-we are better placed to ride out the current difficulties and then to resume economic expansion and the growth of jobs, as the world economy turns round. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress there will be no let up in the determination of the Government to fight inflation; and that cannot be said too often. The Government fights inflation not as an alternative to-instead of-fighting unemployment, as the Labor Party so often makes out and as the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) was saying in an earlier debate today, but in order to increase employment and growth and reduce unemployment on a sustainable basis. That is the only route to sustainable growth, to higher employment and to lower unemployment. It is inflation and higher costs which undermine competitiveness, which erode profitability and thus the capacity and the incentive to invest, because with inflation and higher costs here-the costs of construction and of employing Australians-the sums, when one projects forward a new investment and a new project, do not come out right. So it is inflation which holds back investment, the very investment which means additional jobs for Australians. As against that we have an Opposition whose first answer to overcome unemployment is to increase government spending. The honourable member for Adelaide said: ' The big factor is the shortage of orders'. He would try to get over that problem by big government spending. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indeed, using the taxpayers' money. If that led to inflation, as it inevitably would, the next prong in the policy, as put by the honourable member and by other honourable members from the Opposition, is that that would be countered by an incomes policy centred around a wage compact, so-called, based on Labor's 'special relationship' with the unions. I say to this House and to the Australian people: That is wishful thinking; it is simply not credible. There is no special relationship, except that of the unions, saying to the Labor Party: 'We pay in to your funds, therefore do as we say'. There is no special relationship between the unions and the Labor Party of any value to the Australian people as a whole. A 'wages compact' and an incomes policy based on that sort of relationship is a pipe dream. It is unreal, it is not believable. It was tried on a previous occasion in 1974-75 when the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) was both head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and President of the Australian Labor Party, and we had the most unprecedented upsurge in costs and prices in Australia's history.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;'Australian manufacturers are more pessimistic about the general business outlook for the six months ahead than they have been at any time since 1974'. This is not the conclusion of the trade union movement or the Australian Labor Party. This is the conclusion of the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Bank of New South Wales-two organisations which represent and speak on behalf of the majority of business interests in this country. They have contradicted the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) who has just spoken, and not simply the Labor Party. For these bodies to reach such a pessimistic conclusion and to advertise it, the situation must be very serious, and indeed it is. Manufacturing industry in this country is in a state of crisis, a crisis the potential consequences of which are devastating for this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two aspects of this crisis. Firstly, manufacturers are gloomy in their expectations of the future. They are very reluctant to invest and to increase production. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Over half of all respondents, 54 per cent compared with 29 per cent in December and only 3 per cent a year ago, now expect a deterioration in the general business situation in Australia during the next six months. Some 41 per cent expect no change. Only 4 per cent of respondents expect an improvement, the smallest proportion recorded since June 1974. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the actual performance of the manufacturing industry in this period has been woeful, as the report indicated. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Respondents reported a decline in output during the March quarter (-14 per cent . . .), exceeding the December survey's pessimistic forecast (-4 per cent . . .) , and representing the first reported fall in manufacturing output since September 1977. This contraction in output reflected the reduction in new orders (-18 per cent . . .) compared with December (+4 per cent . . .). Contrary to respondents' expectations in December, export deliveries (-8 per cent . . .) declined in the March quarter. </PARA>
<PARA>Can anyone deny that these figures are a shocking indictment of the Government's economic policy and its total neglect of the consequences of that policy on manufacturing industry? Yet what kind of response did we have from the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch)? He has not even come into the House to defend his own policies. This is the outrageous kind of response that we have had. Does he initiate urgent action to assist industry? He does not. Does he call for a revaluation of the Government's economic policies which are the direct causes of the problem? He certainly does not. Does he initiate urgent discussions with Australian manufacturers and the unions to seek solutions? He can not even conceive of that. What does he do? He issued a bland Press release in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few months there has been concern registered about the future outlook. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing was said about the Minister himself being concerned and being ready to act. It was just simply a statement that there has been some concern. Let me tell the Minister that this attitude just shows his contempt for the millions of people working in manufacturing whose jobs are being threatened by his Government's policies, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of unemployed people who seek work in the manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The inaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is particularly hurtful when one realises that he is a senior member of the Liberal Party in Victoria because it is in his own State of Victoria that manufacturing employment has been traditionally high. As much as 23.5 per cent of the work force is in manufacturing compared with a national average of 17.8 per cent. Yet it is this man, together with his mates in the reactionary Liberal Government of Victoria, who has presided over the biggest slump in the manufacturing industry in that State's history. From June 1976 to June 1980, 19,794 jobs were lost in manufacturing industry in Victoria-a reduction of 4.74 per cent. Many of these jobs were in Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. These and other decentralised areas have suffered dramatically from the manufacturing crisis. God knows what is going to happen to them if the present policies continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Minister, in his Press release, brought up the same ritual claim which has been made over and over by the conservatives here today about this matter-that is, to blame the union movement and so-called excessive wage increases, shorter working hours and strike action. So again the blame for the present Government's ills is put on workers and their families who are merely seeking a restoration of their living standards through increases in wages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not deny that sometimes wage pressures can have a negative impact on the economy but one needs to ask: Where do these pressures come from? Are they merely the consequence of the manipulation of workers by evil union leaders, as the conservatives would have us believe, or is it simply the case that every worker is now so consumed by greed that he or she cares nothing for the general welfare and merely pursues selfish ends? Whilst that might be the callous view of human nature which the conservatives ascribe to-a view which is matched by the heartlessness of their policies-the Labor Party has a different view. We reject this explanation. As everyone knows, workers are seeking increases and are taking industrial action because government pressure led to the end of wage indexation. Workers have been forced to take action to keep up with the dramatically increased costs of living and to offset massive increases in taxes imposed by this Government. The increased wages pressures are, therefore, the direct result of the Government's policies. Yet, this Government has the affrontery to blame the workers for that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Any sensible government, rather than engaging in nonsensical rhetoric, would seek to develop a coherent wages policy based on co-operation with the union movement. Instead, this Government's only action in industrial relations is to introduce absurd union bashing legislation which will merely divide the nation further and create more strikes. It is clear what the machiavellian plot of this Government is. It seeks to destroy manufacturing industry by forcing a war with workers and with the union movement. It knows that this will be the consequence of that particular strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the real causes of the crisis in manufacturing industry. Let us look at the report itself which said:</PARA>
<PARA> Insufficiency of new orders during the quarter was nominated by most respondents as the major constraint on increased production. Excess capacity increased as a result of slackening market demand. </PARA>
<PARA>The single, most important reason for the reduction in demand is the inability of ordinary people to pay for goods and services. It is quite clear that reductions in real wages will always result in reductions in economic growth, contrary to the absurd theories of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Berowra. He mentioned that in fact there has been some economic growth in the last year and a half. He forgets that if one takes into account the overall period of this Government one finds that growth has been less than 3 per cent while inflation has occurred at an average rate of 11 per cent. This Government has talked about controlling inflation and giving us growth. How long do we have to wait for this so-called policy to work? In fact, we will be waiting forever if we have to wait for this Government's policies to work. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, the single most important reason for reduction in demand is the Government's policy. The Government, of course, does not care about manufacturing. It wants to destroy that sector altogether, as is evident from its recently released motor car policy. The reason, of course, is that the Government is simply the pawn of the big financial interests and the foreign owned mining interests which do not care about the manufacturing area at all. There is no attempt to protect employment. There is simply a long run strategy to run down manufacturing through continuous reductions in protection. The lack of demand is not, however, the only cause of this problem. Last year the Bureau of Industry Economics produced a report entitled 'The Long Run Impact of Technological Change on Australian Industry'. That report, based on optimistic assumptions of growth in the economy at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent-much more than this Government can achieve-nevertheless predicted that the manufacturing sector's share of gross domestic product will fall dramatically by 1990. The reasons for this are: Firstly, technological changes and, secondly, continuous reduction in protection. Unless dramatic action is taken, we will see those predictions coming true. In fact, they will be worse because we will not achieve anything like the overall growth rate that is predicted in the report and we will see manufacturing industry being destroyed. What does the Government do? It simply leaves it up to the so-called free market to solve the problems. It is time that a coherent alternative policy was developed rather than sticking to the present policies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter before the House has been brought on for debate by the Australian Labor Party and refers to a report prepared by the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Bank of New South Wales. The survey which led to the report indicated a poor economic result in the March quarter and a June quarter expectation which suggests some further contraction. I put it to honourable members and I put it to the people that that report does not spell economic disaster for Australia, as the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) and the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) are endeavouring to convey to the Australian people. If honourable members were to study that report, they would find that Australia is doing quite well under very adverse economic conditions. They would see that one of the reasons that this economic condition exists in the world today-this is well known by people-is that world manufacturing capacity exceeds demand at the present time. Yet the honourable member for Adelaide talked about mismanagement; he talked about orthodox monetary ideology. None of that would come from that report. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the economic situation in Australia today is very much improved and is far better than it was because of the management of this Government over the last six years. I suggest to those people who care to read the transcript of the speech just delivered by the honourable member for Burke that if they study and analyse some of the programs he suggested they will realise that if we were to adopt those programs we would face an unbelievable economic disaster in this country, the extent of which would exceed any economic disaster we have seen in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, the Government's action since 1976 has greatly cushioned the effect on Australia of the worsening world economy. Since 1976 we have had to take hard economic options, not all of which have been popular with the community. Often correct and hard economic measures are unpopular and difficult to take. But they certainly have enhanced Australia's economic foundation. As I said, our situation is most favourable in the context of the present world recession. Today many countries, in particular the United Kingdom and the United States of America, are recognising the policies that we put forward in 1976. The honourable member for Adelaide mentioned the Reagan policies. President Reagan had the wrong economic policies when he came to power. Evidence shows that he is now moving round to adopting economic policies that we adopted in Australia six years ago. The Thatcher Government of the United Kingdom is coming to the same conclusions. If honourable members were to study the new policies of those two governments they would find that they correspond with the policies this Government adopted years ago. Let us look at what we have done and what our policies are. We recognise the importance of a lower inflation rate. I quote from a book written by Professor M. G. Porter of the Monash University in Australia:</PARA>
<PARA>the only real means for ensuring lower interest rates-</PARA>
<PARA>This is of concern at the moment-</PARA>
<PARA>is the sustained achievement of lower rates of monetary growth and associated . . . reductions in the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it any wonder, when we have leading economists such as that talking about the importance of inflation, that it has been the cornerstone of our monetary policies over the years? Further on in the report Professor Porter states:</PARA>
<PARA>those professing concern for social equity in the community should insist (a) that inflation be brought under control by moderating monetary growth . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: 'Those professing social equity in the community'. The Labor Opposition professes to be concerned with social equity. This Government is certainly concerned with social equity. Yet an analysis of the Opposition's policies shows that they would cause inflation and would do the reverse to creating social equity in the community; they would cause great social inequity.</PARA>
<PARA> Another cornerstone of our policies over the years of course has been control of the money supply. The importance of that is emphasised by the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. Campbell talks about deregulation in certain areas and the Committee recommends deregulation in some areas. But control of the money supply is one of the areas in which Campbell does not recommend deregulation; in fact, he recommends that the Government should always have a monetary supply target. We do have that. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of our Government has been to control the growth of the Public Service, the public sector and government spending. That is a correct policy, but it is the complete reverse of the Australian Labor Party's policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Berowra said, it wants big government , more taxes, plenty of spending. If those policies were adopted the whole economic situation would be altered and Australia would lose the advantage created by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention another point. Manufacturing industry has been the cornerstone of the speeches of the honourable member for Adelaide and the honourable member for Burke in this debate. They said that we are trying to destroy the manufacturing industry. The honourable member for Burke, in his read speech, spoke about the Government's motor vehicle policy. Our policy on manufacturing industry has been another cornerstone of our policies in our six years of economic control in Australia. We have not neglected manufacture. We have introduced measures such as the investment allowance, research and development grants, export grants, just to name a few. We use our tariff policies to move gradually towards less protection and a less restrictive situation but at the same time they allow an orderly transfer of employment and resources to meet the changing demands of the Australian consumer. If we analyse our tariff policies we find that we are modifying protection, which the consumer wants, but we are doing it in a way that will allow Australian industry to meet future demands and future change. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate the Opposition has raised the Victorian situation-I guess because an election is to be held there. I mention the New South Wales power situation. The Opposition refers in its matter of public importance to 'The Fraser Government's responsibility for the worsening economic situation'. No single factor in the economy today has done any greater harm to Australia's manufacturing capacity and our economy than has the mismanagement of the electricity supply in New South Wales. Factories are coming to a halt, programs are being cancelled. There has been no greater contributing factor. Unfortunately for Australia, we will see more of this as years go by. Our industries are facing disaster because of mismanagement by the New South Wales Labor Party and Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn from the situation in New South Wales to some of the economic statistics that the Opposition speakers have distorted to support their claim of economic disaster. I quote a few summaries from the most up to date 'Round-up of Economic Statistics' published for the Treasury in March 1982. It is now March 1982. The publication states:</PARA>
<PARA> Employment growth has slowed; in the three months to January 1982, total employment was 1.5 per cent higher than in the three months to January 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>The employment growth rate has slowed down but it is 1.5 per cent higher than it was. I ask does that constitute economic disaster? Yet in the six years that we have been in government, because of the policies of this Government, the total level of employment in Australia has increased by half a million people. Let us look at some of the other things that these economic statistics state. The growth in retail sales appears to have eased. That is not very good news. But sales were 12.4 per cent higher in the three months to January 1982 than the three months to January 1981, which is roughly the rate of inflation. Is that an economic disaster? The honourable member for Adelaide mentioned new motor vehicle registrations. The Treasury statistics show that new motor vehicle registrations have remained strong. The number of registrations in January, seasonally adjusted, was 11.2 per cent above the number in January 1981. Does that indicate an economic disaster? Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that the matter of public importance put forward by the Australian Labor Party Opposition is nothing more than a fraud. </PARA>

<PARA>Rights of Disabled</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The failure of the Federal Government to seek information from the census re disabled people-i.e. partial or total disability-to enable for adequate planning of, and for, types of services needed by disabled people to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The failure of the Federal Government to lead the way in employment of disabled people by employing a greater number of such people within the Commonwealth Public Service-note the small number currently employed within the Service.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The wastage of the Federal Government funds perpetuating large, bureaucratic institutions and organisations where there are often few disabled people on their boards and little emphasis is placed on consumer participation in decision making.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The failure of the Federal Government to encourage independence of disabled people, or to develop ''normalised'' support systems-attendant care.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The failure of the Federal Government to provide ''non-institutionalised'' specialised accommodation for those people who would not be able to benefit from , or cope with attendant care.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Failure by the Federal Government to alter, or create a ''disability'' allowance means test free for all disabled people-this would assist with necessary equipment and mobility costs.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Failure to provide a national compensation scheme thus saving time and enabling people to be automatically covered in the event of a disability.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Failure by the Federal Government to abolish tariffs on all equipment available to the disabled-e.g. Optacon.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Mismanagement of Federal I.Y.D.P. Funds-e.g. non-receipt by some States of funds through unresolved negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that immediate action be taken to remedy the above stated and that the Federal Government recognise that disabled people are citizens who should have equal rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-It is not my intention to delay the House unduly. As leader of the Australian delegation, I simply want to take advantage of the opportunity in the first instance to express my genuine appreciation of the staunch and loyal support of all members of the delegation during the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. That loyalty and the extraordinary unanimity of view covered all the State parliamentary delegates as well. In that respect, I was well served as leader of the Australian delegation and it proved to be a very pleasant experience. I am also happy to report to this House that the venue for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference for 1988 has been fixed for Australia which, as the House will recognise, coincides with Australia's bicentenary celebrations. I would feel remiss if I did not extend my appreciation and the appreciation of the members of the delegation to Mr Alan Browning, First Clerk Assistant, who acted as Secretary, and to Mr Kevin Shearwood and Mrs Lesley Carroll from the Hansard staff, who supported the delegation in rare style.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report itself, particularly the summary of proceedings in the appendix, will acquaint members with the character of the conference. The matters raised and discussed covered the whole gamut of human experience and human involvement. It was very apparent that Australians, coming from this benign part of the world , tend not to approach a conference of that nature with the zeal and intensity of emotion or conviction of many of our Commonwealth parliamentary colleagues. Therefore, any notion previously held that Australia, by dint of circumstances, could be excused for adopting a somewhat avuncular attitude to the occasion, albeit perhaps in the eyes of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association a rich uncle, would lead this country into a totally erroneous belief of its own importance in the scheme of things.</PARA>
<PARA> The subtle shift in the composition of the conference cannot be withstood. Indeed, I do not suggest for one moment that advantages will not flow from the change. But it is somewhat daunting to find present nations which perhaps were not present at the previous conference, cunningly concealed under new names and with a population of perhaps 50,000 to 60,000, enjoying all the trappings of the Westminister parliamentary system. No doubt these conferences present some fairly challenging budgetary problems for them. But the unquestionable fact of the matter is that they are in all sincerity taking their place in these forums and at each and every conference they acquire an additional voting power. It is quite clear that as the years go by the very character of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the direction its endeavours may take will certainly present challenges for those members with more conventional and prosaic attitudes to global matters. But the unquestionably good aspect of the conference is that, while people are engaged in talking together, the prospects of enjoying a greater understanding of their mutual problems and finding a happy solution to them are much enhanced. I feel that the delegation, having discharged its duty, can return confident that the House will find no particular reason to be disenchanted with the quality of the Australian representation at the twenty-seventh conference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to speak briefly on this matter. First, I commend the efforts of Mr Millar, our Deputy Speaker, who led the delegation on this occasion. He added a great deal to the group and contributed much in bringing about that unanimity of view that was so evident, as he indicated, among the members of the delegation. He also contributed significantly to the excellent working relations between members of the Commonwealth delegation and members of the delegations of the various States. I mention that because that has not always been the case, as members who have attended Commonwealth parliamentary conferences in the past will be aware. It is important to note, as it has been referred to in the report, that there was evident on this occasion a significant change in attitude and a willingness to work together in Australia's interest. That was very evident and very worthwhile. I am sure that all members of the delegation would encourage those who attend such conferences in the future to seek to work in that co-operative way that we achieved on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also take this opportunity of bringing to honourable members' attention the report of the General Assembly. It is a particularly important report so far as the future of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is concerned. There are a number of aspects of it to which I should like to allude, but first I mention one particular matter which gave me great pleasure, in one sense, and disappointment in another sense. That was the effort put by the Australian delegates into nominating for the post of chairman of the executive council an Australian candidate. Our colleague Harry Jenkins, the honourable member for Scullin, was nominated as a candidate for that position and was very strongly supported by all members of the delegation-from the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Country Party of Australia-and he was very ably supported by the State delegates. The disappointment, of course, is that, whilst he was very strongly supported from this region, we were unable to secure his election to the chairmanship of the executive committee. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the second major matter that the report brings out. That is the question of the way in which the executive committee is responsible to the General Assembly and, per se, responsible to this branch of the CPA, that is, the Commonwealth of Australia Branch. As a nation we are a significant contributor to the CPA in money terms. I think that we are also a significant contributor in terms of the personalities who make up the Association. But our capacity to contribute at the executive council level is quite limited. One would not mind that that was so were it not for the fact that the General Assembly, to which body accountability ought to be shown, is not given the opportunity genuinely to examine the activities of the executive committee. </PARA>
<PARA> There are references in the report to that matter in a number of places. There is a reference to the fact that the General Assembly was asked to agree to significant increases in the annual membership fees of the Association-some 15 per cent. Later in the report reference is made to those accounts of the executive committee upon which it was argued that there should be such an increase, and there was some criticism, particularly from the Australian branch, that the financial reports were made available only at the General Assembly meeting. They were not made available for delegates to peruse before they went to the conference, to seek advice from the skilled advisers who might even be available to the Government in Australia. We did not have a chance to see what other avenues are available to save money to check expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> There were many matters raised in the General Assembly that are not mentioned here, about the way in which money might be saved. A critical examination of the accounts of the Association might be possible were Australia represented at the executive committee level and might be possible if there were genuine accounting at the General Assembly because the accounts had been made available earlier. On page 15 of the report, reference is made to the executive committee report. That document itself is made available only one month prior to the General Assembly meeting, in draft form, and then it is not made available in a satisfactory way to the members concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter is of great concern to all members of the CPA. It is of concern to the executive of the Association. I know that it is a matter of considerable concern to the honourable member for Scullin, and to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), who also accompanied us on this occasion. Unfortunately, they are not present this afternoon to speak in this debate, but it ought to be noted that the executive of the CPA has this matter under consideration and is actively seeking a greater say for the Commonwealth of Australia Branch of the CPA in the affairs of the executive committee. We shall seek to obtain it either by a voice at the executive committee level, which is something that we lack, or on the floor of the General Assembly at future meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst these matters are under consideration, it will be of the utmost importance for Australia to maintain at future meetings of the General Assembly of the CPA some continuity of membership so that at least one or two people are familiar with circumstances that have gone before, so that these matters may be pursued vigorously in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is historic. It seeks to exercise the full power of the Commonwealth to make laws for the people of any race, including people of the Aboriginal race . It seeks to override the Government of the State of Queensland in respect of the ownership and control of land by Aboriginal people of that State. Most importantly, it has been passed by the Senate, which is the House of this Parliament with at least a theoretical responsibility for safeguarding State interests. In this case the Senate has taken the view that the interests of the Aboriginal people of Queensland are greater than the interests of the Government of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, the Bill was passed by the Senate on the voices. There was no division at any stage during the Senate's consideration of the Bill or the amendments agreed to during the Committee stage. Presumably the Government did not want to be embarrassed by the revelation of support for this measure from among its own ranks. From their remarks we do know that at least two Government senators would have voted for the Bill. We also know at least six of the ten Senators from Queensland would have voted for the Bill. That is, a clear majority for the representatives of the Queensland people, elected under one of the fairest systems imaginable, support the view that the Commonwealth should intervene to override the Government of what the state rights fanatics are fond of calling the Sovereign State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> We are unsure of the views of the occasionally dewy-eyed Senator Martin from Queensland. This sometime crusader for progressive causes was strangely mute during the entire debate in the Senate. She was apparently caught in a conflict of disloyalty-either abandon the interests of a rotten and unrepresentative Government of which her party is an enthusiastic member, or abandon the interests of the Aboriginal people of her State for whom she has from time to time pretended some sympathy. But when it came to the point she apparently could not summon the courage to declare her position. Her conflict was resolved in cowardly silence. Not so her colleague, Senator Bonner. He is to be congratulated for making the choice in favour of the Aboriginal people of Queensland. Even he, who after all has been extraordinarily tolerant and forgiving of the Queensland Government, has decided that there is no point in expecting that Government to discover sufficient decency to resolve the problems of land rights in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government has shown no intention of providing land rights. In fact, it has set its face implacably against that course. That is why Senator Ryan, on behalf of the Opposition, introduced this Bill. She deserves our congratulations for the way in which she has taken this initiative and for the way in which she has taken account of the views of Queensland Aboriginals not only in the original drafting of the Bill but also in the formulation of amendments, the need for which arose as a result of her extensive consultations in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me provide the justification for this Bill. There are in Queensland two major statutes governing the lives of Aborigines on Aboriginal reserves; namely, the Aborigines Act and the Torres Strait Islanders Act, passed in 1971 and amended in 1974, 1975 and 1979. These laws contain many features obnoxious to the Aborigines who have to live under them and, one hopes, obnoxious to anyone in Australia who has any concern for the outrageous abuses of human rights which these laws enforce. </PARA>
<PARA> Action was taken by the last Federal Labor Government to outlaw the worst of these abuses with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act. However, many objectionable provisions remain. A campaign against these Queensland Acts, as they have been known, has been waged ever since their enactment over 10 years ago. They have been the focus of Aboriginal hostility in Queensland. In what I imagine the Premier of Queensland thought was a clever device, he announced in the context of the last State election that he would repeal these laws. However, what he really intended was to abolish the reserves to which these laws related. In this way Aboriginal occupancy of the reserve lands would be even more tenuous. Proposals for leasehold tenure were raised-variously 50-year or perpetual leases. The Premier' s action, however, was far too cute. What purported to be action to benefit the Aboriginal people of Queensland was in fact a ruse to disguise his continual rejection of legitimate claims for land rights. The issue became urgent in the middle of last year when the hopelessly inadequate leasehold proposals were formally foreshadowed. The Aboriginal people rejected them and called for Commonwealth intervention. The Commonwealth did nothing and so the Opposition, the Australian Labor Party, undertook to sponsor this Bill to provide for the intervention sought by the Aboriginal people of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is specifically designed to respond to the announced intention of the Queensland Government to abolish Aboriginal reserves in Queensland. It will make possible the granting of freehold title to Aboriginals for land which constituted Aboriginal reserves as at 31 March 1978. The major provisions of the Bill are: An optional system of self-management which will not be able to be circumvented by the Queensland Government; the ability to make a land rights claim in respect of the reserves; power for the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to acquire the claimed land from the Queensland Government under the Lands Acquisition Act of 1955; the setting up of an Aboriginal land trust in respect of each reserve acquired; minerals are to remain the property of the State but mining is to be allowed only if either the land trust agrees or where both Houses of the national Parliament pass a resolution that mining must go ahead in the national interest; and, where mining does proceed, the Aboriginal owners of the land will be entitled to compensation. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was addressing my remarks to the Bill which the House has received from the Senate in relation to the proposal to provide for Aboriginal land rights in Queensland. I said at the outset that this Bill is historic but in a sense it proposes no new principles which have not already been accepted by both the Opposition and the Government in this place. It is the extension of those principles in a workable and determined way which is new. The principle of overriding State laws in relation to Aborigines was contained in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders ( Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act. The principle of Aboriginal self-management is contained in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-Management) Act and the principle of land rights is contained in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. The Bill before us seeks to assemble and extend the principles of existing legislation to provide land rights and self-management for Queensland Aboriginals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should point out that the provisions in this Bill do not attempt to deal with the question of land rights of Queensland Aboriginals in its entirety, much less with the general question of land for Aborigines living in other States of Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Those questions remain to be addressed and it is not intended that this legislation will preclude any further legislative action to provide Aboriginal land rights in Queensland or elsewhere. This Bill applies only to reserve lands. The 3 million-odd hectares comprising the land area of Queensland Aboriginal reserves amount to 1.8 per cent of the total Queensland land area of 172 million hectares. When the various Torres Strait Island reserves are added to the Aboriginal reserves the percentage of Queensland land areas affected is approximately 2 per cent. Surely there can be no argument that the claim of 2 per cent of Queensland for Aborigines is anything other than a reasonable one.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill relies on the power of the Commonwealth, bestowed by an amendment to the Constitution passed by all States by substantial majorities in 1967, to make laws in respect of people of the Aboriginal race. It was on this power that this Government based its attempts to provide for self-management at Mornington Island and Aurukun. That law was circumvented, just as this Government apparently intended it to be, by the actions of the Queensland Government when it abolished the reserves to which the law was to apply. The defect of the Act was that it left the ownership of the land in the hands of the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA> A committee of the Senate examined and reported on the validity and intended operation of the Act. Referring to the constitutional status of the Act, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs said at paragraph 40 of its report:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is of the view that the legislation clearly falls within the scope of the power conferred upon Parliament by section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution . . . Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders as defined in the Act are 'people of any race'. A law allowing self-management and control of their affairs is a law 'with respect to' such people. Even if it should be necessary to go further and demonstrate that the Act is a 'special' law in the sense that it relates to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders as such, the Committee is satisfied that the Act meets this requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>At this point I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard several paragraphs of the Committee's report in relation to its views on section 51 ( xxvi) of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>(4) Views of the committee on Section 51 (xxvi)</PARA>
<PARA> 12. In general, the Committee is of the opinion that the Commonwealth has plenary (though concurrent) power to make laws with respect to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who reside in Queensland. In accordance with established principles of constitutional interpretation, discussed in para. 8, the words of section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution are to be read in their natural sense; any limitations upon the power must be found within the terms of the Constitution, either expressly or by implication. </PARA>
<PARA>(a) Express Limitations</PARA>
<PARA> 13. Along with all other powers contained in section 51 of the Constitution, the power to make laws with respect to the people of any race is conferred ' subject to [the] Constitition' and must therefore be exercised according to limitations expressed in the Constitution, such as sections 92 (freedom of interstate trade, commerce and intercourse), 116 (freedom of religion) and 117 ( freedom from discrimination based on State residence). None of these appear to be in issue in the present reference. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) Implied limitations</PARA>
<PARA> 14. The power conferred by section 51 (xxvi) must also be read in conjuction with other provisions of the Constitution, including other heads of power in section 51 itself. In so doing, the High Court may impose limitations upon broad words of the Constitution by implication. The scope of a general power may be confined in order to give effect to limitations placed upon the scope of a more specific power. The position was summarized by Menzies J in Strickland v. Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd (1971) 124 CLR 468, at p. 507:</PARA>
<PARA> Each subject of enumeration is not exclusive of the others and a limit upon one cannot be inferred merely from the existence of another of more particular scope . Nevertheless, when there is to be found a limit in the definition of one subject matter the others should not be construed as enabling Parliament, by legislation on a different subject matter, to override that express restriction. Of this s. 51(xxxi) provides the simplest example, but in Bank of New South Wales v. The Commonwealth [(1948) 76 CLR 1] there is to be found another example , namely a limitation upon s. 51 (xx). </PARA>
<PARA> This principle is relevant to section 51 (xxvi) of the Consititution in so far as it demonstrates that the power to make laws with respect to the people of any race may not be exercised so as to acquire property free of the restrictions imposed by section 51 (xxxi) of the Constitution. Beyond that, it is not clear what other limitations could possibly be placed upon section 51 (xxvi) merely by reading that provision in the context of other paragraphs of section 51. The inclusion of section 51 (xxvi) in the Constitution as a separate head of power becomes meaningless if it is given no sphere of operation beyond the other provisions of section 51. The untenability of that approach to interpretation was recognised by the High Court in a somewhat different context in Strickland v . Rocla Concrete Pipes Ltd (above), when it was affirmed that section 51 (xx) of the Consitition would not be limited by implication to corporations engaged in inter-State trade: per Barwick CJ at p. 497, per Menzies J at 509, per Gibbs J at p. 523. </PARA>
<PARA>(c) 'The people'</PARA>
<PARA> 15. The submission of the Western Australian Government raised the question whether the power conferred by section 51 (xxvi) upon the Commonwealth Parliament is merely a power to make laws with respect to the people of any race generally, but not with respect to a specified segment of such people (Annexure F, p. 5). Some support for this view may be derived from the wording of section 51 (xxvi), which refers to 'The people of any race' rather than to 'people of any race'. The Committee feels that the High Court is unlikely to adopt this narrow and somewhat strained interpretation of section 51 (xxvi). It is not a necessary consequence of the phraseology of section 51 (xxvi), and does not appear to the Committee to be consistent with the approach of reading the Constitution 'naturally in the light of the circumstances in which it was made': see para. 8, above. </PARA>
<PARA>(d) 'Race'</PARA>
<PARA> 16. The Oxford English Dictionary variously defines the word as meaning 'a group of persons . . . connected by common descent or origin', 'a tribe, nation or people regarded as of common stock', 'the fact or condition of belonging to a particular people or ethnic stock; the qualities etc. resulting from this', and 'a group of persons . . . having some common feature or features' (volume VIII, p. 87). There is considerable difficulty in determining a single, precise meaning of 'race' in section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution. This problem may well arise in the context of deciding whether a particular person is a member of a nominated race. The problem is compounded in the case of a person of mixed blood, that is to say, a person whose ancestry comprises more than one tribe, nation or other group of people. There appear to be two basic approaches towards determining the 'race' of such a person. The first is largely subjective: it concentrates upon the assertion made by the person regarding his or her race, provided that the assertion is generally accepted by recognized members of that race. The difficulty with this approach lies in the latitude which it affords a person to 'select' a desired race. It may be doubted whether the High Court would allow such flexibility. The second method is objective; it concentrates upon the origin of a person in fact. The difficulty here is that there is no inherently correct minimum which may be applied to exclude people from a race. Why should a one-eighth ancestry necessarily be insufficient to allow membership of a race, as compared to a one-fourth, or even a one-half ancestry? It is perhaps not unlikely that the High Court will seek to avoid all of these problems by refusing to adopt any single criterion as a determinant of race. Instead, the Court may well decide that race is a question of fact to be decided in any particular case by a consideration of all relevant factors, subjective and objective. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. It is not incumbent upon the Committee to reach a conclusion upon the meaning of 'race' in section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution. The terms of reference merely require an opinion on whether Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders fall within the ambit of legislative power conferred by the section. There seems little room for doubt in the case or both Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. So far as Aboriginals are concerned, the inclusion of the exception of 'the aboriginal race in any State' from 'race' before the 1967 amendment of section 51 (xxvi) clearly illustrates that, whatever meaning is finally attributed to 'race', it includes Aboriginals. The effect of the amendment was to broaden the ambit of the section by deleting this express exception. This approach to interpretation of section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution is not available in the case of Torres Strait Islanders. Nevertheless, it would seem that, regardless of the criteria ultimately adopted by the High Court to determine 'race', Torres Strait Islanders would meet the description of 'people of any race'. </PARA>
<PARA>(e) 'It is deemed necessary'</PARA>
<PARA> 18. It is for the Commonwealth Parliament to decide whether it is necessary to make special laws for the people of a particular race. The Constitution provides no basis for limiting the discretion which may be exercised by the Parliament in making such a decision. Although section 51 (xxvi) falls short of specifying that the determination is to be made 'by Parliament', the practical operation of the section demands implication of those words. </PARA>
<PARA>(f) 'Special laws'</PARA>
<PARA> 19. Either one of two consequences may flow from the inclusion of the reference to 'special laws' in section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution. The phrase may be viewed as having a limiting effect upon the scope of power conferred upon the Parliament, in that the power extends to making only those laws which meet the description of 'special'. Presumably, 'special laws' in this context would mean laws having a particular connection with the 'people of any race' for whom Parliament had deemed such laws to be necessary. In other words, the legislative capacity of the Parliament would not only be limited but would also vary according to the particular race chosen and the matters which the High Court viewed as being 'special' to that race. On the other hand, the inclusion of the reference to 'special laws' may be viewed as having no limiting effect upon the scope of legislative power, the phrase being merely descriptive of laws applicable to a restricted category of people. This approach is suggested by the distinction between general and special Acts of Parliament, the former referring to laws applying to the population at large, the latter referring to laws applying to a defined segment of the population. Any laws enacted pursuant to section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution would necessarily fall within the latter category, by virtue of their nexus with 'the people of any race'. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. The Committee is of the opinion that the second of the above interpretations is required by the wording of section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution. To adopt the first approach is to ignore the opening words of the provision:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament shall . . . have power to make laws . . . with respect to:</PARA>
<PARA> (xxvi) The people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Stated differently, the first approach does not take account of the fact that Parliament is given power to make laws with respect to the nominated matter: on the contrary, it treats the provision as saying that the Parliament merely has power to make special laws with respect to that subject matter. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. Nevertheless, the issue may not be entirely free from doubt. The Committee therefore feels it appropriate to add that, even if the power of Parliament is confined to making 'special laws', there is considerable scope for Commonwealth legislation allowing Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who live on reserves in Queensland to manage and control their own affairs. No general answer can be given to the question of which statutes constitute 'special laws'. That is an issue which can only be decided on a case-by-case basis. To take but one example, the Committee notes that Blackburn J in Milirrpum v. Nabalco Pty Ltd (1970) CLR 141, found that the plaintiff Aboriginals had a 'religious relationship' with land, and that land formed the basis of their social organization (pp. 165-171). In such circumstances, it seems to the Committee that Commonwealth legislation which provided, for example, for acquisition of an appropriate interest in land as part of a scheme for self-management of the affairs of Aboriginals would be 'special' in the required sense. </PARA>
<PARA>(g) 'With respect to'</PARA>
<PARA> 22. By way of concluding this section of the Report, the Committee recognizes that a law enacted pursuant to section 51 (xxvi) of the Constituton must satisfy the ordinary requirement of being 'with respect to' the subject matter of the power, namely, 'the people of any race . . .' Not every law which has some impact however slight, upon Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders will come within this category. Whether a particular law does so or not depends finally upon the provisions of that law. The High Court has carefully refrained from providing precise (and thereby inflexible) rules to govern this process of characterization. The requirement is finally a matter of degree. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister and the House. The Committee also concluded that 'the constitutional conception underlying the principles and structure of the legislation are consistent with the proper responsibilities of the Commonwealth.' It went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effectiveness of the Act is very limited . . . the effective operation of the Act is . . . dependent upon the acquiescence of the Queensland Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why, of course, the Act failed. The Queensland Government would not acquiesce and the Commonwealth, in the face of that failure to acquiesce on the part of the Queensland Government, did not take the sensible and necessary action to provide for the compulsory operation of the Act in spite of the failure of the Queensland Government to co-operate. The Committee further concluded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that, since the amendment of the Constitution in 1967 to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws with respect to Aboriginals, most attempts have failed to achieve any co-operative arrangement with the Queensland Government regarding management and control of the affairs of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in that State and the current agreement in respect of local government arrangements cannot, as yet, be seen as successful or as generally acceptable to the residents of Aurukun and Mornington Island. The Committee accordingly bases its recommendations regarding Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland on the assumption that co- operation between the Commonwealth and Queensland is not likely to provide a full and sufficient discharge of Commonwealth obligations to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland and that some unilateral action by the Commonwealth will therefore be likely to be necessary. In cases where the effective management and control of their own affairs by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders requires the continued occupation of specific lands by those people, the Committee considers that some acquisition of property must form part of the legislative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee pointed out the fact that in exercising its power the Commonwealth enjoyed very considerable flexibility in devising schemes for management and control of their own affairs by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders incorporating acquisition of appropriate proprietary rights and it said that the Commonwealth should enact statutes which take account of the particular circumstances of the separate communities in Queensland. In fact, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) pointed out in the Senate, the Committee believed that a single statute designed to deal with all the circumstances may not be appropriate to all situations. Of course, the Minister very quaintly picked out this one slight qualification of the Senate Committee in support of his argument that the Bill proposed in the Senate, subsequently passed in the Senate and now before us was an inappropriate response to the question of providing land rights to Aborigines in Queensland. However, in doing so he ignored the overwhelming thrust of the Committee's recommendations and the conclusions of its examination which pointed to the need for unilateral action on the part of the Commonwealth in a way which involved the acquisition of land on behalf of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in that State. So I think the Minister was less than fair in the way in which he singled out this aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we do not disagree with the notion that there should be particular responses to the various circumstances which apply in Queensland, but in the absence of a determination by this Government to exercise its power it is not possible to devise arrangements for the variety of circumstances which exist throughout Queensland. We would, of course, not proceed with this Bill if the Government demonstrated any interest in pursuing such a course. It was either shortsightedness or plain deception on the part of this Government which resulted in the self-management exercise failing and now it is political gutlessness which prevents this Government effectively dealing with the proven intransigence of the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate in the Senate the lame, almost sulking attitude of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was indeed instructive. This Minister, who began in this portfolio with such promise, revealed what I imagined to be his true colours. His opposition, and I take it it is also the opposition of the Government, was based on the assertions that this Bill is, to quote him, 'premature, ill- considered, poorly drafted and based on the misapprehension that Commonwealth intervention is both necessary and desirable or that it is necessary now'. Let me deal with these criticisms. Firstly he says the legislation is premature. I must say that is pretty breathtaking. Does he want the Aboriginal people of Australia and, indeed, Queensland to wait another 200 years before something is done to return in a secure way a tiny portion of the land which was so brutally and disgracefully stolen from them? He says we do not even know what the Queensland Government intends to do. It is true that no specific proposals have seen the light of day yet. It is also true, if the public brawl in Rockhampton between the Queensland Premier and the President of the National Party is anything to go by, that the form of the proposal is not yet formalised. </PARA>
<PARA> But does the Minister and does the Government really expect the leasehold proposal which the Queensland Government is considering to be adequate in granting secure tenure to these people, which I understand is the stated objective of this Government? The Minister asks us to leave it to him to negotiate a settlement with Queensland. All I can say to the House is that, in the absence of any report on the progress or chances of success of the Minister' s approach, one would be mad to accept his soothing platitudes or, indeed, to have any confidence in them. We have seen the way in which he and his predecessors have sold out Aboriginal interests in the past. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) did it in respect of Aurukun and Mornington Island, Senator Chaney did it in respect of Noonkanbah and Senator Baume has done it in respect of the Northern Territory. We have also seen the cruel way in which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has built up the aspirations of the Aboriginal people, has promised them support and has undertaken to atone for the past, but, when the going gets tough, he is nowhere to be seen and nowhere to be found. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is certainly not premature. The matter is urgent and to pretend otherwise is to be guilty of the grossest deception, ignorance or disinterest. The Minister says it is ill-considered and poorly drafted. The Bill has now been around since 27 August last year-seven months. During that time Senator Ryan in particular has consulted widely on the detail of the Bill. The amendments agreed to by the Senate took account of the views of those whom the Bill will affect if it becomes law. The amendments took account of the reservations of Senator Bonner and Senator Missen and even took account of those drafting shortcomings which Senator Baume identified. He has had plenty of time and opportunities to propose changes to improve the Bill but has chosen not to. His attitude to the detail of the Bill was churlish and, in many cases, simply wrong in fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to his last criticism, that Commonwealth intervention is not necessary or, if it is, not yet. That is a fascinating objection. It is not that he rules out Commonwealth intervention; it is just that he does not want it yet, or now. He says that he does not want to upset the delicate negotiations which he is currently having in Queensland. While we notice that the Minister will not let us in on any progress that he might be making in respect of these delicate negotiations, we do not notice the Queensland Premier being too delicate in his constant stream of denunciation of the land rights cause and of any notion of Commonwealth involvement in settling the matter. In any case this Bill, once passed by this House, does not have to be proclaimed immediately. If, as the Minister maintains, great progress is being made, let him have this legislation in his hip pocket as a reminder to the Queensland Government of the alternative if it refuses to give a wholehearted commitment to the question of land rights. Such a prospect might just serve to concentrate what passes for the collective mind of the Queensland Government. The point is that the Bill only becomes effective once it has been proclaimed. That is in the hands of the Government. It has very little time, however, to finalise the legislative progress of such a proposal if it wants to be in a position to act at about the time that the Queensland Government is likely to proceed with its intentions. This Parliament, I understand, is to sit for about another three or four weeks and beyond that period we will be in the winter recess when all opportunities for taking action at this level will evaporate. </PARA>
<PARA> We have always said that Commonwealth intervention is a last resort. It will always be better to get the States to provide land rights, just as was stated by the Senate Committee. But we cannot wait for ever and the Aboriginals should not be expected to wait for ever. The Commonwealth should not be allowed to escape the responsibility for what might happen at the Commonwealth Games this year. It knows the strength of feeling amongst Aboriginal people in Queensland. It knows of their determination, reluctant though it is, to let the world know of their plight, if neces- sary by protesting during the period of the Games. It also knows of the potential and even the enthusiasm for brutal responses to these sorts of demonstrations by the Queensland Government and the Queensland police. The Federal Government has, through the vehicle of this Bill and any other devised by it with the same objective, the opportunity to defuse entirely this critical issue. Its failure to act will leave it with the responsibility for whatever happens. If one drop of blood is spilled in the streets of Brisbane in the cause of Aboriginal land rights, the blood will be on the hands of this Prime Minister and his Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. All the considerable goodwill which has been established in Africa and amongst other black countries in recent times will be squandered through a quite shameless lack of political will on the part of this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I expect that if this Bill is ever debated again in this House the arguments against it from honourable members opposite will range far and wide. I predict that the cop out argument, as I will term it, will be advanced by the Minister for Industrial Relations and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), whom I notice is sitting in the House this evening. They will say, as they have said before, that confrontation is no way to resolve this problem, that it is the innocent Aboriginal people who get caught in the crossfire between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government and that the matter will descend into at best a litigious argument in the High Court which could take years to resolve . They will say that the State Government will retaliate by denying services such as roads, water, schools, electricity, health and so on to any Aboriginal community for which the Commonwealth seeks to provide land rights against the objections of the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA> That may be the regrettable reaction and, of course, in such circumstances the communities involved would be adversely affected. The trouble with that argument is that it assumes that the people of these communities think that things are Christmas the way they are when in fact in many cases it is hard to imagine their being much worse. It also overlooks the fact that this legislation provides that the communities themselves decide whether the provisions would have application for them and they could carefully consider the consequences. In any case this argument is a little meaningless coming from members of a party which prides itself on upholding the sanctity of the law. We will not be stood over by the bunyips from Brisbane who masquerade as a government, and neither should honourable members opposite. To do so is to capitulate again and to deny Aboriginals a chance for dignity and a chance for the future. The prospects of standing up to that govenrnment are best if we do it together. If the Government and the Opposition in this place are of one mind and agreed on this proposal the political fallout, which I expect the Government fears, will be minimal. We offer that agreement and I hope the Government accepts it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking for only a short time in support of the statements made by my colleague the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) and also in support of the legislation which has come to us from the Senate. This country owes a great debt to Senator Susan Ryan, to the Liberal senators, Senator Bonner and Senator Missen, and to the Australian Democrats in the Senate who supported this Bill when it was carried on the voices. I was interested to read the speech in the Senate by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume, in which he said, amongst other things, that this Bill was premature, that when the Queensland legislation is known it will be time to pass judgment. He obviously has not read the statements made by the Premier of Queensland, who indicated that it was proposed that such title as would be given to the reserves on which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities are living would be done under the Lands Act and there would be no need for any legislation. That is still the considered and stated view of the Queensland Government. These reserves, which have existed since the 1890s, have always been authorised under the Lands Act by the government of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been statements by people on the reserves, from officers of Aboriginal councils, expressing their satisfaction with the proposals of the Queensland Government. These people are as concerned as any other person on an Aboriginal reserve about their security of tenure, but it has been put to them that freehold title or any other form of title other than title held in trust would be able to be alienated in the way that lands given to the American Indians in the days of the Theodore Roosevelt Government were sold, with the result that the remnants of those tribes in North America-in the United States of America in particular-are now, once again, dispossessed people. The Queensland Government's attitude to land rights is quite clear. It has never shown any respect for the traditional land rights of Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders. The first legislation for the protection of Aborigines and the suppression of opium use was brought down in 1893 following a report by Archibald Meston, who became the Protector of Aborigines. These reserves were set up as a means of 'soothing the dying pillow'. Right up to the outbreak of the World War II it was thought that the Aboriginal people were dying out. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of that program was the deliberate dispossession of Aboriginals and their removal from where they had traditionally resided to reserves far away. For example, the people from Fraser Island, near Maryborough, were taken to Yarrabah , near Cairns. In my time in the Parliament I have seen people from Beaudesert taken to Palm Island. The exceptions, of course, were those who lived on the isolated reserves of Cape York and the Torres Strait islands. Since the 1890s, Queensland government administrations of all political persuasions have accorded no importance to traditional claims. In more recent times, while certain elements of change have motivated this Government and administrations in the Northern Territory and elsewhere, the Government of Queensland has discouraged traditional ceremonies, movement back to outstations and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issue is security of tenure. This is a very modest piece of legislation which purports to give such security to the Aboriginal and Islander people-the sort that applies in respect of the national parks in Queensland. Such land can be alienated only with the consent of Parliament. Although I have mentioned traditional owners, the legislation applies also to Aborigines-for instance some I have met who live at such places as Palm Island-who may not be the traditional occupants of an area but have been there since 1918 or for a considerable period. As we all know, Aborigines have a very close affinity to the place where they were born. </PARA>
<PARA> For all of these reasons, because it is right and proper that this Government acknowledge that the land rights principles which it has acknowledged in respect of the Northern Territory should apply also in Queensland, and because of the unfortunate confrontations which may take place during the holding of the Commonwealth Games later this year, this legislation should be supported. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I present Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1981-82 which, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1981-82 which I shall introduce shortly, comprises the Additional Estimates for 1981-82. In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made under Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1981-82. One of the principal reasons to Additional Estimates is that, although the original budget figuring contained allowances for prospective wage and salary rate increases in the Public Service -including the Defence Force-under long-standing arrangements, that amount was not then appropriated. Those allowances, as well as amounts for wage and salary increases in excess of the allowances, now need to be appropriated. As well, funding is required for new Government initiatives undertaken and cost and price increases arising since the Budget was prepared. The additional appropriations total $811.8m. Of this, $740.4m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and $71.4m in Appropriation Bill (No.4). </PARA>
<PARA> The additional appropriations sought in the Bills are offset in part by savings in appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1981-82, resulting partly from the Government's determined efforts to achieve savings in expenditure wherever possible. These savings, amounting to $361.3m, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document, 'Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations', which has been distributed to honourable members. Notwithstanding the additional appropriations now sought, on current information, total outlays in 1981-82, including provisions in annual appropriations and those outlays financed from special appropriations, would be about one and a half per cent above the Budget estimates. While this increase over the Budget estimates is higher than that experienced last year, the Government considers the increase is unavoidable in view of the need to maintain essential services and programs. The Government was faced this year with substantial wage and salary increases and other strong pressures which indicated a significant overrun on outlays. In keeping with its expenditure restraint policies, it has conducted a firm review of spending in order to reduce net additional requirements by offsetting unavoidable increases with reductions elsewhere wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline some of the main areas where the Government has found it necessary to seek additional appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1981- 82. Included in the amount Parliament is now being asked to appropriate is an estimated $409.1m to meet increases in award rates and other wage and salary costs since the Budget, consisting of $177.2m, civil, and $231.9m, defence forces. These amounts do not include the wage and salary component of additional funds provided to statutory authorities funded under one-line appropriations. This compares with an allowance of $160m included in the overall Budget figuring . An amount of $14.1m is included under the Department of Communications to enable the Australian Broadcasting Commission to maintain its services without major cutbacks in 1981-82, in the face of salary increases. Under the Department of Defence, the provision of $35.1m is made for initial payments on a mine counter-measure vessel, the aircraft carrier Invincible and the modernisation of guided missile destroyers, after taking into account slippage against other projects. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional amount of $4.9m under the Department of Education covers running expenses for the Australian National University. The provision of $10.1m is sought under the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs for existing community-based youth support scheme projects following the Government's decision to continue the scheme under revised guidelines. An amount of $9m is sought under the Department of Foreign Affairs for the provision of additional food aid for Afghan refugees in Pakistan and to meet food shortages in Bangladesh and Madagascar. Included under the Department of Health is an amount of $6.6m for the continuing essential operations of the Capital Territory Health Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Other significant amounts for which provision is sought include: The sum of $ 63m under the Department of Housing and Construction to discharge existing commitments under the Homes Savings Grants Scheme; $4.7m under the Department of Science and Technology for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, mainly for wage and salary cost increases; $11m for the Department of Trade and Resources to meet calls of contributions to buffer stocks established under the International Tin Agreement and the International Natural Rubber Agreement; $22.8m under the Department of Transport to meet the anticipated operating losses of the Australian National Railways Commission which comprises $13.9m to meet the projected increase in the Commission's 1981- 82 operating loss and, following legal advice, the re-appropriation of an amount of $8.9m which was originally appropriated in the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1981 -82; and finally, $6.8m for the Department of Veterans' Affairs to allow for increased fees and higher than anticipated demand for the services of specialists, medical officers, physiotherapists and other allied health professions. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill to amend the income tax law ranges over a number of subjects. Flowing from the 1981-82 Budget, it effects considerable improvements in the zone allowances for people in more isolated areas of Australia, and allows a more rapid write-off of plant for use in the iron and steel industry. In the area of tax-deductible gifts, there are measures to allow deductions for gifts to three Polish relief funds and to certain animal protection societies, as well as some to guard against abuses of the incentives for the arts segment of the gift provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Two groups of amendments of an anti-avoidance nature concern the provisions under which profits from buying and selling property within 12 months are subject to income tax, and the provisions governing the taxing of income derived by trusts. There are also changes of a more technical kind dealing with medical expenses paid to incorporated practices and overseas living-away-from-home allowances of members of the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> Important though each of these changes is, the amendment of major significance in the Bill is that concerning international profit shifting arrangements. I foreshadowed this change in my speech to the House on 27 May 1981, when I introduced the legislation that is now in place as Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I have much pleasure in now bringing into the Parliament the foreshadowed companion amendments, thus completing a package of general measures that are designed to render ineffectual arrangements that have the purpose or effect of avoiding Australian tax. The latest amendments will repeal section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and replace it with revised provisions. The new provisions will deal comprehensively with the shifting of profits out of Australia, whether by transfer pricing or other means. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures in the Bill aim to give clear guidance to the Commissioner of Taxation as to the way in which they are applicable. However, the variety of situations that occur in practice is such that the revised provisions, like those they re-express, have had to repose broad powers of judgment in the Commissioner of Taxation. His exercise of these will, of course, be subject to review and appeal in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA> The shifting of profits to minimise or eliminate a taxation liability, while not a new problem, is one that has become increasingly significant in recent years. The growth of international investment, the relative ease with which money, goods and technology cross international boundaries, improved communications, and the development of a network of tax havens have all served to facilitate profit shifting arrangements by transnational enterprises, both Australian and foreign-based. Profit shifting through transfer pricing has also become the subject of considerable public discussion in recent years, both in Australia and abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> At the international level, it is appropriate to recognise the valuable work of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development-the OECD-which has formulated guidelines for dealing with transfer pricing in its various forms. Since I announced the Government's intention to revise section 136 to deal more effectively with international profit shifting arrangements, the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, in its report on the development of the bauxite , alumina and aluminium industries, has also commented upon the operation of the existing section and indicated the areas where it considered the section might be strengthened. I am pleased to inform the House that the proposed measures do in fact include provisions along the lines of those which the Committee considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Although complementary to Part IVA, the proposed measures are not limited in scope to arrangements that have a dominant tax avoidance purpose. In that regard , it is important to recognise that an arrangement to shift profits out of Australia may be entered into for a complex mixture of tax and other reasons. However, as I mentioned in my earlier statement to the House on this matter, the fact that tax saving is not a key purpose of a particular arrangement or transaction is no reason why we, as a nation, should not be in a position to counteract any loss to the Australian revenue inherent in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The main requirements for the application of the revised provisions are that a taxpayer has supplied, or acquired property or services under an 'international agreement', one or more of the parties to which were not dealing at arm's length with each other, and that the supply or acquisition was at prices other than those that might have been expected in a transaction between independent parties dealing independently-that is, at arm's length. The term 'international agreement' is broadly defined but will not affect transactions wholly within Australia where both sides of a transaction are reflected in Australian tax. Where the Commissioner of Taxation determines that the new provisions should apply, arm's length prices will be substituted for income tax purposes in place of those adopted in the profit shifting arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The revised provisions, like the existing section 136, will permit the scrutiny of profit shifting arrangements-other than those between separate but related entities-that may be made by a single taxpayer who has business operations in more than one country, for example, a taxpayer with a head office in one country and branch operations in another. Profit shifting at this level occurs not through actual purchases or sales, but through book entries involving, for example, the invoicing of goods at non-arm's length prices or the charging to accounts of excessive expenses between head office and a branch. Technically, profit shifting arrangements of this kind involve questions of the source of a taxpayer's income and the extent to which expenditure is incurred in deriving income from a particular source. The Bill therefore contains provisions which authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to determine these questions by reference to arm's length criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> An important feature of the new provisions is that, subject to powers of remission, a statutory penalty will be imposed, equal to 10 per cent per annum of the tax becoming payable by virtue of the revised provisions. Without that, taxpayers who engage in profit shifting to reduce their Australian tax liabilities would have the odds to nothing when they engaged in such arrangements. These measures, which are to have effect in relation to income derived and expenditure incurred after 27 May 1981, will overcome a number of deficiencies in the existing section 136. They will, in express terms, bring the Australian income tax law into line with the approach adopted by many other countries and with the provisions already embodied in our double taxation agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, they are, by any standard, a significant legislative response to arrangements that are damaging to the Australian revenue. Before leaving that subject I would like to acknowledge the interest and contribution of a number of members of this House to amendments in this area and not least the contribution of my colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) who has taken a long and consistent interest in this particular subject. </PARA>
<PARA>Zone Allowance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Following my Budget announcement I gave details of this change on 15 November 1981. The change follows a careful examination of the zone allowance system in the light of the report of the public inquiry into the system of income tax rebates for people living in more isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements given legal force by the Bill with effect from 1 November 1981, the basic rebates of $216 for zone A and $36 for zone B will not be altered, but the part of the zone rebate that is related to dependants will increase. It will rise from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the relevant dependant rebate amounts for zone A, and from 4 per cent to 20 per cent for zone B. A special basic rebate of $750, in lieu of the ordinary basic zone A and zone B rebates, will be available for people residing or spending the required period of time, in particularly isolated areas in either zone-that is, at places in excess of 250 kilometres by the shortest practicable surface route from the centre of the nearest population centre of 2,500 people or more; 1976 census data will be used to establish the population of centres for the purpose of the special basic rebate. The situation will be reviewed after 1981 census data becomes available. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the existing test of eligibility for a zone rebate, under which a person must reside or actually be in a zone area for more than half the year of income, will be liberalised in two respects, effective from 1 January 1981. First, a person who resides or spends time in a zone area for 183 days or more over a period of two consecutive income years, but who does not satisfy the existing test in relation to either income year, is to receive a rebate in the later income year. Second, a person who resides in a zone area for a continuous period of up to five income years, but who does not satisfy the existing test in the first and last of those income years, will be entitled to a rebate in the last year, provided the period in the first income year combined with that in the last income year exceeds 182 days. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention that to maintain the long-standing relativity between the level of the zone A rebate and that of the rebates available to certain persons serving overseas with a United Nations' armed force and to Defence Force members serving in certain overseas localities, the dependant component of those rebates is also to rise from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Depreciation of Basic Iron or Steel Production Plant</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members may recall that details of this Budget measure were announced on 30 October 1981. As announced, special rates of depreciation, on a prime cost basis, are to be provided for new and second hand plant used primarily and principally in the production of basic iron and steel products. The new rate will be 20 per cent except where, under existing law, eligible plant would attract a rate of more than 20 per cent. In those cases, a 33 1/3 per cent rate will apply. </PARA>
<PARA> The new measures will apply to eligible plant that is ordered after 18 August 1981 and before 1 July 1991, and is first used or installed ready for use before 1 July 1992. Plant constructed by the taxpayer will qualify on the same basis if construction is started within the 18 August 1981 to 1 July 1991 period. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of the special depreciation allowances, basic iron and steel products will be, broadly, those products included in the definition used for the purposes of the 1980 report of the Industries Assistance Commission into the iron and steel industry. In addition, following representations received from the Government of Western Australia, the Government has agreed that sponge iron should also be recognised as a basic iron product for the purposes of the scheme . </PARA>
<PARA> As outlined in my 30 October statement the accelerated rates will apply to direct production plant and also to plant used by the producer within the production premises on certain necessary associated processes. Road vehicles of a kind ordinarily used to transport persons or deliver goods will not qualify for the accelerated rates. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Amendments proposed by the Bill will further extend the gift provisions of the income tax law. These allow deductions for gifts of the value of $2 or more to specified funds, authorities or institutions. One extension will authorise deductions for gifts made after 5 February 1982 to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and to the equivalent societies in Queensland and the Northern Territory-the Royal Queensland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The Acting Treasurer announced this decision on 5 February 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The second will authorise deductions for gifts made to three Polish relief appeals. In a statement on 18 February 1982 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced that gifts made during the current financial year to the Help Poland Live Appeal conducted by the Australian National Committee for Relief to Poland would qualify for deduction. Following representations, the Government has decided that gifts made to the Australian Red Cross Poland Appeal and the World Vision of Australia Poland Emergency Appeal should similarly qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> Still further amendments will modify the operation of the taxation incentives for the arts scheme. That scheme authorises deductions under liberalised conditions for gifts of works of art and other cultural property to the Australiana fund, a public art gallery, library, or museum or to Artbank. At present, such gifts qualify for deduction irrespective of the time when, or the manner in which, the gifted property was acquired by the donor. The amount of the deduction available is generally based on the market value of the property at the time the gift was made, determined by reference to the average of two or more valuations obtained from approved valuers. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of the modifications proposed to that scheme was foreshadowed in my statement of 14 October 1981. That amendment will, in two specified sets of circumstances, apply to gifts made after that date so as to restrict the amount of the deduction to either the value of the property or any amount paid by the donor for the property, whichever is the lesser. This restriction will apply, firstly, when the property is donated within 12 months of its acquisition by the donor; and, secondly, when the property was acquired by the donor for the purpose of making the donation, or was acquired subject to an agreement or understanding that the property would be so given away. This basis of deduction will not, however, apply to gifts of property inherited by the donor. Such gifts will continue to qualify for the market value basis of deduction. Further amendments cover arrangements for the appointment of valuers under the scheme, by formally placing responsibility for such appointments with the Secretary to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. Guidelines for the purpose are being inserted in the law. </PARA>
<PARA>Short-term Property Transactions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I foreshadowed this change in a statement to the House on 10 September 1981. I said then that section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act needs to be amended to support the policy of the section that profits made from short term property transactions are to be subject to income tax. Section 26AAA requires that the assessable income of a taxpayer include any profit arising from the sale of property purchased within the previous 12 months. When a person who owns controlling shares in a company has the company purchase property and, when the property appreciates in value, effectively realises the resulting profit by selling the controlling shares in the interposed company the section does not apply and there is doubt whether the profit is brought to tax by related provisions of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar uncertainties could arise in the event of use of a trust as the vehicle for the purchase and sale of assets within 12 months, or by selling off an interest in property held for less than 12 months through a chain of companies, or through interposed companies, partnerships or trusts. The Bill deals with these situations, so that a taxpayer's assessable income will clearly include the profit component of the sale price of shares in a private company or an interest in a trust estate or partnership that is attributable to an increase in the value of underlying property purchased within the preceding 12 months. The amendments will apply when the value of the underlying property immediately before the shares or interest are sold is 75 per cent or more of the net worth of the company, trust estate or partnership.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 26AAA is to be further amended so as to apply in a related situation in which a taxpayer sells property received as part of a distribution in specie by a private company or trustee of a trust estate, the property having been purchased within the preceding 12 months. When I announced these measures in the Parliament on 10 September 1981 I indicated that they would apply in relation to underlying property purchased after that date, other than trading stock, depreciable plant or property held for resale at a profit. It has, however, been found necessary to include in the Bill additional safeguarding provisions to prevent taxpayers from being able to exploit a general exclusion of those classes of property. To the extent that these safeguards depart from the terms of my announcement, the further measures will apply only in relation to underlying property that is purchased after today. </PARA>
<PARA>Income of Trust Estate and of Dependent Children</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the amendments that were foreshadowed by me in a statement of 27 August last year. The amendments, which are to operate from that date, are designed to clarify the provisions relating to the system for taxing the income of trust estates and of dependent children that was introduced in 1980 in two areas in which, it has been claimed, loopholes exist. In one case, a blatant tax avoidance scheme was developed in reliance upon the alleged deficiency. The scheme attempts, by the creation of multiple trusts, to exploit the measures adopted in 1980 to free from tax at the maximum personal rate accumulating trust income in respect of which a beneficiary has a vested and indefeasible interest. Under those measures, such income is instead taxed to the trustee on behalf of the beneficiary at personal rates of tax, including the zero rate applying in 1981-82, to the first $4,195 of income. Under the scheme, it has been contended that each of the multiple trusts has a vested and indefeasible interest in, but is not presently entitled to, a share of the net income of the head trust, and that the measure I have just referred to operates to allow each of the multiple trusts to obtain the benefit of the tax-free threshold. I might add that it is not accepted that the scheme is effective, but these amendments will modify the relevant provisions of the law so that such unintended results clearly do not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment under this head relates to the exemption from the special tax applicable to the income of minors, for income derived by a minor from his or her employment. It has been claimed that, because the definition of employment income adopted in the law includes payments made for services rendered, the exemption extends to income that a child receives from a trust estate that derives that income from carrying on a business of providing services performed by its employees. This claim is contrary to the intention of the law and the amendment will indicate expressly that the exemption from the special tax in respect of employment income that a child beneficiary receives through a trust is applicable only when the beneficiary provides the services. A related amendment, to apply after today, will clarify the scope of and the application of safeguards in relation to the exemption for business income derived by a child from carrying on a business, either alone or in partnership with others, to make it clear that business income includes income from a business of providing services. </PARA>
<PARA>Medical Expenses</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> At present medical expenses paid to a qualified person are eligible for the general income tax rebate. The law is to be amended so that medical expenses of the kinds that qualify under the existing provisions will also be rebatable when paid in respect of a professional service provided by a qualified person although the payment itself is made to a corporate or other unqualified employer of that person. The amendment will apply to payments made on or after 1 July 1981 and is in recognition of relaxed rules of professional bodies in permiting the incorporation of medical and other professional practices. </PARA>
<PARA>Living-away-from-home Allowances</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Finally, a technical change in the law will remove the present exclusion of members of the Defence Force from the operation of the provision which authorises a deduction against the amount of any living away from home allowance that is required to be included in the assessable income of an employee. The amendment will ensure that allowances in the nature of living away from home allowances received by Defence Force personnel serving overseas continue to be taxed to the same extent as similar allowances received by their civilian counterparts. All of these measures are explained in some detail in the explanatory memorandum that is being made available to honourable members. In those circumstances, I need do no more at this stage than commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend Part IV of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act to accord with the Government's decision to increase the liability limits applying to domestic and non-Convention international air carriage and to make provision for the Act to cover the new air service licence classifications that are to be introduced. The Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act gives force of law in Australia to the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol which limit the extent of airlines' liabilities in respect of damages arising from carriage on international flights. More specifically, Part IV of the Act applies similar conditions to domestic airline and charter operations in Australia and to non-Convention international carriage. Under Part IV of the Act the liability of domestic and non-Convention international carriers for death or injury to passengers, or damage to baggage, is limited. Passengers, or their relatives, do not need to prove negligence on the part of the operator. The injured party is required to prove the amount of damages being claimed and the amount awarded is then limited by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been concerned particularly at the adequacy of domestic liability levels which were last reviewed in 1976. The 1976 amendments reflected the levels that generally applied to international operations. However, the liability limits provided by the Warsaw Convention and associated instruments are expressed in terms of gold francs, the value of which has fluctuated considerably in recent years with movements in the price of gold. To rectify this situation, an international conference in Montreal in 1975 sought to introduce new protocols which express the limits in International Monetary Fund special drawing rights. However, these protocols have yet to come into force and the Government is currently examining possible interim arrangements regarding limits on airline liability for international carriage until such time as the protocols take effect. The Government is also concerned with the broader question of compulsory insurance for the domestic carriers' liability to passengers. This matter is presently under consideration in joint Commonwealth- State government forums. The question of an even broader third party compulsory insurance scheme is also of concern and is, however, a much more complex issue for which consideration will be required by both the Commonwealth and the States . Undoubtedly they are issues that need urgent action. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. Clause 2 of the Bill makes provision for the Act to commence operation on a date to be proclamed. In order that the operators may be given sufficient notice to effect any necessary insurance arrangements the proclamation date will be a short while after the Bill's passage through the Parliament. Provision also exists to make a separate proclamation for clause 3 to coincide with the commencement of new air service licensing arrangements. Later this year, it is proposed to introduce regulations under the Air Navigation Act to provide for new air service licence categories. In particular, commuter and cargo operators will receive clear acknowledgment of their increasingly important role in the provision of aviation services by introducing new licence categories-the supplementary airline licence and licences for cargo-only operators. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 extends the definitions of 'airline licence' and 'charter license' in section 26 of the principal Act so that carriage by operators under the proposed new air service licence classifications will continue to be covered by the provisions of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act. Clause 4 of the Bill amends Part IV of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 to increase the level of liability for death or injury to passengers from $45,000 to $100, 000. Similar increases apply for the liability limits for damage to baggage. For registered baggage the limit will be increased from $300 to $900. For baggage in the passengers' own care, the increase will be from $30 to $90. Provision is also made for these limits to be amended by regulation in future. This will facilitate introduction of what are essentially machinery amendments and allow a more regular review of the liability limits that apply. The Bill also makes provisions for the existing liability limits to continue to apply to all accidents that may have taken place before the date of commencement of the increased liability provisions. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill complements the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill 1982 which I have just introduced into the House. The Air Accidents ( Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963 is a companion statute to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959. It applies to persons travelling as passengers in aircraft operated by the Commonwealth and to passengers on aircraft not so operated who are travelling as Commonwealth employees, or other persons whose cost of travel is met by the Commonwealth or who are travelling for the purposes of the Commonwealth. This Bill increases from $45,000 to $100, 000 the limit of liability of the Commonwealth in respect of personal injury or death arising from an air accident. This is consistent with the limits proposed in the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill 1982 which I have just introduced. By this Bill, the Commonwealth will meet the same conditions of liability in respect of air accidents as it imposes on commercial airlines and charter operators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also extends the application of the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963 to certain classes of persons currently without a cause of action under the legislation. The definition of 'passenger' has been broadened to cover aircrew and airborne workers, such as aerial photographers, instrument fitters, et cetera. This extension of coverage is based on the Government's view that there is normally a commonality of employment between aircrew, airborne workers and passengers carried in aircraft on Commonwealth sponsored flights to which the legislation applies. Under the new criteria all Commonwealth employees killed or injured in aircraft accidents on such flights will have a similar cause of action against the Commonwealth for damages. The provision does not, however, apply to aircrew of an authority or corporation undertaking commercial transport operations. The Bill also contains a provision whereby persons with concurrent repatriation pension rights arising from an air accident during peacetime service will no longer be debarred from claiming damages under the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963. In 1973, repatriation entitlement was extended to cover peacetime defence service and the exclusion provision of the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963 thereupon debarred a cause of action against the Commonwealth for damages. The modification of the exclusion provisions now proposed will mean that, where concurrent entitlement to a repatriation pension arises during peacetime service, a member of the Defence Force or his dependants will now also have a cause of action under the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Act 1963. Any damages awarded as the result of a claim will be taken into account to reduce the concurrent repatriation pension so as to avoid any 'double benefit' accruing in respect of the one accident. Finally, liability under the principal Act is proposed to be adjusted in future by reference to the limit of liability applicable under section 31 (1) of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 as proposed to be amended by the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill 1982. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act in a number of respects. The main amendments proposed by the Bill deal with the levels of penalty for customs offences. Other amendments are directed at controls over the unloading and handling of cargo, the licensing of depots for short term holding of goods, the entering of goods and duty exemptions on ships' and aircraft's stores. The report of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs pointed out inadequacies in the penalties for breaches of the Customs Act. Other inadequacies in Customs Act penalties were highlighted last year in the context of offences committed in the unlawful exportation of horse and kangaroo meat to the United States. As part of the Government's response to those issues, a general review of Customs Act penalties has been undertaken in consultation with the Government's legal advisers. </PARA>
<PARA> The review took into consideration the matters to which I have just referred, the difficulties faced by Customs in supervising the growing flow of goods into and out of Australia, the need for Customs to rely to a significant degree on the integrity of importers and exporters and the magnitude of the rewards that can be obtained from revenue evasion or unlawful import or export activities. It was concluded that the levels of penalties for most non-narcotics Customs offences should be substantially increased. The Bill proposes that the penalty for revenue-related offences should be up to five times the amount sought to be evaded and not less than two times that amount. For the offences of importing prohibited imports or exporting prohibited exports a maximum penalty equivalent to three times the value of the goods is proposed. Where the amount evaded or the value of the goods cannot be ascertained, it is proposed that a maximum penalty of $50,000 should apply. It is further proposed that this maximum of $50 ,000 should also be the prescribed penalty for other offences which strike at the very basis of Customs control. Included in this category are offences such as failure by the master of a ship to permit his ship to be boarded or the pilot of an aircraft to land for boarding, the bringing of a ship or aircraft to an unauthorised place and the unlawful interference with containers or goods between the time of landing and their clearance by Customs. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of some offences which, while serious, are not amongst the most important, a maximum penalty of $25,000 is proposed. Examples of such offences are the unloading without permission of imported cargo or cargo that has been loaded for export. A maximum penalty of $10,000 is proposed for offences such as failing to comply with conditions to which permission for the importation, exportation or movement of goods is subject and for other offences of equal seriousness. Other proposed maximum penalties range from $5,000 for offences such as interfering with customs seals, through $2,000 for offences such as failure to deliver up imported goods that have been washed ashore or salvaged, to $1,000 for offences such as failure to furnish export returns and failure by licensees of warehouses and owners of warehoused goods to observe certain requirements in relation to facilities and documentation. </PARA>
<PARA> No action is proposed by this Bill in relation to penalties for narcotics offences punishable under section 235 of the Customs Act. Those penalties were reviewed and substantially increased by amendments in 1977 and 1979. The penalties already provided under section 235 range from $2,000 or two years, or both, for simple possession of imported narcotics up to a penalty of $100,000 or 25 years, or both, for trafficking in narcotics. There is further provision for imposing a penalty of life imprisonment in the most serious cases. </PARA>
<PARA> With the penalty increases, consequential adjustments have become necessary to ensure that customs prosecutions may be brought in an appropriate court. At present the Act provides that prosecutions involving a pecuniary penalty not exceeding $1,000 may be instituted in courts of summary jurisdiction and in intermediate courts. In order to allow the increased penalties to be recovered without having to institute comparatively minor prosecutions at the Supreme Court level, greater use is to be made of the existing intermediate level of courts. The jurisdictional level of intermediate courts is to be increased to $ 20,000. Other amendments increase the jurisdictional level of courts of summary jurisdiction to $5,000. Other amendments will extend the present system of dealing administratively with relatively minor offences committed by arriving international passengers or crew. These provisions will now apply also to offences committed by other persons which could lead to forfeiture of goods and where the duty evaded is $500 or less. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes amendments to provisions governing the lodgment and processing of entries of goods for home consumption. The changes simplify, update and remedy defects in existing provisions to clarify these requirements on importers. The principal change involves fixing the effective date of entry to establish a duty rate for entries lodged with a Collector prior to the arrival of the goods at their intended discharge port or airport. Presently, advance entries are not effective until the goods actually arrive at that port or airport. This requirement has given rise to anomalous situations where identical goods may attract different rates of duty depending on the time of arrival of the carrying ship at various Australian ports. Delays in a ship's movements around Australia may also prevent some of a shipment of identical goods on the same vessel which are discharged at different ports, being entered in time to meet deadlines applying under import quota arrangements. The Bill proposes amendments which will make the effective entry date the date on which the carrying ship or aircraft arrives at its first port or airport in Australia. Other amendments are proposed which will clarify administrative aspects of the lodgment and withdrawal of entries. </PARA>
<PARA> A further important amendment is the proposed creation of a Part VA to introduce a new system of licensing for places used as depots for holding imported goods and goods for export prior to their examination by Customs. In view of the similarity of operation of premises used for the long term warehousing of goods subject to Customs control and the short term holding of goods for examination in depots, the licensing scheme proposed in the Bill is modelled directly on that now applying in respect of warehouses. The proposed new depot licensing provisions set out criteria under which licences may be granted, provide authority for the imposition of conditions, the charging of fees and certain disciplinary powers in the event of a breach of the terms of a licence. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes amendment of provisions of the Act dealing with the report, unshipment, placement and movement of imported cargo. These proposals will correct deficiencies in the existing provisions which fail to accommodate modern cargo handling procedures, particularly in relation to containerised cargo. Minor changes are proposed to be made to provisions covering the licensing of Customs warehouses and Customs agents. These will overcome administrative difficulties in the operation of these schemes. Finally, the Bill proposes amendments to clarify the exemptions applicable to stores for use in ships and aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are proposed to be made to both the Customs Act and the Excise Act. They are designed to ensure that the exemption applies only in respect of ships and aircraft while they are actually engaged on international voyages or flights. It is intended that, after the second reading is agreed to, this will be referred to the Legislation Committee of this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not seeking to oppose these Bills. As the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) explained when he presented the amending legislation to the House on the 18th of this month, the Excise Tariff ( Coal) Amendment Bill forms part of a package of measures, as he put it, designed to raise additional revenue for the funding of the long service leave entitlement of employees in the black coal mining industry. For that purpose, there is an increase of 10c, from 15c to 25c, in the excise duty on black coal. Insofar as this Bill is designed to achieve that object, the Opposition does not oppose it. I would expect, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you would not think that we would allow to pass this opportunity to make some comment in respect of one item in the Minister's second reading speech of 18 March. I refer, of course, to the fact that the Minister, in his brief speech, said:</PARA></TALK.START>

We in the Opposition find it remarkable that at this time the Government is still seeking to justify action, in this or any other area, on the basis of the razor gang recommendations when clearly it has abandoned all pretence at concern about restrictions in government revenue and government expenditures as evidenced by the decision announced yesterday to use Commonwealth funds to engage in a blatant political electioneering exercise in the State of Victoria.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I regret very much that having come in my calm and ordered way into this chamber to deal with this matter, my colleagues and I have been improperly provoked by the attitude of honourable members opposite. I thank you, sir, for understanding that what I am doing is addressing myself to the legislation. The only way in which honourable members on this side of the House can address themselves to legislation is to look at the speeches of Ministers who are responsible for the introduction of that legislation. If they see fit to relate the proposed legislation to specific matters with which they have been associated, then we would be neglecting our duty if we did not address ourselves to what they had to say. The Minister for Industrial Relations is well known for his rectitude in these matters. If he felt it was an important point to relate to the decisions of the razor gang then obviously I would not be discharging my duty if I did not on behalf of the Opposition address myself to that point. That is what I am doing. I repeat what he said: 'The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Review of Commonwealth Functions'. It has not done anything of the sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat that when it suits the Government's political purposes, it will just ignore the recommendations and the basic reasoning of the razor gang. Why does the Government do this? It is not simply because the Government wants to save Mr Thompson in Victoria; it is because the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wants to save himself. If it comes to a question of saving himself, the razor gang recommendations go out the window. The Government will spend any amount of public money for blatant electioneering purposes in Victoria. When it is going to do that in relation to the razor gang report, how can we really take very much notice of the Minister seeking to justify this legislation on that ground?</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Opposition has no objection to what the legislation is seeking to achieve. But we do object that this House should be, as it were, misled, if not deliberately at least unconsciously, when the Government seeks to found legislation on a report and on a set of principles allegedly behind that report which it has shown by its actions in the House yesterday mean nothing to it. What we are engaged in now, as far as the Government is concerned, is putting reports and principles totally to one side. The Government is engaging in a blatant exercise of electioneering. Of course, this is having all sorts of spin-offs. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I should read to honourable members the stage that this situation has reached because I have just had put in front of me a statement issued this day- it must have been released just a while ago-by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch). The Press release is headed: 'Statement by the Right Honourable Sir Phillip Lynch, Minister for Industry and Commerce'. This is what he has to say in a statement which is really just hot off the Press:</PARA>
<PARA> Some recent Press reports have suggested that statements made by me have had the objective of seeking to 'distance' myself from the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> This assertion is ludicrous and needs to be laid to rest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister stands out as one of the most successful leaders in Australia's political history, one who is supported totally by all of his Ministerial colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it not remarkable! The Press release continues:</PARA>
<PARA> This is my strong view-</PARA>
<PARA>This is what he said-</PARA>
<PARA> This is my strong view-</PARA>
<PARA>Not 'my weak view'; this is one of his strong views-</PARA>
<PARA>as I emphasised-</PARA>
<PARA>He is saying that he has not got cold feet, but of course he has-</PARA>
<PARA> This is my strong view, as I emphasised recently in the Federal Parliament some two weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a very close and effective relationship with the Prime Minister. Suggestions to the contrary are false and mischievous. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has the full support of all Liberal Ministers and this statement is made with their full knowledge and concurrence. </PARA>
<PARA>Here it all is. What is happening at the moment is that politics and the attempt to save the unsavable neck of the Prime Minister have taken over in this Parliament. Any suggestion about the Review of Commonwealth Functions being important, as determining why this Government acts in a particular way or according to the principles of financial responsibility embodied in the childlike face of the Treasurer of Australia staring at me from across the table , is all nonsense. Honourable members opposite do not care a damn about what the razor gang said. If they expend $300,000 on blatant electioneering because that may save the Prime Minister's neck, that is the No. 1 criterion. There is not any suggestion about what they said in the razor gang report. So we have to put up with all this nonsense in this Press release. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever the phrase methinks he protests too much was applicable to a statement, it is applicable to this statement by the professional deputy. He is organising his footsteps so that if it emerges that the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) is going to be the leader of the Liberal Party, he will be deputy to him. But if the Treasurer, in that method for which he has become well known- very careful and calculating-finishes up with the numbers, the Treasurer will be the deputy. Those are the sorts of things that are going on here. It really is an insult to us to have it stated in speeches about this Coal Industry Bill that the Government is acting on the basis of the razor gang speech and is concerned with being the good protectors and guardians of the public purse. The concept of looking after the public purse and not expending money unnecessarily went out the window yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am indebted to you for the way in which you have enabled me to make this point on the basis of the Minister's spech. Having exposed the hypocrisy of this Government, its concern to spend money recklessly for its own political campaigning purposes, its hypocrisy in saying that it introduced this legislation on the basis of the razor gang recommendations, I conclude as I began by saying that the purpose, if not the reasoning and justification, of this Bill has the support of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend tonight to speak about the coal industry, unlike the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). The two pieces of legislation before us in fact relate to the coal industry. I think that obviously the honourable member for Wills does not wish to face some of the unpalatable facts about what is happening in that industry. Perhaps he does not wish to talk about the resources rent tax proposals. Perhaps he does not want to talk about loading delays, industrial disputes and other inefficiencies that are occurring in the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the two Bills is to increase the excise tariff from 10c to 20c a tonne to provide funds for the long service leave funds and to keep the Coal Research Account fund contribution at 5c a tonne. Perhaps other honourable members may wish to refer to that. But I would like to take this opportunity to go through some of the problems that are facing the coal industry in this country at the moment. Those problems are grave indeed. Let us look at the industry. The coal industry is Australia's largest industry. It produced 92 million tonnes of coal last year, 50 per cent of which was exported. Export earnings amount to about $1.8 billion and the industry has the potential to double that amount in the next 10 years. The industry has contributed very significantly to maintaining the balance of payments during a period of difficulty when the primary industry sector was not contributing as well as it might have. It is the biggest foreign exchange earner in this country. It assists manufacturing industry in earning foreign exchange which is necessary for imports used by much of that industry. It is Australia's major resource industry. It has led the so-called Australian resources boom. It has contributed to Australia's standard of living and our 15 million people are no doubt better off as a result of its development. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us talk about the industry in terms of employment. There is a current view that industries, and mining industries in particular, do not have a significant bearing on employment. They do. The coal industry employs some 30,000 people Australia-wide. In New South Wales about 20,000 people are employed in mines. The steaming coal section of the industry is very labour intensive. Some 90 per cent of those employed in the coal industry in New South Wales work in the underground steaming coal area. </PARA>
<PARA> The coal industry has a very significant bearing on the economies of regional areas and towns that are located within the coal industry area. For example, in my electorate the towns of Lithgow, Portland and Wallerawang are undergoing major development as a result of the coal industry. Likewise, this is happening in the electorate of my colleague, the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O' Keefe). In the Hunter Valley and around Ulan nearly 30 new mines are being opened and it is projected that these mines will employ some 9,000 additional people. This sort of development is also taking place in the southern fields in the area represented by my colleague, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). We must also remember this development affects not only those people employed in the mining industry. The industry employs many young people. It provides very necessary jobs for young people in regional and country areas. The average age of miners is 28.3 years. Miners are high income earners; that means they are high spenders. </PARA>
<PARA> We must remember that there is a significant multiplier effect of at least one to one, if not two to one. In other words, employment in the coal industry means employment in all the service industries associated with it. For example, it is projected that the spending power of the coal industry in the Hunter Valley of $ 7m this year will rise to something like $173m in 10 years' time. We have only to look at the new supermarkets, the new shops, the new housing estates, the new road and rail developments, the new schools, the new hospitals and the new sporting facilities that we see in places such as Lithgow, Singleton and Muswellbrook. There is no doubt that the industry is not only a major employer but also a very significant contributor to the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, let us look at the situation of the industry right now. Is it a highly profitable industry? Most people believe that it is. With the exception of a couple of companies, that is not the case. In 1980 the before tax profit of the industry Australia-wide was $659m and that dropped by 24 per cent in 1981 to $501m. There was a drop of 24 per cent across the whole industry. In New South Wales 60 per cent of the coal companies made a loss in 1981. The after tax profit for the whole industry in New South Wales was some $10m, down 30 per cent on last year. That is a profit of $10m on an investment of some $1.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at coal prices. The real average f.o.b. price for export coal over the last five years has declined. In actual terms, it has gone up from, say, $35 to $42 per tonne, an annual increase of about 3.7 per cent. But, if we account for the consumer price index and adjust it back to real terms, it has dropped from about $18 a tonne in 1975-76 to about $13.30, an annual decline of nearly 5 per cent. That is the situation based on the CPI. In fact, I imagine, from the figures submitted to me and from my discussions with people in the industry, that the real situation must be lower than that because costs within the industry have increased far more rapidly than has the CPI. The margin for soft coking coal and steaming coal at the moment is some $2 or $3 at best after tax, government charges and the rest. Therefore, whilst it is a very significant industry and a significant employer of national importance, coal prices are not moving in real terms. The companies, with a few exceptions, are making losses or otherwise very small profits. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the cost structures and the cost pressures within the industry. I will deal first with wages. The Joint Coal Board in its 1980-81 report indicated that average weekly earnings in 1979 for the New South Wales fields was some $ 367. In June 1981 it was $556, a 52 per cent increase in 27 months. In current terms, I understand that the average wage is about $680. In some southern fields , I understand it is more like $800, to which has to be added a factor of about 28 per cent for all the other associated costs. For some companies that puts the average cost of employing a miner in the vicinity of $1,000 per week. That is not allowing for many of the additional things that have to be allowed for in the industry. Yet the New South Wales Minister for Mines and Energy approved a $ 63 a week increase in the basic award which was, I understand, the top bid of the combined mining unions and not the bid that they would happily have accepted . The companies will have to find about $120 per week to cover that $63 per week award increase, allowing for overtime, shift allowances, penalty rates, et cetera. That is the equivalent of about $4 per tonne of coal. I understand that even trainee typists receive nearly $20,000 per year, including bonuses, within the industry. We know that those in the higher echelons of the industry, such as deputies, are in the bracket of $50,000 to $55,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The next major problem that the industry has-perhaps the greatest problems by far-is that of industrial relations. We have the most unfortunate situation in which some of our major customers, such as Japan, are saying that they are no longer interested in dealing with us, to the same extent at least, because of cost pressures, particularly wages, and because of the instability, unpredictability and unreliability of Australia as a coal supplier. Japan has indicated that it would like to take about 11 million tonnes less this year from New South Wales. That will go in small part to Queensland but mostly it will go to overseas suppliers, such as the United States of America and South Africa. South Africa is doubling its export effort. The United States, despite the fact that it has lower quality coal and has to transport it some 1,500 kilometres, has set up a presidential task force to facilitate in any way possible the export of coal from that country, obviously to take advantage of our uncompetitive situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wills might be interested in this: The reduction for New South Wales of 11 million tonnes can be directly reflected in a loss of 5,500 jobs, plus prospective jobs and the multiplier effect that I talked about earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to port delays. Perhaps members of the Opposition are interested in the fact that it is not uncommon for carriers to wait four months off Port Kembla or Newcastle for orders to be filled. One company that I know of has had to wait five months to fill a ship and the demurrage charges on that were so high that the total of them exceeded the value of the cargo. Demurrage charges are crippling the industry. We have the ridiculous spectre of some 50 to 60 ships- Wran's navy, as it has been coined-sitting off Newcastle and Port Kembla. There will be virtually no shipping in April of this year. Perhaps it would be of interest to members of the Opposition to realise that New South Wales increased its exports by 300,000 tonnes last year; that is, by 1.3 per cent, as opposed to Queensland, which increased its exports by 39 per cent. That reduction in exports was almost entirely due to shipping delays. </PARA>
<PARA> On another aspect of industrial relations, I learned recently that there are some 24 unions between the coal face and the bulk carrier. For perhaps the first time in the industry's history, the combined mining unions have met with the waterfront unions because they have started to realise that they are sowing the seeds of their own destruction. They have told their boys in the Hunter Valley to go slow because they realise that there are huge stockpiles. Of course, this really does not help because it increases the unit cost of the extraction of coal. I mention that a stockpile of 12 million tonnes, nearly half of what New South Wales exported last year, is now sitting on the grass waiting to be shipped. If we translate that into interest that has to be borne by the industry we come up with a figure of about $100m or $4 per tonne of coal. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to another difficulty that besets the industry; that is, the effect of Government charges. There is a multitude of visible and hidden charges, both by State governments and the Commonwealth Government, which do not help the situation at the moment. I believe the most significant charges originate within the States. Notwithstanding that, it is interesting to note that in the last seven years there have been some 33 taxation decisions-not all disadvantageous, of course-that have affected the industry. That creates a very great problem for the industry so far as the instability and unpredictability of its operating conditions are concerned. In New South Wales, 60 per cent of the industry's operating profits have to go in government charges, royalties or levies of some sort. Let us look at the New South Wales charges. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BJ7">Mr MacKENZIE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was waiting for the interjection from the honourable member for Cunningham. Would he be interested to know that the average annual increase in rail freight in New South Wales over the last five years has been 13 per cent? There was an increase of 10 1/2 per cent in April 1980, 17 per cent in January 1981 and 25 per cent this year. That is a total of 52 1/2 per cent in two years. If we take it over three years, it is 80 per cent. For his information by comparison, Queensland's freight costs on a tonne per kilometre basis are 60 per cent of those of New South Wales. Yet in New South Wales the industry is compelled to use the railways. Furthermore, the industry is required to provide much of its rail infrastructure, whether it be rail lines or wagons. At the moment the industry has to find $75m in order to provide 700 rail wagons. By 1990 it will have to provide another 2,300 rail wagons. In New South Wales royalties have increased 70 per cent in this last year, an increase of 800 per cent over the last 10 years. Power charges went up 25 per cent at the end of last year. Goodness knows what they will be this year. Yet the industry has to provide its own infrastructure to get its power supply from the Electricity Commission of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of port charges. The industry, despite the fact that it has witnessed no increase in throughput at ports was last year hit by the New South Wales Government with a 47 per cent increase in port charges. Demurrage, which I have already mentioned, is running at between $10,000 and $13,000 a day, or between $5 a tonne and $6 a tonne. We see now a devastatingly worrying situation in which organisations that provide insurance cover against strikes are no longer keen to cover operations in Australia. That will hit the industry even harder. I learnt recently that one company had to pay out $1m in demurrage alone. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider also the question of front-end payments, which are the name of the game in the various States, with Queensland being just as bad in this respect as New South Wales. As part of the conditions of tendering for a lease, companies have been expected to provide up-front money amounting to between $10m and $20m. The local councils have got into the act and are requiring up-front money for infrastructure. Of course, the cost of that infrastructure is not deductible as a capital outlay, a matter that the Commonwealth Government could well consider. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer now to Commonwealth charges. The export levy of $1 a tonne on steaming coal is a discriminatory charge which has no relativity to profit. I am of the view that the Commonwealth could well consider seriously reducing or abolishing that charge, provided the States were prepared to do likewise. In New South Wales, the budgeted outcome as a result of the export levy is not likely to be achieved. Even if it is, there will be a shortfall in company taxation and the Government may well have to be paying out in tax credits more than it was due to receive. The Commonwealth is involved also as a result of its decision of last year to deny the investment allowance on leveraged leasing arrangements. I refer again to the requirement that the industry has to provide its own infrastructure, for example in connection with the provision of electricity connections and rail wagons. </PARA>

<PARA> I propose now to recapitulate the situation of the industry. It has been in this country for 150 years and has had a colourful and checkered history. Of course, in recent times, with the oil crisis, steaming coal in particular has had an opportunity to really take off. It had the opportunity-indeed it may still have if we can rectify some of these problems-of increasing its present export capacity of 50 million tonnes to some 200 million tonnes in the 1990s. What a dramatic opportunity exists for unionists, governments, the industry and indeed the Australian people to take advantage of. Even now some five million of the 18 1/2 million barrels of oil produced in the world each day are going into furnaces. The opportunity can still be taken to make the coal industry the black gold boom industry of Australia, but that can be achieved only if there is common sense amongst governments and unions, so that we can persuade our customers that we can be a reliable and predictable supplier. </PARA>
<PARA> Growth in the industry has not yet taken off. The figure of 6.5 per cent per annum is about the same as it was, in real terms, in the 1950s. The industry is facing market difficulties. We are seeing other countries look elsewhere because of our unpredictability and unreliability. We have an opportunity to hold onto these markets and expand them if governments play the ball the right way and, likewise, unionists realise that strikes and excessive pay demands not only will jeopardise their jobs but may well hand our coal markets over to other countries , as buyers look for more reliable suppliers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The remarks of the honourable member for Calare ( Mr MacKenzie) seem in many respects to be appropriate. I am certainly not here to disparage the prospects of the coal mining industry or to quibble about the contention that there ought to be more understanding on the part of government and various sections of the community about its current situation. The industry possesses a great potential, one that I doubt is being fully exploited by any means. I have no doubt that Australians tend to underrate the competitive nature of this industry on a world wide scale. By the same token, I cannot help make the point that the late Rex Connor might have made, that is, the Australian industry has a tendency to sell itself a little cheaply, to operate in a broken and patchwork way, often against competitors who are more effectively organised under a nationalistic flag. If one can take any notice of the figures that are available to us in respect of investments being made and the incidence of employment that is being sustained, there appears to be a lot of confidence on the part of coalmining entrepreneurs. I say that to some extent with tongue in cheek because I know what the colliery people are saying. They claim that their profitability is low. Tonight I met with representatives of an oil company, as I did last night, and found that they were saying the same thing. Almost everybody is saying it these days; that is the trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One has to look at the real figures. It is all right for the honourable member for Calare to wheel out figures about the profitability of this or that industry , in respect of a company or the whole corporate scene, but everybody knows what mining industries are about. It is a long term haul. In one year there may be a high level of profitability and other years losses. The whole pitch is about long term investment risk. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that very competent people who run the coal mines in Australia- have been doing very well over the years I might add, not having sustained notable losses-are now going into the business with an element of enthusiasm that they have never previously exhibited. There are figures to sustain that point of view and I have discussed them in recent times in this place. It might be worth mentioning again that the expenditure planned by the industry for 1981- 82 in New South Wales totals $1,114m or more than twice the actual expenditure in 1980-81 and almost six times that in 1979-80. The honourable member for Calare would not quibble with those figures because they come from the 34th report of the Joint Coal Board. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as employment is concerned, I noticed that, at the end of June 1981, 19, 867 persons were employed at the State coal mines, or 12.4 per cent more than at June 1980. The increase in employment was more than twice the figure of 941 in the previous year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight on an issue which I have raised a number of times in the adjournment debate, and that is the future of Canberra's economic growth and the need for an end to the stop-start growth of Canberra. As I speak tonight I am reinforced by the 49th annual report of the Canberra Chamber of Commerce. That body represents over 300 business organisations in the Australian Capital Territory. I want to take this opportunity to read from sections of that annual report. I hope that the Government members who are listening, particularly the Treasurer (Mr Howard), who is in the chamber tonight, will take note of the recommendations of the Canberra Chamber of Commerce. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Canberra's economy is highly sensitive to even slight changes in Commonwealth Government policies, particularly those affecting staff and public works programmes. </PARA>
<PARA>The report states that this has:</PARA>
<PARA>had the effect of reducing scheduled gross Commonwealth economic inputs to Canberra and at the same time undermining private investment confidence. </PARA>
<PARA>It points out that there has been a decline in Canberra's private sector employment. It states the figures and points out that private sector employment:</PARA>
<PARA>has declined each year at an average rate of 3 per cent or by about 1000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>It also points out:</PARA>
<PARA> While most of the decline has occurred in the construction industry as a consequence of Canberra's reduced rate of growth, there have also been falls of a lesser magnitude in the numbers employed in retailing, manufacturing and entertainment. The only area to have increased employment levels was finance. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> However the one ingredient which the Commonwealth seems to be incapable of supplying is a measure of consistency in its economic inputs. The economic tap has been turned on and off with increasing frequency to suit the Commonwealth's own particular needs, but with scant regard for the impact of such adjustments on the growth and development of Canberra's business sector. </PARA>
<PARA>The report points out:</PARA>
<PARA> The time is long overdue for the Commonwealth to devote as much attention to the management of the A.C.T.'s economy as State Governments devote to their economies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chamber does not suggest that the Commonwealth should spend money on Canberra simply to prop up local businesses but rather that it should examine its self-interest and adopt a new business-like, returns-oriented approach to the management of its existing massive investment in Canberra's infrastructure, and that it manage its economic inputs and adjustments in such a way as to provide a far greater measure of consistency and stability than has hitherto been the case. </PARA>
<PARA>The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Given this sort of setting there is no question that Canberra's private sector could grow, diversify and prosper and begin to create the new jobs so desperately required by our growing numbers of school leavers. </PARA>
<PARA>The point that is highlighted throughout this report is that what Canberra needs is a commitment from the Federal Government to Canberra's growth and a plan so that the business community knows where it is going. It wants a halt to the stop -start policies that have persisted in the Australian Capital Territory over the last seven years. The report also points out the effects that the Review of Commonwealth Functions has had on the Australian Capital Territory. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The combined effect of these particular decisions will be to slow Canberra's growth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chamber apparently met the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), who is the head of the review committee, and stressed the need for more sensitive management of Canberra's economy. Unfortunately that message has gone unheeded by the Government. I would hope that Government members would read this report from the business sector in Canberra and come to grips with the recommendations. I thank the members of the Chamber of Commerce in the Australian Capital Territory for giving such a frank account of the problems of the business sector in this community and I hope that their recommendations are taken heed of by the members of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week in this Parliament in the debate on the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers I made the point that for a broader peace settlement in the Arab-Israeli dispute the Western world always demands major concessions from Israel without mentioning the intransigent nature of Arab hostility to Israel. I have constantly held the view that the European initiatives, through the Venice Declaration, and the view of the Australian Labor Party are wrong in that they seek to bring the Palestine Liberation Organisation into peace negotiations without demanding of it the concessions which are demanded of Israel. This official acknowledgement of the PLO, given its present covenant requiring the destruction of Israel, is simply a policy of appeasement which no respectable government should support. I have previously outlined the PLO covenant in this place and argued that it automatically precludes the PLO from any recognition by any self-respecting negotiating party or government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I want to highlight another aspect of PLO activity. Intelligence sources have now indicated that during 1980 and the first half of 1981 some 2, 230 terrorists from 29 countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa participated in training courses of one month to four months' duration at PLO camps in Syria, Lebanon and South Yemen. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of terrorist organisations which are the more prominent of the organisations assisted by the PLO. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The list read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> MPM-Movimiento Peronista Montonero (Argentina-Uruguay)</PARA>
<PARA> Operaia Autonomia (Italy)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The PLO also has instructors active throughout the world and is a major supplier of weapons to international terrorist organisations. Most of these weapons originate from the Soviet Union. Given that Saudi Arabia contributes some $50m per annum to the PLO to finance the purchase of additional military equipment, it is interesting to note how the PLO represents even the conflicting interests of its various sponsors in the Arab world. It indicates the convoluted snake pit of diplomacy by appeasement in the Middle East when anti-communist nations such as Saudi-Arabia help finance communist subversion throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Soviet connection is quite obvious. PLO terrorists have been trained in Soviet camps and since 1968 Palestinian terrorists have been trained in Cuba or have had the benefit of expert Cuban instruction in Algeria, Libya, Syria and South Yemen. Nearly one in 10 PLO terrorists has been trained in the Soviet Union. The PLO United Nations representative has recently been quoted on American television as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union and all the Socialist countries give us full support- diplomatic, moral, educational, and they open their military academies to our freedom fighters. </PARA>
<PARA>And this is the organisation Israel is expected to negotiate with and make concessions to. It is an organisation of international terrorism and one which maintains publicly that Israel must be destroyed. As Hani al-Hassan, the political adviser to Arafat said in Beirut on 9 January this year:</PARA>
<PARA> The liquidation of Israel is one of the means we adopt to achieve unity and freedom in the Arab world. </PARA>
<PARA>How can certain nations of the Western world, most recently joined by Greece, give diplomatic recognition to this organisation, let alone involve it officially in any negotiations involving a solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to support fully the continued stand of this Government in refusing to grant any official status or any negotiating role to the PLO while its covenant demands the destruction of the state of Israel. The Government is quite correct in this view and must resist Western pressures to ease its position on that particular issue. I think it is regrettable that Senator Georges of the Australian Labor Party as I am advised, was in Beirut to celebrate the seventeenth anniversary celebrations of the PLO. I think it is equally reprehensible that certain members of the parliamentary Labor Party should publicly let themselves be associated with known PLO sympathisers such as Vanessa Redgrave who, in the guise of supporting certain peace movements, proclaims the virtues of an organisation designed to liquidate a particular country and sponsor terrorism throughout the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to draw to the attention of this House a sad case of disadvantage that has been drawn to my attention. This case concerns a low income family in my electorate of Ballarat which has now incurred serious financial hardship because of this Government's peculiarly hard-nosed attitude to health care. If we had a universal health care scheme, as proposed by the Australian Labor Party, this and similar cases of hardship just would not occur. In other words, if there were to be an attitude based upon a compassionate view of social justice, the fear of financial stress would not accompany the anxieties that are now associated with the treatment of illness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable members are aware, the maximum amount that a family with two children can earn and be eligible for a disadvantaged person's card is $200, averaged over a four-week period. This particular family of a husband, wife and two small children received an increase in income that took the income marginally above the $200. The Department of Social Security has advised them that as a result of this increased sum, the family's eligibility for the disadvantaged person's card ceased on 28 February 1982. That happened to be on a Sunday. The family does not have a car so they had some difficulty getting to the Medibank office. On 2 March the man's wife went to Medibank and was advised that to join the scheme she was required to pay about $40. She just did not have that kind of money. I guess that honourable members opposite would not really know what it is like to be in such a situation. This lady indicated to the Medibank official that prior to the latest health debacle her contribution had been deducted from her husband's wages. Arrangements were made to have this done but once again a delay occurred. It was four weeks before the employer processed the request. </PARA>
<PARA> The following day her daughter was hospitalised and the family is now facing a bill of $600. Medibank cannot backdate the application so the family is now faced with this crippling bill. I hope that the consciences of those who fulminate about the principle of the user pays worry them when an issue such as this is raised because this is a real problem of hardship. It is not an isolated case. Throughout Australia today there are many thousands of such cases of people who are now living not just poverty stricken lives in terms of money but whose lives are being desperately ruined because of the policies of people such as the Treasurer (Mr Howard). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my concern tonight to raise the problem of high interest rates. I am very pleased to see that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has returned to the House because I would like to think that he is somewhat interested in what I might say on this subject. My main concern is the fact that farmers and small businessmen are being asked to go out into the money market to purchase bank bills or money bills for carry-on finance. I do not believe that this situation can be allowed to continue if farmers and small businessmen, particularly those in my electorate, are going to be able to remain in business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to add that it has been very difficult for us to obtain funds . I am one of those farmers who have been put in the position of having to purchase a bank bill. I have had come experience of the sort of charges involved . Unfortunately for us, the Australian Wheat Board has been competing in the money market for a total of $2 billion. Quite a deal of that amount was raised. Government and semi-government organisations also are seeking funds in the money market. Telecom Australia recently put out a float for $400m. It subsequently resold quite a deal of the finance raised which again forced the bill rate up to over 20 per cent. The current 30 day rate today is 18 per cent and the price for 180 days is 20 per cent. The minimum amount obtainable is $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, most people do not seem to realise that on top of those amounts the banks then charge their fees which amount to approximately 4 per cent to 4 1 /2 per cent. The facility fee charged is 1 1/2 per cent; the activation fee 1 1/ 2 per cent; stamp duty, which the States collect, is a little under half a per cent; and the establishment fee for a bill over 12 months is approximately one per cent. If one is unfortunate enough to be forced to obtain these sorts of funds today one is being asked to pay approximately 20 per cent to 24 per cent interest over a term of 180 days or six months. I certainly cannot see that we can remain in business with these sorts of interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Treasurer might say that the interest rates are tax deductible. I argue that with these sorts of interest rates and with the amount of indirect taxes that we have to pay there is no profit left at the end of 12 months. A tax deduction is of zero help unless one is showing a profit. I would like to see interest rates either completely deregulated-of course, this would help to bring down the higher rate but obviously it would raise the lower rates somewhat-or, if the Government is not going to go along that track, then I believe that it should be looking at releasing some of the statutory reserve deposits that the trading banks presently have with the Reserve Bank of Australia. They stand at approximately $2,036m which is 7 per cent of their trading capital. The level of deposits was increased last on 6 January 1981-from 6 per cent to 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see the Treasurer direct the Reserve Bank to release some of those funds and to channel them particularly into the term funds and the farm loan development funds of the trading banks. I think that if this were done it would help to take some of the pressure off the banks and allow them to take loans to these people out of the money market area. Surely primary producers, as long term business people, cannot be expected to operate within that market. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I should like to make is that trading banks currently are receiving 2 1/2 per cent interest on those deposits. I believe that the Treasurer has announced that perhaps that could increase to 5 per cent. I think that if the interest rate is to increase the banks ought to be prepared to match the Reserve Bank's funds with some more of their funds. If we are not going to do that then I think the only other alternative is for us to borrow on the overseas market. That is difficult because presently the minimum amount the Reserve Bank will allow someone to bring into the country is $500,000. I say to the Government that if it is not prepared to--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The attitude of the Federal Government to the problems of nuclear waste disposal is nothing short of criminal. The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) has indicated in an answer to a written question from the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) that he has no knowledge of any firm proposals to construct facilities for the final disposal of high level nuclear waste and that many countries do not foresee such disposal occurring before the period from the year 2000 to the year 2040. What irresponsibility it is for a Minister of this Government to declare that the problem of the disposal of high level nuclear waste will not be solved for at least 20 to 60 years. What will happen to high level nuclear waste during that period? Already in nuclear waste sites all over the world, in those countries which use nuclear power, high level radioactive waste is accumulating at a rapid and frightening rate. In the United States of America the spent radioactive fuel from nuclear reactor sites is stored in ponds which have limited capacity. Unless a solution to the disposal of these wastes is found within the next few years the nuclear power plants will have to close down to avoid the storage ponds becoming choked with this dangerous material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apparently the Government does not consider that it has any responsibility in regard to such matters. So long as the mining corporations can sell the uranium ore at a reasonable profit the Federal Government is not concerned with one of the end products, namely nuclear waste. I will come back to this matter of responsibility shortly, but first of all I refer to the plans of the United States Navy to scuttle 100 old nuclear submarines some 250 kilometres off the north Californian coast at a depth of 4,200 metres. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member says, it is disgraceful. This matter was reported in the Melbourne Age. It was reported that the United States Navy plans to remove the left-over nuclear fuel from the submarines, which it will then scuttle at the rate of three to five each year. However, scientists have pointed out that the radioactive waste could leak from the hulls and be absorbed by bacteria in the water. With the bacteria being consumed by other organisms which in turn are consumed by fish, one can readily see that the end of the food chain will be the final consumers, human beings. As the concentration of radioactivity increases at each stage of the food chain the final level of radioactivity is in contaminated fish, which are consumed by humans. That will mean a lethal dose for the persons concerned. Of course, the nuclear waste I am talking about is low level waste. Obviously it is not as harmful as high level waste, but in the concentrations mentioned previously the effect on human beings is just as lethal . With the discovery of leaking canisters of low level radioactive waste which have been dumped in the Pacific Ocean has come the discovery of high levels of strontium 90 in fish caught near the areas concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now return to the responsibilities of the Federal Government. Does the Government seriously believe that Australia will not be held responsible in the next century for the dumps of nuclear waste which, by that time, will be dotted all over the globe? There will be leaks from those sites and people will develop cancers. In desperation, the countries concerned will turn to the country from which the raw material originated for redress and compensation. In particular, they will be able to point to the fact that Australia knew about the dangers but had no answer to the problems except to keep exporting the yellowcake and to accept the profits from those exports. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the obvious answers to the problem for those countries with the lethal dumps will be that world opinion will insist that Australia should store the radioactive waste in her vast open spaces. In fact not so long ago a member of the United States legislature suggested that radioactive waste could be safely stored under Ayers Rock. This suggestion was no joke; it was proposed quite seriously by an elected representative of the American people. It does not surpise me that such a suggestion has been made. We have huge tracts of desert and other countries would not consider it unreasonable that such areas should be used as dumps for radioactive waste, especially as the raw material came originally from Australian soil. The Australian people should be made aware of the irresponsible attitude of the Minister for National Development and Energy ( Senator Sir John Carrick) to the nuclear waste disposal problem and should insist that no further exports of uranium take place until the problem has been solved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There would be no question in this House as to the contribution made by the Australian agricultural industry to the Australian economy. This industry suffers many threats, not the least of which is pestilence and disease. Tonight I draw the attention of the House to a threat which materialised in Western Australia in 1968 and which could threaten the viability of one of Australia's top pasture grasses. I refer to rye grass and a resultant stock toxin which has become known as annual rye grass toxicity, ARGT. Rye grass toxicity occurs when, for reasons I will shortly describe, the otherwise beneficial rye grass produces a deadly toxic gall. The occurrence is annual and matches the maturing of the rye grass seed. Rye grass is a vigorous and productive grass pasture ideally suited to Australian soil and dry land conditions. There is no known equivalent replacement for its specialist values. I am unable to say accurately what percentage of Australia's grazier farmers rely on this grass, but I can assure honourable members that it is very high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like most other plants, rye grass is a host to a nematode, angina agrostos. This nematode, whilst affecting production to some degree, is otherwise harmless . However, in areas affected by ARGT the nematode is host to a bacterium, of the corynebacteriaceae species. This bacterium accompanies the nematode when, to complete its life cycle, the nematode enters the rye grass seed head. In most cases the nematode then purely converts the seed to a useless gall which houses its eggs. However, on some occasions the bacterium achieves ascendancy and kills the nematode. The bacterium then reacts with the seed, producing a highly toxic gall. </PARA>
<PARA> When these galls are eaten by livestock, the toxins so generated act upon the central nervous system and liver of the animal. Death, preceded by a lengthy period of semi-paralysis and convulsion, is the result. To have observed this phenomenon, especially in larger animals such as mature cattle, is alarming, to say the least. Might I comment at this time, Mr Deputy Speaker, that such an exercise should be recommended to the average suburban animal libber, so that they might get into better order their priorities for expending their time and money in supporting dumb animals?</PARA>
<PARA> The stock can be saved only if removed from the affected padocks after a very small intake of galls. Although certain warning signs are obvious, both on the plants and in the behaviour of affected stock, the time span to react to these indicators is short and they are easily missed in broad acre farming activities. A sheep flock worth many thousands of dollars can be wiped out overnight. Various remedies are promoted but the only sure-fire action is to burn completely the affected paddock. The ARGT normally surfaces between October and December and in the areas concerned this means no pasture regeneration until the following winter. </PARA>
<PARA> The disease is still confined to my electorate and was first identified in 1968 in a very limited area. It has now been identified on 270 properties. These range north to south over 450 kilometres and east and west up to 100 kilometres. The spread is increasing at 20 per cent per annum. It was also identified in South Australia in the 1950s and has recently surfaced in South Africa. Recorded stock losses are low, 21,000. This figure would in reality be a fraction of total losses. Further, no measure can be made of those who have been forced to abandon livestock production completely. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Department of Agriculture, through the Western Australian Animal Health Laboratories and in conjunction with the Department's South Australian counterpart, has waged a lone war against this problem. Expenditure on research in Western Australia over the last five years has totalled $2m, all but $0.5m being donated by industry groups such as the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Meat Research Committee. The rest has been provided by the Western Australian Government. Dr Allen Purcell has led this program for some time. Results to date have included isolation of the toxins, which was an important and difficult step. A dedicated researcher, Dr Paul Vogel, is now working to develop a vaccine, this being a difficult but practical direction. However, early success can be achieved only by expanded effort. Expanded effort means expanded expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers the rapid spread of ARGT in Western Australia there is little doubt that it could condemn all areas of Australian agriculture where rye grass is the principal pasture, with resulting huge losses or disaster when the pendulum swings back from grain production to grazing. This problem is already national. It transcends State borders. Funding cannot remain the responsibility of the States. National funding is imperative. </PARA>

<PARA> A solid majority of Americans favor an immediate freeze on the testing, production and deployment of all nuclear weapons by the US and the Soviet Union, a 'Los Angeles Times' poll has found. </PARA>
<PARA> By a 5 to 3 margin, Americans believe the US does not need any more nuclear weapons for its defence. </PARA>
<PARA> About 59 per cent say that if the US manufactures more nuclear bombs, they would not feel more secure, and 43 per cent believe that more bombs would make them more vulnerable. Only 34 per cent said they would feel more secure ''if the United States manufactured more nuclear bombs''. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey conducted by the 'Times' poll in conjunction with Cable News Network also showed that Americans by a 5-to-1 margin support a nuclear arms control agreement with the Soviet Union. But almost two-thirds doubt that the Soviets could be trusted to keep their end of the bargain. </PARA>
<PARA> By a 57 per cent to 37 per cent margin, Americans support a nuclear arms freeze despite the fact that a substantial 41 per cent believe the Soviets have a stronger nuclear arsenal than the United States. Only 7 per cent feel that the US has nuclear superiority while 41 per cent consider the two superpowers about equal in nuclear strength. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond very briefly to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) on the subject of interest rates. Let me say at the outset that I can understand the concern the honourable member expressed on behalf of his constituents about the current level of interest rates. Nobody finds the present level of interest rates to be comfortable. Nobody wishes that they remain at the present level. The question is whether any- thing can responsibly be done to bring down those interest rates for any lasting period and whether in fact there is any realistic alternative to the present interest rate regime that does not involve other than a very short term reduction in interest rates at the cost of much higher inflation and still higher interest rates in the medium to longer term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member referred to the impact on private interest rate levels of the borrowings of government and semi-government authorities. I must say that I endorse every single remark that the honourable member made in this regard. The Government and I have been arguing for some time now that the overall borrowing requirements of governments have driven up private sector interest rates in this country. I can only urge the honourable member to use his undoubted influence and good offices on the Queensland Government to curb the borrowing proclivities of that Government and its various authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also mentioned the impact on interest rates of the huge Australian Wheat Board borrowing of almost $2,000m this year. That has had a marked impact. He will be aware that a couple of years ago, in lieu of the first advance being paid out of the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank, the Government decided for monetary policy reasons that that money should be borrowed commercially. I would have to say to the honourable member that if in fact all of that had been advanced out of the Rural Credits Department the addition of that amount of money to the money supply would indeed have been quite considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> He mentioned the possibility of releases from the statutory reserve deposits of the trading banks held by the Reserve Bank. This, of course, is a general monetary policy instrument and it is available for general liquidity purposes. It would be one of the things that the Reserve Bank could do over the coming months if it felt that some easing of liquidity was desirable. I would caution very strongly against believing that specific SRD releases are a solution to the problems of interest rates in particular areas. The purpose of the statutory reserve deposits is to influence the general level of liquidity and not the specific interest rate level in a particular sector of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> To put it another way, if there were a special SRD release for a particular sector and if, in a few months, it became necessary for general tightening of liquidity purposes to make an SRD call, where would that call fall? Would it fall on the sector which had received the last release or would it be distributed throughout the entire banking system? What would be the distributional consequences? Would the sector that did not receive it in the first place have to bear a disproportionate burden of the call? That really illustrates, in my view, that, however superficially attractive, the idea of specific SRD releases raises a large number of impracticalities. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also mentioned the question of increasing the interest rates on statutory reserve deposits. This is one of the matters that I mentioned in my statement last week had been discussed between the banks and the Government in the context of other matters that were mentioned in that statement . It is, of course, something that is within the initiative of the Reserve Bank. I simply say again to the honourable member that the possibility of paying an increased interest rate on statutory reserve deposits would arise in the context that, in the event of lending guides being removed as a monetary policy instrument, in all probability the SRD device would be used more frequently as a monetary policy instrument and that as a consequence it would not be unreasonable for there to be an increased rate of interest on the SRDs. The report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System recommended that those deposits bear a market rate. What we are contemplating is only about 5 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government's nuclear safeguards policy announced in May 1977 stipulates conditions of eligibility for countries wishing to receive Australian uranium. This policy requires as a minimum that, in the case of non-nuclear weapon states , sales of uranium will only be made to countries which are parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.</PARA>
<PARA> The entire civil nuclear industry in such countries is subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. In the case of nuclear weapons states Australia requires an assurance that nuclear material supplied for peaceful purposes will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and a commitment to the application of IAEA safeguards to any uranium we might supply for peaceful purposes. In all cases, shipments of uranium cannot be made without the prior conclusion of a bilateral safeguards agreement incorporating all the requirements of Australia's nuclear safeguards policy as outlined by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1977.</PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that these are minimum conditions for countries to be eligible to receive Australian uranium. Wider foreign policy considerations may also be taken into account and the Government reserves the right to refrain from permitting export should this be appropriate in the light of such considerations .</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that by exporting uranium in accordance with Australia 's nuclear safeguards policy, Australia is actively contributing to international efforts to strengthen the international non-proliferation regime and as a reliable supplier within this framework, is contributing to the peaceful energy needs of eligible customer countries.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4U4">Mr Killen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Royal Australian Air Force currently has 24 F111 aircraft of which 6 are planned to be in scheduled servicing at any one time leaving 18 aircraft, that is 75 per cent of the F111 fleet, available for missions. Similarly, there are 83 Mirage aircraft on the RAAF inventory, including 3 aircraft based at the Aircraft Research and Development Unit, Edinburgh which, although operational, are presently instrumented for trials flying. Of the remaining 80 Mirages, the RAAF plans on 25 being in scheduled servicing at any one time leaving 55 aircraft or approximately 69 per cent available for missions.</PARA>
<PARA> However, from time to time unforeseen problems may further reduce aircraft availability. For example, in addition to the 2 or 3 F111 aircraft presently receiving scheduled servicings, 9 F111 are in the United States undergoing a Cold Proof Load Testing program thus leaving approximately 50 per cent of the F111 fleet available for missions. Moreover, 5 Mirages are currently unavailable due to the RAAF Wing Refurbishment program, thus reducing to approximately 62 per cent the availability of Mirages for missions.</PARA>
<PARA> Once both programs are completed, a higher percentage of both aircraft types are expected to be available.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The decision by the Executive of CSIRO to close the Culgoora radioheliograph by 1985 was based on three factors:</PARA>
<PARA> scientific leadership necessary to keep the heliograph as a first-rate scientific research instrument was not available.</PARA>
<PARA> major capital investments (of the order of $1.5m) would have been required to upgrade the mechanical and electronic systems of the heliograph. Additional staff resources (between 6-10 people) would also have been required</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Whilst the levels of aircraft noise near airports can be quite high, the exposure time is much below that of established Australian Standard criteria for hearing conservation. Also, research carried out to date is not conclusive in relation to the effect of aircraft noise on a person's general health. Several overseas studies which have reported increased incidences of morbidity are under question because of poor control techniques employed in the social surveying procedures. Other studies have reported no direct evidence of an association between aircraft noise and health.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) A significant amount of published research has been carried out throughout the world on the subject of the effect of noise, including aircraft noise, on man, and this is continuing. There are considerable practical problems in relation to methodology in the study of the effect of noise on health which are virtually impossible to control. Because of this, commissioning a study within Australia on the matter is not considered to be warranted at this time.</PARA>
