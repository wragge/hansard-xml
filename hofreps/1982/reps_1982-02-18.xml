<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Librarians and library users throughout the nation call for the exemption of books, periodicals and newspapers from the imposition of sales taxes.</PARA>
<PARA> The tax exempt status of libraries and schools will not protect them from general cost increases which sales tax and its collection will cause. Indeed, exemption claims on millions of items per year will themselves add to the cost burden of both libraries and suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA> This tax is socially injurious and unworkable, and a burden on education, science and culture.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will exempt books, periodicals including newspapers from the proposed sales tax.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The 17.5 per cent sales tax on pet foods places unreasonable financial strain on pensioners and other pet owners.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. A pet is not a luxury item for many owners, it fills a vital part in their lives and, in many cases, is therapeutically beneficial, particularly for families and pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The added financial strain may cause many people to abandon or otherwise dispose of their pets, thus adding to the distress of already disadvantaged people and further overloading the resources of animal welfare societies.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. In view of the abandonment of sales tax on veterinary drugs, it seems inconsistent to tax pet foods when food is as much a basic need as medicines.</PARA>
<PARA> We therefore request that this tax on pet food be immediately withdrawn.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Budget imposition of 2.5 per cent additional Sales Tax to both existing sales tax items and to previously exempt goods:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) will add to the regressivity of the tax structure by imposing a similar burden on all sections of the community-regardless of the capacity to pay tax;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) will be highly inflationary and a disincentive to economic performance in key sectors of manufacturing industry, e.g. car manufacturing, textile and footwear industries;</PARA>

<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under 'Cosmetics' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to : (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parliament take immediate and positive action to avert possible threats posed to women's health by implementation of the above measures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The developments on the Australian share markets in recent weeks mirror very significantly what has happened to share markets in other parts of the world. Inevitably different people will have different views as to why movements of this kind should occur in our share markets and also share markets in other parts of the world. I believe that in significant measure they are a reflection of expectations regarding interest rates around the world. It is a phenomenon that when expectations regarding interest rates worsen they do have consequences on share markets. I think that underlines the necessity for governments to follow policies which take as much pressure as possible off interest rates and that means not expanding Budget deficits or taking other measures which will only increase pressures further on interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member and the House that the Government has not shelved its plans to revamp its housing policies. I was disappointed to note recent statements in the Press that all plans had been shelved. Quite obviously, in this case the information that fell from the back of a truck was a decoy. It is a highly complex issue. The Government is not prepared to make ad hoc policies, as was the practice of the Opposition when it was in government. We are making our decisions in line with an examination of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and, of course, it is necessary to look at any assistance in the overall budgetary context.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last two or three days there has been a very serious situation in Tasmania which has been relieved to some extent yesterday and this morning, I understand, by more favourable weather conditions. The possibility of a very serious situation is likely to remain for some time. As soon as we heard of the difficulties I assured the Premier that the Commonwealth would stand ready to do whatever it could to assist. The night before last 150 troops were flown to Tasmania to relieve fire fighters who had been at it for a long while. I think they flew down overnight and were at the fire very early in the morning. That was a very prompt response by the Minister for Defence to that request. The honourable member for Denison was down there to see for himself the concerns that people had and he has spoken to me about that. This is a very serious matter and the honourable member is right to ask what the Commonwealth is doing and can do to assist. The Premier is coming to see me this afternoon, not just about this matter. I have not talked to him since he became Premier and I understand that he wants to discuss one or two matters before the Premiers Conference tomorrow. I had a very useful and productive discussion with the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Prime Minister noted that his Minister for Housing and Construction appears indifferent to the result of an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey which has revealed that the level of home ownership in Australia has fallen from 73.8 per cent in 1978 to 71.9 per cent in 1980?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of changed conditions there are two main problems in the housing area. One is obviously the quantity of funds available for lending for building purposes. This has arisen because of the changed structure of interest rates. It is a matter that is obviously very serious. In addition to that there is the problem of price. That can be influenced not only by the interest rate that has to be charged but also by the capital cost of the land or of the land and the house. The Government is examining both of these matters against the background of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. It ought to be understood that we in these parties have an overriding concern to make sure that access to home ownership in Australia remains as a high national priority, capable of being achieved by average Australians. We are conducting our discussions against that background.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I add only that it is not just the policies of the Commonwealth that are important in relation to these matters but also the policies of the State governments. In Victoria it would take about three years of average earnings to buy a decent, average house. In New South Wales it would take about 4 1/2 years of average earnings to buy a house in the Sydney area. The Commonwealth policies are the same in relation to each so the difference is obviously the Wran Labor policies which are making it enormously difficult and costly for people in the Sydney area to buy their homes. The honourable gentleman knows also that Victoria has the highest household income of any State; it has the highest rate of home ownership of any State. What the honourable gentleman has just suggested is a nonsense. Victoria also has the highest savings bank savings of any State. On these grounds the Wran Labor Government needs to look very much to its record and what it has done to the people of New South Wales. If the honourable gentleman is capable of working out the differences in the weekly payment charges on average families in New South Wales compared with Victoria he will find that the increased capital value of a house and land in Sydney is adding enormously to the repayment problems of Australians in the Sydney metropolitan area. Mr Wran has got to take responsibility for that and I hope that he is addressing himself to the problem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has in place significant measures in condemnation of martial law in Poland. These complement measures that the United States has taken and indeed measures that other Western allies have taken. Also, there is no doubt about the complicity of the Soviet Union in events in Poland. It certainly had prior knowledge of the imposition of martial law and has been standing behind the regime very significantly in support of it. There is no credible sign yet that General Jaruzelski is prepared to allow an end to martial law or to release political detainees. The restrictions and the repressions that are obvious in Poland continue. There has been no resumption of the process of political dialogue which had been taking place before as a result of discussions between Solidarity and the earlier Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While we condemn what has happened in Poland very strongly we are, at the same time, very concerned also about the hardship for many Polish families and the very real difficulties which would be hard for most people in Australia to envisage but which are part of daily life in Poland. If any honourable members have had discussions with people who have visited Poland recently they will have learnt of and will understand the very great human suffering that is present daily in Poland. That is why many people have sought to encourage humanitarian aid. That is flowing through. It is being managed and organised very significantly by the Catholic Church. On the advice available to us it is being delivered to the really needy people in Poland. The Government earlier made a donation of $1m to the fund for the support of Poland. There have been significant contributions from people around Australia to that appeal. The matter is a very serious one. As a result, the Government has made a decision that donations to the fund during the course of this financial year should be tax deductible. It would remain, obviously, within our capacity to review that particular matter at the end of the financial year, if there were a continuing need for further encouragement of donations from Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Treasurer, follows the question that I asked of the Prime Minister a few minutes ago and which he helped the Prime Minister by answering. He will recall that I pointed out that the collapse in the Australian stock exchange as a result of the Government's fierce credit squeeze had, for instance, reduced a $100,000 investment from a lump sum superannuation settlement to a real worth of less than $60,000 in the period from October 1980 to this month. He will also recall that he claimed that the experience here was comparable to that of other advanced countries of the world. Is he aware, in fact, that the experience in Australia is far in excess of the experience of the stock exchanges of the industrialised capitals of the world? Is he aware that, for the period stated, the nominal fall in the Australian stock exchange index exceeded 30 per cent, that in the United States of America it was only 4 per cent, in Germany 3 per cent and that, in fact, in the United Kingdom there was an increase of 16 per cent and in Japan an increase of 25 per cent? In view of this, I ask the Treasurer: Will he address himself to the heart of the question that I put to the Prime Minister, namely, will the Government withdraw from the vicious credit squeeze it is now imposing on the Australian community, which is destroying the value of equity investments on the Australian stock exchange for tens of thousands of small investors and especially for the retired who are now increasingly confronted by the spectre of poverty?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the earlier question from the Leader of the Opposition I made two points. First, I rejected his claim that the Government's monetary policies represent a vicious credit squeeze. That is a total misreading of the present situation. As a corollary to that point, I also made the observation that any change in policy which exacerbated interest rate pressures would further compound the difficulties to which the honourable gentleman's question was addressed. There is no doubt that world stock markets have gone through difficult times in recent months. The honourable gentleman has produced some statistical comparisons. I will analyse those comparisons and then provide any further response I can. Quite obviously, the validity of the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition regarding those statistical comparisons depends upon the relative buoyancy or otherwise of Australian stock markets in earlier months and upon the commencement date of the comparisons.

In relation to the Builders Labourers Federation, it has been condemned even by elements of the union movement.

This situation has not been created by you but by the comments of the Prime Minister and we are placed in the incredible position where the honourable member for Wills is expected-the parliamentary forms have it that he should withdraw but in fact the implication of it is apologise-to apologise for the offence of the Prime Minister. No self-respecting person is going to accept that. Within that transcript which the Prime Minister has obviously read it is declared that under Mr Cain a Labor government would not ignore the findings of a royal commission, that it would consider those findings even after the election and that it would accept that the inquiries continue after the election if they are still in train.

<PARA> I recall a number of discussions that I had on a number of occasions with a very good friend and colleague, Mr Michael Maher, the former State member for Drummoyne, when I was a member of the New South Wales Parliament. Both Michael Maher and I were concerned about many of the things that we were wanting to achieve for our individual electorates. On many occasions we were told that the things we were wanting to do simply could not be done because of the insufficiency of funds being made available by the Commonwealth Government. Despite that type of response, Michael Maher's dogged persistence in promoting the interests of his electorate achieved many outstanding results. The excellence of Michael Maher's representations and the commitment that he had to his constituents saw him increase his majority from something like 100 to about 12,000, a magnificent effort which reflected the dedication and the competence of Michael Maher and the sound judgment of his constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall in particular one statement that was made to me by my colleague Michael Maher because of that response. He said: 'If these problems are being created in Canberra by the Government in Canberra perhaps that is where we should be'. I am delighted that Michael Maher has now made a decision to join us in this place and to attempt to influence the decisions that are made concerning the ability of the New South Wales and all the other State governments to meet the increasing demands that are made upon them. The reality is that the present Commonwealth Government has been reducing the financial capacity of the State governments to do the things that they are expected to do. In addition to that the present Government has been divesting itself of responsibilities and passing those responsibilities on to the States without giving the States the financial capacity to carry out those responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the fact that the Commonwealth Government and spokesmen for the Commonwealth Government have denied that assertion, I think it is as well that we should examine the facts. The facts are these: Since this Government came to office during the financial year 1975-76 Commonwealth Government revenue has grown from $18,276m to $40,716m this financial year, representing an increase of 123 per cent. During the same period the consumer price index of costs and prices in Australia has increased by only 80 per cent. If Commonwealth revenue had increased at the same rate as the rate of inflation-that is, if it had maintained its real value during the term of the present Government-it would have increased by $14,621m. In fact, total Commonwealth Government revenue has increased by $22,440m. In other words, Commonwealth Government revenue in real terms this financial year is $7,819m greater than it was when this Government came to office in 1975. That is the position concerning Commonwealth Government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the postion of the States. In the first financial year of this Government, as a result of the last Budget of the Labor Government, total funds allocated to the States were $8,555m. This financial year they totalled $13,663m , representing an increase of 60 per cent. As I said, the level of inflation during that period was 80 per cent. If total funds allocated to the States had increased at the same rate as the level of inflation had increased-that is, if the real value of funds allocated to the States had been maintained-they would have increased by $6,844m during that period. In fact, they increased by only $5 ,108m. In other words, the States are worse off in real terms to the extent of $ 1,736m in this year alone. The total amount over the past six years by which the States are worse off is well in excess of $3,500m. The disadvantaged position in which the States have been placed has been brought about as a result of deliberate decisions by this Government, which then goes out to the public and maintains to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> The position for the States and their residents is even more horrific in relation to capital funds. In the current financial year, 1981-82, general purpose capital funds are at a level of $1,307m. In 1975-76 general purpose capital funds totalled $1,291m, which means that they have increased during the period of this Government by 1.2 per cent. I remind the House that inflation during that period has increased by 80 per cent. That is a damning indictment of the financial policies, the federalist policies, being pursued by this Government. To keep pace with inflation those general purpose capital funds to the States should have increased by $1,033m. In fact, they increased by only $ 16m. In real terms State capital grants are worse off to the extent of $1,017m in 1981-82 compared with 1975-76. How frustrating it is for members of the New South Wales Parliament, when they receive all these demands and requests from their constituents, to have to say: 'I am sorry but in many cases I cannot deliver the sorts of things you are seeking because of the insufficiency of the funds being made available by the Federal Government'. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation does not relate to all the States. The unfortunate reality at this time is that New South Wales alone has been deliberately sabotaged by the Fraser Government. As an example I refer to the figures per head of population for Commonwealth funds to the States in the way of general purpose grants for this year. The average for the States is $460 per head. For Queensland the figure is $559 per head; for South Australia it is $576 per head; for Western Australia it is $617 per head; and for Tasmania it is $754 per head. But what is it for New South Wales? New South Wales, the most populous and the largest State , receives $387 per head-about half the amount granted to the highest per capita grant State. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only can details of that kind be compounded but we can also look at other examples. The Commonwealth Grants Commission was charged with reporting on the allocation of funds to the States and it reported early last year, following a 2 1/2-year inquiry. The report was available for the Premiers Conference held in June 1981. It recommended that New South Wales be allocated an additional $118m, that Victoria be allocated an additional $68.2m and that Queensland be allocated an additional $108.3m. Despite the fact that New South Wales should have received an additional $118m, it received only $24.5m. I look forward to welcoming a great representative of the people, Michael Maher, when he takes his seat in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was my good fortune in January to join an Australian parliamentary delegation which visited Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the Union of Arab Emirates, Oman, Egypt, Israel and Jordan. The delegation was extremely well received in all those nations I have mentioned. Indeed, Australia is held in the greatest esteem. However, I want especially to talk about our visit to Egypt. Egypt is a country with which Australia has very good trading relations. It purchases huge quantities of our wheat, less quantities of our wool, our meat, our lead and our iron ore. We in turn, of course, do not buy very much from that country. Possibly we buy some cotton fabrics and some dried vegetables. So the balance of trade is very much in favour of Australia. Recently a very large sale of Australian wheat was made to Egypt and it is interested in other exports from this country. Egypt's main revenue, of course, is derived from oil, the Suez Canal and tourism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What did concern the members of our delegation were the very poor facilities the Australian Government provides for the Ambassador and his staff. We were shocked at the conditions of the facilities provided by Australia for the Ambassador, the trade commissioners and the members of our staff. They are housed in a Mobil Oil building. The conditions are shocking. The lighting is bad . The ventilation is shocking. The reception room is dismal. The air conditioning does not work. The Ambassador's office and those of the other officials are totally inadequate. The building is most unsatisfactory. We should be doing something about improving it. There is also another section for the Australian immigration office which is a little better than that provided in the Mobil Oil building overlooking the Nile. </PARA>
<PARA> While we were there we accompanied the Ambassador across the city of Cairo to a new building which has just about been completed and the Ambassador would like to have two floors of the accommodation that is available there. He has made tentative arrangements. Indeed, this new building is in a very fine part of the city of Cairo and would provide most suitable accommodation for the Ambassador, the members of our immigration staff and the whole embassy staff. I think we have about 27 or 28 members on our staff in the embassy with four or five staff members in our immigration department. We as a government should be looking at providing this suitable accommodation which is so necessary for the increasing of trade and the prestige of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony), the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) will take note of the very poor conditions for our staff in Cairo. The image of Australia is certainly impaired as a result of the poor conditions. I have made a submission to the Deputy Prime Minister, pointing out to him the problems associated with our embassy there. Let us hope that we will achieve some results. If we are to develop our trade and if our ambassadorial officials are given decent conditions, it will be to the advantage of all concerned. I might add that the Ambassador's residence is excellent. There is no problem with the personal accommodation of the Ambassador and, I understand, that the staff are also quite happy with their conditions. While the delegation was in Cairo it took part in the Australia Day celebrations, which was attended by more than 400 guests. It was a splendid occasion for Australia. More than 400 ambassadors and their staff turned up to celebrate Australia Day. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I cannot but stress the importance of improving the situation in Cairo. I know that a tight financial situation exists, not only in this country but throughout the world, but if we are to develop our trade and elevate Australia's image we must do something about the situation of our officials in Cairo. Egypt has 40 million people and will be increasing its trade with Australia. Let us provide our staff with decent facilities. This will improve our standing in Egypt, will be to the benefit of this country and will bring in the valuable export income which is so necessary to our economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was fascinated by the travelogue delivered by the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe), but I would like to come a little closer to home and talk this morning about building schools rather than building palaces on the banks of the Nile. I enter this debate to deplore the deficiencies in federal policy and funding as they affect the quality of education in New South Wales. There can be no doubt that successive cuts in Federal funding have placed schools in that State in a very bad position indeed. The New South Wales Minister for Education said last year that Federal funds had declined, in real terms, by between 11 per cent and 12 per cent since the election of the Fraser Government. During that time New South Wales schools have lost $43m. The guidelines issued last year left New South Wales schools another $23m down. The Minister described it as a disgraceful blow against public schools and their pupils. Despite these difficulties the New South Wales Government has made valiant attempts to work in the interests of school children throughout the State. It is very pleasing to note that one of the State's newest and largest high schools was opened recently at Concord.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tertiary sector students in the State fare little better. They are battling along on the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance, which is below the poverty line and is paid only to those whose families qualify under a restrictive and unfair means test. The prospects for an improvement in TEAS are nil as this Government pushes ahead with its ill-judged student loans scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of technical and further education, despite all the self- congratulation that this Government and this Minister appear to be addicted to as some kind of escape from reality, the reality is that TAFE is still the poor relation of the education family. Despite the fact that TAFE serves about 60 per cent of all post-secondary students, it receives only about 11 per cent of federal funding. It is small wonder that TAFE has been squeezed and that services in some areas have had to be cut in the face of this funding crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to migrant education. It is important to note the extreme deficiencies in this area through failure in government policy and failure in federal funding. Last year, in School Report, a publication produced by teacher and parent organisations, the following statement under the heading 'Help for Migrants is Meagre' appeared:</PARA>
<PARA> It is an unfortunate fact that Australian governments have been quick to bring migrant workers to Australia and slow to provide for their welfare and for their children's education. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well known that many workers migrate in order to get a better deal for their children, and although it is obvious that poor knowledge of English is a severe handicap in Australian schools, government efforts in English teaching for migrant children have been pitiful. </PARA>
<PARA> Substantial programs were started only in the early '70s, and they still cover only slightly more than half of the children needing attention. In spite of this inadequate effort, conservative governments in the late '70s have been cutting back on spending for migrant education. </PARA>
<PARA>I concede that there was a miserable increase in last year's Budget but that increase was inadequate. At the end of 1980, in Australian schools, there were 576,000 students from non-English speaking backgrounds, 211,000 of them in New South Wales. That is one fifth of the total school population. The migrant education program for these children is far from adequate. I would like to consider some of the reasons for this and suggest some ways in which the situation could be improved. Obviously, first of all, this situation has arisen because of inadequate band-aid 'ad hoc' funding, but it goes a little deeper than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Migrant education is unsatisfactory in this country because it is subjected to a mishmash of administrative arrangements. The system for migrant education is far too complex. The programs involve a number of State and Federal Government departments and a number of statutory bodies, including the Schools Commission and the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. At the delivery end there is a whole range of bodies-government schools, non-government schools, colleges and community organisations. There is clearly a need, if the system is to work in the interests of migrants and their children, for reorganisation and rationalisation of the administration of migrant programs. In addition, the system of teacher employment is quite unsatisfactory. For example, most adult migrant education teachers are casual teachers. In New South Wales less than 20 per cent of the adult migrant education teachers are permanent. The New South Wales Government recognises the difficulty. It would like to take on additional permanent teachers; in fact it is willing to take on 160 additional permanent teachers in this field if the Federal Government will recognise its responsibility and make those funds available. </PARA>
<PARA> Migrant education has also suffered through the destruction of research, planning and review mechanisms-mechanisms, I might add, destroyed by this Government. The Curriculum Development Centre has done valuable work in migrant education. The Education Research and Development Committee has commissioned and done work itself of great value in the field of migrant education. But both the CDC and the ERDC, which have done great work in this field, were axed by the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the razor gang report, in April last year. A further vehicle for planning, co-ordination and review, and for bringing together the different threads of effort in this field, has also been axed. In his statement of 4 June last year the Minister for Education said that the State co-ordinators of the multicultural education program would no longer be meeting regularly on a national basis and they would be no longer publishing separate reports on their work. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of adult migrant education there have been numerous criticisms of the deficiencies of that system-criticisms too numerous for me to mention in detail this morning. They include the fifth report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, a statement by the Australian Council on Population and Ethnic Affairs in 1977, a statement by the Good Neighbour Council of Victoria and, of course, the report of the Galbally Review of Post-arrival Programs and Services to Migrants Committee. In addition, a great deal of implied criticism is contained in the education policy of the Greek Welfare Association. There is no doubt that the Government has failed in this field of migrant education, and this failure shows up in particular geographic areas and in particular electorates. The 1976 census showed the areas and the electorates favoured by migrants and it shows, therefore, the clusters of need. The census grouped together electorates on the basis of the proportion of population born in non- English speaking countries. The electorate with the highest population of people born in non-English speaking countries is in fact Grayndler in New South Wales with 31.62 per cent. Most of the electorates with a high population of people from non-English speaking countries are in the cities. The electorate of Melbourne, was second highest, followed by Wills, Lalor, Gellibrand, Sydney, Kingsford-Smith, Melbourne Ports and then Prospect in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Number 10 in the list is the electorate of Lowe in New South Wales, where 23.3 per cent of the population were born in non-English speaking countries. I am glad that the people of Lowe will very soon have an opportunity to register their disapproval at this shoddy treatment and neglect by this Government. In speaking of shoddy treatment in relation to Lowe, I should comment on the shoddy treatment that the former right honourable member for Lowe received in this place on Tuesday. Even though the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was tongue tied on that day, I would have thought that someone on the Government side, if not the Prime Minister, might have been gracious enough to have marked the departure of Sir William McMahon with some words of tribute and farewell. After all, the former member was a Prime Minister and a Treasurer and occupied five other portfolios. He served as leader and deputy leader of his Party. Possibly the greatest service to his Party was to hold his seat for 33 years under very difficult circumstances. I have no doubt that he survived some close shaves because of the service that he gave to his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> On that point, the electors of Lowe are indeed fortunate that they have available Michael Maher of the Australian Labor Party, a man with an even greater commitment to elected service. He is a family man and lives in the electorate. He is an experienced parliamentarian and has long experience in working for electorates and for the betterment of people and their families. I have no doubt that Michael Maher will serve the electors of Lowe with distinction when they elect him on 13 March as their member to represent them in this place. </PARA>

That gives more proof to the claim that the union movement controls the Labor Party. As we know, resolutions of that conference are binding on the Parliamentary party in Victoria.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will correct that. Mr Michael Easson is apparently the education officer of the Labour Council. I am sure the honourable member for Grayndler recognises it. Let us look at what Mr Michael Easson says about the socialist left and the control of the conference in Victoria. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The combined vote of the Socialist Left and the Independents-who are embraced in an alliance to control the Victorian ALP-fluctuates between 58.37 per cent and 56.50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting because it means that the socialist left controls the State conference of the Labor Party in Victoria, that at any time among other factions and other alliances there will be wheels and deals within the Labor Party at the conference, and that between 43 per cent to the mid-50s and from the mid-50s to 60 per cent of that conference can be controlled by the socialist left. That is easy to do because 13 per cent make up the independent faction with which, I think, Mr Cain and Senator Button are aligned. The other factions are known. There is the socialist left faction and there is the centre unity faction of the Labor Party. So the pro-revolutionary socialist left, which is sympathetic to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Irish Republican Army, controls the Australian Labor Party in Victoria. People in the Victorian Labor Party may say that the Party is not controlled by the socialist left but that is fiction and false. No one can represent the Labor Party in Victoria without representing the socialist left. </PARA>
<PARA> There are international implications in this control of the Labor Party. Let us look at the Omega navigation base in Gippsland. Omega is used for navigation by commercial aircraft and merchant shipping. It is also used by submarines. The ALP's foreign affairs committee has passed a resolution in Victoria in favour of dismantling the Omega tower and navigation base in Gippsland. That is what the Labor Party would do. Having the power to control the conference, the foreign affairs committee will take that resolution to the next ALP State conference--</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Cain, the Leader of the Labor Party, is saying that the ALP will repeal essential services legislation which was responsible for getting milk to mothers and children who were denied it by the trade union movement during a strike last year. Mr Cain is going to repeal all that legislation. There will be no secret ballots in Victoria. There will be no essential services legislation in Victoria to control unions. Even the Vital Projects Act, which is similar to the New South Wales Act, will be repealed because Mr Cain does not have the power that Mr Wran has in New South Wales. That is what is going to happen. The unions are going to run riot in Victoria, as they are running riot in New South Wales. Let us look at today's headlines in respect of New South Wales, which is under a Labor government. They read: 'Food, petrol crisis'. This is what is happening in New South Wales under a Wran government today. The headlines also state: 'Trains back but cars, shops hit'. That is what will happen. The glitter has gone off Mr Wran. This will happen if Labor gets into office in Victoria. There will be no power; there will be strikes. Sydney is the strike capital of Australia. There will be no investment in New South Wales because there is no electricity for factories. There will be investment in Victoria because of the industrial capacity of the electricity commission in that State. Victoria will be the investment capital of Australia under a Liberal government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To be quite serious, I think it is most important to look at the iniquitous ways that this Government has treated the pensioners of Australia, the people who have made this country what it is. In 1975 the present Prime Minister promised that the real value of pensions would be preserved. In 1975 when that statement was made the age pension was 23.2 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is considerably less than that now. I will come back to that in a few moments. The present Government also made a number of outrageous promises which it has subsequently breached in relation to pensioners. Since this Government came to power in November 1975 it has done a number of things that have drastically reduced the living standards of pensioners and those on social security benefits in this country. At one stage it reduced pension increases from twice yearly adjustments to once yearly adjustments. It restricted the cost of living allowances for pensioners over 70 years of age as well as their eligibility under the means test. The Government reversed the Labor Government's decision to pay free of means test pensions to people aged 69. It reduced the subsidy on aged persons housing from two to one. The announced Fraser policy of a three-year program costing $225m has been cut to $150m for three years and this is about two-thirds of what the previous Labor Government spent on housing the aged in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, on 26 February last year I drew the attention of this House and the Minister to the fact that the Government was even then proposing to tax the amount of money earned by pensioners who are in receipt of fringe benefits. At that time I warned the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) that the Government needed to bring in supplementary legislation to change the tax threshold as it affected pensioners. Last year I brought to the attention of the House the situation that people would be paying tax on the amount of money they earned over and above the pension, even though they were on fringe benefits. As I said, the Government did nothing and indeed last year 250,000 pensioners paid income tax on the $20 they earned above the pension which is rather an iniquitous circumstance for a government to apply. This year many more pensioners will pay income tax on the amount of money they earn above the pension. By November this year more than 270,000 single aged pensioners on fringe benefits will be added to the number of pensioners who pay income tax. Under the present system nine out of every 10 single pensioners on the maximum rate will pay tax this fiscal year. The reason for this is that single pensioners who have been receiving a total income of $89.70 a week, that is the $69.70 pension plus the $20 they are allowed to earn and still retain the fringe benefits, have gone through the tax free threshold which is $80.70 a week. Each one of those pensioners will pay $150 in tax this year. The Government is taking $3 a week out of the pockets of the pensioners of Australia. I do not know how people can live on $89.70 a week but the Fraser Government obviously believes that they can live on at least $3 less than that a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously this Government does not care what happens to the pensioners of this country. But I am sure that the iniquitous way in which this Government has treated the pensioners of this country will be brought home to the Government in the Lowe by-election to be held in a few weeks. My electorate of Grayndler and the electorate of Lowe have a higher number of pensioners than most electorates in Australia. In my electorate 12 1/2 per cent of the population are age pensioners. In the electorate of Lowe 14 per cent of the population are age pensioners. Those people will take a very close look at what this Government's policy is doing to the aged when they vote in the Lowe by-election on 13 March. When they do look at the Government's policy they will see a very sorry policy. But when they have a look at how the Government looks after itself and the previous right honourable member they will see that the Government has been rather more generous. Last year we saw the Government put through this House a Bill which specifically gave Sir William McMahon, the former right honourable member for Lowe and a man who admits that he receives the age pension, $500,000. That was very nice for Sir William McMahon. I think in the latter years of his life as the right honourable member for Lowe he forgot where the place was because he did not go near it and in that time he received an age pension--</PARA>

If they move into a higher tax bracket without changes to the tax scales, as would happen with any other citizens of this country, that might happen. But to say that 15,100 pensioners in the electorate of Lowe will automatically be paying $3 in tax a week this year is absolutely untrue and misleading. In fact if one looks at the number of pensioners who paid tax in 1975-76 under the Hayden Budget one sees that some 400,000 pensioners had to pay tax and with one stroke of the pen when we reformed the tax scales some 18 months later the Liberal Government took off about 250,000 people. I just hope that in the campaigning in the eletorate of Lowe these statements that are meant to put fear into the hearts of pensioners- older people who genuinely worry when such statements are bandied around-will be understood and that the pensioners will understand what the truth is. They will get the truth if they read statements from the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) and if they listen to statements that are made by people on this side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8Q7">Mr SAINSBURY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no fault with the other clock. Perhaps the honourable member ought to look behind him occasionally. New South Wales has been suffering for some time with mismanagement in general. That is beginning to catch up with the State Government; but in particular we are suffering from a misallocation of resources away from country areas to the cities of New South Wales. As a person who represents the country areas, it does concern me a great deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will acknowledge that the Federal Government has some direct input into the allocation of resources in country areas in Australia. I am always vocal with my own Government when I see any misallocation of that nature occur. In particular, in recent months I have had quite a lot to say about the tariff debate because, after all, the export industries which are very strong in my electorate suffer a great deal because of the privileges given to certain industries usually located in the cities. My views are well known nationally on that issue. I do not propose to pursue it today. I also acknowledge that in one area where my Government has control, namely in that of Telecom Australia and Australia Post, at the present time there may well be a misallocation of resources towards people in the city. </PARA>
<PARA> On that score I am prepared to take up the matter with my own Government and pursue it vigorously. Nevertheless, most people in Australia have their every- day activities constrained usually by State governments-not Federal governments- in the sense that the State governments control the roads, the hospitals, the rail services, the police services and the educational services. Whenever decisions are made in those areas they are essentially ones for the State government. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) noted earlier some misgivings in relation to New South Wales, in particular in terms of how much money the New South Wales Government has got from the Federal Government in recent years. I just want to mention one point there. He raised some figures and I acknowledge that the Federal Government has some sort of an input in this area . But I would like to note that between the 1977 and 1981 Budgets there was an increase of $1,324m in the amount provided to New South Wales from all sources from the Federal Government. That represents an increase, on my calculations, of about 41 1/2 per cent. The honourable member for Hunter might say that that does not quite keep up with inflation. I have not done that calculation, but it must be very close to keeping up with inflation. I want to point out that on top of that $1,324m some other factors ought to be taken into account. Firstly, in this year the New South Wales Government has some sources of revenue from health collections that it did not have before-they were created by our own measures. Secondly, there was a substantial increase in funds available through the New South Wales Government ceasing to pay teacher scholarships and by the Commonwealth picking up the tab by way of Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme scholarships. That ought to be remembered. Thirdly, there has been-this is an indirect effect-an enormous increase in the amount of Commonwealth funding by way of transfer payments to people in New South Wales; so through pensions and other benefits there has been a very high capacity on the part of people to pay charges which are being collected all the time by the State Government quite directly from revenue given to individuals in New South Wales. On top of that, the increase in population we experienced in the time that we needed capital works for schools just is not occurring in New South Wales. As we all know, the strong growth states are Western Australia and Queensland where there are more enlightened governments. That has meant that the pressure on capital works in schools is far less than it was when a Liberal-Country Party government came into power in New South Wales in the mid 1960s and when, concomitantly, there was a big increase in spending on schools. If we really look at the situation there has been around a 50 per cent increase in usable funds by New South Wales from the Federal Government. In the face of all that, what is the State Government doing to my area? The rail services are shot to pieces. There was a very big stunt in New South Wales just prior to the last State election when the express passenger transport train travelled around. It was called by many people 'Mr Wran's train'. I tell honourable members that there is no prospect that my electors will see or be able to use this train for many a long day. In a town like Goulburn, which is on the main Sydney-Melbourne line, I can promise, under the present policies of the State Government, that very few passengers will be able to get on that train. Perhaps this time next year I will be able to catalogue that disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The freight costs for people in country areas have been savagely increased on at least two occasions by the State Government. They represent a very strong impost on wheat growers. They have been a very strong impost on the coal industry, an industry which is suffering already under the industrial policies of the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Centralisation has begun to occur again in New South Wales. Our road system is suffering drastically especially in the national highways area in New South Wales. In my own electorate there is now a reallocation of resources towards the magic Sydney-Newcastle axis, an area which, in terms of national highways, is not one of national significance; it is more one of intrastate significance. We are finding that funds are being chiselled out of the Hume Highway projects and the Federal Highway projects in favour of the more parochial areas, the stronger Labor areas of Sydney and Newcastle. In terms of general mismanagement in New South Wales, leaving aside the wages demands that were deliberately fostered by the State Government, especially in the electricity area, we need to focus on the disaster in electricity in New South Wales. Very poor maintenance-which means, in my terms as an engineer mismanagement in the electricity area-has meant that the New South Wales people are beginning to suffer in terms of services and in terms of costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The State Government has used up all the resources as far as we can see that were left around for a rainy day and the statutory authorities of New South Wales. Frankly, it is looking to us as citizens in the country of New South Wales as if our own State is going broke. It is the old situation that whenever the socialists get into power they spend everybody else's money and tear down the enterprise of the State or Commonwealth they are looking after. It happened in Canberra for three years. I certainly hope it is not allowed to happen in Victoria in the upcoming election. Thankfully the tide is beginning to turn. I think that the New South Wales people are understanding that the policies of New South Wales that are milking and have milked our State and tended to turn it bankrupt are not suitable for the State and this will be shown in the coming by- election in Lowe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will forget about the other suburbs. That is a fair enough grouping. There is a very big migrant complement in the seat of Lowe. There are a lot of schools and churches in the area and it has a very interesting socio- economic mix. Despite all the variances in income, background and social affinity, the people of Lowe probably share the aspirations of the rest of the people of Australia. They want to own a home. They want to see that the education system works properly. They want to see that there are employment opportunities for their kids. Generally, they want a better life for themselves. I feel that in this month of February in 1982 the people of Lowe and the rest of Australia are suffering great disillusionment. They look at this country, a country so rich in so many ways, but a country that is mismanaged by a government in which they placed their trust. They feel frustrated and disappointed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1949 the residents of Lowe have supported a Liberal government. They have supported the right honourable Sir William McMahon, even in his dotage. Even in the last bursts of his senility in 1980 they supported him. Probably the greatest claim to fame he had in his declining years was that he was the only politician in Australian history to get a parliamentary salary, an old age pension and the family allowance all at the same time. That is probably his apotheosis. On 13 March the people in Lowe will have an opportunity to exhibit their disappointment and disillusionment with this Government and to elect a Labor member for the first time since 1949. Of course, that Labor member will be Michael Maher, the present State member for Drummoyne. I suggest that when they elect Michael Maher to this Parliament--</PARA>

He is a very competent politician and a member the people in Lowe, my forebears, will be very pleased to have as their member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer particularly to a couple of areas in which the people of Lowe are suffering the same disappointments, the same disillusionments and the same frustrations as the rest of Australia. I refer in particular to interest rates for home loans. The mismanagement of the monetary system is undoubtedly one of the greatest failings of the Fraser Administration-along with a lot of others, of course. Business journals are now predicting higher interest rates across the board in 1982. Prime overdraft rates are already in the range of 16.25 per cent to 16.5 per cent and are predicted to go higher, to as high as 18 per cent, in the June quarter. In those circumstances it is highly unlikely that there will be a reversal of recent trends towards the collapse of lending for small business and housing. Our national savings are being syphoned off only to the most glamorous and high-paying areas, such as resource-based investment and the speculative areas. With a depleted money supply, thanks to the unduly restrictive monetary targets of this Government, there are simply not enough funds for the less glamorous yet equally essential forms of investment in such areas as housing and small business. Of course, the so-called 'dries' of the Liberal Party of Australia-I notice at least one of them in the House at the moment--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr JOHN BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one I can identify. Those so-called 'dries' are calling for the deregulation of interest rates on housing loans and small overdrafts as a means of attracting more money to those areas. That response shows that those Liberals are not only economic 'dries' but also morally parched. The increase in housing loans and small overdraft interest rates that would occur could be three or four percentage points if interest rates were to reach the levels predicted. What would a 3 per cent rise in interest rates do to a modest loan of $30,000 for a house? Monthly repayments would increase by $66. The people of Australia recognise that. It is no wonder that the popularity of the Government is at such a low ebb. Under those circumstances thousands of people in Australia would suddenly be faced with the prospect of having to sell the homes for which they had worked so hard. New home buyers would virtually disappear from the market. There can be no doubt that the deregulation of housing interest rates in the present circumstances would lead to a massive transfer from poor to rich in this country. Is it any wonder that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) on AM this morning suggested that now is not the time for the Government to go to a poll? He will find that out very forcibly when the Government does go to a mini poll on 13 March. The people of Lowe will let him know that what he said this morning on AM is correct. It is unlikely that that situation will change before December 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shortage of funds in the housing and small business areas can be overcome only by a change in the Government's economic strategy, including a rejection of its restrictive monetary policies. Restrictive monetary targets are destroying the job opportunities of thousands of Australians, ruining the hopes of home owners and buyers and maintaining an extraordinary pressure on small businesses, leading to the highest rate of bankruptcy in Australia's political history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why has the Fraser Government acted so blatantly to destroy worthwhile opportunities for Australians? It has done so because it is ideologically bankrupt, with no effective anti-inflation policy-this is evidenced by the increasing level of inflation, now back to double figures-no wages policy, no business policy and a callous disregard for the consequences of this policy vacuum. All that this Administration has offered for six years is restrictions, not only in the public sector but also in the private sector. That is the reason that business confidence in the Government is fleeing and people are turning to the Australian Labor Party as an alternative. That is the case in New South Wales and it will continue to be so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again this morning the Treasurer (Mr Howard) blamed overseas trends. Many countries have lower interest rates than Australia has at the present time. Clearly it is the domestic administration of policy which is the principal determinant of domestic monetary conditions. The Fraser Government, no matter what it states, cannot run away from that. This Government is presiding over the highest rate of bankruptcy in Australia's history. I repeat: It is presiding over a steady decline in the level of home ownership; it has presided over the highest levels of unemployment and interest rates in the post-War period. It has the worst record of any Government in Australia's history. Is it any wonder that Lowe, after 32 years of Liberal ownership, will fall to the Labor Party on 13 March? I, as an old-time resident of Lowe, look forward to that date when the people with whom I lived for so long will be properly represented in this Parliament by a man of honour, a man of dignity, a man who will represent them thoroughly and decently.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin my remarks on a matter of major moment today, may I say how disappointed I am that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) let slip his usual very high standards in this House by making a personal attack on Sir William McMahon. I think that what he said about Sir William in his later days in this House was grossly unfair and grossly untrue. I regret that the honourable member for Parramatta who, as I said, has a high standing in this place should have descended in an unaccustomed way to making remarks such as he did. I simply pay tribute to the contribution Sir William McMahon made to this House and to this nation. I believe that it is inappropriate for the honourable member for Parramatta to behave as he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter I raise today is in fact a plea to both the New South Wales Government and the Federal Government to preserve, to save from extinction, the underground coal mining industry in New South Wales and particularly in my electorate. I am particularly concerned about the impact on underground coal mining of the 25 per cent increase in rail freights now being imposed by the New South Wales Government. Without question that will bring about the closure of coal mines in my electorate; it will bring unemployment to coal miners in my electorate; and it certainly will bring very severe economic problems to a large section of what was a prosperous, thriving community until the Wran Government came to power in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I include the Federal Government in my request because it imposes an export levy of $1 a tonne on coal produced from those mines. This is done at a time when those mines are not in a situation in which they can adequately cope with that kind of levy, which is based not on profitability but on volume. I accept the fact that the present Government has reduced this levy from the $6 a tonne that was introduced by the previous Federal Labor Government, but it is still $1 a tonne. I have made repeated submissions to the Federal Government to get this levy reduced and have been advised that the Premier of New South Wales has threatened that if the levy is withdrawn by the Federal Government the State Labor Government will reimpose it in order to get additional revenue for the State Government. While I can be critical of the Federal Government for not having withdrawn the levy, it is incredible that a State Labor government would seek to perpetuate the damage being done to the underground coal mining industry and to jobs by threatening to impose such a levy if the Federal Government withdraws it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to concentrate my concern on the matter of the Labor Government in New South Wales increasing by 25 per cent rail freights for coal mining companies. These companies are already suffering severe losses. The employees of those companies are suffering severe reductions in income because of the loss of bonuses and other additional income on which they base a reasonable standard of living. It seems incredible that, in order to finance the massive transport losses generated in the city of Sydney by the State Rail Authority, the country people and coal producers of the State should have offensive and enormous increases in coal freight rates imposed on them. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it not disgraceful that the State Rail Authority of New South Wales will so increase freights in order simply to subsidise the city, after all, that is a typical Labor Party stunt as it is concerned only with the cities? Even more offensive is the fact that the imposition of this enormous increase of 25 per cent, which will bring about the closure of mines in my electorate, has taken place at a time when the State Government has dictated in an incredible way to these companies that they must not use any other form of transport. The State Government has behaved in a way Chicago gangsters traditionally behave. It has said to the companies: 'You are not permitted to use any other form of transport '. I know of no other industry in Australia which has been subjected to that kind of dictatorship. Having done that, it has said: 'We will now increase the price by 25 per cent'. I regret to say that the coal miners in my electorate have committed a heinous sin as far as the Labor Party is concerned in that they have tended to vote Liberal. There is no doubt that those who are left in jobs will continue to do so because they recognise what the Labor Party has done to them. They have had to suffer because, I presume, they have had the good sense, at least in Federal elections, to return a Liberal member for their area. They are suffering as a result of that sin. It seems incredible that a State Labor government should do this. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice today that at last the Premier of New South Wales has been forced to talk to the coal miners, the coal mining industry and the unions about this matter. He has continually ducked going into the area to talk to them. He refused to turn up for the opening of the Tahmoor mine, even though he was supposed to open it and his name was on the plaque. He ducked going there because he knew that the representatives of the Japanese steel industry would complain bitterly at the official opening-as they did-about the anti-coal, anti- shipping and anti-transport attitudes of the New South Wales Labor Government. However, today an injunction was taken out to prevent the State Rail Authority collecting the increased rates and, as a result of that injunction, the Labor Government at last has conceded that it will talk with the industry. As a result , that injunction has been suspended. I plead with the New South Wales Government, for God's sake, for the sake of the miners and their families who live in my electorate, to give the mining industry a fair go. Please listen to the industry-I make this point to the Labor Party in general-when it says that unemployment is being caused. The policies of the State Labor Party in New South Wales are anti-coal and anti my electorate and are causing distress--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning during Question Time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) were questioned in regard to falling home ownership in Australia. Figures were given that home ownership had fallen from 73.8 per cent in 1978 to 71.9 per cent in 1980. The Minister for Housing and Construction, who is at the table, always argues that Australia has the greatest rate of home ownership in the world. That may have been the case, but it has been falling over the last few years and it is still falling. The situation is becoming drastic because the housing sector is a major victim of the Government's economic policy. Next to unemployment, housing is the most serious social problem in this country. The housing sector is faced with high and rising interest rates, a flow of funds away from the housing sector and dramatic cutbacks in Commonwealth funds for State housing. They have all acted to stifle the housing sector and to bring about stagnation in the home building industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This stagnation is a direct result of this Government's policies. Let us be clear about that. It is not a by-product of other policies; it is not an oversight. It is a deliberate policy to downgrade housing in order to make room for an expansion of investment and foreign capital inflow into resources development for the sake of a few jobs in a few regions and big profits for a few companies. On the whole, those companies are foreign-owned. This was the message of the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Stone, in his Stan Kelly Memorial Lecture in November 1981. That line has been endorsed by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and it dominates the thrust of this Government's economic policies. It is a view which suggests that Australians are overhoused and a view which has led this Government to sacrifice the housing sector while the Treasurer, like Pontius Pilate, washes his hands of responsibility for the consequences and effects on the Australian people. Most Government supporters do not want to be seen to hold this position for it flies in the face of common sense. It runs against the expectations and aspirations of ordinary Australians. I stress, as I have stressed over and again, that we in the Australian Labor Party stand for private ownership of homes for individuals and wherever we can we will assist a worker to own his own home. We support that principle because the major saving of most workers in their lifetimes is the home in which they live. It is our aim , wherever we can, to get Australians to own their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the Minister for Housing and Construction go before Cabinet with his housing programs gimmicks which, in fact, have contravened the whole economic thrust and policies of the coalition Government. That has to be clearly understood. The sad situation is that he is given wide publicity by the newspapers every time he puts forward one of these gimmicks. They build up false hopes in many people in this country. However, on each occasion these proposals have been rejected or deferred by Cabinet. They are only cosmetic cover-ups, at best, and the Minister's submissions are not deserving of any real support. They are ad hoc, knee jerk, instant coffee responses to the wrong problems, such as more wasted money for the discredited Home Savings Grants Scheme. Within that industry it is called the home decorators' account because it gives too little too late to be used by people in meeting a deposit gap of something like $20,000 . People get the money nine months after they get their own loan. No wonder they call it the home decorators' account. </PARA>
<PARA> The housing sector is the building block of the nation's social structure and the nucleus of its industrial structure. Never before in Australia's history has a government shown so little regard for the social and economic importance of stable national investment, both private and public, in the housing sector. Never before have we seen members of the Federal Government so consistently attacked for their housing neglect by the Premiers and housing Ministers- including those who belong to their own parties-in every State. Only yesterday the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory issued a Press statement saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Unless there is a change of heart on the part of the Commonwealth, the average Australian's dream of owning his own home will soon cease to be a reality. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The present Commonwealth housing policy, combined with excessively high interest rates is also causing considerable harm to the construction industry which relies on housing for a very large segment of its work. </PARA>
<PARA>Look at what happened in January when the Premier of Western Australia issued a booklet entitled the Fight for Fairness-I give it to the Minister to read-in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned to show that home buyers, people seeking low-cost housing and the building industry are all suffering because of the Commonwealth's failure to take action to relieve the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Western Australian Premier went on further to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Our intention is to highlight the low priority which the Federal Government is currently giving to housing. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at the Minister's old friend, the Victorian Minister of Housing. In September last year he said that the Federal Government did not deserve to stay in power if it did not increase funds for housing. In November he wrote an open letter to the Prime Minister calling for an urgent increase in housing funds for the States. In January this year he sent the Prime Minister a telegram saying that unless the Federal Government made urgent policy changes it would soon be too late to regenerate the housing industry. These are the remarks of National Country Party and Liberal Party Ministers who are leaders within their own States and regions. The fact is that I have not referred to any of the leaders of the Australian Labor Party States. I could mention what is happening in New South Wales where 40,000 families are waiting on the Housing Commission list, and the number is growing at a very fast rate. But I have not referred to that. I am just quoting the Minister's own colleagues, but why are they saying these things? It is because the shattering of the housing sector is causing widespread social and economic chaos within their States and regions. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider some of the economic effects of the issues involved such as falling loan approvals, falling building approvals, falling building commencements, builders and suppliers going to the wall, rising unemployment and the growing housing needs of the people. In 1977 the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry estimated that a feasible level of housing industry activity relative to capacity was 161,000 dwellings in 1979-80. In the 1980 report the Council estimated housing industry capacity for 1979-80 at only 142, 000 dwellings. It further projected the capacity for 1981-82 at 135,000 dwellings. These declining estimates reflect a downturn in housing industry capacity over the last four years of 26,000 dwellings or 16 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria the housing industry capacity estimates for 1981-82 are down 10,000 dwellings or 24 per cent on the estimates of four years ago. In that State particularly we have seen a substantial number of small and large home builders and suppliers go to the wall in recent years. Let us look at the more serious situation that is occurring in Victoria. The housing industry capacity in that State for 1981-82 is estimated at 32,000 dwellings. Activity in Victoria according to the November 1981 report of the Indicative Planning Council is estimated at only 26,000 dwellings. That means that the Victorian housing industry, which has already suffered a loss of capacity, will be operating at 19 per cent below capacity in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia housing industry capacity is estimated at 20,000 dwellings in 1981-82 but activity is projected at only 15,500 dwellings. This year the Western Australian housing industry is operating at actually 23 per cent below capacity. Labor's condemnation of the Government is a basic one. At this time, with the unmet and growing housing needs of the Australian people, when the building industry has surplus capacity and a high level of unemployment, the housing sector, both private and public, is being squeezed when, in fact, the industry should be stimulated because this is a labour-intensive industry. It is an industry that can do a great deal of social good in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the economic impact of the squeeze. According to the Bureau of Industry Economics the value-added multiplier for the housing industry is 2.4. The employment multiplier is 2. That means that for every $100 output in the housing industry, production to the value of $240 is required from other parts of the economy. Australia's manufacturing industry supplies over 70 per cent of those goods. For every person employed in the housing industry two more are required throughout the Australian economy. For every $100m of private expenditure on dwellings, employment increases by 1,635 jobs for the home building industry and by 2,900 jobs in other parts of the economy. That is a total of 4,543 jobs. For every $100m of government expenditure on dwellings, employment increases by 1,884 jobs in the housing industry and by 3,351 jobs in the rest of the economy, a total of 5,235 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The message is straightforward and I want to give it to the Minister right between the eyes. If he wants to house the Australian population, if he wants a broad-based economic growth and if he wants stable employment growth, then build houses and provide stability in the housing industry; stable flows of housing funds and stable supplies of skilled workers are needed. On the other hand, if the housing sector is allowed to run down that brings on widespread disruption, unemployment, the closure of firms and far-reaching erosion of the manufacturing industry. Stagnation in the housing industry is a sign of a sick economy. Under this Government over the past six years we have seen the most stagnant housing industry in Australia's post-war history. If this Government's policies persist Australia will not have the capacity to make up the backlog of existing unmet housing needs. It will not have the capacity to address the housing needs of future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider some of the reasons. In 1981-82 this Government is spending one -third of the amount on public housing that was spent by the Federal Government seven years ago. In 1974-75, the last full year of a Labor government, in today' s prices we made $789m available. This year the comparative figure is $225m. In other words, at the 1974-75 level there has been an underspending on public housing of $534m. We need a stimulus not only in public sector housing. We need also a program which will give first home buyers an opportunity to own their homes. We need a program that will protect those who are already living in and paying off a home but who, because of the increase in interest rates, are now in trouble. We need a building industry with a steady flow of finance, we need to stimulate the building industry so that it will not only create employment but also will give stability and security to many of the people who need it so much. We need a government with some compassion that will do something about the housing of the Australian people. </PARA>

He either missed the mark or his attempt did not have much strength to it. I assure him that in a very short time I shall demolish his argument of straw. I am very disappointed because, once again, he rose in this House, as he does with rather monotonous regularity, to announce the death of of the housing industry. That industry, in common with Mark Twain, could very well reply, 'The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated'. Like the Associated Press announcement of Mark Twain's death in 1897 the constant attempts of the honourable member for Reid to undermine confidence are the cause of distress and concern in the community. They are equally wrong and equally irresponsible, and if he were the man of concern, the man of compassion that I had thought he was up to the present, he would not have risen in this House and tried to destroy the confidence of the Australian people. Heaven forbid!

<PARA> If we study the number of dwelling approvals we will see that in 1981, under this Government, they were at the highest level since 1973. This follows the commencement in 1980-81 of close to 150,000 dwellings. It is true that we do not expect the industry to repeat this feat in 1981-82, but the decline is nowhere near as bad as the honourable member, the disciple of gloom, would like us and the community to believe. My Department and the Housing Industry Associations would agree, I am sure, that there will be about 138,000 housing commencements in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make my position quite clear. I am not happy about any drop in housing commencements. No member of this House feels more genuinely for the housing industry and the housing aspirations of the ordinary Australian than I do, but let us keep this forecast of 138,000 dwelling commencements in its proper perspective. It would be higher than for any year other than 1976-77 except, of course, for the outstanding performance of 150,000 commencements in 1980-81 under this government. Thank goodness this industry is more resilient than the honourable member for Reid would like us to believe. Thank goodness it has shown continuously its ability to adapt to change in market circumstances and to produce a product which matches the needs of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> For once, I agree with the honourable member that the cost and availability of housing finance is a worrying problem. It is an issue we are currently grappling with, but these are very important matters; we must get our decisions right. They must reflect a careful balancing of all of the economy's needs and the community's expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I point out that there are some encouraging signs. Lending by permanent building societies has recovered in each of the last two months to the level of early 1981. Obviously, the honourable member for Reid was too interested in coming up with his false propaganda to realise that today encouraging figures were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in respect of savings and trading banks. They show that loans approved by them increased in December. I repeat: Loans approved by trading and savings banks increased in December. This, together with the improved lending performance to which I have already referred on the part of the permanent building societies, resulted in total lending by those societies and by banks combined that was significantly up in December. That is the sort of confidence that the honourable member should be talking about, rather than destroying the hopes and aspirations of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> In December the number and value of loans for dwellings approved by savings banks rose by 8.6 per cent and 7 per cent respectively to 8,639 and $219.7m. The figures for trading banks rose by 1.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively to 3,552 and $77.9m. The figures for savings banks and trading banks combined rose by 6.3 per cent and 5.2 per cent to 12,191 approvals and a grand total of $297. 6m loaned. The figures for banks and permanent building societies combined rose by 6 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively to 16,838 approvals and $462.6m loaned. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take 1981 as a whole we find that the number of loans for dwellings approved by savings banks increased by 1.5 per cent to 109,917. Those are figures which reflect confidence. The honourable member for Reid did not give the House that sort of information because he wants to destroy the home ownership aspirations of the Australian people. We must not forget the fundamentals. A healthy housing industry depends on a healthy economy. It depends on income growth. Clearly, the honourable member does not even understand basic economics. The housing sector is sensitive to overall government economic policy. It needs an economic policy which maximises long-run economic growth, provides sustained demand through lifting real family incomes, maintains a healthy rate of population growth, ensures that young people can get jobs and consequently form households, keeps building costs within reason, promotes efficient finance markets, minimises inflation and price increases and assists a steady availability of housing finance. The very sort of investment that the honourable member attacks constantly is what is needed to provide this long term growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the recent statistics. Gross domestic product increased at a rate of 3 per cent in the six months to September 1981, following a 3 per cent growth rate in the three months to March 1981. Private business growth fixed investment expanded strongly, at a rate of 22.2 per cent, in the six months to September. Non-dwelling construction investment increased at a rate of 31.5 per cent in that period. In the first half of 1981-82 the value of private non-residential approvals rose by nearly a quarter, compared with the same period in 1980-81. This has all been reflected in the incomes that families have been receiving. Real household disposable income-which is the pertinent thing-is estimated to have increased at a rate of 3.2 per cent in the six months to September-up from a rate of 2.5 per cent in the previous six months. Thus, we are improving the prospects for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Building material costs represent another area of importance to housing. Again, as comes from this side of the House all the time, we can announce more good news. In the 12 months to December 1981 the index rose by 9.2 per cent. This was significantly below the 14.5 per cent increase in the 12 months to December 1980 . Quite obviously we are good business and finance managers. I am not trying to say that everything in the economic garden is rosy. Obviously our economy is a very open economy. We are one of the world's great trading nations. We must be affected by the relatively lower economic performance of the other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. We must be affected in part , in regard to interest rates, by what happens in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> However, labour costs represent another important area. I hope that the honourable member for Reid is listening because the people whom he represents are ripping the guts out of this country. The Housing Industry Associations organisation of Victoria has estimated that the cost of an average new house in that State will rise by $1,600 as a result of the newly-agreed tradesman's award . I repeat, the cost of housing will go up to $1,600. How are the young marrieds of Australia to bridge the deposit gap if they have to find an extra $1,600 because of union activities that are supported by the honourable member? I consider that to be a reasonable estimate of the flow-on effects of a 38-hour week. What would the farmers of this country do? They must laugh when they find out that carpenters are to work 38 hours a week. I suggest that in a lot of cases if they work for 38 hours it would not be quite as bad as what happens at present. I mention also an immediate $22 a week pay increase awarded to tradesmen. However, that does not take into account further pay rises granted under the new award due to be paid this month and in July. </PARA>
<PARA> Using the formula of the Housing Industry Association, I would expect that the new award would increase the price of a modest average home in Melbourne by about $2,500 rather than the $1,600 estimated by the industry. Therefore, if a modest first home in Sydney costs, say, $60,000, the new award, which the Opposition champions, can be expected to increase the price of a house in Sydney by $3,600 because of the insatiable greed of unions and the people they represent who are denying their fellow Australians the opportunity to have a job . That is one of the reasons that there has been a slight downturn in the activity in the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely vital that we bear down on these rising labour costs, the sorts of extravagant rises that honourable members opposite would undoubtedly applaud and encourage if they were sitting on the Government benches. They are not interested in home ownership. They just want to talk about it. But the housing industry can remain confident that the Government will not abandon the fundamentals. The fundamental is to stick to policies which protect this country 's international competitiveness, which exercise some discipline over industrial chaos and preserve the incentive for personal effort and investment. Of course, as honourable members are aware, we are not a government which forgets the aspirations or needs of ordinary men and women, especially in this vital area of housing. The Government is very concerned about, and sympathetic towards, young home seekers, home buyers, pensioners who rent their dwellings, Aborigines and other special groups who are being helped through the Commonwealth-State housing agreement. We showed this by taking firm action in the 1980-81 Budget to lift our overall spending on housing and accommodation. I tell this to the honourable member for Reid because he will not go around this country quoting the true statistics. He tries to go back to what is obsolete. I tell him now that in the Budget we increased our total spending on housing and accommodation by the grand total of 18.9 per cent, from $555m to $660m. He should tell that to the people of Australia. He will not, because it is true. </PARA>
<PARA> As I pointed out to honourable members earlier today, the Government is reviewing the whole range of housing policies in conjunction with its examination of the recommendations on interest rates in the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. This review underlines our willingness to respond to changing circumstances. We have not yet finished considering the various assistance proposals. But housing responsibilities are not just a Commonwealth concern. The States and local government share this responsibility. I mention two areas of concern. Firstly, State and local governments bear a very heavy responsibility for housing costs. Statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that the cost of building an average 150 square metre private house in Sydney is around $44,000 compared with $36,000 in Melbourne. In New South Wales, under a Labor government , the cost of building a modest home of 150 square metres is $44,000 compared with a similar house in Melbourne at $36,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is so right. In New South Wales there is no government concern and no government interest in Australian home ownership. They do not want people to own their own homes. A more modest 120 square metre home in Sydney would cost about $35,000 to build and in Melbourne less than $30,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I refer to conveyancing and stamp duty. In Sydney a first home buyer purchasing a house and land package costing $65,000 pays about $1,300 in stamp duty, the only concession being that this can be paid in five interest-free instalments over five years. In Melbourne a similar house and land package would cost about $40,000 and the stamp duty would not be $1,300 as in Sydney under Wran's Government; it would be only $800 under Lindsay Thompson's Government. For first home buyers who are eligible under the Commonwealth Homes Savings Grant Scheme that figure is reduced to $400. Therefore, Victoria is cheaper in the first instance and is halved if a buyer participates in the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. In New South Wales, under the Labor government, there is no such concession. It is out to destroy home ownership for the ordinary Australian. As I indicated to the House earlier today, Australia still has one of the highest rates of home ownership in the developing world. I note that the honourable member for Reid, in his opening comments, gave due significance to the fact that the home ownership rate had dropped slightly and marginally. That is true; I do not debate that. </PARA>

I would like to deal with two matters which he raised. I refer firstly to the subject of building costs. He pointed out that the cost of building materials had decreased . The reason for that, if we look at the figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in September last year, was a substantial slowing down in the price of building materials. That is correct. This was caused by a lower demand for housing because of record interest rates and the lack of housing finance. In commenting on the figures, the Deputy Executive Director of the Housing Industry Association, Dr Silberberg, stated that there are now thousands of Australian families squeezed out of the home market because of the present interest rates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -by leave-I table the report of the Committee on Revitalisation of the Australian Shipping Industry. This Committee was chaired by Sir John Crawford, and the report has become known in the industry as the Crawford report. Only limited copies are presently available due to printing problems. Copies are available for reference in the Parliamentary Library and I will arrange for copies to be provided to honourable members as soon as they are printed. The shadow Minister, of course, has a copy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For some time I have been concerned that Australia's involvement in overseas shipping has been dismal compared to the comparative efficiency and competitiveness of our export industries. Australia is an island continent almost totally dependent on shipping to move our exports and imports, yet in 1979-80 Australian flag vessels lifted a total of only 7 per cent of cargoes carried in all Australia's overseas liner trades, 9.4 per cent of import cargoes and 4.3 per cent of exports. In the bulk trades Australian flag vessels lifted 3 .24 per cent of exports and 1.84 per cent of imports. The coastal shipping trades are also not in favour because of claimed high costs and unreliability and have been overshadowed by road and rail transport. </PARA>
<PARA> I formed the view that Australia ought to secure a more substantial place in our overseas shipping and that there should be a clear choice between shipping and over-land transport in our domestic trades. Following discussions with the maritime industry, I announced, in an address to the Australian Chamber of Shipping on 28 May 1980, initiatives to revitalise the Australian shipping industry. At that time I stated that both the maritime unions and the shipowners had agreed to enter into negotiations to find mutually satisfactory solutions to the problems that were apparent at that time in the industry. Both the shipowners and the maritime unions had agreed to set up separate shipowner and union committees to examine the issues involved. It was also agreed by the unions and shipowners to establish a joint committee under an independent chairman to facilitate discussions between the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, on 14 June 1980 I was pleased to announce the appointment of Sir John Crawford as the independent chairman of the joint committee. The chairman's role, through the joint committee, was to assist in the evolution of practical proposals for the benefit of the shipping industry as a whole, having regard to the problems identified by the shipowners and union groups. I stated at the time that the committees would identify the problems facing the industry and then propose solutions, aimed at providing potential for some growth in the Australian shipping industry. By fostering agreement between the shipowners and the maritime unions, through the joint committee chaired by Sir John, I hope to achieve the development of an efficient Australian shipping industry which will be able to compete commercially. By 'commercially' I mean an industry that does not need to rely on measures such as cargo reservation for Australian ships and that does not impose additional costs to the exporter or an additional price to the consumer for our imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The task that Sir John undertook has now been completed, and I should like to express my appreciation to Sir John, and also to the shipowners and union officials who have worked so hard together to produce the report. The report provides an answer to the question 'why have an Australian shipping industry if other countries offer subsidised services to carry our goods' by pointing to the advantages to Australia of a commercially viable fleet. In brief these are: A small but real balance of payment gain; a growth in employment and a source of skilled personnel not merely for ships but for the off-shore exploration and development industry as well as for the operation of ports; the opportunity to improve the efficiency of coastal shipping by integrating coastal and overseas operations; the operation of Australian ships provides exporters with reliable information on freight costs which can be a significant marketing tool; and access to adequate shipping services in times of emergency. The report also has an important attachment, which should be noted by all exporters, dealing with the vexed question of c.i.f. and f.o.b. sales. The report suggest that exporters be encouraged to sell c.i.f. where commercially feasible. </PARA>
<PARA> The report contains a number of recommendations, which together provide a package, that Sir John considers has the potential to improve efficiency and enable orderly development and growth of Australia's shipping industry. I seek leave to incorporate the recommendations of Sir John Crawford in Hansard. </PARA>

<PROCTEXT><PARA>Summary of Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations are to be read as a total package. Serious shortfalls in any group would jeopardise revitalisation.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Definition of an Australian Ship:</PARA>
<PARA> It is recommended that ships claiming the benefits of revitalisation should:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) fly the Australian flag;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) be manned by Australian crews;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) be registered under the appropriate Australian Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) be liable to tax on their operations;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) comply with relevant F.I.R.B. guidelines in relation to the shipowning company.</PARA>
<PARA>(Section II refers)</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Financial Incentives:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government should make the following changes to legislation as it affects Australian ships as defined above:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) for ships added to the fleet allow depreciation of over five years at 20% per annum with depreciation to commence in the year prior to commissioning provided the equivalent sum has been spent on the ship;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) abolish the 2% import duty on Australian ships;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) extend the investment allowance to all Australian ships regardless of the geographical pattern of operation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) My recommendation here should not preclude consideration of the wider benefits requested by the Jenner Committee. In particular the depreciation allowance should not be fixed indefinitely but should be reviewed from time to time particularly if amendments are made to the investment allowance.</PARA>
<PARA>(Section II refers)</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Existing ships less than five years old should be eligible for financial benefits if the manning level is reviewed and agreed.</PARA>
<PARA>(Section II refers)</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Manpower Policy:</PARA>
<PARA> The industry (comprising shipowners, unions and Government) should develop a manpower policy the significant factors of which are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) only ships manned in accordance with the decision of a manning committee be eligible for financial assistance;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the safety manning initiative of the Department of Transport be abandoned;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the manning committee be modified to provide a single committee to set the total manning of each vessel:</PARA>
<PARA> an officer of the Department of Transport to continue to chair the committee</PARA>
<PARA> a series of sub-committees be used if necessary to set numbers required in each category;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Launceston College be used as the core of a training program for officers and ratings with further Government financial support as necessary;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the industry agree and implement an effective dispute settling procedure.</PARA>
<PARA>(Section IV refers)</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Access to Cargo:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government should commit itself to support an efficient Australian shipping industry and should:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) encourage exporters to sell c.i.f. where commercially feasible;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) not legislate for a fixed Australian share of our cargoes but</PARA>
<PARA> (c) make known its wish to increase the Australian flag share of our shipping and arrange Government to Government discussions on behalf of efficient Australian shipowners if entry cannot be arranged on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA>(Section V refers)</PARA>
<PARA> (7) In addition there are a number of subjects where specific recommendations would be inappropriate but where continued dialogue between industry and Government is required:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) If Australian shipowners are to use the favourable shipbuilding credit available from foreign yards there is scope for owners, local financial institutions and Government to provide a solution to any foreign exchange risk problems which might arise.</PARA>
<PARA>(Section IV refers)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A mechanism is needed to overcome industry problems with Department of Transport interpretations of international conventions as they arise.</PARA>
<PARA>(Section IV refers)</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Close and continuous liaison is needed between Government, exporters and shipowners over the commercial use of Australian ships in overseas trades.</PARA>
<PARA>(Section V refers)</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Further examination is needed of the problems of coastal liner shipping.</PARA>
<PARA>(Section VI refers)</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The Department of Transport should promote, on a continuing basis, greater interaction among the related groups within the Australian shipping industry on both technical and economic policy issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The recommendations of the report deal with the need to define an Australian ship, something made easier by the recent introduction by the Government of the Australian Register of Ships. The report recommends financial incentives for shipping through accelerated depreciation and an extension of the investment allowance to Australian ships operating overseas, these concessions only being made available to ships with an acceptable manning level. A further recommendation is the development by the industry, comprising shipowners, unions and government, of a manpower policy covering manning, training and a disputes settlement procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following consideration of Sir John's report, the Government has agreed that I should hold discussions with shipowners, potential shipowners and the maritime unions to explore a package, generally along the lines of the recommendations of the report. Following these discussions I will then report the outcome to the Government. In the first instance, it is expected that this growth will occur primarily in the export of bulk commodities. Opportunities may also be available in other areas, and it is hoped that the benefits would flow into our coastal trades.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware of my recent announcement concerning the high costs to the nation of industrial disputes in sea transport. When measured in terms of days of disputes, almost half are attributable to the stevedoring industry but over one-third are attributable to ships' crews. Of those involving seagoing personnel, a substantial proportion were issues which find their basic motivation in job protection. I refer, of course, to disputes such as those designed to achieve higher manning levels or those involving bans on the so- called flag of convenience shipping. If there were opportunities for growth in maritime employment, much of the present pressures leading to such disputes would be removed. I believe the Crawford report provides this opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA> Revitalisation should enable us to enter a new era in maritime industrial relations through the prospect of growth in the industry and elimination of the disputes as to manning levels for vessels. I am confident that the challenge that Sir John has put forward will be met by both the shipowners and the maritime unions, and that we can look forward to a revitalisation of Australian shipping, where an efficient, reliable service can be offered on a commercially competitive basis. If this can be achieved it will be of considerable benefit to many Australians and the Australian nation. It is fitting indeed that the proposals which give the prospect of revitalising the shipping industry should have been brought forward by Sir John Crawford, who was recently recognised as Australian of the Year. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes the statement by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) on the reports of the Committee on Revitalisation of Australian Shipping. From time to time people ask me and, Mr Deputy Speaker, they probably ask you: 'Are there not any occasions on which the Opposition and the Government concur?' I reply: 'There are many, but those occasions are not newsworthy; it is the friction that is newsworthy'. But today is an occasion when there is substantial agreement on an issue that we see as vital to Australia's trade and employment opportunities. Although the Minister has not detailed the Government's attitude to the specific recommendations in the report it does appear that the Government has adopted the general thrust of the recommendations. The Government has, in effect, adopted Labor's long- standing policy for the expansion of Australia's maritime industry as, similarly , it adopted our policy in respect of an independent air-fares committee, and we commend the Government for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition, maritime unions and shipping companies have repeatedly made the point that Australia, as a major trading nation is one of the least significant maritime nations with only about 3 per cent of its international trade being transported in Australian flag vessels. The Government, albeit belatedly, has recognised the substantial benefits to be gained from greater Australian participation in the sea carriage of its exports and imports. This Minister, to an extent like his National Country Party predecessor, has continued the negative union bashing policy, but to a lesser degree. However this Minister, to his credit, has realised that there is a role for an expanded Australian shipping fleet and that job insecurity has been a core problem in the disputes that have occurred in the shipping industry. The recommendations for provisions of accelerated depreciation allowances and the development of improved consultation disputes procedures and manning arrangements are a positive approach to the needs and problems of an industry whose effective performance is crucial to Australia's economy. However, from the Minister's statement today we should not raise false or overoptimistic expectations as to the future of the shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect all that has been decided is that the Minister has been authorised to put the recommendations of the review to shipowners, potential shipowners and maritime unions as a package for agreement, with the emphasis being on 'as a package'. If agreement is reached on a package of conditions, then the Government will consider the terms of the agreement. The real test then for the Minister will be in taking that package back to the Cabinet and getting the support of Cabinet for the implementation of the terms of the package. I am confident at this stage, looking at the recommendations overall and in principle , that if the Minister brings back to the Cabinet a package that is substantially the same as that now before us he again will have the support of the Opposition for his endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA> Public understanding of the vexed question of crew levels of Australian ships has been confused by the distortion and misrepresentation engaged in over the years by supporters of this Government and its predecessors. Sir John Crawford confirms in the report that substantial progress has already been made in the reduction of crew levels. This problem has always been related to job insecurity . When men in the industry saw the number of jobs diminishing and the crew levels on ships declining, they worried about their future and they took action to try to preserve their future. But when they can see an industry with a hope, with room for expansion and with a level of certainty about it, then their attitudes like those of all other human beings can be quite different and they can look forward with confidence and security to their future. All parties accept at present that there is further scope for improvement in manning scales. In an expanding shipping industry with appropriate consultative procedures I have no doubt that further progress can be made. Fundamental to improvement in the shipping industry is the need for greater efficiency in the operation of the massive public and private investment in port facilities. Sir John has referred to this particularly in respect of coastal container shipping. This Government has been preoccupied, as I said earlier, with union bashing on the waterfront, but not this Minister so much in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> But what of other major causes of rising port costs that add to export and import prices and reduce Australia's overseas competitiveness, notably inefficient port organisation from the national perspective? Many ports lack competition amongst container terminal operators and amongst stevedoring operaors, leading to monopolised gains to shipping and terminal companies. This has led to port organisations supporting suppliers not users of shipping terminal services. Users are exporters, importers and all Australians. The present lack of Federal input in major port investments and planning leads to major customers of individual port authorities, such as shipping companies and terminal companies, exerting strong influence over port authorities and gaining concessions which do not benefit exporters or importers. Thus, suppliers of the services to a port benefit with the users of those services or the customers being a secondary consideration. In addition, competition between States to attract investment and trade has led to States offering to supply large companies with port infrastructure leading to overcapacity of port container facilities from a national perspective and in effect a waste of resources. Often solutions to port problems tend to focus on greater investment in facilities rather than a better utilisation and co-ordination and organisation of the infrastructure that is available in each of those ports. This again leads to a waste of scarce resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me for a few minutes turn to the problems of a specific port, the port of Newcastle, which has been coming into the national arena over recent weeks. In his usual style the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in recent weeks has sought to score cheap political points from the delays to shipping at Newcastle rather than to recognise and to face up to the issues and complex difficulties involved in seeking a viable solution to these difficulties and delays. Let me say that the nature of the global shipping industry is such that in the foreseeable future there will be a minimum queue of about 15 vessels off Newcastle. That is not something new. Honourable members may recall the disaster in 1974 when the Sygna went aground at Stockton beach in the electorate of Lyne at a time when there was a fleet waiting off Newcastle. That occurred at least eight years back. That is the nature of the industry. It is because of the positioning of the vessels which operate on global routes, from the timing as to when they reach port or are off port, and the simple fact that those vessels go on to the coal loaders at Newcastle in the order of their arrival off the port. So there is an incentive--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VF4">Mr Cowan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are defending the 40-odd ships off the coast.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I am trying to approach this, not in the honourable member's manner, but in a constructive way in order to offer a solution to the problems so I would be grateful if the honourable member were to treat this subject in that manner. I will help the situation. Because the vessels go on to the coal loader in the order in which they arrive at the port there is an incentive to arrive early off the port. In April or May last year, during the 2 1/2-month United States coal mine strike, which my friend the honourable member for Lyne ( Mr Cowan) did not want to mention, vessels were diverted from the United States west coast-the coal trade-to the port of Newcastle and Port Kembla in the expectancy that they might pick up a spot cargo because cargoes were not available in the United States due to the coal strike. Other tramp vessels will arrive off those ports and get in the queue, again in the expectation of picking up cargo. So one should not think when one sees an armada off the coast that all those vessels have a cargo awaiting a turn. A number of factors are involved. The worst port of all is Hampton Roads in that home of free enterprise, the United States. It is off the east coast. There, 100 vessels are not uncommon. No coal port in the United States has a depth greater than the port of Newcastle. The deepest coal port in the United States is 45 feet. So let us get the whole matter into perspective and then see what we can do about it. What is important is that the transport of shipping of coal be so organised that the number of waiting vessels is minimised, and disruptions that would impede the smooth flow of coal through a port are avoided. The reasons for the recent increase in the number of ships waiting off Newcastle are several, I acknowledge, including the multiplicity of unions and a lack of national interest in improving this situation. The Federal Government has declined to play any effective role in the despoilage of the local seaside environment caused by the discharge of waste and oil from the waiting off-shore fleet. There are other local problems associated with this problem. The Minister and the Prime Minister have turned their backs on it. But in the circumstances and because as a nation we have to set about doing something to improving the flow of coal through our ports, to protect our export trades, to protect our industries and at the same time minimise delays, I advise the Government that later today I will be writing to the Premier of New South Wales, in the absence of initiative from this Federal Government and from the Prime Minister, requesting the New South Wales Government to initiate the establishment of a Newcastle port co-ordinating committee comprising representatives of the Federal and State Governments, local government, coal producers, shippers, exporters, coal loading interests, shipping companies, the port authorities, the relevant trade unions and the local fishing industry with the following aims:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. The efficient movement of coal through the port of Newcastle;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The minimisation of delays to ship movements and loading;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The avoidance of interference with the operation of the local fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The prevention of pollution of coastal waters in the coastal environment by the dumping or discharge of inorganic and organic refuse, oily substances, sewage and packaging materials from vessels awaiting entry to the port;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The streamlining of quarantine procedures so as to enable:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) maximisation of local opportunities for on-ship and shoreside ship repair services;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) crews of waiting vessels to have greater access to port recreational facilities. </PARA>
<PARA>That last matter is there because there is a problem of morale and state of mind of the crews of those waiting vessels. I am confident that given support now from this Government and from the State Government that such a co-ordinating committee could make positive contributions to the solutions of the port's problems and of the industry. </PARA>

<PARA> That, unless otherwise ordered, for this session, standing order 101 be amended to read: '101. The House shall proceed each day with its ordinary business in the following routine: 1. Giving notices. 2. Questions without notice. 3. Presentation of papers. 4. Ministerial statements, by leave. 5. Matter of public importance. 6. Presentation of petitions. 7. Notices and orders of the day: Provided that on those alternate sitting Thursdays when ''Grievance debate'' is first order of the day, government business, under standing order 106 or when general business has precedence on the Notice Paper under standing order 104, '' Grievance debate'' or general business, as the case may be, shall precede ''5. Matter of public importance.''.'. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that on 15 November 1979 the House of Representatives Standing Orders Committee presented a report to this Parliament which included, amongst its recommendations, the changed routine of business specifically with respect to petitions. I do not want to go into a great deal of detail in summarising the reasons for the change, but it is worth commenting on some part of the Standing Orders Committee report. On page 1 it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The particulars of petitions lodged for presentation to the House are announced to the House by the Clerk in a long announcement which cites the Member lodging the petition, the identity of the petitioners and the subject matter of the petition. This results in a burdensome narrative which has little significance for Members gathering in the Chamber at the start of the day's proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the time taken by the Clerk's announcement is increasing at the expense of prime Parliamentary time. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing in this, or in the change proposed, in any way lessens the significance of petitions. I know that many people in the Australian community regard the petition as a valid way by which they can address matters of concern to themselves, or groups of which they are members either to those responsible, or to this Parliament. It is also worth remembering that in our present procedures those petitions that fall within a Minister's bailiwick are in fact forwarded on to him. It is not just a matter of a petition being presented in the Parliament and being read here; it is a matter of that Minister having the capacity to respond if he sees fit. In that respect, I draw honourable member's attentin to Standing Order 132 which requires that a copy of every petition be sent by the Clerk to the appropriate Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that in 1974 the House of Commons in the United Kingdom decided that it would alter the time for the presentation of petitions until immediately before the half-hour adjournment debate. Though such a late position in the program in the House of Representatives sitting is not suggested, it does seem to the Government that a suitable position would be after our dealing with matters of public importance. It is for that reason, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee, that I now propose this change in my name to the sessional order. I point out to honourable members that it has been introduced as a sessional order so that if the practice proves unsatisfactory modifications can be made to it. It will be the intention of the Government, subject to the sessional order proving to meet the convenience of the members of this House and enabling a satisfactory consideration of petitions , for an appropriate amendment be made to the Standing Orders in due course. I comend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition agrees with the motion. We think it is a sensible one. We note that petitions will still be important, that only the order in which they are introduced into the House will change. It is noticeable, particularly when we come back after a parliamentary recess, that petitions have accumulated and we are sitting listening to them for a period of up to half an hour or more. From the point of view of public interest and matters of interest to the nation it would be more appropriate if we got on with the business of the Parliament. According to the Notice Paper, the petitions would be read at a slightly later time of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important that Ministers be made aware of matters in the petitions. That is to be commended. It is essential in democracy that we just do not have the whole of this place to ourselves. We want to hear the claims of people and petitions are one way of doing this.

<PARA>This Bill proposes to amend and repeal existing legislation to allow for the termination of the operations of the Australian Canned Fruit Sales Promotion Committee and for the residual assets and liabilities of the Committee to vest with the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation. The Sales Promotion Committee was established in 1959 with the single function of promoting the sale of Australian canned deciduous fruit. As a matter of policy, the Committee has always restricted its promotional activities to the domestic market. The Committee's activities are funded from the proceeds of a charge on grower deliveries of fruit to canners collected under the Canning-Fruit Charge Act 1959. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the announcement of the decisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions on 31 April 1981, I canvassed with grower and canner interests the desirability of rationalising the operations of the Committee within the existing broad marketing and general functions of the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation. This has been accepted, and the domestic promotion programs of the Committee were taken over by the Corporation as from 1 January 1982. I commend this Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes increases to the rates of levy imposed on canned deciduous fruit production to finance the administrative operations of the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation. As from 1 January 1982, the operative rate of levy increases from the equivalent of 11c a basic carton-24 x 825 gram cans-to 27c a basic carton. Provision is also being made for future alteration of levy rates by regulation up to a maximum of 30c a basic carton. The new maximum and operative rates for various container sizes are set out in the Schedules to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased levy rates have been recommended by the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation following its decision in November 1981 to reduce canned fruit production in the 1982 season to approximately one-half the level achieved last year. This decision was made necessary following the drastic downturn in export market outlets last year and the build up of unsold stocks to near record high levels. The Corporation's marketing plans for 1982 have been developed in close consultation with grower and canner interests and the reduction in production is seen by the bulk of the industry as the best response to the current oversupply problem. Significant marketing and promotional problems will continue to face the industry this year and the increased levy rates proposed by this Bill are essential if the Corporation is to have the resources necessary to deal effectively with these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also giving urgent attention to the problems facing the industry. It agreed late last year to an urgent Industries Assistance Commission reference. The Commission is scheduled to report on the industry's short term assistance needs by 31 March. I have assured industry interests that the IAC report will be accorded urgent consideration by the Government. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to introduce, as from 1 July 1982, charges to recoup a proportion of the cost borne by the Commonwealth for inspecting dairy products for export. This is part of the Government's program to recover costs of providing export inspection for certain agricultural and fishery products. Export inspection is designed to ensure that products meet minimum standards of quality, hygiene and presentation when exported. The Government introduced charges for inspecting meat, grain and wool in 1979 and fish and dried fruits in 1981. These charges are aimed at recovering approximately 50 per cent of the inspection costs of the Commonwealth. The Government proposes that fees aimed at a similar level of recovery should be imposed for similar services provided by my Department for other products. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to specifics in this Bill. Honourable members will see that it provides for the recovery of dairy product export inspection costs to be achieved through charges on dairy products inspected for export. The Bill provides that the person who furnishes an export notice for inspection purposes is liable to pay the charge. Exemptions may be provided in the regulations. A maximum rate of charge of $5 a tonne is specified. The actual rates of charge will be specified in regulations. It is proposed that the following rates for 1982-83 be recommended to the Governor-General for promulgation by regulation: Butter packed in bulk or pat form, $2.50 a tonne; butter packed in other forms and butter fat products, $1 a tonne; cheese packed in bulk, $2.50 a tonne; cheese packed in other forms, $1 a tonne; concentrated, condensed and dried milk, $0.50 a tonne; and milk and other milk products, $1 a tonne. On current estimates of export production for 1982-83, charges at these rates will yield approximately $ 307,000 in a full year. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for Australia to take up increases in its capital subscriptions to two international financial institutions-the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation. Honourable members will be aware that the main function of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was established in 1947, is to provide loans on semi-commercial terms to its less developed member countries. To the end of June 1981, the Bank had lent about $US68.2 billion to its member countries for projects covering all the major sectors of economic development with emphasis on the development of infrastructure facilities in the transport and communications, industry and energy sectors, as well as projects for agriculture, education and water supply.</PARA>
<PARA> Following an examination of the adequacy of the capital base of the Bank for its operations in the 1980s, the Governors of the IBRD approved in January 1980 an increase in the authorised capital stock of the IBRD of approximately $US40 billion. This represents an effective doubling of the Bank's capital base and should allow it to continue to increase its operations in real terms. The increase was covered by two resolutions, one approving a general capital increase and the other an additional capital increase. Under the latter resolution each member country is entitled to a fixed number of shares. It was passed to offset an unintended reduction in the aggregate voting power of developing countries, which would otherwise result from the general capital increase. Australia voted in favour of the resolutions authorising these capital increases. The text of the resolutions, including the number of shares to which each member is entitled to subscribe, is set out in the explanatory memorandum to this legislation. Members, including Australia, are entitled, but not obligated, to subscribe to this authorised increase. Australia is entitled to subscribe to 6,037 shares under the general capital increase and to 250 shares under the additional capital increase, a total of 6,287 shares, valued at $US758 .43m. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the general capital increase, 92.5 per cent of the subscription is to remain on call with the other 7.5 per cent-$US54.62m-to be paid in. Of the paid in portion, 10 per cent-$US5.46m-has to be in the form of gold or United States dollars and the balance of $US49.16m in Australian dollars. The latter amount-$ A44.95m at the current exchange rate-will be paid in the form of a promissory note. Subject to agreement with the Bank, this will be encashed in approximately equal instalments over four financial years commencing 1982-83. Under the additional capital increase, the full subscription price of the 250 shares remains on call. The IBRD is an effective and efficient institution in the provision of development assistance to developing countries, and it plays an important role in the South East Asian region. This has been recognised by Australian governments over the years since the Bank's establishment. I believe it to be in Australia's interest to continue this policy of support by taking up , in full, the increase in our capital subscription to which we are entitled under the two resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Finance Corporation, which was established in 1956 as an affiliate of the World Bank, is an international development institution established to promote the growth of productive private investment and to assist enterprises which will contribute to the economic development of its developing member countries. In addition to the direct financial assistance it provides, which may take the form of loan or equity investment, it also arranges for other investment finance, mainly from the private sector, to be made available. Up to the end of June 1981, the Corporation had invested about $US4.1 billion in nearly 600 ventures. The syndications it has arranged are an important measure of its ability to attract private financing for the projects in which it is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the need to ensure that the IFC had adequate resources to continue to expand its operations, the Governors of the Corporation approved a resolution in September 1977 authorising an increase in the IFC capital from $US110m to $ US650m. Australia voted in favour of the resolution. As in the case of the IBRD capital increase, member countries are entitled, but not obligated, to subscribe to additional shares. Australia is entitled under the resolution, the text of which is set out in the explanatory memorandum, to subscribe an additional 9,976 shares at a cost of $US9.976m, all of which would be paid in. Under the terms of that resolution all payments associated with additional subscription must be made by 1 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The IFC has proved itself to be a very effective catalyst for attracting private capital for investment in enterprises in developing countries. As honourable members will be fully aware, this Government has continually emphasised the important role that the private sector can play in economic growth and development both in Australia and in developing countries. It is totally appropriate therefore for Australia to register its support for the Corporation and its activities by taking up its full share entitlement. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 to provide for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the payment in 1981-82 of additional tax sharing grants and special allocations totalling $69m to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the payment in 1981-82 of a fixed tax sharing grant of $315.1m to the Northern Territory in lieu of the amount which would be payable under the formula prescribed by section 8 of the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA>At the Premiers Conference on 20 June 1981, at which the Commonwealth Grants Commission report on State tax sharing entitlements for 1981 was considered, it was decided that there would be no change in the relativities contained in the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981 in respect of the year 1981-82, and that the Commission should be asked to produce a further report on its assessment of States' relativities in the light of submissions to be put to it by States and by the Commonwealth. The Commission is expected to report by 31 May 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the likelihood that, following the further review, the State relativities would be adjusted in favour of the three most populous States, the Commonwealth agreed at the June 1981 Premiers Conference, to provide additional grants to New South Wales, $24.5m; Victoria, $15.0m; and Queensland, $20.5m in the current financial year. These additional grants are to be considered as being a part of whatever total contribution the Commonwealth may choose to make towards assisting States to adjust to whatever new relativities are adopted after consideration of the further report of the Grants Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, the Commonwealth made it clear that it has no intention of funding the total cost of the adjustments to whatever new relativities are decided and that the additional grants for 1981-82 are without prejudice to any future decisions about the degree of change in relativities or the pace at which any such change should be implemented. The additional grants for 1981-82 are on the basis that there will be no application by any State for special grants in respect of 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of an agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland at the 20 June 1981 Premiers Conference the Bill also makes provision for that State to receive a supplement of $9m to its tax sharing grant payable in 1981-82. This special addition is a once-and-for-all payment to compensate that State for the reduction in its basic tax sharing grant resulting from the adoption of a new basis of estimating States' populations in the tax sharing calculation. The impact of this change-to an estimated resident population basis-on estimates of the States' tax sharing grants in 1981-82 was to produce a significant reduction in Queensland's grant as compared with estimates using the population estimates, prepared on the previous 1976 basis. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also gives effect to an agreement with the Northern Territory, arrived at subsequent to the June 1981 Premiers Conference, to pay the Territory in 1981-82 a fixed tax sharing grant of $315.1m rather than the lesser amount that would result from the formula set down in section 8 of the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act 1981. This amount takes into account both the population increase in the Territory and the above mentioned change in the basis for estimating State and Territory populations to be implemented in March 1982. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the following table which contains the latest, that is Budget estimates of the tax sharing grants that would be payable to each State and the Northern Territory in 1981-82, including the amounts contained in this amendment Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Act 1975 to enact the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Proposals which I tabled in this House on 18 August 1981. The changes to the coal export duty, as proposed by this Bill, were foreshadowed by my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the Budget Speech on that day. These changes impose, with effect from 8 p.m. on 18 August 1981, an export duty of $1 per tonne on black coal previously exempt from export duty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Act imposes a duty on exports of coking coal, at rates of either $3.50 per tonne or $1 per tonne depending on the quality of the coal and certain other features of the mining operation. Lower valued coals, principally steaming coal, had been exempted from this duty. Because of changes in the world market for energy resources and the consequential strengthening of export demand for steaming coal the Government decided that there was no longer any reason to differentiate between coking coal and steaming coal in the application of the export duty. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill we are about to debate is a Bill to amend the International Organizations (Privileges and Immunities) Act of 1963. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the parent Act to provide a contingency which was not foreseen when that Act was passed. It relates specifically to provisions which must be made for organisations such as the European Economic Community. The particular problem which has necessitated legislation at this time arises out of the establishment in Hobart of a secretariat to service the countries belonging to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Under this Convention, negotiations on which were completed last year, the European Economic Community will now be entitled to participate along with the member states of the Antarctic Treaty. They will be participating in meetings relating to Antarctic marine living resources. It will therefore be necessary for them to send delegations and diplomatic representatives to meetings. As the host state, Australia has the obligation to extend to those delegations the same privileges which diplomatic envoys enjoy under the Vienna Convention. Similarly, the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the headquarters' organisation which services the Convention will also have to reflect this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the parent Act was passed in 1963 this was not foreseen. The Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, had come into operation , but we did not foresee in 1963 the establishment of what are called EEC missions in countries such as Australia or the sending of envoys to negotiate on behalf of the EEC in meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment, which is set out in clause 6, will enable Australia to implement her taxation obligation under agreements establishing the Common Fund and the Asian Development Bank. This clause will exempt from taxation on income experts participating in the work of prescribed organisations. The Opposition agrees with the amendment, but would like to make some immediate observations as to what Australia's position is in respect of its international obligations and responsibilities. We note that this Bill will in that regard, particularly as a number of matters arise in relation to the EEC, for example, but we need a little detail as to what the Minister has defined as 'prescribed organisations'. We appreciate at some time information as to what he has in mind, other than perhaps the Asian Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> We also appluad the fact that a secretariat is to be established to service the countries that are parties to the Antarctic Convention. But on that note, let us emphasise the fact that what we are all about is the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. We submit that we ought to be doing a little more than just ensuring that international public servants have a tax exempt status, because there are a number of essential matters which, when we come to the Antarctic, have a very high profile. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular area of the world, of which we claim a substantial part- admittedly, our claim is not recognised-has enormous potential and wealth. Other countries which have perhaps, more capacity than we do, are exploiting that wealth. Australians would be anxious that this Government-all Australian governments-should continue to take a very keen interest in the Antarctic, both for its preservation and effectively to indicate to the world that we have a stake there. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me mention some of the resources of the region. Nearly two-thirds of the world's fresh water is to be found in the polar ice cap. The largest coal field in the world runs along the Transantarctic Mountains, which are within the Australian sector. We seem to be in the position of perhaps jeopardising our own sovereignty, because I am told that one of the things that is likely to happen because of what are called fiscal stringencies, or the razor gang approach to this issue, is that we could well close one of our bases there-probably Casey, leaving only Mawson and Davis-simply because we do not have any funds. That is an indictment of any approach taken to safeguard Australia's interest in the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make the point that there are four Soviet bases in our sector. If Casey were to close, half of our sector would be completely unoccupied by us, although the Soviet Union would have bases on it. I am not getting paranoid about the Soviet Union, as such, but it runs counter to any question of sovereignty if in our own territory we cannot service or own bases, and close them, yet other nations are establishing bases there. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worthy of note that last year 40 Soviet ships harvested some 2000,000 tons of krill-that small protein of marine life which the nations of the world are anxious to exploit. One wonders what is happening to us, it being recognised that krill contains 25 per cent of the world's protein requirements, we have no capacity at all to go there and harvest it. The Japanese also are there and are doing very well. That is to be applauded also. But what about our capacity to send ships there and do something from the point of view of Australia? India is about to set up a base there. That is an indication of the recognition by other countries of the value of the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is: What about Australia's plans? What about our having a ship of our own that can go to the Antarctic? At present we hire such a vessel. These vessels are heavily in demand by countries which are taking an increasing interest in the Antarctic. Are we to be left out? The ship that we have seems to be getting old and it will obviously be coming to the end of its life. We shall be left without any facility in that regard. We are becoming very dependent on United States flights for assistance. Again, the United States has been--</PARA>

With due respect to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to refer to United States flights to the Antarctic and matters of a similar kind, as he has just been doing, is to draw a pretty long bow from the point of view of associating those remarks with this very specific piece of legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us look at the matter: The whole concept of the Antarctic secretariat is preservation. Surely in that context, as Australia is claiming territorial rights, which, as I have said, are not recognised, I may make this point: What input could we have to these meetings if we could not even find out what was happening at our own base? How silly we shall look in Hobart at the secretariat if we are not able to participate in the discussions. That is the point I am making. Do not tell me, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Minister will object to my pinpointing issues which every Australian will be anxious that we might promote at these meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Perhaps I may conclude, which will delight the Minister, on this note. The budget for Antarctica is only $18m, of which only 10 per cent goes into research . If we could only get a bit more money devoted to that, we could build up the scientific research which would give us so much greater input into the areas that we are about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) raised a point on which he sought clarification, and I am happy to give it to him. It relates to that clause of the Bill which concerns the taxation obligation under two specific agreements, one being the Common Fund and the other being the agreement establishing the Asian Development Bank. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked whether there was any further intention on the part of the Government in this respect. I merely make the point that at present we are not a party to any other agreement under which a similar concession could be made, but it is conceibable that such a situation could arise in the future, and this legislation is designed to deal with it. If any further agreements are entered into, they would have to be prescribed by regulation which, of course, would have to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and come before Parliament in the usual way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with the Domicile Bill and the Domicile (Consequential Amendments) Bill. The Bills are based on a model domicile Bill which was agreed to by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General , which consists of the Federal Attorney-General, the six State Attorneys- General and the Attorney-General for the Northern Territory. On 27 October last year the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown), who was at that time Acting Attorney-General, introduced the Bill into this House. He informed the House that similar legislation had been passed by the Northern Territory and all States except Western Australia, where at that stage the Bill had been introduced. I am advised that it has since been passed in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Domicile Bill introduces four reforms into the law of domicile. These reforms are not exactly new. They were first recommended by the British private introductional law committee report which was published in 1954. A Bill to give effect to these proposals was first introduced into the British Parliament in 1958. Objections to the legislation by foreign corporations-which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) never likes us to mention-and disputes between the House of Lords and the House of Commons resulted in the legislation to implement the reforms not being introduced and passed until 1973. One of the reforms is to abolish the common law rule whereby a woman who is married has at all times the domicile of her husband. This was perhaps the worst rule of the common law position on domicile. It treated women as secondary to their husbands until divorced. However, the form of amendment is a little difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill simply states that the common law rule is abolished. It does not instruct the courts on how to ascertain the domicile of a married woman. It uses the expression 'at all times', that is, that a woman at all times used to have the same domicile as her husband. The question now is: At what time does she not ? Does there need to be a legal separation as distinct from a de facto separation before the woman can acquire her own domicile? In a country which is a federation such as Australia, this can be particularly important as one acquires a State domicile, rather than simply a country of domicile. From the Minister's second reading speech it would appear that what is intended is that a de facto separation, without any judicial proceedings, is sufficient. However, the courts may interpret it differently. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the importance of the law of domicile has gone with the passing of the two Federal pieces of legislation governing family law. I refer to the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1959, which introduced the concept of Australian domicile, and the Family Law Act of 1975 which allowed 12 months' residence in Australia to be a sufficient basis for jurisdiction. However, there are matters, particularly under State law, which continue to be governed by the law of domicile. These are important matters relating to laws governing ex-nuptial children, adoption and certain matters relating to wills. While domicile is a principle of the British system of private international law, it is not the universal test for determining the status of a person. European countries, as well as Japan and Mexico, adopt nationality rather than domicile as the test for determining personal law. In 1968 it was estimated that about 1,450m people were subject to the law of domicile, about 1,600m were subject to the law of nationality and about 350m were citizens of countries which applied the principle of nationality to their subjects and that of domicile to foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems with the law of nationality is that it is inappropriate for federations such as the United States of America, Canada and Australia. For example, every State in Australia has legislation governing wills. The legislation varies from State to State. To adopt the test of nationality would make it impossible to determine which system of State law governed a particular will. Nevertheless, domicile has its problems. Firstly, it is riddled with technical rules which mean that the domicile of a person may be far removed from where that person lives. I cite as an example a person who may have left Italy at the age of eight, moved to New Zealand, then, say, at the age of 15 moved to Sydney and at the age of 18 then went to Victoria with the intention of residing permanently in any one of the three places but not having made any decision. He would be amazed to find that his domicile was still in Italy. This would be because he had no intention of residing in any one place and therefore his country of origin had been revived. For example, even if a person intended to live indefinitely in Australia but retained a lingering desire to die in Italy, his domicile might be determined to be in Italy, irrespective of the fact that he might be an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> Domicile was defined by Lord Cranworth in the case of Whicker v. Hume in 1858 as 'home, the permanent home, and if you do not understand your permanent home, I am afraid that no illustrations drawn from foreign writers will very much help you to it'. Unfortunately Lord Cranworth's definition does not help much either. Long term residence in a particular place may not be enough to establish domicile. The test is both of residence and intention. It is the way the courts determine intention that makes domicile such a difficult concept. This Bill will abolish some of the more ludicrous rules of the common law. Clause 7 abolishes the rule known as the 'revival of the domicile of origin'. This meant that a person who acquired a domicile different from that where he was born and then left that place without any intention to live indefinitely in another place was deemed by the law to have the domicile of the place where he was born. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 10 of the Bill makes it clear that the necessary intention for a person is to make his or her home indefinitely, rather than permanently or perpetually, in a country. In Clause 4 country is defined as any State, province or other territory that is one of two or more territories that together form a country. Clause 11 defines that situation in which a person intends to live permanently, for example in Canada, but resides in Ontario until he is able to find a residence in Quebec. At that time that person is considered to have a domicile in Ontario because it is with Ontario that at that time he has the closest connection. That is an example of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reforms made by the Bill relate to children and the age of majority. Clause 8 specifies that a person can have an independent domicile at the age of 18 or on being married. Clause 9 of the Bill relates to the domicile of some children. As the Minister said in his second reading speech, at common law a child born of a married union acquired the domicile of his father while an ex- nuptial child acquired the domicile of his or her mother. The Bill provides that the child has the domicile of the parent with whom the child has his principal home. It makes the same provision for adopted children, with the added proviso that, if the child has only one adoptive parent, the child has the same domicile as that parent. If that parent dies, the child retains, until he or she can acquire a domicile of choice, the domicile of the deceased parent. Where an adoption is rescinded the domicile of the child becomes that of the natural parent or parents. In other words, it is assumed that the adoption never took place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports this Bill. It is perhaps worth noting in passing that, just as special provisions need to be made for federations in relations to the law of domicile, so the pace of law reform in a federation is very slow. These reforms have come 30 years after they were first mooted in Britain. The passage of the Bill through this place has not been hasty. It has already passed through the Senate and we can see no reason to delay it further. </PARA>
<PARA> The other Bill which we are debating is the Domicile (Consequential Amendments) Bill. This Bill simply repeals sub-section 5 (4) of the Marriage Act of 1961 and sub-section 4 (3) of the Family Law Act of 1975. These two sub-sections relate to the domicile of married women, abandonment of a domicile of choice and the capacity of people over 18 years of age to have an independent domicile for the purposes of the Act. These matters are now covered in the Domicile Bill and therefore, the two sub-sections are no longer relevant. While, technically, matters relating to the Family Law Act and the Marriage Act are subject to a free vote, the Opposition has no objections to the amendments as they are consequential on the passing of the Domicile Bill, which we support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Domicile Bill and the Domicile ( Consequential Amendments) Bill is to replace certain of the common law rules of domicile with statutory provisions which have been agreed upon by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, and to make consequential changes to the Marriage Act and the Family Law Act. Four important changes are made in this legislation. These changes relate to the abolition of the rule of dependent domicile of married women, the abolition of the rule of revival of domicile of orgin, the age of capacity to have an independent domicile, which is fixed at 18 years, and new rules for determining the domicile of certain children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Domicile is not a concept generally understood. Lawyers aside, people usually are aware of it only when it appears to complicate some piece of litigation in which they are engaged. It can, nonetheless, have significant consequences for an individual's status. A person's domicile is a place the law regards as his permanent home. A number of matters affecting personal capacity, such as capacity to marry and to make a will, are determined accordingly to the law of the place in which a person is said to be domiciled. The question where a person is domiciled is now determined according to a number of complex common law rules . At birth a person acquires his father's domicile, if his parents are married, or his mother's domicile if his parents are not married. </PARA>
<PARA> Other rules relate to changes of domicile, for example, where a person moves from one jurisdiction to another. The common law rules do not take account of modern social attitudes relating to the rights of parties to a marriage or the custody of children, nor do they reflect the increasing mobility of individuals. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has indicated, in a nation such as Australia which is a federation those complications can arise even if a person does not move outside the nation. The first change to which I wish to refer is that which abolishes the common law rule that a married woman has the same domicile as her husband. At present a woman acquires, upon marriage , the domicile of her husband and thereupon has no capacity to have an independent domicile. A wife continues to have the domicile of her husband throughtout the duration of a marriage, even if the spouses permanently separate and the husband acquires a domicile in a foreign country with which the wife has no connection. It is clearly no longer appropriate that a wife's domicile should automatically be the same as that of her husband. The common law rule is abolished by this Bill and a married woman will have an independent capacity to acquire a domicile of her own. </PARA>
<PARA> The second change is to abolish a common law rule known as the revival of the domicile of origin. This rule is complex and inconvenient and can have unexpected results for the individual whose status has become important in litigation. the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gave a number of examples of that just now. At the same time a new provision is introduced in clause 10 that states that the intention a person must have in order to acquire a domicile of choice in a country is the intention to make his or her home indefinitely in that country. There have, until now, been problems at common law in establishing the acquisition of domicile of choice. One hopes that this provision will make this easier. In particular, problems can arise in a country such as Australia which comprises a number of States and Territories. A person may come to Australia with the intention to settle permanently but because he moves between States he may be domiciled in Australia for the purposes of Commonwealth law but not have sufficient connection with any particular State to acquire a domicile of choice in any State for the purposes of State law. Clause 11 of the Bill deals with this situation by providing that a person who is domiciled in a union but is not domiciled in any particular part of that union is to be domiciled in that part of the union with which he has for the time being the closest connection. </PARA>
<PARA> The third change made by the Bill relates to the age at which a person is capable of having an independent domicile. Clause 8 provides that a person is capable of having an independent domicile if he has attained the age of 18 years or he is or has at any time been married. This change recognises the contemporary view of the age of majority which is already incorporated in other legislation. The Bill includes a number of changes related to children. Under common law, a child born in wedlock acquires the domicile of his father; an illegitimate child acquires the domicile of his mother. In a situation where the parents have separated it would be quite possible under common law to find the child living with the parent other than the parent whose domicile he has acquired. This Bill makes the sensible provision that in such circumstances the child has the domicile of the parent with whom he has his principal home. I am aware of some custody orders which have been made in recent years which give children equal time in both parents' homes alternately. I hope I never have to be a participant in a case which decides the domicile of the child. The Bill also makes provision for the case of adopted children. </PARA>
<PARA> The enactment by the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory of the model domicile legislation will rationalise and modernise the rules of domicile. The Attorneys-General are to be commended for acting together to reform a complex area of law. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Bill. I think it is appropriate that it be debated at this time because the dried fruit industry along the Murray Valley is presently picking one of its best ever crops. Many thousands of pickers are involved in the production of this harvest and it is expected that the yield will be well above any previous production figures. I am told that the currant crop will yield some 7,200 dried tonnes. Last year this crop yielded only 4,000 tonnes. The sultana crop is likely to reach some 75,000 dried tonnes, being the equivalent of about 300,000 tonnes of fresh grapes. The entire crop being produced this year throughout the Sunraysia and mid-Murray areas of my electorate and on the other side of the river in New South Wales is estimated to yield $90m, and 50,000 tonnes of dried fruit are expected to be exported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given that this large crop is presently being picked, I believe it is important and significant that this legislation is now before the Federal Parliament. The Bill that we are debating seeks to provide an underwriting arrangement to support, if necessary, returns to the producers of dried sultana grapes in the 1982 to 1986 seasons. The arrangement before us at the present time in acceptable to the dried fruits industry. It is in fact at the industry's request . I emphasise that the legislation applies only to dried sultanas, which presently accounts for some 85 per cent of the dried fruit production. The House would be aware that previous stabilisation schemes for dried fruits have been in existence for most seasons since 1964. The latest arrangements, which applied to sultanas in the 1978 to 1980 seasons, was terminated at the industry's request in 1980 when it became evident that very favourable export prices in those seasons had made government support unnecessary. We are also aware that export prices for dried vine fruits are volatile. Any major crop failure, such as the one we saw in the United States of America in 1979 which triggered off large rises in world prices, can occur at any time. On the other hand, abundant supplies can rapidly develop, leading to keen price competition. </PARA>
<PARA> World production in 1980-81 was relatively high and prospects for further big crops for the second year in several major producing countries during the current Northern Hemisphere autumn have already brought about reductions in world prices. In Australia our home market absorbs one-third of our production of dried sultanas. However, the dried fruit industry and the Government are concerned that the income position of Australian producers is vulnerable, particularly if an abrupt worsening of conditions on world markets occurs. I shall return to this problem shortly, particularly in respect of volatile production and trading conditions in other countries. The Government has therefore decided in this legislation to implement an underwriting arrangement to provide a measure of security for producers against sudden large falls in world prices. The scheme that we are legislating for will provide security for producers but, I emphasise, it will not insulate them from market price signals which might be indicating that fundamental changes should be made to the structure of production and trade. </PARA>
<PARA> As the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) indicates, the underwriting arrangement is based on the Government guaranteeing minimum returns per tonne for production in the 1982, 1983 and 1984 seasons which will be equal to 90 per cent of the average of net returns per tonne to packers in the preceding two seasons and the estimated net return for the current season. In the 1985 and 1986 seasons the guaranteed minimum return will be 95 per cent of the three-year average net return. If the net return for a season is less than the guaranteed level or underwriting payment equal to the difference would be made in respect of the total production in that season. The provision for the guaranteed minimum return to be set at 90 per cent in the first three seasons reflects the satisfactory export prices which the industry has enjoyed in recent seasons. If one travels through the grape growing areas of the Murray Valley one will see that these higher prices have been reflected in the obvious improvement that has taken place in recent years in personal lifestyles, and this is something that I think has been warranted for many years . As I have said, the determination of the three-year average return requires an estimate to be made of the average return requires an estimate to be made of the average return for the current season. This will be determined by the Minister after consideration of advice and information provided by the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The administration of the underwriting scheme is to be vested in the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the very real concern that the dried fruit industry has about, particularly, the influences of the European Economic Community in the world trading scene. We are all aware that, prior to the Common Agricultural Policy, Australia secured and held European markets-mainly but not solely in Great Britain-for its farm products on the basis of price and quality considerations. However, the progressive exclusion of Australian farm products from the Community as a direct consequence of the policy of Community preference is only one aspect of Australia's concern. Perhaps I could give some examples of the rundown in trade that has occurred between Australia and the EEC over the last few years. In 1958-59 Australia exported 71 per cent of its beef and veal to the EEC. In 1979-80 it exported only 2 per cent. In 1958-59 Australia exported 69 per cent of its dairy and egg products to the EEC. Now it exports none. Australia exported 48 per cent of its sugar to the EEC in 1958-59 but now it exports none. In 1958-59 it exported 48 per cent of its wheat to the EEC but now it exports none. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the loss of these markets on Australia is very real. Industries for which no alternative markets can be developed have had to scale down production. This inevitably has led to a reduction in the numbers engaged in affected industries with consequent adverse effects on towns and regions. In the past decade the number of dairy farms in Australia has declined by 54 per cent. Peach and pear production has declined by one-third, apple production by over 20 per cent and the number of beef producers by 30 per cent. If this adjustment to change had been substantially shared by both the Community and third countries and real restraint had been exercised on the part of the Community in terms of support prices, self-sufficiency ratios, import levies and export restitutions and exports, a degree of fairness and equity might have been achieved and the needs of world trade advanced. That this has not happened is a matter of great concern to Australia. Indeed, the situation worsens each year and the gulf between the Community and Third World countries deepens. In short, the continual rise in Common Agricultural Policy support prices has called forth ever increasing production across the whole range of temperate zone commodities. Since its inception in 1962, the CAP has acted to displace Australian farm products first from continental Europe, then from the United Kingdom and now, with further enlargement, from the few remaining markets. As well it has begun to invade third markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background of the loss of traditional markets described above, of even greater concern and complaint is the emergence of the Community as an agricultural exporter of major proportions on the basis of subsidised export disposal. This is the result of excessively high producer supports, unrestrained production, high domestic food prices and extensive intervention in foreign trade. As a consequence of European integration Australia has been forced to develop entirely new agricultural markets in the Middle East and in East and South East Asia. These markets are now also threatened by subsidised exports from the Community. The CAP has been massively successful in generating production but highly unsuccessful in achieving expanded levels of consumption of such production in the Community. As a result, massive surpluses have been disposed of on world markets. Nowhere has this been of more importance or significance than the effect of the EEC in relation to the dried fruit industry. It is in this area that the dried fruit industry is extremely concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the EEC is the largest export market for Australian sultana production with some 30 per cent being exported to it. The EEC is also the largest world importer of sultanas, taking 55 per cent of total world imports. Exports to the EEC have traditionally accounted for about 46 per cent of total exports of the Australian crop. These, of course, have gone mostly to the United Kingdom and more recently to the Federal Republic of Germany. Exports of sultanas to the EEC in 1979 totalled some 10,000 tonnes at a value of about $A11m. In 1980 they totalled some 32,000 tonnes with value of $A40m. On the basis of the very low self-sufficiency in the Community, dried vine fruits was one of the few commodities in respect of which Australia's traditional United Kingdom-Europe trade remained relatively unaffected by the CAP regime. However, the entry of Greece into the EEC in 1981 has changed this outlook substantially. Greece has traditionally been a major world producer and supplier to the EEC of dried vine fruit. However, following the accession by Greece to the EEC, an EEC system of production aids for dried vine fruit was implemented in August 1981. This was designed to permit growers to compete with Third World suppliers to the EEC but it also effectively guarantees high returns to their growers. In essence the regime consists of a subsidy to producers-a subsidy for storage, compensation for losses incurred in storage and subsidised sales by tender for storage agencies where the market situation so requires. The processing subsidy is calculated as the difference between total processor costs and the frontier price of Third country imports. Current low prices on world markets and for imports into the EEC are presently inhibiting purchases of Greek fruit by processors with the result that most of the 1981 Greek crop has been put into storage. It is also alleged that processing at current prices would be unprofitable because of the generous minimum prices paid to growers. Attempts have been made to sell fruit by tender from storage agencies but few sales of Greek fruit have been made because of the high reserve prices set by the EEC Commission. Under the tender system that exists the difference between the tender price and the minimum price would be funded from that fund that backs the Common Agricultural Policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned and the industry is concerned about these circumstances for three main reasons. Firstly, the dried vine fruit regime is an unreasonable concession to Greece. Secondly, the regime may be the forerunner of more direct restrictions on imports of dried vine fruit from Third country suppliers. In this regard there has been a recent reduction in access under the annual concessionary quota for dried vine fruit and an increase in the operative tariff . Thirdly, there must also be a concern that if prices for dried vine fruit remain at depressed levels into this year's marketing season, returns to Australian producers will be significantly reduced. Whilst Greece has traditionally produced a substantial quantity of sultanas it has been claimed by Greek producers that the scope for this to increase is limited and that as a consequence increased returns to producers will not result in greater production in competition from Greek exporter in the EEC markets. However, I believe that these claims are based on some assumptions which may no be valid. Firstly, the primary restraint on increased production is assumed to be the limited land area available. This, however, does not take account of the potential in Greece to increase productivity yield within existing producing areas and also ignores the potential for additional plantings in areas currently occupied by alternative crops. It also ignores the fact that Greece may encourage increased production through the availability of subsidies which would allow the EEC to become more self-sufficient and the future import market would therefore decline. This, of course, would lead in time to increased competition in other Third World markets . </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government is making repeated representations to the EEC Commission both in Canberra and Brussels and it was making these representations three years before the new regime was finalised. These representations have been maintained since that time. the Australian Government has urged restraint in setting the levels of dried vine fruit production aids because it foresaw the likelihood that these subsidies would depress prices in the EEC and new production would be encouraged in Greece. The Commission, however, has discounted our concerns and maintained that the support measures for dried vine fruit were unlikely to harm Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Since August 1981 at every indication that Australia's fears of the effects of the dried vine fruit subsidies were justified the Government at both ministerial and official level has made representations to the EEC. Throughout this period I am aware that the Department of Trade and Resources through the Department of Primary Industry has consulted the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation with a view to ensuring that the Australian industry is fully consulted on all developments including the various actions taken with the EEC. To date, however, our representations have not resulted in any modification of the dried vine fruit subsidies. The Government, in closer consultation with the Australian industry, is now examining its options including possible action under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States of America, another major exporter of dried vine fruit to the EEC, has also failed to secure assurances from the Commission officials that the effect of the dried vine fruit subsidies will be moderated and has recently taken a decision also to seek consultation with the EEC under GATT. The Australian Government is presently liaising with the United States on these consultations. The object is to achieve order in the trading situation and to maintain full access for Australian fruit to the EEC market. </PARA>
<PARA> I support this Bill. I believe it does show that our Government is prepared to make arrangements to provide stability for the future of the dried fruit industry extending over the 1982 season into the 1986 season. I hope that in that time some moderation of the Common Agricultural Policy will take place allowing the Australian dried fruit industry to have the same access to the European market that it has had in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) has given the House a very thorough outline of the mechanics of the Dried Sultana Production Underwriting Bill. Of course we are all aware that his electorate is the one that produces more dried vine fruit than any other in Australia. His comments ranged very widely over the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Economic Community and any commodity that is so possibly affected by that Policy also needs to be discussed at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose this Bill and we indicated this when we did not oppose the Dried Vine Fruit Stabilization Legislation Repeal Bill 1981 which was debated nearly a year ago on 5 March. At that time the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) said that an underwriting scheme would be introduced. But even over a year ago the Minister and his officials were in discussion with the Australian Dried Fruits Association as to the level of the underwriting and whilst the industry has suffered no disadvantage from the delay, the lapse of time is typical of procrastination by this Government and the Minister when it comes to rural issues generally and the welfare of Australia's primary industries. Quite apart from the fact there has been economic bungling on the part of the Government such as the level of interest rates which have a particular impact on our primary industries and quite apart from the fact that the Government has allowed to persist an overvalued currency disadvantaging rural exporters, the Government will take no positive action to help specific industries. The industry in most trouble at present is the beef industry and the Government will do nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The negotiations with the Association took so long because the Government was insisting that domestic prices be related to export prices. Given the fluctuation in price on world markets, the industry's case was understandable and supportable. While the Minister's second reading speech does not acknowledge the success of the industry, in putting its case, he at least alludes to it when he said that prices in the domestic market should be maintained but that rises in price will be moderate. While the industry now accepts the provisions of the Bill, it still has some reservations about the level of underwriting, particularly at a time when inflation caused by the Fraser-Howard Government's policies is still rampant. The 90 per cent level of underwriting, related to the average net returns per tonne to packers in the preceding two seasons and the estimated net return for the current season, when taken into account with the level of inflation could give a real price per tonne for sultanas-working from two years back-of only between $850 and $900 a tonne. This is an unprofitable level-a level at which most growers would go broke. Previously the Association has administered stabilisation and equalisation arrangements and all negotiations with the industry have sensibly been between the Government and the Association. The Australian Dried Fruits Corporation now has the powers of administering the equalisation arrangement and while it was essential for the Association-that is the growers-to have been fully involved in the negotiations we are now talking about, I find it hard to understand why the Corporation was not also involved in the negotiations too, particularly when the Corporation will administer the new underwriting arrangement from now on. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to Greece's accession to the EEC the organisation of the international market between the northern and southern hemisphere producing countries had been by informal agreements. Australia has often taken the initiative in trying to get some sort of order into the trade. Supply and demand have always been taken into account. In the past two years prices have been firm but there was a slight shortfall in production. This situation has now changed and the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) has referred to this. The northern hemisphere has had excellent crops and Greece's usual crop of some 65,000 tonnes of sultanas is up to 100,000 tonnes. So export prices are going down and the Greek crop is now in the hands of the Brussels Commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's primary producers rightfully are concerned by EEC policies in a range of agricultural and pastoral products. While the EEC follows policies that the National Country Party would like to see applied here for our domestic industries, it has no choice but to protest strongly at the effects of the decisions on more efficient exporting industries and exporting countries such as Australia. The Opposition joins with the Government in making as strong a case as possible that EEC policies, which result in surpluses that have to be dumped and take third markets off us and result in generally inefficient agriculture in the EEC, are not in the long term interests of the people in the EEC who have to pay the taxes to support this unprofitable production when it is often producing products that could be more cheaply bought on the free international markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and I were in London some two weeks ago and we again made Australia's case known in the strongest terms possible to the British Government. For the reasons I have already stated, export prices bear little relation to the cost of production. Quite apart from the slight over -supply situation at present, one of the key factors determining the price from now on will be the price set by the Brussels Commissioners for the Greek crop. Since 1978 prices for the Australian crop have ranged from between $A1,090 to $ A1,650 per tonne. The $A1,650 Australian price gave Australian growers returns in excess of $A1,000 per tonne for the first time. This represented a doubling of the price of some five years before. The 1981 crop was sold, or is being sold , for prices below this and the current price on offer is about $A1,375 per tonne, which equals about $US1,600 a tonne c.i.f. cost, insurance and freight. I give these figures to show that if, as is rumoured, the EEC sets a price equivalent to $A1,250, c.i.f., there will be a downward pressure on Australian prices for the coming season's crop which is now estimated to be something like 65,000 tonnes of sultanas, most of which is predicted to be high quality three, four and five crown. It is estimated that the price which will trigger the underwriting mechanism is about $A1,000 a tonne. I think we can believe that this level will not be reached. Australia and South Africa in setting southern hemisphere prices next month should not go below $US1,550 as world stocks are not all that high and the previous informal arrangements need to be persisted with so that Greece's accession to the EEC does not distort the world price for sultanas to an unrealistic degree. To back up that statement, I advise the House of a telex from the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. This was repeated by Mr Sutterby, President of the Federal Council of Australian Dried Fruits Association, to the recent Bureau of Agricultural Economics Outlook Conference. A telex was sent to Greece, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, South Africa and the United States of America for information. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Dried Fruits Corporation is extremely concerned at the very low prices particularly those emanating from Turkish exporters now being offered in world markets for 1981 season's sultanas. We are well aware of the very favourable benefits received recently from the European Commission by the dried fruits industry in Greece particularly the sultana and currant growers and while we may continue to express our disapproval at those developments our immediate problem is to stop the run on export prices. </PARA>
<PARA> We maintain that there are no justifiable reasons for the present low prices- world stocks are not large and as you know world export trade in sultanas/ raisins is around 350,000 annually. We must maintain that business. </PARA>
<PARA> World markets will not react in a positive manner when prices are low and falling and this approach to your organisation is being made in the sincere hope the present attitude of selling at prices not in accordance with the proper market indicators will be reversed. </PARA>
<PARA> We all owe it to our producers and respective countries to obtain the best possible returns and so limit as far as we possibly can the call on our governments for financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> During the four years from 1977 to 1980 dried fruit producers throughout the world had no need for any recourse to governments for assistance. We in Australia fail to understand why sultana producing countries should subsidise the dried fruit trades in importing countries. If there is any thought that the present low prices will be passed on for the benefit of the consumer we should think again. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 12 months sultana prices in world export trade have fallen by 30 to 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We fear that what may happen will be a repetition of the early 1960s when prices dropped from 150 pounds sterling to 78 pounds sterling. It was only then that sultana producing countries through the intervention of their governments stopped the run on prices and decided that Australia, Greece and Turkey should talk together. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not need government intervention now or any other time on a matter well within the capabilities of the dried fruit industries in Australia, Greece, Turkey and others to correct. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote this telex because it sets out very clearly the Dried Fruits Corporation 's case, the case of the Australian growers and the need, as I have emphasised, for informal arrangements to prevail in the sultana market. I am sure all Government members and all Opposition members are very much aware that if Brussels sets a price so high that surplus production is encouraged, this would be worse in the long term than if too low a price were set in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure before the House only cushions Australian producers from an abrupt worsening of market conditions. While we are in a position of some uncertainty at present both in price and by way of diversion, one would hope that if conditions do change for the worse and if the underwriting is shown to be inadequate, the Government will respond with alacrity to allow the industry to survive in the short term or to adjust in the long term. Underwriting is a more economically rational way of dealing with government support for primary industries. This measure is now common to other industries, such as the wheat industry and dairying. The Opposition supports the Bill but, once again, wishes to emphasise that the Government needs to be more sensitive to the industry's needs at this time and for the rest of this season than it is to the plight of some of Australia's other primary industries. We support the measures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a contribution to this important debate on the Dried Sultana Production Underwriting Bill. There is no doubt whatsoever that the dried vine fruits industry is a significant industry in the context of Australian primary production. It is widespread throughout the Murray Valley area. It is an industry on which thousands of families depend. It is an industry which, unlike a lot of other industries in this country, is highly decentralised . Not only are a lot of people directly involved in growing the product and what have you but also a lot of people are employed in and otherwise involved in processing and packing-the general secondary phase of the industry. This legislation is important to that industry. Obviously we on the Government side of the House support it. However, the Australian Labor Party seems to lack interest in this matter and is not playing much of a part in debate on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to provide underwriting, to provide support, if it becomes necessary, for the returns of producers in the dried sultana grapes industry in the seasons from 1982 to 1986. Such an arrangement was requested by the industry and is acceptable to it. It will apply only to sultanas, which account for about 85 per cent of the production of dried vine fruits. One of the difficulties the industry is facing is that threats are being made by the European Economics Community, largely as a result of the accession of Greece to the European Economic Community and the fact that Greece now takes its place in the arrangements known as the Common Agricultural Policy. I think it is fairly well known in this chamber and in this country generally that Europe has traditionally been a large buyer of Australian sultanas. We as a nation have exported quite significant tonnages of sultanas to the European Economic Community in recent years. For instance, in 1980 we exported 32,000 tonnes of sultanas. Since 1975, the tonnage has varied between about 11,000 and 32,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> The dried vine fruits industry, particularly that part involving sultanas, is one of the industries which survived the arrangements made on the formation of the European Economic Community and the introduction of the Common Agricultural Policy. That was largely because there was not in the European Economic Community a country with a significant industry of that nature; therefore there was no competition for the Australian product. Traditionally about 30 per cent of our sultana production has been exported to Europe. However, the entry of Greece into the Common Market last year changed quite significantly the situation in relation to dried vine fruits. Greece is a dried vine fruits producer and was a supplier of dried vine fruits to the Common Market before its entry. However, now that it is a member of the Common Market and has been able to seek arrangements to protect its producers under the Common Agricultural Policy, it is quite likely that support which has been or may be granted to Greek producers and processors will disrupt the Australian producers' market in the European Economic Community. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall talk a little of the background of the Common Agricultural Policy because I think it is important that this House and Australians generally understand to a far greater extent than perhaps they do the basis of the Common Agricultural Policy and why it has the effect it has on Australia. It was introduced in 1962 and developed out of the original Treaty of Rome. Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome defines the five fundamental objectives assigned to the Common Agricultural Policy as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> to increase productivity by promoting technical progress and by assuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour;</PARA>
<PARA> to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community;</PARA>
<PARA> to stabilise markets;</PARA>
<PARA> to assure the availability of supplies; and</PARA>
<PARA> to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices. </PARA>
<PARA>To meet the above objectives various markets for farm produce have been progressively organised, based on three fundamental principles, namely, the single market, community preference and joint financial responsibility. Single market implies total trade liberalisation between the member countries, therefore the removal of customs duties and non-tariff barriers between the member countries. Community preference is the indispensable corollary of the single market. Protection for the European market against low priced imports is provided by Customs duty at Community frontiers. </PARA>
<PARA> Levies dissuade the outflow of Community products to higher priced markets outside the EEC insofar as it is necessary to guarantee supplies to European consumers. That is a fairly important rider 'insofar as it is necessary to guarantee supplies to European consumers'. As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) who is sitting at the table, his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony), and particularly those of us who are members of the National Country Party are well aware, the reality is it is with those commodities in which there are surpluses which are sought to be exported that so much difficulty and disruption has been caused to Australian trade. Joint financial responsibility arises logically from the two preceding principles and is embodied in the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, which is an integral part of the Community budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Economic Community has a limited source of revenue. Largely it comes from Customs revenue. My latest figures indicate that of the order of 75 per cent of the EEC budget is spent on the Common Agricultural Policy, not only on paying subsidies to the producers of various agricultural commodities within Europe but also in providing export subsidies to enable produce to be sold outside the Common Market boundaries. That I would think is a unique situation. I am sure that if we could arrange such a situation for the farming community in Australia everyone in that community would regard it as an outstanding achievement. It creates a double whammy effect. Not only is assistance given to the producer to produce a commodity, but also if that commodity, having been produced with assistance from government, in effect, cannot be sold because its price is too high, a further subsidy is applied to help it to be off-loaded onto third markets, That obviously is of great concern to Australia, particularly the agricultural producers and exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> My leader, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources, is on record as having not only in this chamber but also around Australia and in Europe, argued vigorously against the sorts of policies the Europeans have adopted and as having defended strongly the rights of the Australian primary producers-be he a dried vine fruits man, a sugar producer, a wheat producer or a beef producer-to sell that produce in a fair and competitive way in world markets and not to have his situation disrupted by the totally unethical methods adopted by the European Economic Community under the Common Agricultural Policy. That policy creates enormous difficulties not only for Australia but also for other Third World nations, other developing and developed nations which export agricultural produce. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obviously a matter of record that Australia's protestations have been vigorous and lengthy, and it seems that it will be only as a result of pressure from within the Community itself that we will be able to get some semblance of sanity into the Common Market. I was in a party that visited Brussels a couple of years ago and we held discussions with officers of the Community. We spoke also to officials in France, France being a member of the Community and benefiting to some extent from the Common Agricultural Policy. It became fairly apparent at that stage that the costs of supporting the Common Agricultural Policy may ultimately sink that policy. They tended to take the view at that time that they would seek to maintain, in the industries in which they were operating, those producers involved at that time and they would allow any growth in the European market to be taken up by imports; they would not seek to encourage further any highly subsidised high cost European production of agricultural commodities. </PARA>

If we were to get into a situation-it seems we may-in which the Common Agricultural Policy was being used on yet another occasion in yet another industry to provide support for a domestic European primary industry to the detriment of what is obviously an efficient industry in Australia, that would concern me greatly. The Government is obviously concerned about the industry in Australia and the industry has its own reasons to look to its future. It is for that reason that the Government and the Minister for Primary Industry have introduced the legislation we are debating this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most honourable members are aware that a stabilisation scheme has existed in most seasons for almost a couple of decades. In recent years we have not needed export support and for that reason it has not really been operative. But the fact is that it is a volatile market and if world situations develop as a result of seasonal conditions in other countries prices can fluctuate quite dramatically. World production in the 1980-81 season was relatively high and that could lead to reductions in world prices. We have to understand that whilst the Australian domestic market consumes a significant part of our production-I think around one third-we do rely very heavily on the export market. It is for that reason that the price of the product on the export market becomes of great significance to the producers. It is not so much a Cinderella industry but it is not one of the big primary production industries. When we talk about agriculture in Australia we tend to think in terms of wool, wheat and meat. It is often the case that we are not as cognisant as we might be of the smaller industries which do contribute quite substantially to Australia's export figures. As I indicated at the outset, these industries are of great importance to not only a large number of producers but also the people who are employed in the further stages of the industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Mallee so rightly says-he is a member who probably represents more dried vine fruit producers than anyone else in this chamber-it is an industry which is highly decentralised. That point cannot be made too strongly. The exports of sultanas to the EEC alone in 1980 earned $40m for this country. That is a significant amount of money not only for the overall Australian trade figures but also for the people involved in the industry who rely on it for their own well being and to support their families. That needs to be brought home and it cannot be brought home strongly enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend the Government for taking action to guarantee minimum returns per tonne from production in the 1982, 1983 and 1984 seasons of equal to 90 per cent of the average of net returns per tonne to packers in the preceding two seasons and the estimated net return for the current season. A similar arrangement has worked very well in the wheat industry in the years since that formula was introduced. I am sure that the same experience will apply in the dried vine fruits industry, particularly for the sultana growers. In the 1985 and 1986 seasons the guaranteed minimum return will rise to 95 per cent of the three-year average net return. So the Government has not been slow in coming forward to meet the needs of this important industry. This measure will be well received by the growers, packers, processors and exporters in the industry. I just make a plea, particularly as the European Economic Community is on the verge of setting up a mission in this country, that its representatives take back to Europe the message that I and other speakers in this debate have made about the problems that Europe creates for our-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Mr Deputy Speaker, the last thing I want to do is to stop the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) from speaking but I respect your ruling on the Standing Orders. I am speaking in the debate on the Dried Sultana Production Underwriting Bill not because in my country electorate we grow any dried vine fruits but because any Bill that has to do with government intervention or stabilisation affects my farmers in one way or another. I want to take the opportunity to raise one or two points about the effects of subsidies in rural industry and some of the good reasons why they are very necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, there are many people-especially those who live in city areas-who are connected with secondary and tertiary industries who see the Australian farmer as being heavily subsidised. Even in country towns in a country electorate one finds fairly constant criticism of farmers because it is perceived that at every Budget they receive handouts, that is, handouts through either subsidies, stabilisation schemes, underwriting schemes or new concessions that a government such as ours, which is very concerned about country people, tends to introduce from time to time. We do that with a great sense of responsibility to country people. We recognise the role they have played in the development of our nation. But more than that, we recognise that in Australia we have the most efficient primary production sector of any country. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot produce accurate figures because the figures would depend on one's system of calculation, but it is said that Australian farmers, per head, produce enough to feed about 70 to 80 people. It is said that another great and supposedly efficient primary production country, the United States of America, produces per farming head enough food to feed about 30 people. Without going into other relative rates of production in countries such as India, Libya or any other country such as those by comparing ourselves with the USA it is possible to demonstrate just how efficient we are. We, therefore, have an industry that always will be able to stand on its feet. One of the reasons it will be able to stand on its feet is that it has always been forced to in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been an innovative primary production country. It is a country where our own consultants and experts are always giving valued advice to emerging countries, especially with respect to dry land farming, irrigation techniques and breeding and animal husbandry techniques. It is one of my great joys to represent many Australian farmers who are able to compete on world markets and who are able to hold their heads up high and produce reasonable returns in the face of very substantial privileges which are being given to other sectors of industry but are not available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the European Economic Community has been noted and, of course, it has been a great danger to Australia. But more than that, the common agricultural policy has presented a great danger to the EEC because if any country pursues a policy of over-protection within its own country it is bound to become less efficient. In toto it is bound to compete on world markets worse than it did previously. The evidence is showing through very rapidly at the moment that the common agricultural policy is contributing a great deal to the reduction in efficiencies in Germany and in a more recent joiner of the EEC, the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> All of that is a matter of record. I think the greatest argument against the EEC we have on our side for the next 10 or 15 years is the argument that must emerge through the EEC's own understanding of its own mistakes. I say that they are mistakes because, quite demonstrably, they are. Those mistakes, apart from pulling down the overall efficiency of those economies, have great effect on us. In the dried vine fruits area, as the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) has just pointed out, in this coming season we are at risk of having fruit virtually dumped from one of the members of the EEC, namely Greece. I have read that following the election of the socialist Government in Greece Mr Papandreou has said that he might favour removing Greece from the EEC. Nothing would delight me more at present than to see that because without the EEC this would be one industry that would not have the same support. Be that as it may, we have to continue our discussions with and our persuasion of the EEC to reverse its policies with respect to agriculture. We have to hope that sense will prevail through the realisation that the common agricultural policy is dragging down the rest of the economy and dragging down other industries within the EEC that have always been efficient-for instance, manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to our Government's handling of a stabilisation or similar scheme it has been interesting to see the evolution. When these things were not so well tested there was a tendency in Australia to go in for other sorts of schemes such as a stabilisation scheme that was used in the milk industry for many years which, in fact, proved-we were the first to recognise it-not to be in the best interests of the industry in terms of encouraging efficient production and better returns. It was a sincere attempt in the early days to provide better returns but, in fact, it did not work. We found-I am talking about the milk industry because it illustrates the evolution-that because it was a stabilisation scheme where there was a guaranteed return of a particular nature, some producers were actively selling milk products overseas at very low prices in order to have higher production and, therefore, supposedly, economies of scale. That was dragging down other, usually smaller, producers in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> It was through very sensible decisions by the previous Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, that that whole milk mechanism was changed to an underwriting system. In this underwriting system with respect to dried vine fruits there is an inbuilt mechanism to militate against people selling overseas at too low a price. Honourable members would note from the legislation that if the price in a particular season is made artificially low, given that it would be supported by the mechanism of the underwriting, nevertheless that return price from overseas that year would, through averaging, be used to drop the underwriting price for the next year. In other words, there is a built in mechanism to keep exporters honest. That is one element that ought to be commented on. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I perhaps comment on other justification for this type of scheme I ought to talk about the general question of stability in markets. It is a glib and often illegitimate comment that we ought to have orderly marketing at all costs. Again, in the past the Australian farming community has tended to look for so- called orderly marketing as a matter of faith, but these days there is a great deal more sophistication among our farmers. They understand that orderly marketing at all costs can often mean merely propping up the more inefficient producers at the cost of the relatively more efficient; so orderly marketing at all costs is no longer a matter of faith. Nevertheless, the farming communities, going as they do through capricious seasons, receiving what they regard as capricious overseas prices and at times, because of particular levels of production, capricious local prices, generally say to me, at least in my electorate, that whereas they are prepared to stand up and survive in the basic market place, they do look for some form of income stability. </PARA>
<PARA> I imagine that anyone who lives with the seasons encountered in Australia would be prepared even to sacrifice a little income over, say, a 10-year period in order to have short term stability-to iron out the troughs and the peaks. This Government has recognised that, while at the same time recognising that people ought to be subject to the basic forces of the market and ought to adjust to long term trends. In the dried vine fruits industry, the wine industry, the apple industry, the wool industry and the meat industry there has been a shaking out from time to time, and at other times, an increase in production based on long term market signals. So I can support the basic thesis that farmers are prepared to sacrifice a small amount of income in order to have some basic income stability. It is really with this motivation in mind that the Government has introducted the legislation that is before us.</PARA>
<PARA> Another very good reason for its presentation is the old problem of coping with dumping by other countries. In our terms, and I believe any reasonable person's terms, the policies of the European Economic Community can amount to dumping. It is all right to say that people must live with the market and that people must cope with whatever prices competitors like to offer in the market, but it is another thing to say that that ought to be a universal rule during periods of short term dumping. Also, as a matter of faith in Australia, a principle support is that if there is evidence of dumping-which, of course, means indirectly that at any time supply could be reduced or removed, thereby removing a source of world supply-it is fair enough to protect our own people against dumping, at least in the short run. Australia having, as I have just suggested, the most efficient farming sector in the world, its farmers deserve to survive till the day when their very efficiency will allow them to compete.</PARA>
<PARA> Another feature that I like about this legislation, as distinct from other forms of government protection-it is a form of protection for an industry-is that it is quite visible. We also have other protection devices such as bounties . In essence, an underwriting scheme, whereby the Government is prepared to put up money to support an industry, is very visible because, when the Budget is brought down, the taxpayers can see that a certain sum is coming out of their pockets to support fellow workers. It is far less insidious than our other forms of protection that are provided not by the Government but by other consumers. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Lusher" NAMEID="VI7">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8Q7">Mr SAINSBURY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quotas are the most insidious form of protection. The Government is well aware of that. Some industries do have quotas and the Government has indicated its intention in that regard. In the case of the motor vehicle industry, in particular, it has stated, 'In about 10 years time you will just have to do without quotas.' That proposal, which was included in the government' s statement on the industry, is another step in the right direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another attractive feature of this legislation is that it may well cost the taxpayers nothing. An underwriting scheme merely provides that under certain conditions support will be provided. Under other conditions it will not be needed. The mechanism for deciding on a price is fair. I hope that that mechanism will not be required to operate, but at least the farmer and his family, functioning in an efficient environment, will know that within reasonable limits they can obtain protection for the next four or five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the legislation is simple. It is not a tricky device, not one which contains many overlays of constraints and regulations with money passing from one hand to another-complications that so often are introduced by governments of all political persuasions. Public servants have a penchant for that sort of thing, for trickiness in legislation. Thank heavens this is not one of the tricky ones. It is one that the farmers will be able to understand; that the Government will be able to administer very simply. I congratulate the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) who, although certainly not a simple person, can see things very clearly and express them without funny business or fuzziness. The legislation is a great credit to him. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Government is gradually moving away from such tricky situations, from artificial support schemes. Rural industry is also prepared at the present time to support that sort of drive. Of course, it wants to see the Government act consistently across all industries, but even leaving that aside, the National Farmers Federation has, quite gratifyingly, supported in principle the recommendations of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. That, one might say, has nothing to do with the dried vine fruits debate, but to me it does have a fair bit to do with it. The farming environment really requires protection only because of artificial structures in other parts of our economic environment. The NFF sees subsidies for farmers, long term, as not preferable to consistency, to an open market situation subject of course, to assistance such as is here proposed in the short term against dumping and other measures such as I have mentioned. In fact, the reaction of the NFF to the Campbell report was, in a sense, surprising to me. Campbell has suggested that the Primary Industry Bank of Australia be disbanded or put in other hands. It has suggested that the Development Bank need no longer, in a deregulated environment, be relevant. All of that makes sense to me, given of course that the full Campbell package is taken up by the Government. That is something that we have still to see. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the dried vine fruits industry is one which, even if in the next five or six years it costs the taxpayer something, would deserve some sort of man of the match award for having been an efficient industry, one that has been able to compete in distant markets. It is one that ought to be allowed to continue to exist in a competitive environment in Australia. For many years it will bring in export income and provide employment for a large number of people in certain areas of Australia-provided always the present Government stays in office. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It goes to show that the claims about the great interest of the Country Party are not warranted. I will say something else on the subject of interest. So far we have had three or four speeches from Country Party members. In each case what we have been given has been a repeat of the same story. This indicates that the Government is not bringing sufficient legislation before the Parliament and we are about to run out of the program. We are dragging on a debate when we should be discussing other matters. The Opposition does not oppose the Dried Sultana Production Underwriting Bill. For that reason we want to allow it to go through the Parliament in a reasonably speedy way. Instead, we have these long-winded speeches by Country Party members trying to justify overall Country Party policy rather than speaking to the Bill. I will take a similar liberty and take on some of those arguments. In his second reading speech the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The underwriting arrangement embodied in this Bill is similar to systems which the Government has introduced for the wheat, dairy and apple and pear industries . It is consistent with the export pricing policies which the Government has developed for those industries. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, we support this Bill and we support action of this kind to stabilise and underwrite rural industries. But let us make very clear the methods involved. They involve Government intervention. They involve the sorts of methods which the Government is not prepared to carry out in other sectors of the economy. In fact, when we advocate such forms of intervention in other sectors of the economy we are derided by the Government. The forms of intervention involved are important in stabilising our rural industries and we support them. But the fact remains that similar forms of intervention should be carried out in manufacturing industry and other industries to support them rather than, as was suggested by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hume, allowing them to go to the wall by simply removing all protection levels without intervening to support, restructure and sustain those industries. The previous speaker talked about the motor car industry and claimed that it was a great thing that all protection is to be removed in 10 years' time. If that is a great thing, let us apply the same principle to rural industry and see how the Government likes that. The thing is that there is a contradiction in Government policy between rural industries on the one hand and manufacturing and other industries on the other. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact remains that, although there are problems relating to the EEC, that by itself is not the totality of the situation. We have heard a lot about the Greek Government, the fact that Greece has entered the EEC which is affecting the possibility of dried vines and sultanas from Australia entering the EEC market. That is true. Nevertheless, if Greece had not joined the EEC we would still be in a difficult situation with our exports to the EEC. Let us just not blame the entry of Greece into the EEC. An earlier speaker mentioned the support price as a result of Greece's entry into the EEC. He failed to appreciate the implications of the price to be set for Greek grapes by the EEC. The support price should not become the world price for sultanas because, if it is too low, it will damage world trade as a whole; if it is too high, it will encourage unprofitable production. In this situation it is very important that all the other producing countries keep the market up and not undercut each other . That is why the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) cited the telex from the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. The other point missed by the honourable member for Hume was that of diversion. If Greece places in the European market sultanas presently being sold to Russia, it may take markets away from Australia. While the entry of Greece into the EEC may have made some change, it is not the cause of our problems in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So that the honourable member for Burke will understand, I will restate what I said but do so more slowly and clearly for him. His attitude reflects an anti-rural attitude in that he claimed that secondary industry in Australia did not receive anything like the assistance or protection that is given to the rural sector. He made some point of this. He went on at great length about how in many areas it was unfair for the rural sector to receive assistance, even though he did say that his party favoured taking the measure contained in this piece of legislation. I am glad to see the Labor Party is supporting the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was endeavouring to point to the comments of the honourable member for Burke which were typical anti-rural comments. He suggested that, because support to the rural sector in this kind of legislation is clear, open and evident for all to see, it is somehow more sinister and more offensive than the hidden support that is given to secondary industry, the costs of which are not as evident to the public and which I believe represent a principle which is unacceptable to large sections of the Australian community. I stress that it seems to me, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) said, that it is far better to support an industry openly, cleanly and honestly in the way in which an industry is being supported in this Bill than to adopt a system which has built up over previous years under governments of all political persuasions whereby there are hidden amounts of assistance and the public does not know the real cost of the protection given. I refer, for example, to many areas of manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA> I simply counter the proposition put by the honourable member for Burke which seems to me to be typical of the pro-urban position generally taken by the Labor Party in discussing rural matters. All the honourable member for Burke has succeeded in doing is confirming the general proposition that the Labor Party tends to have a bias against the rural sector. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Mr BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I point the honourable member for Burke to a few other matters that he raised in his speech and which were simply totally untrue. He said that there was a continuing revaluation of the Australian dollar which was damaging rural industries. If the honourable member for Burke directed his attention to what is really happening to the Australian dollar, he would see a tendency to devalue in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Burke also alleged that there was no legislation to be dealt with by the chamber. If he looked at the Daily Program he would see that today a matter is coming up of major significance to all sides of the House -it is certainly of major significance to this side of the House, and I would assume to the other side-the Freedom of Information Bill. If the honourable member for Burke limited his comments to matters of facts the status of his contribution to this House would certainly be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which I think the honourable member for Burke failed to understand in dealing with this legislation related to his saying that the Greek situation connected with dried fruits should not disadvantage Australia. That is my understanding of what he said. I do not think the honourable member for Burke understands the way the common agricultural policy actually works. The common agricultural policy will provide serious disadvantages to the Australian dried fruit industry now that Greece is a member of the Common Market. This is not simply illustrated by analogy although we can point to many other industries where the Common Market, which had been a major importer of rural items from Australia and other primary producing countries, as a result of the imposition of the common agricultural policy has become a major exporter. The dairy industry, for instance, is a classic example. Australia and New Zealand used to have various Common Market countries as their major customers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Common Market as a result of the exercise of the Common Agricultural Policy is now dumping massive surpluses in our other markets because of the encouragement to surplus production. The honourable member for Burke said that if the price were set too high there would be excessive production, and that would be silly. I am afraid that that is exactly what has happened in the Common Market, that is the result of the Common Agricultural Policy. Next month in Brussels there will be serious negotiations-I hope not disastrous-to establish a price rise for agricultural support in the current year. The French agricultural Minister has stated that the price rise will be 16 per cent-a 16 per cent increase in the support prices for agriculture in the Common Market. The consequence of that kind of price rise would be absolutely disastrous in most areas of agricultural production in which Australia is an exporter. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that we have in the case of dried fruits the situation which existed 10 years ago in the dairy industry. Now that Greece and Spain are members of the Common Market, we face the risk of exactly the same situation developing where excessively high support prices in Europe could generate enormous surpluses of production. Instead of the Common Market's being an importer, it will become a dumping exporter of the products. In butter, for example, the dairy surplus accounts for some 30 per cent of the European Economic Community's budget and about 40 per cent of total community expenditure on agricultural support. It seems to me that when that sort of thing is allowed to happen world trade ends up in a totally disruptive and disastrous situation. I hope this does not happen to the dried fruits industry. I am pointing to the dangers involved particularly if the French have their way in the negotiations which start next month. A price rise of 16.3 per cent in the support price for agricultural products for the current year, as recommended by the French agricultural Minister, will encourage such a massive increase in production across the board that it will inevitably mean the dumping disposal of huge European surpluses. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Burke does not seem to understand that not only are there price support schemes within the Common Agricultural Policy which generally involve the setting of a minimum price at which the intervention agencies of the member states acting on behalf of the Community purchase produce offered when market prices are weak at times of surplus, for example, but also there are minimum import prices which are designed to protect the Community markets from imports at prices below those of the Community. The import price limits would clearly disadvantage Australian exports of dried fruit and particularly sultanas with which this Bill mainly deals. They would clearly disadvantage Australian exports which may well otherwise have been able to go into Europe at lower prices and demand a larger market. In other words, the Greek producer is going to be protected against the Australian producer. Nothing that the honourable member for Burke said will diminish or detract from that point. I fail to understand why he felt that the Government was being somehow mistaken in complaining. The honourable member for Burke objected strongly to a speech from this side pointing to these dangers. I simply cannot understand why he would seek to diminish in any way the real threat that exists. I would only hope that in this industry the sorts of variations that we have had in prices will not lead to even further disruption to the industry now that the Common Market has extended its umbrella to producers such as Greece. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all aware of the fact that the major supplier in the world trade is, of course, the United States of America in the sense that if there is a crop failure in that country obviously prices will rise substantially, as they did, I think, in 1978. That led to very large rises in world prices. On the other hand- I take the honourable member for Burke's point that this might be, in his view, offensive socialism-it seems to me sensible and reasonable to have a price support system which allows for, as happened in the Australian dairy industry, intervention in the market of an underwritten price when there is a surplus. Dried fruits are a storeable commodity. Many people have said that intervention schemes should exist for many other commodities, such as meat. The price of storeage, frankly, makes it very difficult to run any kind of effective intervention price. But it seems to me that in the case of dried fruits an underwriting system is very reasonable and sensible. I certainly support such a scheme. I welcome the fact that the Labor Party also supports it. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that this kind of underwriting support system has been so successful in the dairy industry. In fact, from memory the latest year involved no actual cash payments because the price received was adequate before the intervention price was called on. I hope that there will be little need to resort to the underwriting price in this industry. Let us face it, given a fair deal in Europe there would be no need to use such a scheme. I regret to say that the experience of Australia in dealings with the Common Agricultural Policy is such that one would not look forward with confidence to getting a fair deal in Europe. It seems to me very important for this industry and many other export rural industries in Australia that the negotiations to be held next month in Brussels result in a far lower price rise than the 16 per cent being pressed by the French. The Common Market bureaucrats have suggested a 9 per cent price rise . I understand that such a rise would also lead to substantial increases in the surpluses of agricultural products from Europe which would be dumped on to Australian markets. I refer particularly to butter and meat. </PARA>
<PARA> As the House may remember, the Common Market used to be the biggest importer of meat after America. This year it will end up as the biggest exporter of that product. None of it will be exported at genuine prices. It will all be done at artificially dumped prices. The British Government is desperately seeking to limit the amount of the price rise in the Common Agricultural Policy this year. In fact, several members from both sides of this House had the opportunity to discuss this matter with Ministers of the British Government and senior bureaucrats during a recent official visit to Britain. There is no doubt that the British are very keen to limit the size of the price rise for the very simple reason that they will end up paying the bulk of the bill. It seems, therefore, that Britain and Australia have a similar objective in trying to limit the excesses of the Common Agricultural Policy which have done so much damage to trade and agricultural products throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I strongly support this Bill. I totally agree with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that this sort of legislation is the best way to deal with this kind of problem. Such an approach is open and the public is told exactly what the support is and what the cost of that support will be. Also I believe such a scheme enables the industry to know what it is doing and to have an understanding of what the future holds for it. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take up a few minutes of this debate to respond to a couple of points that have been raised and to put to rest the argument that the Australian Labor Party is a party that is interested only in the urban sector. The fact is that we support this Bill. So far in this debate we have heard everything from underwriting, which the Bill is about, to the marketing arrangements of the European Economic Community and just about every other industry in the rural sector. We must have a clear understanding of what underwriting involves. I should point out that the underwriting will not be set at a level which will do anything for farmers who are going broke. It will be set at a level that will allow the industry slowly to wind itself down. Many references have been made to the dairy industry. Honourable members should remember that the Government took a long time to get into the underwriting business in respect of that industry. In fact the dairy industry got right down to a broke position of 50c per lb for butterfat before the Government made any move in respect of underwriting. Even then it underwrote the industry only at a level at which thousands and thousands of farmers went out of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government members have said that they are helping the industry. What they are actually doing is providing funds to allow farmers to be paid until export markets can return money. That is basically the purpose of underwriting under this Government. The Government would like many people in the cities to believe that it is a government with a heart and understanding. This has never been the situation. The Government has not provided funds in that regard to the rural sector for a long time. We of the Labor Party understand what underwriting is about. We support the principle of underwriting because some industries have to be rationalised to enable them to be returned to an economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate there has been plenty of talk about the European Economic Community. The EEC is a fact of life. Every now and then we hear Country Party and Liberal Party supporters say in this place what a terrible thing the EEC is. We have to face up to the fact that the EEC does exist. We have to work within the policies of the EEC. The big thing that is affecting Australia's rural industries, the grape industry, our fruit industry and all exporting industries, is the revaluation of Australian currency. The honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) who put that case forward was ridiculed by the following speaker, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) but the honourable member for Hume was talking about the fact that over the last couple of months there has been a devaluation of 5 per cent or 6 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Seven per cent, as the honourable member for Mallee said, but not against all currencies. The honourable member was talking about major currencies such as the United States dollar. What we in the rural industry have to contend with at present is that government economic policies have created a situation in which the countries that we need to trade with have devalued against our currency by enormous amounts. There is very little point in Australian exporting industries going into those countries and expecting to get a return. One only has to look at the advantage New Zealand has at present and compare the value of New Zealand currency with the Australian currency to realise what would happen if these two countries were to compete on the same export markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mention has been made of the dairying industry. Today the dairying industry is strictly an industry that is based on the home market. There is very little export from this industry. In fact, the export opportunities available to the dairying industry at present would be barely enough to keep us in our own product if we have a bad season. The dried fruit industry which is under discussion today will be in the same position when it loses its market in the EEC. We have to bear in mind that any exporting industry, be it in agriculture or manufacturing, depends on exporting to a country where the revaluation of its currency is such that we are totally non-competitive. We have to look to the Government to protect those industries in some way. It is all very well to talk about underwriting but there is no guarantee that underwriting will be set at a figure that will allow an efficient and economic producer to stay in business. It is all right for the Minister to set a figure after looking at and equalising the returns. That will cost the Government nothing. We know in the present economic situation how hard it is to get two bob out of this Government and we in the Labor Party cannot see the Government providing even to the rural industry any great amount of money that will be of assistance to it. These industries are in desperate trouble because of the Government's economic policies. The countries which have revalued their currency are the ones that are --</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Chair is quite correct. None of the other speakers have been any closer to the Bill so I am quite entitled to say what I have been saying. The crux of the matter is that underwriting on its own will not be a solution to the problems of these industries that are in danger of losing their markets, these high paying markets such as the EEC. These industries will then be forced to sell on other export markets. It is not competition from the EEC that is the problem. The problem is one of valuation of money. The economic circumstances in this country prevent many export industries from competing on the export markets that are available. Those honourable members who watched the television program The History of Ireland, which was shown recently would be aware that in the last century a country was able to export food while its people died of starvation. We have the same situation in the world today. Australia is a country that can produce food at the present time but we are being asked to phase out agricultural industries simply because of the economic situation and the valuation of money.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Freedom of Information Bill which is now before the House. In continuing my remarks today from an earlier date last year when the Bill was being discussed I trust that the House will forgive me on this occasion for going over some of those remarks which describe the aims and objectives of this legislation. This Bill represents a major initiative by the Government in its program of administrative reform. In many respects it is unique. Although a number of countries have freedom of information legislation, Australia is in fact the first country in which a Westminster style of government operates to bring forward such a measure. I understand that at present Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are considering similar legislation. I think the Government of this country is to be commended for being the first to bring such a measure into the Parliament. At present in Canada I understand legislation is before the Parliament or the Government is looking at it before it is reintroduced. In New Zealand a parliamentary committee is examining similar legislation. In the United Kingdom I understand there have been several attempts by private members, from both government and opposition, but as yet there is no government information legislation before the House of Commons. I think Australia and the Fraser Government are to be congratulated and commended for bringing this legislation before the House and before the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I go into the detail of the legislation I think it is worth reflecting on the environment in which this legislation has been introduced. We are talking about the making available of information in Government departments and authorities to members of the public in this democracy of ours. I think it is worth reflecting just for a minute or two on the democracy and freedom we enjoy in this country because I suggest that only 20 or so countries enjoy the same sort of freedom that we do. I think it is appropriate that the Government should have introduced freedom of information legislation so that individuals and citizens can have access to Government records and information. The people should be entitled to have this sort of access. But I think it is worth remembering that many countries do not have these forms of democracies and are unlikely to have them. The whole of the Soviet bloc has no democracy. Freedom of information is anathema to the Soviet bloc and to the communist bloc. In many countries which have a dictatorship, of the Right or of the Left, the basic freedoms that we take for granted do not exist. It is in the concept that I have referred to, that is, the environment of the freedom that we have in this country under the Westminster system, that the Government has introduced this Freedom of Information Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three major aspects to the legislation. Firstly, it provides for the publication of certain government information, such as descriptive material about the functions, structures and operations of government. The second type of information for which publication is provided is the so-called hidden law-the manuals, the guidelines, the precedents and the instructions that are given in government by one government official to another-perhaps sometimes by Ministers, but mainly by the administrators. This provision for the publication of this material is designed to enable this so-called hidden law, this administrative structure of manuals and guidelines that I have referred to which flesh out acts , regulations, to be available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA> The second key element is that the Freedom of Information Bill provides for a right of access to documents in the possession of Commonwealth departments and statutory authorities. In this area there has to be a balance between the confidentiality of government and the right of access. This balance takes place in the legislation. I refer to Part IV which contains the exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth stating that the Bill does not set out to be a code of access but a minimum standard which any Minister in the Executive branch of government can go beyond at any time. The exemptions that I have referred to in Part IV are a basis for saying: 'I am not required to give you access.' They are not a basis for saying: 'I am prevented from giving you access.' The Bill says, in effect, ' I am not required to give you access.' As I have said, and I will say it again, it is not a basis for saying that a Minister or the Executive is prevented from doing this; it is a matter of establishing in the legislation a floor level of access. </PARA>
<PARA> The Freedom of Information Bill is certainly not a code of secrecy. It is very much a case of legislation where the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. We have to see how it is administered. Ministers should be encouraged to make available more than what is set as the minimum standard established by the Bill, more than the floor level. I am confident that that will occur. Of course, when legislation such as this is being introduced for the first time, it is quite right and proper to establish that minimum floor level. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect of the legislation that was introduced in the Senate is that there is a right of correction in respect of personal records. Honourable members will agree that that is proper, appropriate and right. The Bill also provides for an adequate right of appeal. It has mechanisms for that and has, as I have mentioned, the right of access and the right of correction. We need to recognise that a Government, like a business or a family, needs confidentiality and secrecy on occasions. That is right and proper. On the one hand, it is a matter of an appropriate balance between openness and confidentiality and, on the other hand, the extent to which the right of access to information given by the Bill should require the commitment of resources in depths and authorities at a time when the Government is seeking to contain the size of the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not know what the demand for access under the legislation will be and whether there will be a rush for access. We would not want to see the number of people needed to service this legislation to equal the size of one government department. We have to see how the legislation works and what the demand is. When the Government is seeking, as a matter of an economic policy, to contain the size of the public sector, the House will agree that an open-ended commitment of resources to this legislation at present is just not on. The Government is to be congratulated in this regard for having undertaken to review , after 12 months operation, whether additional rights of access might be given to documents already in the possession of agencies at the date on which the Bill comes into operation-that is, the so-called prior documents. As I have said before and indicated in my comments today, the policy of the Government is to make as much information as possible available to the public.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth reflecting on the Westminster system of government as we know it. As I said earlier, this Government and this country are the first operating under the Westminster system to have such legislation before it. There is, of course, legislation in the United States of America, but under the Westminster system, where there is a particular relationship between Executive government and the Parliament, it is a different ball game. Under our system, the Executive government of the day bears a responsibility to the Parliament and, through the Parliament to the people, for the proper discharge of the government of the country. In legislation like the Freedom of Information Bill before us today, we have to take care in adapting to our system a legal concept which has been derived from countries having systems different from ours. The present Bill we are talking about today needs to be seen also in the context of legislation that the Westminster system has produced, in the context of the systems of administrative review which have already been established under this Westminster system by this Parliament. I refer to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia operating under the powers conferred on it by the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> One also must remember that, under our system, Ministers are subjected to daily questions without notice in Parliament on matters within their ministerial responsibility. A mechanism is available to parliamentarians-honourable members and honourable senators-to place questions on the Notice Paper. This is not available under the American system where the Executive and the legislative branch are completely separate. Therefore, we cannot just adapt what has been implemented in the United States to the Westminster-Australian environment. Similarly, in our system honourable members have the opportunity to participate in debates-we have seen it today-and Ministers can be asked questions by members of their own Government back bench as well as by members of the Opposition. That is the Parliament at one of its best moments. That is where this system is different from the United States system. The Bill is interesting. It requires Ministers or departments seeking to withhold information to justify their decisions to deny access to information by reference to the criteria set out in the Bill. It puts a responsibility upon them to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I have talked of the balance in the Bill and I have talked of the mandatory provisions in it. The Bill imposes a positive obligation on departments and authorities to make public their organisations, structures and the functions they perform. They are also obliged to make available to their clients or customers the criteria employed in the exercise of decision-making functions. I am sure honourable members will agree with that. I found one interesting provision when I was browsing through the legislation earlier as to the requests involving the use of computers. I have not done any research, but I do not think there are very many Acts of Parliament that actually acknowledge the existence of computers. It is interesting that clause 17 of this Bill, in fact, does that because often information today may not be written or on file but, in fact, may be on a computer tape. The Bill provides that where the information is not available, as it puts it, in a discrete form in documents of an agency, it can be called for and be produced as a computer printout. That will be the accepted form for the information being made available. The legislation is very modern. It recognises what is happening in the 20th century. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this legislation the ultimate decision must be made by the Minister or an officer directly responsible to him, especially in relation to exempt documents, defined in the Bill as, among other things: Documents affecting national security, defence, international relations and relations with States; Cabinet documents; Executive Council documents; and documents affecting the enforcement of the law and the protection of public safety. I am sure that the House will agree that one does not want the Australian Federal Police to have to make all its records available to people who require them; for instance, to criminals who may want to know what is going on. I agree with this legislation. I consider it represents a major step forward in removing unnecessary secrecy from the administrative process of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Freedom of Information Bill is, in our view, an excellent example of the Government's giving lip service to small 'l' liberal principles but in fact doing whatever it can to limit the genuine implementation of those principles. Indeed, it proves once again that this Government is conservative rather than liberal in any sense. It is in fact a closed government , jealously guarding its privileges, rather than an open government. I shall endeavour to demonstrate that point in speaking on this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I shall make some remarks about the need for freedom of information legislation and about the principles of liberalism, on which such Bills are based. The father of liberalism, John Stuart Mill, expressed the importance of information being available to the people from governments as a central feature in an open society. He pointed out in his writings on liberty that the possibility of rational discourse on government policies, on decisions by governments, is the most important feature of an open society and a society that prides itself on matters of liberty. He pointed out that the state can be oppressive and can oppress by withholding information from its citizens. That situation is indeed a situation we have encroached upon in the developments of the 20th century. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that we in the modern state, in the moderm government, have masses of government information that is not available to the people. One reason why it is not available to the people is that people are bewildered by that mass of information, that mass of activity. I shall give some facts that illustrate that . In 1901, at the time of the first Australian Government, there were four million people and they had a Budget of #4m. The House of Representatives sat for 113 days and discussed a variety of matters. It could be argued that at that time a normal citizen could have some idea of what was going on in government and in government departments. Indeed, at that time the biggest government department was that of the general post office, would you believe? I ask honourable members to contrast that situation with the situation which existed in 1980-81, when there were 14 million people with a Budget of $40,000m. After allowing a factor of 18:1 for inflation, the growth of government, government departments and government spending was of the order of 71:1. We have had a massive increase in government departments. We have had a massive increase in activities. Those activities are determining the lives of citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> John Stuart Mill, in postulating the principles of liberal democratic government-I point out to honourable members opposite that we are talking about liberal democratic principles-insisted upon the importance of such information being accessible to the people. Given that enormous increase in available data, so to speak, how can any citizen be expected to come to grips with the totality of the situation? Of course, he cannot. That gives rise to opportunities for the Public Service, for the Government, to hide an enormous number of things from its citizens and, in fact, to claim that information citizens want to get because it affects their lives in certain ways is lost in computers or in one government department or another. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in a very substantial way most modern governments govern what information is made available and what is not. In other words, we have a situation in which the ordinary citizen makes his decision about the effectiveness of government, about the extent to which government decisions represent his will, on the basis of information that is released in a controlled way by government. It can be claimed, in fact, that what the citizen gains is basically propaganda rather than information. We do not have to look far to find examples of that. We need only look at political advertisements and at surveys of the political knowledge of our people, undertaken by political scientists, to recognise that we face a serious situation in that people are ignorant about matters they should know more about because only certain types of information have been made available to them and have been pushed through the media channels . </PARA>
<PARA> To have the most liberal, the most open system of information is to strengthen a democracy. It is in fact to create a situation in which genuine participatory processes can operate. That is not happening in Australia. We know about the cynics who say that Australians are a bunch of apathetic no-hopers who take no interest in politics and in the operations of government. I do not for a moment accept that proposition. What I say is that part of the blame, a lot of the blame, lies with government and its insistence on secrecy in a large number of its dealings. That means that we have to think about opening up that system. </PARA>
<PARA> When this legislation was introduced in the Senate the Opposition proposed a substanial number of amendments, designed to do exactly that, to open up the system. What was to be lost by the Liberals adopting those amendments? Do they suppose that they will be in government perpetually or that if we come to government we will not have to operate under the same rules? Of course we would have to. Therefore, they should have recognised that in the long term it is in their interest to make government as open as possible and to make information as openly available as it possibly can be. But, as I said, lamentably that is not what has happened. Most of our amendments were not accepted by the Senate and we now face a situation in which we have to move those amendments again in the House of Representatives. I appeal to honourable members opposite who pride themselves in having some respect for genuine liberal principles to look at this legislation once again, to look at the amendments once again and to accept that by refusing to support those amendments all that they will be doing will be strengthening the hands of the Executive against the Parliament and against the people as a whole. They should consider supporting the Opposition and adopting those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, freedom of information legislation is necessary to ensure the proper functioning of a democratic system. The people should be given much greater access to the Public Service, especially to those decisions which directly affect their lives. The people must be able to query the suppositions on which government decisions are made and the manner in which those decisions are implemented. We have a Public Service which, notwithstanding the Government' s attempts to run it down and discredit it in various ways, generally performs well. However, there is room for improvement and a need for a more rapid process of learning from past errors. My experience on the Public Accounts Committee has shown me the extent to which senior public servants in particular are prepared to go to great lengths to prevent the Parliament, never mind the ordinary citizen, knowing too much about certain activities. Some senior public servants seem to be of the view that the work they do and the decision processes in which they are involved are the property of the Government and not of the people. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they think the Parliament is irrelevant in certain ways. This attitude must be changed if we are to have a worthwhile democratic system. The Executive not only has too much power within the process but also seems to have a monopoly on information. It has created this attitude in public servants so that even what might appear to be perfectly harmless material is not available to ordinary citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is along those lines that I wish to point out the exemptions contained in this legislation. Some bodies need not release a single piece of information to citizens; they will do so only if they or the Government cares to make it available. Among the bodies which are totally exempt are the Australian National Railways Commission, the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation, Aboriginal land councils and land trusts, the Canberra Commercial Development Authority, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and the Pipeline Authority. For God's sake, what is there about these bodies which makes them so mysterious, so strange, that the Government has to exempt totally from this legislation all information in relation to those bodies? Is it a conspiracy between the Executive and certain senior public servants to cover up mistakes and inefficiencies? If it is not, why has the Government made all these organisations exempt? Further organisations are exempt in respect of particular documents. For example, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to be exempt in relation to its program material. In other words, if a program appears on the ABC and I want to know something about it, as a citizen who is paying for the ABC, for some strange reason that information is to be exempt under the freedom of information legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> These points illustrate the central difficulty that the Opposition has in supporting the Government on this legislation. We demand that the Government reconsider our carefully thought out amendments so we can say that in a bipartisan way we have given the people of Australia a Freedom of Information Bill that is really worth its salt. I wish to mention a couple of other objections to the legislation before the House. These objections were put most concisely by Senator Evans last year in another place. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, despite the very extensive and elaborate character of the report of the Senate Committee, to which I have referred, the Bill simply does not adopt more than a relative handful of the recommendations of that Committee. Those who presented it have not done the Parliament and the nation the courtesy of giving a fully argued, careful response to all the very detailed provisions and arguments in that report which have been rejected. The other ground for disappointment, to summarise it, is this: Not only is the new Bill not a really significant advance on its 1978 predecessor, despite the hopes which many of us had that the Committee's recommendations would be picked up in this way, but in fact it goes backwards in a number of significant respects, with a whole series of new exceptions and exemptions and procedural obstacles contained in it which were not contemplated, and certainly not contained, in the original version. </PARA>
<PARA>So, not only do we have all these exemptions but also we have a series of procedures designed to frustrate the process, to make it difficult even for those people who want to operate under the legislation to get information. Let us suppose someone requests certain detailed information. It is possible that a government department that does not want to give out this information will say to this person, 'We are sorry but you have to specify exactly the date, time and situation relating to that information. We would love to help you, we really are great democrats and people who believe in open government, but unfortunately we cannot quite find the piece of paper to which you have referred'. In that situation the citizen is left up in the air, without any redress. So it is necessary that we provide checks on a government department's refusal to provide information and do not put obstacles in the way of the availability of information. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe this should have been a matter on which we had total bipartisan support but it has turned out to be a matter on which there is substantial disagreement. It is to the great discredit of the people who mislead the nation by calling themselves members of a liberal party but which is in fact a conservative and closed government party that they have not accepted the sensible amendments which we have put forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An essential feature of the Freedom of Information Bill is that it is an experiment. It will almost certainly be amended in the not too distant future, after a year to three years of testing, as the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) said in another place. On that basis it deserves the support of the House. As almost everyone who has spoken in this debate has agreed, the Bill is an attempt to strike a balance between openness and confidentiality; between public access to government records and the preservation of necessary confidentiality. A particular balance has been struck. Some want more openness, based on the model of the United States Freedom of Information Act, and others want less; but a system has been launched. We can see how it works and make changes as we go along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since most of the Opposition critics of the balance struck in this Bill have held up the American system as a model it seems useful to draw attention to some of the very serious criticisms that have been made in the United States of the American system. The Bill before us can and should be seen as an attempt to establish freedom of information arrangements that deliberately avoid in particular the six defects that have emerged in discussions of the American law. In comparison with the American law the Bill before the House attempts, firstly, to reduce administrative costs; secondly, to reduce retrospectivity; thirdly, to reduce litigation; fourthly, to tighten the exemption of criminal intelligence; fifthly, to use ministerial certificates to exempt disclosures where necessary of national security and defence information; and, sixthly, to schedule a number of agencies which are in whole or in part exempt from the operation of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> In all those six ways it departs from the American model. I would say that in all those six ways it attempts to improve on the American model or to get away from serious defects that have emerged in the American model. These variations on the American system may tend to strike the balance between openness and confidentiality too much in favour of confidentiality. I am inclined to think that they do and will, in due course, require amendment. But each one of them is based on an awareness of criticisms or defects in the American practice. The Bill, in short, attempts to avoid the mistakes of the Americans. Let me refer to some that are taken to be mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> The American freedom of information law of 1966 was radically amended in 1974 to maximise, speed up and cheapen disclosures of government information. This amended 1974 law has certainly worked-no one would deny that-but at a price. Let us look at administrative costs. I know that costs are only one consideration in the whole mix and there are some who would argue that the public's right to know must prevail over questions of costs or departmental efficiency. Nevertheless, one ought to be clear about what is or may be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States House Committee of Government Operations was reported in 1976 -a little after the law was amended-as estimating that the administration of the amended 1974 law would cost no more than $100,000 a year. In fact, in 1977-a year after that estimate-according to the congressional research services' annual overview, costs were approximately, not $100,000 but $36m. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in that year estimated its costs as $10m; defence was $5 .5m; health, education and welfare costs were $5.2m; and Treasury costs were $5. 2m. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, dollar costs are not the only measure of criticism. Processing of freedom of information applications usually requires qualified analysts who are consequently diverted from their primary duties. The United States Senate Judiciary Committee reported in 1978 that the Drug Enforcement Administration then had a freedom of information division processing applications larger than any of its six internal security field offices combating the drug trade. It had to put more manpower into freedom of information than into combating the drug trade in particular fields. </PARA>
<PARA> The Central Intelligence Agency complained that it had had to expend four man- years meeting the freedom of information request of a writer who was dedicated to exposing the identities of overseas CIA employees whose lives were subsequently put at risk and at least one of whom was murdered. So the dollar cost of administration and the diversion of departmental resources are considerations that cannot be just brushed aside. The limits on retrospectivity and litigation and the exemptions in the Bill before us ensure that these American excesses are avoided. It may be that this Bill goes too far in avoiding those excesses but it seems to me to be a reasonable basis on which to start. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Bill's treatment of business information. Every private enterprise of any consequence is portrayed in government records. Government, in its dealings with business is, at various times, licenser, regulator, taxer insurer, investigator, auditor, inspector, subsidiser, customer, seller, lender, landlord and tenant. It inevitably collects something approaching complete information about most businesses. The complaint in the United States for many years was that much of this information became available to business competitors under the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>
<PARA> At the hearings of the House Committee on Government Operations of the ninety- fifth Congress, the deputy-general counsel of the Environmental Protection Agency stated that the greatest use of Environmental Protection Agency records had been by business corporations and their law firms seeking information about competitors. The Food and Drug Administration's testimony was that in 1975 it received 20,000 Freedom of Information Act requests, 86 per cent of which came from industries and private attorneys seeking confidential information about competitors. It also said that it received 25,000 requests in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies such as Freedom of Information Services Inc. of Rockville, Maryland, specialise in handling Freedom of Information Act requests on behalf of corporations. For the price of a postage stamp, under the 1974 United States law , anyone could obtain confidential information about someone else's business. The vice-president of the Dow chemical company quoted a case in which his company had been negotiating the sale of technology to a foreign company. The negotiations abruptly ended when the foreign company obtained the technology under the Freedom of Information Act. Other businesses claimed at the hearings that the release of information relating to equal employment opportunity programs and affirmative action plans allowed knowledgeable competitors to deduce labour costs, sales volume, plans for expansion, profit margin, vulnerability to price changes and new products. Indeed, they could obtain all the confidential information about a competitor that they needed to know in order to compete more than successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> After much litigation in the United States the District of Colombia Court of Appeals in the famous case National Parks and Conservation Association v. Morton adopted the 'substantial competitive harm' test for exemption from disclosure. Commercial and financial information may be withheld under this exemption if disclosure is likely to, firstly, impair the government's ability to obtain necessary information or, secondly, cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained. After examining the American practice I see that the Bill before us, in clause 43, adopts almost the very words of the National Parks case. This seems to me to be typical of this Bill's attempt to learn from American errors and not simply adopt the 1974 US law while ignoring the criticisms that have emerged since 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> The same can be said about clause 37 of this Bill dealing with records concerning the investigation of crime. The 1974 US amendment limits exemption from disclosure to records of active police investigations if disclosure would put the lives of police or informants at risk or undermine enforcement proceedings or a fair trial. But it also requires the disclosure of associated or segregable portions of otherwise exempt records. The result is that by obtaining various non-exempt segregable portions requesters, in particular criminals, can put two and two together, identify police sources and take appropriate criminal action against them. </PARA>
<PARA> One in six requesters for FBI documents under the freedom of Information Act in America is the inmate of a prison and two in five requesters for information from the Drug Enforcement Administration are inmates of prison, all seeking to piece together information about the police's sources of information concerning them. The result is that the FBI complains that State, local and foreign law- enforcement agencies, let alone private citizens, have become increasingly reluctant to co-operate with the FBI through the fear of the facts involved in their co-operation being disclosed. One may argue that the FBI is being self- serving in this line of criticism but one has to give its complaint due weight. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 37 of the Bill before us has done this and has given this complaint due weight. It not only exempts documents which would prejudice a fair trial or put lives at risk but also-to overcome the risks in the American practice of disclosing associated information in segregable portions-exempts the documents which could reasonably be expected to do so. Clause 45 also exempts documents, the disclosure of which would be a breach of confidence. This, it seems to me, is another example of learning from American experience and tightening exemptions in relation to police investigations of crime. </PARA>
<PARA> To give one last example, one should consider the criticisms made by the US defence and security organisations of their 1974 law and compare that law with clause 33 of the Bill before us, Parts VI and VII and the Schedules. Spokesmen for the CIA and the National Security Council have repeatedly attacked the 1974 law in terms similar to those made by spokesmen for the FBI and, in particular, the role of the courts in requiring these government agencies to diclose publicly in court documents they claim to be exempt so that the courts may assess the claim-in other words, defeating the claim to exemption whilst purporting to judge it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was comparing the Freedom of Information Bill before this House with its model, the United States Freedom of Information Act, as amended in 1974. I was making the point that this Bill, while following the model in its essential details, departed from the American model in the light of the criticisms that have been made of the American 1974 law and the defects in it that had emerged in the years since. I was just referring to the criticisms of the American law by the United States defence and security organisations. I would continue to make the point that the Bill before us meets those criticisms by exempting the relevant security and defence documents on the basis of a ministerial certificate; that it exempts security agencies in the schedules and, while providing for a document review tribunal, limits its powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These provisions are also attempts to avoid the American abuse of that country' s Freedom of Information Act. They may well go too far. I think that they may do so. But we have the Attorney-General's assurance in another place that after a period of between one year and three years these measures will be reviewed and possibly amended. I am sure that they will be amended. But at least it can be said that they achieve the object of providing freedom of information while avoiding the defects in the American arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum up, the Bill before us sets out to strike the balance between openness and confidentiality that avoids the mistakes made in America-mistakes in particular in relation to costs, diversion of departmental resources, and the disclosure of business, police, defence and security information. It is fair to say that on those grounds the American model for this measure has been very trenchantly criticised. This Bill meets those criticisms. If the Americans struck a balance too much in favour of disclosure, it may be that this Bill strikes a balance too much in favour of confidentiality. We shall see. </PARA>
<PARA> When it becomes law, this legislation will obviously be constantly monitored and I believe that there will be amendments to encourage greater openness while still avoiding the American excesses. I hope I have shown that the Opposition's uncritical reliance-one might even call it hypocritical reliance-on the American model is naive and ingenuous. The American law is, indeed, a model-a great one, but one that also has serious defects. The bill before us is, in any case, an historic first step that deserves support and fair trial as a very progressive experiment. </PARA>
<PARA> We could take the Opposition's criticisms more seriously if it were also using its influence in the State Labor parties to introduce State freedom of information laws. The New South Wales Labor Government for example, will not look at a State freedom of information Act. The Liberal Government of Victoria has such a Bill before its Parliament-and an excellent Bill it is. I need not mention the provinces of Canada, particularly Ontario-even Canada itself. But the New South Wales Labor Government will not look at what all advanced communities have under review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), attacked the Bill before us with great passion, but one wishes that he would persuade the New South Wales Government to take some action . It has, after all, Professor Wilenski's draft of a freedom of information Bill , but ignores it. The New South Wales Labor Government could take the Bill before us as a model and improve on it if it could. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be of great value, and a great public service, to have freedom of information access to the records of the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, to see how that Commission and the State Government have bungled electricity production in that State. We know why. We know it is because of the 35-hour working week that the State Government introduced in the electricity industry. We know that it is because the Government has gone behind the back of management to make sweetheart deals directly with the union, despite management policy, and we know it is because the Labor Government of New South Wales has raided and used up the cash reserves of the Electricity Commission so that it is unable to finance maintenance, which has fallen off over the past two or three years and has led to the crisis that New South Wales is now facing. </PARA>
<PARA> We know this, but it would be of great help and in the public interest to have the citizen's right of access to the records. However, the Labor Government of New South Wales would not dream of giving the citizen access to these records. He would then have documented evidence of the mismanagement and bungling of electricity production in New South Wales by the Labor Government of that State.</PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government has introduced, and has before the Parliament, the sort of legislation that will allow the Victorian people to have access to such records, but the New South Wales Government will not contemplate that, for obvious reasons, because the sort of legislation that we have before us now, that the Victorian Government has introduced and that the Liberal Party of New South Wales is committed to introducing when returned to government there, would expose the humbug and sham of the most secretive government in Australia- possibly the most secretive in Australia's history-the Labor Government of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be a wonderful thing in New South Wales to have access not just to information about the Electricity Commission but also to the records of the Department of Main Roads in order to see how the labor Government of New South Wales has bungled the freeway policy in New South Wales and the traffic situation there. It would be a wonderful thing to have access to the Education Department's records to see how it has bungled education policy in New South Wales. I need not mention the records of the Department of Corrective Services, from which we could see the bungling of the prison system of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Would it not be of great help to have access to the Premier's Department's records in New South Wales? That would really be a horrifying, but salutary, measure. Would it not, again, be of great help to have access to the records of the Health Department, to see the bungling in relation to hospitals in New South Wales, or access to the records of the Department of Industrial Relations to examine its dealings with the unions in New South Wales which have led, through its appeasement, to the strikes and the dissolution of civil life that we see in the State?</PARA>
<PARA> Would it not be of great value to have access to the records of the Department of Industrial Development in order to examine the smelter policy in Hunter Valley which, because of the crude location of smelters, will destroy the great and historic wine industry in New South Wales?</PARA>
<PARA> Those are the sort of things that a Freedom of Information Act in New South Wales would give to the people of that State, but these phoneys on the other side of the chamber, while asking for a better freedom of information Act than the legislation before the House now, are doing absolutely nothing to urge the New South Wales Government to introduce such legislation. Indeed, the New South Wales Government has gone even further and has introduced the notorious Evidence Act to prevent the disclosure in the courts of government information which has been available for years, despite the historic Sankey v. Whitlam case of 1979, and despite the condemnation of the Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, including the condemnation of the Labor Shadow Attorney-General of the Government of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Labor Party is serious in its criticism, it could do something about its own government in the benighted State of New South Wales. The Labor Party's criticism of this measure can only be described, once again, as always, as hypocritical and fraudulent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is unfortunate, on an occasion when we are discussing a Bill of some importance and about which there is a measure of agreement, that the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) chooses to demean both himself and the debate by alleging that the standards by which we judge the merits or demerits of this legislation are to be determined by the actions of a government in another State of a political complexion that is different from his. I say to the honourable gentleman that if he looks at the history of State governments and State bureaucracies, he will find that they are all very much like the Commonwealth institutions and its bureaucracies; they are all very much products of their own history and tradition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having spent many years in the Parliament of Victoria, I believe in one of the simple systems that came down from the Westminster system-that any member in the Parliament had a right to ask for a government file. The tradition of that Parliament, which was honoured when I was there, was that, unless there was some compelling reason for security, or if perhaps some sensitive negotiations pertained to the file, the file was made available. It was laid on the table of the library and made available to all honourable members. That is one of the better traditions of the Victorian Parliament. It has been honoured by governments of all political colours. If other State parliaments are not as good , that can quite properly be the subject of comment in terms of their tradition and practice. I believe that the Victorian system has much to commend it, for this very simple reason. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final analysis, in contemporary society, given the growth of government and the responsibilities that fall upon parliamentary institutions and individual members of Parliament, why should not a member of Parliament on behalf of one of his citizens, if that citizen believes he is being affected by a decision made within the bureaucracy, have access to the files which in many ways affect the rights and liberties of that citizen? It is not just true about this Government; it is part of the tradition and the way in which the Commonwealth Parliament has evolved. The real struggle against this legislation has not been merely within sections of the Government parties; the real struggle has been waged by one of the most centralised bureaucracies that exists anywhere in the Western democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA> As a new boy to this place I had the experience of asking for a file in respect of a government factory which was being closed down in my electorate. The Minister at the time, who was also a Victorian but a new Minister, was perfectly happy to make the file available. I came to Canberra for the purpose of going through the file because, as the local member, I believed it was important for me to know the basis upon which the Government had made a decision which could affect the livelihoods of some 150 people. The Minister was perfectly co- operative, but when I arrived here I was told that I could not see the file because the relevant public servant, the man who handled it and had his fingerprints on it, was not available to come with the file. I said: 'I did not come here to see the public servant; I came to see the file.' After a number of exchanges, and a telephone conversation with the Minister in which I reminded him of his undertaking, the Minister insisted upon the file being made available . It was brought over by two very senior public servants who were thoroughly embarrassed. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that nonsense went on for something like four or five hours was not because of any opposition from the Minister, who acted throughout this time in a thoroughly principled manner; it was because the permanent head of his Department felt a complete sense of outrage that a Minister would dare to make a file available to a member of Parliament without the knowledge of the permanent head, and also because the permanent head was not too happy about some of the contents in the file. That is the essence of the struggle being waged in this Parliament; it is the essence, I think, of some of the problems in the whole relationship between this Parliament, its members and the bureaucracy. Quite frankly, before we got to the stage of this legislation, I would have preferred to see how this Parliament would have gone as a parliamentary institution had we adopted the very simple principle which operated for years in the Victorian State Parliament, and which was honoured by Ministers and members alike-while I was in that institution it was not, to my knowledge, the subject of any abuse- whereby a member as of right asked for a file to be laid on the table of the library and, unless there was some security reason or sensitivity in terms or perhaps current commercial negotiations for it not to be made available, it was made available. </PARA>
<PARA> That system established the proper relationship between the member and the Minister, but, more importantly, it established the proper relationship between the member and the bureaucracy. In the final analysis, although a bureaucrat may have been unhappy with the system, he understood both the role of the parliamentarian and the parliamentarian's role in the scheme of our governmental processes. What I believe is destroying any concept of effective federalism in Australia today is the fact that, because Australian society is growing larger, government at every level is growing larger. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) may say he wants to cut back, but the reality is that, at both State and Commonwealth government levels, the bureaucracy is growing. Therefore, as a parliamentary institution, we need continually to ask ourselves how the Parliament operates, in order to establish a proper relationship between members , the Executives and the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, it is one of my profound regrets that, in terms of Commonwealth institutions and Commonwealth bureaucracy, the rights of the average member in the Federal Parliament have been continuously eroded and demeaned. There would not be a permanent head who would not fall over at the mere thought of having to produce a file. Every day we deal with transactions, some of which affect businessmen and some of which affect individual citizens. In the final analysis, the bureaucracy does not believe that it ought to be subjected to that kind of simple exposure which, if all is in order, ought to be part of the due process of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Government decisions can be made which affect our rights as citizens. A decision may be made about a pension entitlement or it may be that some Government department has decided to build a road through someone's front room. It may be that some Government department wants to have access to someone's property for public purposes. Why in such situations is not an individual and his member of Parliament entitled as of right to have available to them all the documents so that the basis upon which a decision has been made can be fully examined? We are not running some kind of secret society. The concept of government in our democracy is a concept by which we see governmnt as an instrument that serves the people. Therefore, we must strive continuously to create within the framework of our political institutions a degree of responsibility that gives to the member of the Parliament and to our citizens inalienable rights both against the process of government and the functions of the Executive but, more importantly, against the bureaucracy which, by its very growth patterns must, by its very nature, be making decisions which affect citizens in all sorts of ways in the normal operations of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> What is disappointing to me and to my Party about this Bill is that there comes a time when one says: Is this a good Bill or a bad Bill? What is the basis for comparison? What is the standard by which we judge it? With respect to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) it is not, in my view, a proper procedure to compare it with an American or a British system. Given the way in which the Commonwealth has evolved, in a sense we have to act in terms of our own principles and our own guidelines. The standard of and the judgment about this Bill have to be determined by the work that was done by what I believe is one of the most competent of standing committees which examined it. I am talking about the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which, in its 1979 report on freedom of information, established what it believed were the essential ingredients and the proper boundaries and principles upon which a Freedom of Information Bill ought to be founded. That is the starting point. </PARA>
<PARA> Does any member on this side of the House say that the Committee perhaps was a little too radical? Its composition was like any other Senate standing committee ; it represented the balance of the Senate. It has been my experience that when a group of experienced parliamentarians come together on an issue such as this they tend to make fairly balanced recommendations. Paragraph 3.7 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The essence of democratic government lies in the ability of people to make choices: about who shall govern; or about which policies they support or reject. Such choices cannot be properly made unless adequate information is available. It cannot be accepted that it is the government itself which should determine what level of information is to be regarded as adequate. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sentiment that I believe this Parliament can readily endorse and enshrine. One can express only disappointment when comparing the recommendations of the Senate Committee with the legislation that is now before us. When one looks at the heads which are involved in this Bill, one can only reach the conclusion that, whilst the Government has taken some steps and has established some framework and procedures, it has not been prepared to accept the spirit or the terms of the recommendations of the Senate inquiry report. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important if we as community and as a parliamentary institution are to make decisions about the future of this nation that we should do so on the basis of being properly and effectively informed. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know from your experience sitting in the chair, there is no member in any part of this House who does not have a political philosophy and does not hold his views somewhat strongly. We saw some examples of that this morning. The very strength by which views and prejudices are held make it very important, if we are to make the right decisions, to do so on the basis of all the information being available. The tragic fact is that in so many areas information is not merely not made available but it has to be gouged out of the bureaucratic process. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the House two simple examples with which I am personally involved. As a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I am interested in the defence structure of this community. We have just produced a report which states that the real threat to Australia is the problem of involvement in nuclear war. We reached conclusions about the presence of joint American bases within Australia. The reality is that no effective information is contained within this Parliament as to the nature or the operation of those bases upon which an informed and rational debate can take place. Any member of this Parliament who wanted to inform himself about the nature and the structure of those important facilities could get more information out of the American congressional records than from his own government. That is the reality; we accept it. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to an important book produced by Dr Ball. Honourable members might agree or disagree with the conclusions; it does not matter. The significant contribution of Dr Ball was that at least he produced, in concise form, the only real information which is available to any member of this Parliament. How can we have informed debate if that is to be the level of information? No department in my view has excessively used and abused the concept of security for the purpose of seeing that this parliament is not properly informed than the Department of Defence. I cite my own experience with, and involvement on behalf of, young Vietnam veterans who had been affected by exposure to defoliants in Vietnam. At every point the information needed from the Department of Veterans' Affairs has taken two years to be supplied. Question after question has been asked. Most of the answers have been more significant for what they fail to admit and for their attempts to avoid providing evidence. We are dealing with individual rights. I have set out the history and the tradition that has developed within the bureaucratic structures that are related to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I for one believe that, if this Parliament is ever to play an effective role so that once again it becomes an institution where real debate takes place and where individual members have a capacity to protect the rights of one individual citizen and to argue his cause in a way which compels the attention of not merely the Ministry but also the bureaucracy, we must take our role seriously and ensure that we have the best information available. It is time that this Parliament was sufficiently mature to deal with whatever political crisis it has to deal with on the basis of information being freely available and not on the basis of documents falling off the backs of trucks. In my opinion that has been the basis upon which this parliament has operated for far too long. That is the nature of the process. It is time we all agreed that we have to so structure ourselves that we do not need the secret document and can dispense with the leak . As an institution we are capable of solving the great issues that face this nation if we have the best information available. </PARA>
<PARA> My regret about this legislation is that the unique opportunity given to move this institution forward was not accepted. Any honourable member who views the legislation honestly can feel nothing but disappointment when he compares it with the details of the Senate Select Committee report. We need, therefore, to try again and to do better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Freedom of Information Bill which is one of the more unusual proposals put before this Parliament. It marks a substantial departure from the practice of some centuries of Westminster tradition in legislation. It is therefore a measure that needs to be introduced with some caution. There has been much debate on it. There has been a very good inquiry by a Senate committee. There is some argument whether more of the recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs should have been adopted by the Government. I think that members of my own party have made quite substantial speeches and put forward powerful arguments to say that the Government perhaps should have gone further than it has in accepting amendments. Nonetheless, the Government has accepted a number of amendments to the legislation. It is a better Bill than the one that was first laid on the table. It has been the subject of considerable analysis by members of both Houses and it is also, of course, subject to review, according to the Government, after about three years of its being in force. The Government has also undertaken to review after 12 months operation the question whether additional access might be given to documents already in existence at the time the legislation came into force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So I think the House should consider the legislation as a Bill that treads into new areas in our system. With reasonable goodwill we can all watch closely what its effects are. I have certain concerns about how far it goes. It marks an important departure from previous practice and will give great opportunity to those who take a genuine interest in the workings of our democracy to examine, perhaps in more detail, how that democracy works, to suggest improvements in the way the democracy works and to suggest improvements in the way this legislation gives us access to the workings of the democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a real question as to how far we should go in the first instance in using essentially an American idea within the Westminster system. The Americans have tended to pioneer this kind of legislation. They have done it with that peculiar ferocity of which we know they are capable. The American republic, which is a great democracy, is given to extremes of enthusiasm on occasions and the Americans often take a lot of working out. We have had the opportunity of observing what they do. As my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) has pointed out, there are various ways in which we have been able to learn from their experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, I would say that we have been able to learn from the experience of the Westminster system that we have inherited. I would say that for this day and age the old Westminster system is totally unsatisfactory in its capacity to provide adequate information for the sensible discussion of public issues. It is certainly true that the Westminster system, with Cabinet responsibility and a great deal of secrecy attached to the workings of Cabinet and of Government, has provided a barrier against destructive interference with those processes. But it has also, in a very complicated modern world, led to an obstruction of serious analysis. I am afraid that in some of the derivative parliaments of Westminster it has led to even greater obstruction than perhaps was intended or is practised in the Mother of Parliaments. There is a certain measure of civilisation in the discussion of issues in Westminster which is not always followed in the derivative parliaments, particularly perhaps when one goes into the derivative State parliaments. I will have something to say a little later about an area where enlightenment ought to have occurred but seems not to have done so. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to issues in respect of which it would be better to have a more informed discussion. I have been involved in a number of these areas. I think we can all sympathise with the experience recounted earlier this evening by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) when he was given access, he thought, to documents by a Minister who considered that as the documents related to the honourable member's electorate it was sensible that the honourable member should be allowed to look at them. He considered there was nothing terribly secret about them. But the decision of the Minister was not taken very kindly by the departmental head concerned and there was a clamp-down on information which was overcome only by reference back to the Minister's instruction. That is a fairly common procedure. Ministers fresh from the back benches where they suffered the frustrating experience of finding it difficult to get information would have some sympathy for back bench attempts to break down some of this departmental exclusion. In most cases it is exercised in good faith by people who believe they are guardians of something that is purer than democracy itself. That is very hard to combat because there is almost a theological basis for this belief and it is very hard to break down. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems in defining the access that one can give to public documents . There is the problem, for example, that access itself affects the nature of the information available. Of course, there is a good side to that in that if one insists that documents prepared by public servants are going to be made available the people who are preparing them and who are working through the problems that will subsequently by publicised will be that much more careful about being straightforward in their dealings and being totally honest in their analysis. That certainly is the good side of this kind of legislation and it is the one that its proponents are always arguing in favour of. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, there are some bad consequences of this promised access. One is that people can be more timid in action if they are in the process of making decisions which are documented and that documentation will be available to the public. Timidity is not always a good attribute when one is examining difficult issues. Indeed, the kinds of issues we face in today's world as they become more and more complicated often require more daring action than is contemplated by entrepreneurs in the private sector and that kind of action is not such that, when documented, it will always look good in public scrutiny afterwards. So that is a difficulty. The legislation probably will breed timidity if in fact all the important actions are recorded. That leads to the second problem; that is, that the promise of access to everybody after the event might lead to a certain deviousness in recording, that the box that one opens in the hope of having exposed to one all the innermost thoughts of those who decided various things or examined various things may not contain anything of any value whatsoever and that most of the transactions and thoughts that went on were left out for the very reason that people engaging in those activities did not welcome subsequent scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> So there is a bit of a problem in that the kind of thing we are really looking to find out may in fact cease to exist in any real form in a number of instances once we enact the legislation. I ask people not to dismiss that as frivolous; I think it is quite a natural thing. I can think of very many cases both in the ordinary course of day-to-day administration and in dealing with quite difficult problems, some of them very personal and some of them very sensitive, where people would rather act and not record or where people might record something which they thought was more palatable to posterity. This is something which is well known, of course, in respect of memoirs that are written by politicians. Politicians have the advantage of writing these things well after the event with a very firm eye on posterity and their own reputations. What is written, of course, is very much for the public eye and has to be regarded very much with scepticism when compared with the writings of others which are perhaps equally subject to scepticism. So there is a bit of a problem. It is analogous in my mind to registers of public interest by politicians or public officials whereby such people are legally required to register their public interests. There is absolutely no doubt that such a register would disclose to the world at large the interests of those who are honest. But there is no guarantee that the interests of those who are dishonest would be disclosed to the world at large. The Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) has said on a number of occasions that one cannot legislate for honour; that honour is either there in the first place or it is not. A register of public interests is something that makes a lot of people feel happy but if one delves beyond the surface of it one really wonders whether it is anything other than a protection for those who are dishonest. </PARA>

I have no particular problem about such arrangement except in relation to spouses and so on and the honourable member would know about all of those problems. But it nonetheless has certain difficulties in that it can provide a veneer of respectability for crooks and that is the main worry I have with it. Whether that is a greater harm than not having one is a matter that the honourable member for Batman and I could discuss at some stage at greater length.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On balance I think this legislation is a sensible start and since I have a very great interest in the more civilized and sensible discussion of critical issues that affect the future of this Commonwealth I certainly welcome the opportunity to look at more information from the public sector than I currently have available to me as a back bencher. In general I am very much in favour of this first relatively tentative step. I do not carp at the various exclusions, although I could, as did the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) who made some remarks on this earlier. I would tend to agree with him because it is pretty hard to understand why in the Schedules certain exempt agencies appear in Part I and others appear in Part II. For example, the Australian Egg Board is exempt in relation to documents in respect of its competitive commercial activities yet the Australian Shipping Commission is an exempt agency in toto. I find it a little difficult to understand why, for example, one agency is exempt in one part and not the other. These are relatively minor criticisms. </PARA>
<PARA> The actual boundary of the legislation, that is, how much of the recommendations of the Senate Committee have been accepted or not, is a matter which can be determined over the course of two or three years of re-examination. When one looks at how important this kind of legislation is in the history of the Commonwealth one sees that these are relatively carping criticisms. Consequently I will not shed blood in re-examining the Government's acceptance of amendments or otherwise. I am quite happy to accept what has been accepted, to get on with it and to see how it works. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another area in which I think we have to be careful. There are exclusions based on quite important considerations. I do not think anybody at first sight would disagree with these. The exclusions, that is the exempt documents, include documents affecting national security, defence, international relations and relations with the States. The definitions are in the Bill. The exclusions also include Cabinet documents; Executive Council documents; internal working documents; documents affecting enforcement of the law and the protection of public safety; documents to which secrecy provisions of enactments apply-that is in respect of certain legislation-documents affecting financial or property interests of the Commonwealth; documents concerning certain operations of agencies-I have referred to those which appear in the Schedule-documents affecting personal privacy; documents affecting legal proceedings or subject to legal professional privilege; documents relating to business affairs and so on; documents affecting the national economy; documents containing material obtained in confidence; documents the disclosure of which would be contempt of parliament or contempt of court; and certain documents arising out of companies and securities legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is quite a long list of documents to be excluded for reasons which, if one looks at them, one will see are fairly sound. But there is of course the question of classification of such documents. Again one should look into the future. We are talking about the classification of documents that will exist in the future, and the legislation does not apply retrospectively for the moment although it may do when we re-examine it in 12 months time. There is a danger that documents can be written in such a way that they let intrude matters which may not be directly relevant but which might bring them into one of these excluded or exempt categories. I think that is a problem. There is provision for appeal and having a look at this. This is important and perhaps this area could be strengthened. It is terribly important that people within the Public Service or even Ministers directing people within the Public Service are not in a position to include in documents matters which bring them within exempt categories. For example, if we are talking about matters affecting relationships between the Commonwealth and the States it is not beyond the wit of almost anybody to include in a document something which might affect the relationships between the Commonwealth and the States and for that to be argued. I think that is something we have to watch. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes when one raises this kind of question people say: 'Are you questioning the integrity of Ministers or of public servants?' All I know is that in view of the pace of modern administration, the volume of matters that come before Ministers, the tiny length of time that Ministers have to reflect on anything-given the incredible pace at which they have to work-the extraordinary number of things they have to do and also the absurd restrictions on their activities which are brought about by the ridiculous Standing Orders of this House, I think it is well to be careful of the kinds of pressures that can be put on Ministers or things which can be slipped past Ministers which might bring documents into an exempt category unwittingly on the part of a Minister, perhaps wittingly on the part of those who put it before the Minister or the other way around. One always has to legislate for an unsatisfactory case. To legislate always for the best cases and the most honourable motives or the most leisurely consideration of things is to make an error. One should legislate knowing that there are tremendous pressures on these people and therefore they should be protected by legislation just as much as the public ought to be protected in terms of this access to information. </PARA>
<PARA> All that having been said I ask the Opposition to treat with some gentleness the matter of amendments and the boundary between what parts of the Senate Committee's recommendations have been accepted and what have been rejected. After all, we are not all absolutely clean in these matters. As my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth pointed out in his speech earlier tonight, the Government of the State of which I am a citizen has been in office for some five years and it has not yet legislated for freedom of information to be allowed to the citizens of New South Wales. It was very distressing, I must say, for me today to read in my local newspaper the Sydney Morning Herald report on the Premier of New South Wales. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it was not the Government's policy to table internal reports, but he was prepared to let Mr Dowd see it if he agreed not to reveal its contents. </PARA>

It is beyond my belief that the current Premier of New South Wales would wish to protect a Liberal predecessor. I can merely say that if this report is as supportive of the New South Wales Government, as he claims it is, the obvious way to prove that is to make it public. But also I think that to adopt the recommendations of Professor Peter Wilenski as regards the freedom of information legislation would give a very good lead to the Labor Party and to the New South Wales members of the Labor Party in this House who are somewhat muted in their criticisms of the Government in this case because of the failure of their State Labor Government to introduce legislation which has anything approaching the value of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we have just heard quite a thoughtful speech with that characteristic tendency to understatement that one gets from the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). I did agree wholeheartedly with his introductory remarks when he pointed out that the Westminster system-I think I quote him more or less accurately-has proved to be completely inadequate in providing for effective discussion of public issues, and it is partly to that theme that I want to direct my remarks tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things that ought to unite honourable members on both sides of the House, as I think the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) pointed out, is our commitment to democracy. Whether we be liberals or democratic socialists, we are supposed to be committed to democracy. This commitment, of course, is critical in terms of the kinds of complex issues that we are confronted with in modern society. I will begin by quoting from Tony Wedgwood Benn who sometimes is painted as something of a radical socialist. He made some introductory remarks within the context of a lecture on the subject of Democracy in the Age of Science. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The relationship between Science and Democracy is central to any discussion about the future. Unless they can be reconciled power may be abused, and the development of knowledge may be restricted. My thesis is that secrecy is the great enemy of democracy and science, and the key to the advance of both lies in the wider spread of knowledge. It is in the joint interest of the scientific community and the general body of citizens to formulate such clear demands for greater openness, and to press for them with such strength, that the present tradition of secrecy is broken down and replaced by an open system offering freedom of information. This is necessary if we are to reveal the issues, and the choices that are available, so that individual citizens may exercise their judgment upon them, and press their policies according to their interests and opinions within our democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The choice between the private and the public ownership of knowledge is a major scientific and political issue . . . Science and the scientific method, engineering and applied technology now permeate every part of a modern society. But they have also helped to create great power-and the organisations which control it-for good or ill. If the men and women who are now in charge of those big organisations-be they governmental, industrial or financial-are successful in shrouding their thinking, decisions and their policies in secrecy then it could be that the resources of science and engineering which they command could enslave humanity instead of liberating it. And if mankind is excluded from understanding the knowledge which is now available he will be deprived of his inheritance. </PARA>
<PARA>What Benn is getting at is that one needs to look at the question of freedom of information not only within the context of the scientific revolution and the rapidly changing march of technology, but also within a social context and a political context. This legislation which we are looking at tonight is a response, perhaps inadequate, but nevertheless a response which is necessary primarily because of the growing concentration of power in modern society and the inter-relationship between various powerful institutions, whether they be economic, political or military in their essence. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the existence in modern society of what C. Wright Mills called the power elite; what President Eisenhower called the military industrial complex; or the technostructure or the managerial class in the thought of J. K. Galbraith . It is an immense concentration of power; indeed, the interlocking of elites in modern society which makes some kind of freedom of information legislation-we hope rather stronger legislation than this-not a choice but an absolute necessity. Furthermore, the possibility of the corruption of that establishment reinforces this necessity. </PARA>
<PARA> The example of Richard Nixon behind the veil of secrecy which governs affairs of high state reveals that the body politic can be absolutely rotten. This fact can be hidden from ordinary people-indeed, hidden as it was in the case of Nixon from the whole society. We have had in this Parliament some glimpses-perhaps not quite as widespread and not quite as devastating as in the case of Nixon-of the way that our establishment is affected by corruption even in the example of Asia Dairy Industries scandal. Even to dig out that particular example required what has amounted to a major research project. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the United States, we do not have the diversity which is present in the United States media nor do we have the muck-raking tradition which enables journalists to pursue a matter when they sense there is a hint of scandal. Further, we have a different tradition of law which means that people are dissuaded from speaking of facts of which they may not be entirely sure by the very strict laws of libel. In addition, the honourable member for Mackellar alluded to the fact that within the traditions of the Westminster system with its heavy emphasis on ministerial responsibility and the entrenched tradition of parliamentary government it is often difficult to properly examine matters which are essential to government decision-making processes. This will often illustrate the inter-relationship between government and other dimensions of society, such as the economic dimension and the military. In this respect the parliament has in terms of its capacity, to throw up information and to illuminate what is really happening in society. How real decisions are made has become a kind of a farce played out for the benefit of members of the Press gallery who write more of the theatre than they do of the substantive issues involved. Few parliamentarians are able to break through the barriers which exist to reveal the underlying issues. </PARA>
<PARA> We are aware of departments within this Parliament only barely through glimpses of public servants advising Ministers on the other side of the House. Face to face communication with the mandarins of the Australian Public Service is extremely rare and, when it does occur, is quite superficial. When such people do appear before committees their loyalty is to Ministers in the 'Yes, Minister' tradition. They are not anxious to have parliament scrutinise the actual operations of their departments. In this Westminster tradition we have developed a tradition not of freedom of information but a limitation of information, not of revealing the truth to people but excluding, parliamentarians perhaps especially, from access to the truth. We have inherited a situation where public servants in preparing submissions for parliamentary committees do so in a way which is devoid of any hard information but is often couched in a bureaucratic language and style designed to confirm Ministers in the view that the department which they administer will never be the subject of controversy and will never ruin an argument with a hard fact. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that we need legislation which is designed to free up decision making so that ordinary people can get access to the kind of information they need to assess decisions or even-and in this Parliament one almost says: 'Perish the thought'-proposed new directions in which policies or programs might be directed. We have nothing like the capacity which is present in the United States congressional system of committees for committees to be presented with initiatives, programs and ideas on the way fundamental problems that face our society might be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation before us is not to be totally rejected. It clearly takes us in some of the direction that is required. The trick that is always employed by the honourable member for Mackellar whenever he speaks is to suggest that any progress, no matter how small, no matter how minimal that one might identify on the Government side, indicates that somehow in the end it will finish up in the right direction. This is a government which survives very largely because of its capacity for public relations and very largely because of its capacity to delude people into thinking that something which is devised for the purpose of reassuring people represents any kind of substantial initiative. It has been clear in terms of the debate that has taken place over a very long period over the freedom of information legislation that rather than this legislation being devised to deal with the fundamental problems which exist for ordinary people in our community to get access to information-not only existing information but also to have information put together for them so that unrelated facts are seen to have the significance which they really do have-that this legislation in fact represents tokenism. It represents simply a very small step in a direction which would require a very large step and very strong initiatives to have any impact. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the point that I began with: It is not as though power is relatively dispersed in our society; power in our society is heavily concentrated and there are very close interrelationships between the various elements of the power structure. A power elite does exist. I do not include the honourable member for Mackellar in that. He may well be part of the power structure of the Liberal Party of Australia represented on the other side of the chamber, but on the other hand he may not. Clearly most backbenchers on the other side of the chamber are not. Power in this Parliament is concentrated in the hands of a very small number of Ministers indeed. They exercise power and co -operation with sections of the Public Service and, no doubt, with sections of economic establishments and other interests outside in the community. We live in a society in which there are very few actors in the crucial game of deciding what the direction of our society will be in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were serious about this it would require very strong legislation. What we have is very weak legislation. What we have is, indeed, a situation in which so many of the recommendations made by a bipartisan inquiry conducted by the Senate, presumably agreed to by both sides in the Senate, were put aside by that small elite inside the Cabinet that makes the decisions about the direction in which this Liberal-National Country Party Government will proceed. Then, quite unbelievably, as Senator Evans has pointed out, notwithstanding the failure of the Government to accept recommendations, the Government in its new Bill has introduced a whole series of new restrictions and prohibitions on the freedom of information. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the honourable member for Mackellar concedes that they include a substantial broadening of exemptions prohibiting documents on law enforcement issues, trade secrets and business information and information on matters related to the national economy and internal administrative efficiency being covered by the provisions of the legislation and the specific adoption, without limitation, of all existing secrecy provisions in other legislation. They include an extraordinary new power in agencies to refuse even to retrieve and examine a document when the document as described in the request appears to be exempt. They include a complete exclusion from the provisions of the Bill of 24 specific agencies, many of which have no commercial or sensitive intelligence functions, including the Auditor-General's Office, the Health Insurance Commission, the Aboriginal Lands Trust and 15 other agencies in respect of their competitive commercial activities and all external territories. They include vesting a new power in agencies to refuse disclosure of a non-exempt portion of a document if it would be misleading. They include vesting in the Minister an unappealable power to prevent an agency from compiling documented indexes if that would unreasonably divert its resources from other operations. </PARA>
<PARA> I go on very briefly to refer to an example which I think fits into the context of what I said when I began this speech, when I referred to the fact that what we are talking about is a society in which power is concentrated, a society which is undergoing rapid scientific and technological change. Let us simply take the example that has been thrown up and has been before this Parliament. It is associated with the chemical industry. I refer to agent orange. We see what a struggle it has been to have information released, even when people who have been affected by a substance have a necessity to gain access to information to establish the causes of their illness. In the post-War period we have produced thousands of new chemicals. Most of the chemicals which have been introduced into commercial use have been untested for their effects on health. They have simply been introduced on the basis that they are commercial chemicals that are of some use. They have not been tested by the companies concerned. They have not been subjected in Australia to an examination by any agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The outstanding example of a dangerous substance which is in use in the community and which has been before the Parliament is that of 2,4,5-T. It contains dioxin, which many people believe has lethal side effects. That has been argued by the Vietnam veterans who were sprayed with agent orange. I ask a question. It is a test question that perhaps others can answer. In what way will this Bill provide, for example, the war veterans with the freedom they require to get the facts they need to establish even whether they were sprayed with dangerous chemicals in Vietnam? What access have they been able to gain to documents within the Department of Defence which would show what was known in the Department of Defence or any other government departments at the time of the Vietnam war of the dangers associated with that chemical? I believe that, in that kind of case, this legislation, if enacted, will make very little difference. I believe that this legislation will not enable veterans to gain, for example, access to certain Cabinet documents or even to information gathered by the Department of Defence on knowledge that was available in the late 1960s about the dangers surrounding the chemicals associated with agent orange. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt the problem which has been established in the case of the Vietnam veterans has its parallels in the case of people exposed in a domestic situation to dangerous chemicals, perhaps even to the chemicals to which I have been referring. I refer, for example, to information that will be available on the nature of chemicals contained in certain herbicides which no doubt are being used by farmers right across the country. What in this legislation will enable farm workers spraying with herbicides to gain access to information which will tell them even what constituents of chemicals are contained in herbicides with which they might be involved and which, indeed, might have been proved in the United States of America to have been extremely dangerous? The reason why the agent orange inquiry is not being pursued and the reason why this legislation does not go to the heart of the matter is not really commercial secrecy, although that is a clue; it is the fact that behind agent orange, behind the chemical industry and behind this legislation is a government that is unwilling to invade, if you like, the territory of capital. We read again and again of commercial secrets. The commercial activities of government are excluded from the provisions of this legislation because this Government is not willing to apply against the commercial enterprises the rules of democracy which it espouses in general. It is not prepared to talk about economic democracy. It is not prepared to talk about industrial democracy. It is not prepared to talk about freedom of information for ordinary people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can recall no legislation that has come before this Parliament in recent years which has been the subject of such intense level of debate, not only here in both Houses of the Parliament but also in the community at large. In every sense of the word, the introduction of freedom of information legislation is unique, not only in Australia but also in the Westminster concept. This is the first time in the Commonwealth that legislation of this type has been introduced in a democratic Westminster-style parliament. Those of us who have made a study of democratic developments over the past 200 years-of course, the democratic system had its genesis over 1,000 years ago- would have to conclude that in the past few years we have seen significant steps forward in the capacity of the individual to gain greater access to his rights as a citizen, especially his rights to know how the government of his country is meant to be operating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps the weakness in our traditional position has been that under the Westminster code it has been presumed that the member of Parliament is to be the essential link between the constituent and the government of the day. The realities of modern government, the problems of a very intense and complicated system of public administration, have made it quite obvious to all of us who have participated in this field that it is now no longer possible merely for members of Parliament, whatever their side of politics and whatever their capacity to get access to information, always to be in a position to look after the interests of the constituents in all fields. It is interesting, therefore, to note that it was not in the Commonwealth democratic system but rather in the United States System that the concept of freedom of information was first developed. The legislation which the Americans introduced in 1966 has demonstrated a number of very real problems. The legislation we are debating tonight is a serious attempt to address those problems with the intention of introducing a set of criteria in which the rights of the individual can be balanced against the capacity of the governmental structure to meet the legitimate needs of the citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> In many respects this Bill has attempted to reduce a range of problems which first came to light in the American experience. These can best be described as the problem of the administrative costs involved; the problem of the retrospectivity of information which has gone through the system in previous years; the very real problem of litigation which can be before the courts and the impact new information coming from government files could have in that context; the major problem of criminal intelligence and the capacity of those who wish to use the system for their own ends to obtain through government information which could basically be of criminal intent; the whole series of problems related to the rights of the individual, including the capacity of the individual to maintain a high level of confidentiality and personal privacy; and , above all, the problems of business confidentiality in terms of both government instrumentalities and, more than that, the private sector. The exceptions under the proposed Act are contained in clause 36 of the Bill. A series of schedules in Part IV also gives a range of exempt Commonwealth agencies which are not covered by this legislation. Later I will refer to the exemptions because, like colleagues who have spoken before me, I believe there are a number of problems in this area and I hope subsequent examination of the legislation after it has been in force for the proposed three years will give us the opportunity to make the necessary reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the legislation as it is currently before the House the principles and objectives may be best described as being the object to extend as far as possible the right of the Australian community to have access to information in the possession of the Government of the Commonwealth by making available to the public information about the operations of departments and public authorities and, in particular, by ensuring that rules and practices affecting members of the public in their dealings with departments and public authorities are readily available to persons affected by those rules and practices. It is the desire of the Government to create a general right of access to information in documentary form in the possession of Ministers, departments and public authorities, limited only by exceptions and exemptions necessary for the protection of essential public interests and the private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom information is collected and held by departments and public authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the impact of this legislation in many ways will be of tremendous importance to the capacity of the average citizen to exercise his right to safeguard his fundamental responsibilities. The appropriate balance, however, between the openness and the need for respective confidentiality has been one of the prime motivating factors which have limited the capacity of this legislation to enter into what can best be described as a free-for-all. As an ex-civil servant and one who has spent most of his time in this Parliament involved in the administration of the Public Service, I have to say that many of the comments made by a colleague on the opposite side, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), have some merit in terms of the attitude and the role which the civil servant feels he has to play relevant to the safeguarding of what he believes is public information. Unfortunately, the tendency over the years has been for many civil servants deliberately to upgrade the confidentiality or secrecy provisions on papers and on files, often as not to protect them not only from the would-be snooper from outside but also, and often just as importantly, from the would-be snooper from some other department. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we cannot accept the situation in which we have internecine strife and warfare in what is meant to be the efficient administration of the Commonwealth, but the fact of the matter is that this attitude of mind has been found in the past and I suspect that we will continue to see it in the future. The passage of this legislation will make officers of the Commonwealth consider very seriously what they are prepared to put down on files which may become public. I am concerned that the impact of this in certain areas could result in the creation of formal files and informal files and in a substantial increase in the telephone bill. As a matter of fact, this has already taken place in a range of departments. It has been caused essentially by the relatively modern tendency for the leak to become almost an official means of communicating with the opposition of the day. Nevertheless, the impact on the attitudes which civil servants have towards the safeguarding of information, towards the usage of information and how they will see the rights of the citizen to get access to that information, is something which this Parliament will have to continue to watch most carefully, especially over the next three years, which is essentially the trial period for this legislation. Because of the Bill's uniqueness it is obvious that after it becomes an Act some of its aspects will require examination. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) made the observation that there is also provision, after 12 months, for examination to be given to the question of whether some form of access could be devised for material which has already been filed away and which possibly has gone to the Commonwealth archives. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of maintaining this kind of legislation will be very significant indeed. I do not think members of the Opposition should be prepared to pass over the reality that the cost of freedom of information must be faced by whoever is the government of the day. As a result of a congressional inquiry prior to the passage of the first United States legislation, it was optimistically believed that it would cost approximately $100,000 a year. However, after the first year of its application it was reliably estimated to have cost the United States Administration in excess of $36m. The reality we are therefore facing in Australia is this: If we are to demand access to a very wide range of information, somebody has to sift through the files, collect the relevant information, set up a bureau which can service the public and make sure the information is made available. The realities of the Public Service today, with cost cutting and the establishment of very difficult personnel ceilings and so forth, make me seriously doubt whether it will be possible, at least in the short to medium stages, to make available sufficient officers with the training and capacity to make what really will be most important decisions. In other words, how will we have the machinery in every department and in every statutory authority, except those which are subject to exemption, to make adequate information available to the community?</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Government has faced the situation because it believes, it being a fundamental Liberal principle, that the Australian constituent, the elector of respective governments, has the right to get information which he regards as relevant to his own interests. That is a fundamental principle which must be protected in this legislation. The principle of openness identifies and defines those circumstances in which confidentiality should be maintained. For example, we must continue to protect personal privacy, confidential commercial information, information of vital national interest such as that involving security and defence and the conduct of government activities. Confidentiality is undoubtedly essential, particularly within the relationships inside a government, the attitudes and the assistance which may be given by civil servants to Ministers, the relationships between one Minister and another and, equally, the relationships which take place between the departments. It is essential in the maintenance of an effective governmental system that there be a level of trust between all sections of the governmental machine. If we lose that sense of trust there is no doubt that every Australian citizen will significantly lose as a result, whether he has access to information or not. The good order and government of the Commonwealth must be the principal responsibility which we must keep in mind throughout this whole operation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the traditional view has been that parliament is the principal safeguarder of the people. There is no argument against that. However, in recent years, because of the complexity of government we have seen the introduction of new instrumentalities and statutory officals such as the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia. All of these instrumentalities operate under powers conferred on them by this Parliament and all in their own way, will have some responsibility to bear in terms of the administration of this legislation. For example, if a citizen is not given access to information to which he believes he has a legitimate right, whether or not it is information which has been previously the subject of a declaration by the Minister of the day of that specific department, he has the right to make approaches to the appropriate organisations established under this legislation and ultimately the right to take questions of law as high as the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Freedom of Information Bill will operate on a wider scope than any existing means of obtaining information we have ever had in the past. The Bill provides the legally enforceable right of access to documented information. It is a radical change of approach from what we have seen in previous years. It will require Ministers or departments seeking to withhold information to justify their decisions to deny access to that information to the citizens by the application of criteria which are quite clearly specified in the Bill. It also imposes a positive obligation on departments and authorities to make public their organisations and structure and the functions they perform. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing has always concerned me as a member of this Parliament and that is the incredible lack of basic knowledge which most Australian citizens have on even the rudiments of the governmental system. We have all been confused between Federal and State members of parliament. That is something we tend to take for granted. But many citizens of Australia are even further confused about exactly what the constititutional basis of the Federal parliamentary operation may be as distinct from that of the State. I hope that with the passage of this legislation it will be possible to enter into a much deeper capacity to give to Australian citizens, schools, universities and institutions much wider scope to be able to get a better understanding of how the Australian system of government in fact operates. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go further and make the observation that there is really little point in the citizen saying that he lives in a democracy and little point in the citizen saying he has to vote for his representatives every three years or so if he really does not even understand the system of government under which he is meant to be administered. In recent years-this has been a trend for at least the last 100 years-we have seen the steady encroachment and growth of governmental involvement in the lives of every single citizen. Recently I was reading a book on public administration written by an American. He took the rather interesting story of a person who woke up in the morning and he followed that person through the day. Literally every single decision that person made-for example, whether he ate a poached egg in the morning, what type of car he drove, where he got his petrol, where he worked, whether he went up in a lift and where he had his lunch -and every single aspect of his life was subject to governmental decisions taken by either local government or State or Federal authorities. We tend to forget these facts. </PARA>
<PARA> But we also have in recent years, because of the sheer complexity of government , lost sight of the fact that as citizens we do have a responsibility to acquaint ourselves with the basic functioning of our administrative system. It is not simply enough for the citizen to take the view that he elects his representative and, therefore, he obviates any need to take any further responsibility. The ultimate responsibility of the citizen must always be the need to keep a watch, to be aware, to be interested and to keep informed. With the passage of this legislation I sincerely hope that the capacity of the citizen to keep informed, in particular, will be significantly improved. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues before me, both the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) and the honourable member for Mackellar, drew attention to the fact that with the passage of this legislation we hope that the various State governments of Australia will also see their way clear to introducing similar legislation of effect to the States. Whilst in Victoria there has been very appropriate legislation along similar lines to our own, it is a matter of great concern to me as a citizen of New South Wales that there is no freedom of informatin legislation in that State. In recent years under the Wran Government we have seen the tendency for the Government literally to take the Parliament for granted. It has become little more than a sham. It was described to me recently as being almost legislation by ambush because the Opposition is lucky if it gets two hours advance warning of legislation to be introduced into the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Time after time we see reports which have not been tabled. They have then been leaked from various sources which the government of the day has either denied existed or, if it does admit that they exist, it refuses to give them to anybody . As was mentioned this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dowd, was informed by the Premier, Mr Wran, that he could have access to a confidential report on the state of the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, which I understand was commissioned in about 1976, on the condition that he did not make the information public. Obviously, Mr Dowd being the Leader of the Opposition, that was an absurd request for any Premier to make of a fellow member of the Parliament. Nevertheless, this is the situation which exists in my State today. It is a scandalous situation which cannot be continued . </PARA>
<PARA> I would say, on the other hand, that there has been at least some improvement in terms of the establishment of a public accounts committee in that State. It has taken over five years of constant badgering to get the New South Wales Government to realise the fact that the Parliament does need effective review machinery to enable the members of the Parliament, from whatever party, to perform their constitutional responsibilities to their constituents. We have seen only in the last two days the tabling of a report on New South Wales hospitals which demonstrates that at least and at last there is a group of people who have been given the capacity to take a serious look at areas of public administration which quite obviously require very fundamental reform. But any government which thinks it can hide behind the ignorance of the public is courting disaster because ultimately the people who are not fools will see through this charade and will appreciate the fact that they have a right to know what is going on in their States. It is not good enough simply to use public servants as a protective device against the fundamental rights of the citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House on this subject to the fundamental views of Lord Hailsham who drew the attention of the community to the fact that information is indeed power and that because it is power it must be diffused throughout the community. He made that view clear. It is one which I totally support and it is certainly a view which is supported by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intervene in this debate very briefly just to express a few views about some of the aspects of it. The first thing I want to say about the Freedom of Information Bill, its origins and its very tenuous and tortured life to this stage is that the basic approach of this Government and, indeed, the Australian Labor Party Government which first initiated the freedom of information proposals, has been that the public servants, who are supposed to serve Government, started from the basic premise that one does not let anyone know anything if one can possibly avoid the revelation of that information. That means that if one can find any flimsy reason for concealing information one should conceal it. That is the basic approach which has continued through to the legislation that is before us tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It starts from the premise that the information is not made available unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. Obviously the alternative approach is to say that we should let everybody know everything unless there are particular circumstances why, for very clear and agreed reasons, that information would be deleterious either to individuals or to the national interest. On reading the legislation and the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which looked at the earlier proposed legislation, one can find throughout it this basic premise that information should be withheld unless it absolutely has to be revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the public reasons for adopting this approach which is advanced by a number of speakers-not only those who are basically opposed to freedom of information legislation but also some of those who are apparently in favour of it-is that this sort of legislation is really incompatible with the Westminster system of government, which is the system we apparently follow. Heaven knows what the Westminster system really was, or is today. Certainly, one does not see within our existing structure any of the sorts of guarantees, any of the sorts of procedures, which would require the revelation of information which is pretended by those who proceed with that argument. Some people argue that because, under the Westminster style of government the Executive is directly accountable to the parliament, freedom of information legislation is not necessary. They say that because Ministers have to be accountable to the Parliament-to every single member of it-in that way a curb can be placed on the Executive and information extracted from it. But of course we know that over the years Ministers have raised the whole art of concealment to a very advanced stage indeed; Ministers do not come into this Parliament with the objective of providing information. They come into it with the objective of withholding and concealing information. Honourable members have to be some sort of an Houdini to work out the mechanism involved in extracting information from an unwilling Minister. If a member of this Parliament dares to develop any sort of inquisitive zeal it takes only one Question Time to kill off that zeal absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA> If we turn to the area of Questions on Notice, which are supposed to give effect to the right of members of parliament to place before Ministers questions which those Ministers must answer, one has only to read the answers themselves to learn that Ministers go to very great lengths to avoid answering questions, conceal information or provide all kinds of elaborate ruses for not revealing the information sought by members of Parliament. So the purpose of asking Questions without Notice during Question Time is not to seek information. The value is apparently in the question, not the answer. Indeed, in relation to Questions on Notice, honourable members do not seem to care much about the answers given. All they care about is engaging in some sort of competition to see who can ask the greatest number. I daresay that the Government goes to a great deal of trouble and expense to avoid answering those questions but I would not suggest-I would be surprised if anyone would-that that mechanism represented any real opportunity for members of parliament, let alone the public as a whole, to extract information from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyway, people have said that because we have a system under which Ministers are responsible to the Parliament, it is inappropriate for us to adopt the United States practice. Of course, the system there is theoretically quite different. The Executive is not directly accountable to the Congress and therefore one needs other sorts of mechanisms to extract information from the Executive, to require it to provide that information not only to the Congress but also to the public at large. I suggest that it is not so much a matter of transplanting or grafting an American solution onto a Westminster style of government, but rather one of recognising that our system has become very close to that of the United States. In Australia, and indeed in the States of Australia, the executives no longer operate in such a way as to be accountable to parliament. They are accountable, apparently, to no one but themselves. They provide only the information that they want to provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of that distortion of the theoretical processes of the Westminster system, this sort of legislation is indeed necessary. My very great regret is that it proceeds from the assumption that one must try to conceal, try to contain, information unless one absolutely has to give it out, rather than let everybody know, unless there are overwhelmingly valid reasons for withholding it . If we are talking about the ordinary people of a country participating in a democratic process and having the information that is necessary for that participation, what on earth is wrong with letting everyone know as much as possible?</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I would go one step further and say that this legislation, in itself, has become almost entirely irrelevant to the processes of informing the general public as a whole. It is no longer simply a question of extracting the information from governments. More importantly these days it is a question of getting that information, once extracted, out to the ordinary members of the community. That, it seems to me, is where the real problem lies. Between the provision of the information by the Government and the receiving of the information by the general public there lie very restricted means of communication indeed. There is a myriad of ways in which the media, the newspapers, television and radio, can apply rules which, in fact, prevent the dissemination of that information, once extracted from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What we really have to do is look not only at the question of getting the information from the Government but also at the ways in which that information, whether readily provided by government or provided under duress, is made available to the general public. Only when the general public has access to that information will we have made any advance at all. If just a small coterie of people have additional access to information we have not advanced very far at all the cause of democracy. It is only when hundreds of thousands or millions of people are in a position to make judgments on the basis of knowledge that we begin to improve the whole fabric of democracy. Instead, we have a situation which apparently is quite persistent, still alive and well, whereby there is, on the part of governments, a terror of letting anybody know anything about what governments are up to, or about what Ministers are thinking. </PARA>
<PARA> What people seem to ignore is that the value of information is largely determined by its availability. If information is in scarce supply it gathers certain value which, of course, disappears as soon as everyone knows it. Who cares if everyone knows a certain piece of information? What is valuable about it is that only a few people know it and that others want to be amongst those few. So those governments which hide behind this sort of cloak of secrecy and try to deprive people of such information misjudge the whole nature of the exercise. If they were prepared to reveal the information quite openly the damaging consequences that they imagine would follow would of course disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give a couple of examples: Recently I was speaking to a senior journalist in the Press gallery who has, for years, followed meetings of the national decision-making body of the Australian Labor Party. At one time that body met behind closed doors-as it still does-but in very great secrecy. </PARA>

He told me that it was a matter of great regret to him when the national secretary of the Australian Labor Party-the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) was the first to do it-decided to brief the Press after meetings of the National Executive, which was then called the Federal Executive.

There are other examples. We have had the example of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) who has been caught out time and again in this Parliament simply because he attempts to delude, to deceive and to withhold information. If only he would come clean, tell it how it really is and reveal the sorts of mistakes he has made and the sorts of intrigues that he has been involved in, he would not get into nearly as much trouble as he has in recent times. He has an additional problem, of course, in that he has an inability to distinguish between falsehood and the truth. He will always be in that sort of dilemma.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is my speech. My speech is to discredit the Minister for Industrial Relations at every opportunity because the Minister for Industrial Relations has no respect for this Parliament. He has no respect for the truth and no respect even for the honourable member, if he cares to ponder on it. The Minister does not care for anybody except himself. He is one of the greatest deceivers and concealers in this Parliament. That is why he has come unstuck in all the portfolios which it has been Australia's misfortune for him to occupy. Then, of course, we have the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) who is gesticulating in his usual way this evening. He has suddenly discovered the importance of the freedom of information. He notes with some great horror that the New South Wales Government is withholding information at the same time as he makes a speech in support of this Government's withholding information, that is, prescribing limits on the sort of information which ought to be withheld by this Government. The honourable member for Wentworth has discovered the very great difference between being in opposition and in government. He has fallen for the three-card trick. He wants to be as secretive as he can while his party is in government but he wants other governments to be as open as possible when he and his party happen to be in opposition. One thing we can say about the Australian Labor Party is that we pioneered freedom of information and, although some of our earlier attempts might have been still-born and a bit defective, at least we set out on the very difficult and hazardous course of providing freedom of information. Indeed, had we had the opportunity to proceed with that course, we would have had a much better Bill before this House than the pallid form of the original intention that in fact has arrived in this House from the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make a couple of other points about exclusions because this Bill is more about excluding and preventing access to information than providing access to information. The particular area I refer to appears in Part IV where reference is made to exempt documents, including those dealing with relations between the Commonwealth and the States. I cannot for the life of me understand why relations between the Commonwealth and the States cannot be more open. Why should not relations between the Commonwealth and the States be as open as relations between one department and another department within this Government? The States, we have come to understand, are the most secretive of all governments in Australia. They have been the most recalcitrant in terms of providing information to the people whom they seek to govern. State governments are supposed to be the closest to the people and those most in touch with the people but, in reality, they are the ones who set about an elaborate course of denying information and of deceiving the communities which elect them. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not understand why this Commonwealth or any Commonwealth should fortify that process. Why should we not make available to the people of Australia as a whole the information that flows between State governments and the national government? After all, it is in the interests of all of the people what happens between governments. To deny that information only encourages the sort of grandstanding, mischief and outright politicking which goes on between Premiers and Prime Ministers of this country. We must stop that process. We must make Premiers stand up and be counted in relation to the things they say, currently, behind closed doors in Premiers Conferences. I am sick and tired of having occasional leaks from Premiers Conferences, to find Premiers revealed as having said something quite different from what they have in fact said when they have gone home to their own little bailiwicks and, in the safety of their closet media, have revealed what they think the communities they serve want to hear. It is about time the whole system was opened up. If it were opened up, the whole system of government in this country would be better and, indeed, Australia might for the first time become somewhat governable. It is an outrage that this legislation should seek to fortify the secrecy of and the deception by Premiers, which has gone on for far too long. State governments are secretive and surreptitious and the Commonwealth should have no part in encouraging that. The honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) both said 'But what an enormous cost is involved in revealing this information'. The honourable member for Bradfield told us what the estimate and the actual cost was in the United States. I suspect that most of the costs in the United States involved with the freedom of information legislation in fact result from finding ways of not disclosing information. The freer information is , the cheaper it is to provide. If these sorts of exclusions and exemptions are provided, of course it will cost money to determine which is available and which is not. It would become very much cheaper if those limits were removed or at least partially reduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tomorrow is 19 February and it marks the fortieth anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. The 19th February 1942 was a very significant day in the history of Darwin and, more importantly, in the history of Australia. My generation, as a person aged under 40, and probably a majority of the people now living in Australia, do not have a personal memory of the events of the first enemy attack on Australian soil. But I think it is important that we-that is, those of us under 40 years of age-should be mindful of our obligation to those who died and to their families. We have an obligation to remember the service of the thousands who served in the defence of northern Australia and in particular the 243 who died and the 253 who were wounded on 19 February 1942. Tomorrow we must think of their families with sympathy. In addition to the two raids on 19 February, in total there were 58 occasions on which Darwin and other centres in northern Australia were bombed between March 1942 and November 1943.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first and most comprehensive book about the bombing of Darwin is undoubtedly Douglas Lockwood's Australia's Pearl Harbour. I bring it to attention to be read by many people in Australia today. The book covers the events of that infamous day very graphically and from the author's personal experience. It covers the tragedy, the mistakes and the destruction and highlights very graphically the unpreparedness of the Australian nation on that occasion. I believe it is incumbent on all of us to remember that 40 years is a very short time. We should be very mindful, when putting together our defence policies, of the need to maintain a very strong Australian Defence Force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The latest government cutbacks will have a grave effect on Canberra's economy. They have further reduced public confidence in the Government's ability to manage the economy. Already, there has been an angry response from local business and industry leaders. These cutbacks have been rushed through in an ad hoc manner with no thought for the consequences for business people, contractors, developers or the ordinary citizen. The building industry has been particularly hard hit once again. The Commissioner for Housing loan scheme has been frozen. If the decision is not reviewed, it will seriously affect the number of new houses that will be built this year. It will put builders and employees out of work and further reduce the opportunity for home ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cutbacks will also prevent cyclical maintenance on government houses. Cancellation of overtime payments will mean that maintenance work will take longer and the reallocation of government houses will be slowed down. There are already 2,400 families on the waiting list and up to 100 each month are approved for priority allocation, but none of these people can get houses at present. The latest cutbacks will place further pressure on these waiting lists and we can expect the present waiting times of 2 1/2 years for an ordinary house to lengthen considerably. All of this means further hardship for the many needy Canberra families. The latest cutbacks have placed the government's commitment to build 300 new houses in jeopardy. These houses were promised in this year's Budget and are urgently needed to replace those sold from the existing pool and to alleviate the ever lengthening queues for government housing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that the Government stick to its budget promises if the private sector is to have any confidence at all in Canberra's future. No business can survive the continual stop-go decisions of the present Government. No business can operate in an unstable and unpredictable commercial environment for long. The Fraser Government is clearly bad for business and it will certainly suffer the electoral consequences. The Chief Executive of the Australian Capital Territory and Southern New South Wales Division of the Housing Industry Association, Mr Laurie Evans, has said:</PARA>
<PARA> The private sector, traditionally linked with Liberal-Country Party coalition policies, might now look to ALP platforms to find the solutions to the continuing problems of interest rates, unemployment and economic mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA>The new Parliament House is another victim of the cutbacks. Only a few months after a Government commitment to the future of this important national project, it was announced this week that $3m is to be slashed from the $26m project budget for this year. This significant cutback will have a serious effect on local contractors and will cause an uneven employment distribution on the project. But, of greatest importance, is the fact that the cutback will not even save any money. On major building projects, delays always cost money and have a significant multiplier effect on the final cost of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the Public Service, the directive from the Department of Finance has thrown the work of the Public Service into confusion. Midway through the financial year, and hard on the heels of disorder generated by the razor gang, each department is now expected to turn itself inside out because the Government cannot get its Budget sums right. No wonder people have lost confidence in this Government. Cutting out overtime, cancellation of major equipment acquisitions and freezing of discretionary expenditure in one swift ad hoc decision are probably the most inefficient method of achieving financial savings that could be devised. The ludicrous suggestion that the Australian Federal Police should eliminate overtime payments, and presumably educate the criminal element to work regular nine to five hours, indicates the extent of the Government's mismanagement. The people of Canberra are bearing the brunt of nearly all Federal Government cutbacks and they are sick and tired of the Fraser Government 's chaotic anti-Canberra policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that both sides of the House would want me to extend sympathy to the Tasmanian Government and Tasmanian people as a result of the disastrous bushfires this week. It is pleasing to see the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) in the House. He went down to Tasmania during the week and monitored the situation. I think we all felt very uneasy. I think all members of Federal Parliament are torn between their homes and here. When there are problems at home I am sure all members want to be there. One never knows with bushfires. We get so many varying opinions and a variance in media reports about what can happen. The other House of Representatives members and the Tasmanian senators, including Labor senators, probably felt the same as I did; they were very uneasy and worried all the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not want a repetition of 1967. I applaud the Tasmanian Government for declaring a state of emergency and for making sure that Tasmania was prepared for the unforseen. We could have had a repetition of 1967. I hope to goodness that everything is cleared up. I hope to goodness that we do not have any tragic loss of life. We have already lost one person, apparently; I believe another was seriously injured. I am sure all Australians feel the same as I do. Bushfires are unexpected and can create terrible problems for the people involved. There can be loss of life, limb, land and goodness knows what. That aside, I am sure it has been an uneasy week in Tasmania. We are all very pleased that the weather has changed and the problems appear to have passed. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise another point tonight. I listened with great interest to all of the arguments about sales tax. Many people mentioned that the sales taxes that would cost the average family about $1.50 a week. I thought to myself about the great rip off in petrol charges in this country. I thought of the arguments that are being presented by many State and Federal politicians about the variation in the price of petrol. I compared Victoria with Tasmania and Melbourne with Hobart. Probably many members are not aware that the oil companies individually have to go to the Petrol Products Pricing Authority to seek an increase. If they can justify an increase it is granted. A maximum wholesale price is charged in every capital city of Australia, and it does not vary that much. In Victoria it is 37c to 38c a litre. In Hobart it is 37c to 38c a litre. There is not very much variance. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been involved with an argument with a person-I cannot think of his name- from the Australian Institute of Petroleum who is probably very heavily involved with the oil companies. He made a statement after a few remarks from me that competition lowers the price of petrol. I thought to myself: Fair enough; if competition is enacted correctly it may do so. I wondered to myself how he could make that assertion when in fact the maximum wholesale price in Melbourne is 37c to 38c a litre and in Hobart it is 37c to 38c a litre and the selling price in Hobart is 42c to 44c a litre and in Melbourne it varies from 33c to 37c a litre- quite a disparity. The same thing is happening all over Australia. In every capital city there is a variance. </PARA>
<PARA> In the capital cities of Sydney and Adelaide there is a freeze on the wholesale price and consumers know roughly what it will be. There is a freeze on the retail price. When the people of Australia have been asked in the national interest to pay a high price for petrol there should be a bit of fairness in the market place. There should not be a variance of about 10c a litre between Melbourne and Hobart. A person who has to use about 10 gallons of petrol will pay about $5 a week more in Hobart than in Melbourne. Yet we argue about $1.30 or $1.50 a week. Governments win and lose elections on issues involving $2 a week. The people of Hobart are paying an additional $5 a week for petrol. This gentleman from the Petroleum Petrol Institute had the audacity to say to me that competition makes a fair and cheaper price. Those days are gone. I plead with the Government and the Opposition to get involved in this petroleum problem, this marketing problem, which varies from State to State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been considerable debate over the so-called Spender report, which reviewed the Children's Services Program. I might say that I object to calling reviews of various programs by the name of the chairmen. I have earlier asked that this report be officially released to the public and I now repeat that request. The document should be the subject of public perusal and debate before any of the recommendations are adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am in accord with some of the recommendations. I agree that the funding formulae should be reviewed and I endorse the emphasis on good business procedures of accountability. However, no matter how unsatisfactory the existing Child Care Act may be, it would be the height of lunacy to repeal the Act before more satisfactory legislation is provided. Such legislation should not even be considered before those people with long-standing and in-depth experience in child development and child care have had the opportunity to debate publicly this latest report. Apart from anything else, if the present legislation is repealed, this would leave the Children's Services Program without a statutory basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I have serious concern about a number of the recommendations in the report. I am concerned particularly about the total lack of consideration given by the report to the issue of the quality of care to be provided. The report appears to assume that it does not matter whether qualified staff are or are not employed to provide child care. In recommendation No. 8, it is proposed to probe the feasibility of providing a subsidy to enable children of low income parents to attend commercial child care centres. If implemented, such a subsidy would support the care of children in conditions considerably lower than those required for the receipt of the Government subsidy at present. For example, commercial centres in Victoria may operate with minimal care provisions, providing they meet requirements for registration. </PARA>
<PARA> The only requirement for a person to be in charge of a group of 30 children and responsible for the functioning of the Centre is that such person be over 18 years of age and that such person be physically and mentally capable. Other staff members may be 15 years old. There is no requirement that staff be trained in the care of young children. In spite of public agitation over many years, the standard requirements for registration of child minding centres has not been raised. Many commercial centres provide a high standard of care, but this type of subsidy would condone the use of public money to place children in situations where there is the possibility of institutionalised child abuse occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to accept the argument presented in the Report that families, and not commercial child minding centres, would be subsidised, since the intention is to select certain centres in each State and Territory. In any case, subsidy to needy families is open to abuse since proprietors of commercial centres can increase fees when subsidies apply without allowing reductions. We have seen this happen with similar provisions in Nursing Homes. Few commercial centres are in the areas of highest economic need, so access for needy families would not be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already declared that no funds have been allocated for new or expanded programs in 1981-82. This means that dozens of applications for new programs which have been sitting with the Department of Social Security for up to 2 years cannot be funded. The Office of Child Care, on instructions from the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), sent out 500 rejections to community organisations. Many of those rejected were admitted to be high priority. This means they were desperately needed. Cabinet rejected that part of the Report that proposed that $5m be provided to cover these applications in 1981-82. The Minister appears to be using the excuse of no new funding to look at a re-allocation of the existing funding, but not to meet the needs of children. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals propounded by the Report will do little or nothing to improve children's access to care. Our primary concern must be to ensure that children in need of care are not denied care by factors of cost or by lack of services. Clear evidence exists to support the contention that high quality care and education during the pre-school years is of critical importance to the optimum development of each individual. It is essential that services for children and their families continue to expand, improve and develop. High quality child care is expensive in simple financial terms but extremely effective in terms of prevention. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsidising commercial centres and introducing a standardised means test are the thin edge of the wedge. Together with the withdrawal of the Child Care Act 1972, these initiatives would let the Government right off the hook on child care. The Government could easily move towards a system of tax rebates and vouchers for children below school age and let the market provide. Then we would see the conservatives' dream-private programs for the rich and tough luck for the poor. The bulk of the Australian families which fall between the rich and--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pay a brief tribute. On my return to Parliament House for this autumn sitting I was delighted to find a letter waiting from a distinguished Western Australian adventurer and yachtsman. I speak of Jonathan Sanders. On 7 February of this year Jon Sanders completed his singlehanded circumnavigation of the world in his yacht Perie Banou and started his second non-stop circumnavigation. In an age where individual achievement and effort do not always attract recognition, it gives me pleasure to pay this tribute to this latest achievement of a fine Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first half of his lonely journey was not without its problems and that is not surprising, given the goals Jon Sanders set for himself. He tells me that his first circumnavigation via the Southern oceans took 142 day 7 hours and 49 minutes, which may well be a record. Despite his yacht being turned turtle during a gale, the ensuing damage requiring running repairs, loss of one of two solar panels essential for recharging batteries and the permanent loss of engine power which may have been needed in an emergency this man has coped with, and risen above, all the challenges the southern oceans could offer. </PARA>
<PARA> In traversing the southern oceans route he follows in the metaphorical wake of Captain James Cook in command of one of only three sailing vessels which have completed similar journeys. The others were commanded by an Argentinian, Vitto Dumas, and a Frenchman, Bernard Moitessier. The latter is credited with the longest sea journey of its kind ever, another record I am confident Jon Sanders will break. While, as I have said, achievements by individuals acting alone are rarely newsworthy, Jon Sanders has already attracted great credit to himself. His cheerful letter to me was written over the period 4 December 1981 to 4 February this year and kindly mailed to me in Hobart by those responsible for re -provisioning the Perie Banou at sea off Hobart recently. I assume he is now in or again approaching Antarctic waters, well into the second of his circumnavigations. I wish him well for the remainder of his journey and join his parents, family and friends in looking forward to his safe return to Perth around May of this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight on the Australian Broadcasting Commission' s Channel 3 news in Canberra the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) was interviewed by a Mr Ron Miller. In his introduction Mr Miller said that Mr Hodgman had a piece of bad news, that National Semiconductor Corporation had deferred its plans to build a mult-million dollar silicon chip factory-it is not a chip factory; it is a wafer factory-in Canberra. Mr Miller went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hodgman stressed there was only a deferment by the company, not a complete pullout. And he had strong words for one of his detractors over the issue, Labor Parliamentarian Barry Jones. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is then quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Jones was reported to me yesterday as having said that nobody had heard of me in California--</PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly true-</PARA>
<PARA>that I had finished with egg on my face--</PARA>
<PARA>That is also true-</PARA>

I am so annoyed about Mr Jones, he might be very good at Pick A Box as far as I'm concerned I'd invite him to Pick A Box and the place I'd suggest he starts looking is Gungahlin. Because quite frankly Mr Jones has done a lot of damage and in my view has behaved in a manner which has not been in the interests of the Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that the elementary principles of journalistic ethics would have led Mr Miller to approach me for comment. He made no such contact and when I rang the ABC to claim the right of reply I was told that Mr Miller had knocked off but I could ring him back tomorrow if I chose. The Minister was forced to concede that the Natsemi project was not going ahead but by saying it is simply deferred he lets himself down lightly. It is dead. Actually it was never a goer and if it was not for the extreme gullibility of the Minister-no one else ever believed it was a goer; the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation always disregarded it; the Department of the Treasury always regarded it as absurd and it certainly was not possible to find anyone who publicly or privately was prepared to say explicitly that is was priority No. 1 as to what anyone would do in the area of microelectronics. </PARA>

<PARA> This emphasis on componentry would have committed Australia to only a part technology-and we would have no control over the end product. </PARA>
<PARA> Natsemi is already under serious threat at home in the US. Japan is gaining a much larger share of the world's chip market. Many of Natsemi's key personnel have left for other companies. The Pentagon has 'de-certified' some of Natsemi's circuitry because the Defense Department was dissatisfied with its performance. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote from a paper called The Relevance of Silicon Valley to Australia by Stuart Macdonald of the Department of Economics, University of Queensland. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory has, however, been exuberant in pointing out the advantages to Canberra of acquiring National Semiconductor. According to the Minister, the plant will employ directly between 1200 and 1500 people-though the domestic employment of the whole American semiconductor industry was less than 90,000 in 1978-and will 'lead to the establishment in this country, without any shadow of a doubt, of an applications industry with a capacity to employ in excess of 100,000 people at the end of the decade.'</PARA>
<PARA>He is no piker, this Minister. He says that in little old Canberra you will have an industry that is bigger than the biggest industry in California. Mr Macdonald went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> That is quite remarkable in the light of the estimation by the Minister for Science and Technology that the many hundreds of millions of dollars so far spent on research and development projects aided under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme will yield only a paltry 29,000 new jobs by the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The hypocrisy of this Minister was shown in a speech that he gave when he introduced a symposium on Starlab at the end of last year. He could not have expressed more enthusiasm for the Starlab project. What he failed to point out in his speech, and the only thing he did not say, was that the Government had declined to provide a single dollar, a single cent for it. That was the one thing he left out in his speech. With $19m of assets one could set up in Canberra a scientific instrumentation facility that would be equal to anything in the world; far more labour intensive. But he is not doing that. This is a case where 'the mouth from the south' is only concerned with grabbing headlines and does not understand the issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House a serious anomaly in the operation of tariff policies that has severely affected from 1 January 1982 the operations of, and jobs provided by, a small business whose directors live in my electorate. It is, I fear, a representative case and it is alarming to find that business people, who are prepared to make their living and create jobs for others through the discipline and opportunities of free enterprise, suddenly find their enterprise threatened not by market forces but by a government decision which is against the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission and is wholly unrelated to the facts of the situation. It is a mixture of protectionism gone mad and of the bureaucratic fetish of uniformity for its own sake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Albart Trading Company, whose premises are situated in Alexandria, employs seven people whose jobs are now at risk. This may seem, I say, a small affair but it is, I fear, representative. The company, as one of its major lines, retails imported American pantyhose. In fact, what the company deals in is support pantyhose, a special item sometimes medically necessary to aid circulation for women such as those who stand all day, pregnant women and so on. The Albart Trading Company's only competitor which manufactures this item locally is Courtaulds Hilton Pty Ltd. This latter company under the tariff arrangement formerly existing has retailed its support panty hose at $6.75 a pair; Albart has had to pay a tariff of 30 per cent on its product, which last year retailed at $9.85 a pair. In other words there was ample opportunity afforded to the local product as against Albart under these tariff arrangements. This interpretation has been supported by the IAC reports of 1978 and 1980. The result was that the IAC recommended a tariff rise of only 5 per cent to take effect from 1 January 1982. Despite this, the Government, overruling the IAC, decided to raise the tariff in question by 20 per cent, and as from 1 January 1982 it has therefore been a full 50 per cent. This new tariff will have the most serious consequences for Albart as 60 per cent of the company's total hosiery imports consist of this item. The tariff increase will make the item unmarketable and I am informed that the result of this will be that the company' s other operations will be drastically affected to the extent that the company may find it impossible to carry on trading at all and a small business will have gone to the wall with the loss of seven jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Two reasons have been given for this sudden change in tariffs. One is that the increase has been necessary to bring about uniformity in the application of tariff measures in this area. It is hard, however, to understand why this item in which Albart Trading has dealt, with no disruption to the market afforded to local producers, should suddenly be lumped together with other items with no regard to the facts of the case being apparent but merely for the fetish of uniformity. The second reason for rejecting the IAC recommendation is that the tariff increases were necessary to preserve jobs; it is hard so see what jobs will be lost by continuing to protect the already highly protected domestic producer while to introduce the proposed new tariff rise will very possibly lead to the definite loss of seven jobs provided by the importer. I must also point out that the domestic producer, so favoured, is an international concern with its base in London. Yet in order to continue protecting this firm without any increase in the number of Australians it employs, it is proposed to harass, if not close down, an Australian firm. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to believe that putting Albart out of business, as these measures threaten to do, will aid employment. It will certainly not reduce inflation. I strongly claim that this is a very serious oversight, perpetrated perhaps because of bureaucratic generalist desire for mythical consistency. Those responsible should look at the individual facts, human as well as economic, in this matter. I commend this matter to the attention of both the House and the Government. </PARA>

<PARA> No part of the peacekeeping force-including the United States component-should have any association with the United States Rapid Deployment Force. </PARA>
<PARA>About that same time I pointed out to the Prime Minister that there had been widespread reports in the United States, some of which had been picked up here, that units or specifically one battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division were going to be used as the American component to the Sinai peacekeeping force. The 82nd Airborne Division is well known in defence circles as one of the two designated for the Rapid Deployment Force, the other being the 101st Airborne Division. The Prime Minister came down on me from a very great height when I raised this matter in the Parliament, starting, as I remember his answer, with a discussion on socialist republicans and moving on further afield. But he did have the decency to say in the course of his reply:</PARA>
<PARA> The condition that we attached in relation to the multinational peacekeeping force and the United States involvement in it relates to the time when any particular United States unit is allocated to that force. </PARA>
<PARA>I did point out to him at that time that the 82nd Airborne battalion would be the battalion designated and I asked what did he intend to do about it. The implication in his answer was, absolutely nothing. We now find, four or five months later, that when the report emerges again-old news getting recirculated but this time seriously because it is now quite clearly the unit that will be designated-the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) has asked for urgent details from Australia's Embassy in Washington. What has this Government been doing for the last four months? Does this country run an independent foreign policy or does it not? Is it serious when it says to the United States that it is going to commit itself to an American operation under strict conditions-that as a mature nation it will follow through those conditions, have its views considered and will insist upon those views being considered-when we discover that after he has been alerted to it from albeit public sources what he ought to have had privately for four months the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) is obliged to ask for urgent details on the matter? That really is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> We are making a commitment which has notably elevated our diplomatic posture in the Middle East and has exposed us to far closer scrutiny from both the Camp David powers and the other powers in the area which are now watching our performance and particularly the view that we have been putting to them that we are capable of operating independently of the United States, that we are capable of having our own view on how this peacekeeping force will be used, that we are mindful of our own particular interests in the Middle East. Yet we are now demonstrating to them that we are going to go along with and have done absolutely nothing about giving warning of a designation of a particular unit which is associated with a force that is particularly feared among many friendly Arab States. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned in this House before, I was recently a member of a parliamentary delegation to the area. In Saudi Arabia and in the United Arab Emirates-two very friendly powers with this country-we found very considerable concern about the rapid deployment force. I think we owe it to those countries with whom we have good relations at least to view seriously a move into an association with that force even if that battalion from the rapid deployment force is not going to be considered with the rapid deployment force when it is in the Sinai Peacekeeping Force. We could have pressed the Americans back in October to take one of their battalions out of one of their units in Europe. It would have had no association with the force and would have performed exactly the same purpose in the Sinai. We did not do it. I think it is the measure of our immaturity that we did not do it. It is only one of the many aspects of the Government's conduct on the question of the Sinai Peacekeeping Force that is to be deprecated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to correct some false impressions created by two totally inaccurate Press reports about a meeting in the Government party room yesterday relating to discussions of the possible purchase of HMS Invincible as a replacement for HMAS Melbourne. The problem is a very simple one. Reports on the ABC 6 o'clock news last night and in the Australian newspaper this morning totally misrepresented what happened in the party room and both fly in the face of the briefing, which was a factual one given by the appropriate Minister at the end of that party room meeting, to the Press. I cannot understand on what basis these two reports would have been prepared. I have tried to contact both the journalists involved and neither has phoned me back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem seems to me to fit into a very serious political context because there is no doubt that the Labor Party, for example, has been running a strong campaign against HMS Invincible denigrating that ship which has performed so outstandingly well in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation excercises in conjunction with our potential allies in the Pacific. it has performed extraordinarily well in NATO exercises in the Atlantic showing its capacity to be effective in that context. It is notable that the Americans have since underlined the point that it would be useful if Australia were to purchase an aircraft carrier. The total misrepresentation in both these reports lies in the allegation that the Government has had to delay further its decision to purchase Invincible because of back bench pressure. The ABC news item said that the back bench had forced the Government to defer its decision on purchase. The Australian article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has further delayed a decision on the purchase of the aircraft carrier HMS Invicible in the face of increasing doubts among back bench MPs . . . </PARA>

<PARA> In the few minutes that I have to speak I want to raise a matter which is of extreme concern to me. On a couple of occasions this House has descended into serious uproar as a result of, I think, a continuing abuse of the procedures of questions and answers during Question Time in this House. I do not want to comment on the rights or wrongs of the actions of any individual persons in this context, but I do want to comment on what I consider to be the most pious and dishonest nonsense that I have ever seen coming from individuals inside or outside this place; in this case I speak of outside this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday and again today Government Ministers, including the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) complained about disorderly conduct in the House and its reflection on the Parliament as an institution. It would be a legitimate complaint if the persons concerned had ever shown any respect for the institution and had been prepared to conduct themselves in a manner that their office suggests they ought to conduct themselves. I was a member of this House in 1975; so were some other honourable members here today. Some of the short memory television journalists we hear conducting interviews today were also in the gallery. The then Opposition engaged in the most disorderly, disruptive and contemptuous behaviour that has occurred in this Parliament. It was led by the present Prime Minister and the present Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair). When they make pious statements about order in the Parliament, they might look at their own records. If they are upset or they cannot cop it now, they should see who the culprits are. </PARA>

I regret that I cannot make the same comment about the contributions made by honourable members from the Opposition, some of whom I believe did less than justice to themselves, their constituencies or, indeed, their causes, by what they said. I shall refer to but two of the contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) devoted the entirety of her speech to a decision announced in the media that $1.4m of Commissioner for Housing home loan funds had been frozen. Had she made her speech yesterday, it would have been spot on. I am rather surprised that the honourable member is unaware that today a decision was made by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) and an announcement was made by me that the $1.4m in frozen funds had been released. I say that because Senator Margaret Reid, Mrs Grant, M. H.A., Mr Leedman, M.H.A., Mr Cornwell, M.H.A. and Mr Webb, M.H.A., all elected Liberal members in the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, not only made the strongest representations about what the situation would be if that money were not released but also were amongst the first to congratulate me and the Government when the announcement was made that the frozen funds had been released. Yet, at approximately 10 o'clock tonight, the honourable member for Canberra was not even aware that the money was back in circulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I come to the contribution by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who is the Opposition's official spokesman on science. In the horrible event of a Labor government coming to power, that man, the honourable member for Lalor, would be Minister for Science. He, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, has been one of the most constant critics of a plan to bring to Australia and specifically to Canberra a $100m microelectronics industry. I have never in my life heard as much clap trap, rubbish and utter nonsense from any member of the Federal Parliament in the past 12 months as I have heard in the invective, the absolute hatred and the determination to destroy this project by the honourable member for Lalor on behalf of the Labor Party.

The figure of 1,200 jobs was the figure given by the Managing Director of the National Semi Conductor Corporation in Australia, Mr Jack Rutherford, in a Press statement issued at the Press conference held at the National Press Club following Cabinet 's decision to enter into negotiations. When the honourable member challenges that figure, he is not challenging what I said but what the Corporation has said . The figure of 100,000 jobs for an Australian applications industry comes from Sir Laurence Muir. He must be an absolute nit wit and the honourable member for Lalor a genius! Sir Laurence is a member of the board of Australian Consolidated Industries Ltd and a member of the board of General Motors-Holden's Ltd. He is probably one of the top 10 businessmen in Australia. He says-it is a matter of record-that 100,000 jobs is the capacity of an applications industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. It is to be noted, however, that on 19 November 1981, in testimony before the Sub-Committee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Government Processes of the United States Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr James Malone (Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs) stated that the United States Administration has 'made no decision on the feasibility or desirability of using plutonium from such fuel for military purposes; nor are any recommendations for decision pending before us'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government considers that it is important to maintain a clear distinction between the peaceful and military uses of nuclear energy in the interests of upholding the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. It has expressed to the United States Administration its concern about any possibility of plutonium separated from spent nuclear fuel from civil nuclear power stations being used for nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. All uranium supplied to the United States by Australia under the Agreement Between Australia and the United States of America Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, signed on 5 July, 1979, is subject to a peaceful, non- explosive use pledge.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 November 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to the development in the United States of America of high powered lasers which promise to be capable of producing highly refined bomb grade plutonium from the plutonium extracted from civilian nuclear power stations operated in an ordinary fashion.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has the Government investigated the possible implications of this technology for nuclear weapons proliferation and existing nuclear safeguards; if so, what were the results of these investigations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Has the Australian Government expressed any attitude about the further development of this technology to the United States of America or within the forums of the International Atomic Energy Agency; if so, what attitude has been expressed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr Street</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. In testimony on 18 November 1981 to the Sub-Committee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation, and Government Processes of the United States Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Dr F. Charles Gilbert (Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Materials, Defence Programmes, U.S. Department of Energy) also stated that: 'At this time, plutonium isotope separation technology has not been demonstrated on a practical scale'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As part of its continuing assessment of non-proliferation and nuclear safeguards issues, the Government has been closely monitoring reports of this development and its possible application to the production of weapons-grade plutonium from plutonium extracted from spent fuel from civil nuclear power stations and will continue to monitor this subject. As noted above, laser isotope separation technology for plutonium is understood to be still in the early stages of development. The Government is aware that laser isotope separation technology is sensitive from the non-proliferation point of view, as stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1979 (Hansard, 22 November 1979, page 3527). During consultations on nuclear issues held in Washington in July 1981, Australian officials advised their United States counterparts during a discussion on international nuclear export controls that Australia would favour laser isotope separation facilities for uranium being specifically added to the international lists of items that should be covered by IAEA safeguards if transferred to a non-nuclear-weapon state (IAEA documents INFCIRC/209 and INFCIRC/254).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has expressed to the United States Administration its concern about any possibility of plutonium separated from spent nuclear fuel from civil nuclear power stations being used for nuclear weapons. As the reports concerned the development of laser isotope separation technology for plutonium in the United States, it was considered that Australia's concerns should at this stage be taken up directly with the United States, rather than within the forums of the International Atomic Energy Agency. As noted in the reply to (2), Australia has expressed the view to the United States that laser isotope separation facilities for uranium should be specifically added to the international lists of items that should be covered by IAEA safeguards if transferred to a non-nuclear-weapon state. The Government is maintaining a close watch on all aspects of the matter including the question of whether and, if so at what stage, it would be appropriate to express Australia's attitude within the forums of the IAEA.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes: following a review of the Divisions of Land Resources Management and Land Use Research and the holding of an Executive seminar on Water Research in June, 1981 CSIRO undertook an internal examination of priorities for water research and of organisational arrangements to facilitate the conduct of research in identified high priority areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The investigation was undertaken in two parts. A Working Committee representing CSIRO Divisions with major water research responsibilities prepared a report in October 1981 which identified water research opportunities and needs . This report formed the basis for the CSIRO submission in November 1981 to the Review of Water Research in Australia being conducted by a working group under the Australian Water Resources Council and is available on request to interested groups and individuals. Subsequently three priority areas for expansion of CSIRO 's water research were identified, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> catchment hydrology,</PARA>
<PARA> salinity and other water quality aspects, and</PARA>
<PARA> groundwater.</PARA>
<PARA> Most recently, in February 1982, decisions were taken on organisational arrangements to facilitate the conduct of research in these priority areas. The final report on the CSIRO investigation is now being prepared and will shortly be made available.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) See (2) above. Some aspects of the proposed CSIRO re-organisation of its water research are dependent on the outcome of proposals that I and the Minister for National Development and Energy are currently discussing.</PARA>
