I ask the Minister: Will he advise the House what action our Embassy in Manila has been able to take to protect Father Gore from attacks and accusations by this regime? Will he ensure that Father Gore is given continuous help, advice and legal protection by our diplomats in the Philippines?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been reports in the media claiming that the Government of the Philippines will soon file murder charges against both Father Gore and an Irish priest allegedly for having ordered the killing of a local town mayor. At present Father Gore is on bail in his own parish in Oringao facing charges relating to the possession of explosives and inciting to rebellion. The Philippines authorities have yet to confirm or deny the accuracy of these reports. We have indicated to the Philippines Ambassador, the embassy in Canberra and the authorities in Manila that we have, of course, legitimate consular interests on behalf of Father Gore for his protection and welfare as an Australian citizen. We have asked to be kept fully informed of all developments. The Department of Foreign Affairs has been in constant touch with Father Gore's parents since the first events of the case. I am happy to inform the House that an embassy official will leave Manila today to attend the court hearing which is scheduled for tomorrow in Kabankalan and to ensure that Father Gore's interests as an Australian citizen are fully protected.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that honourable members will recall the circumstances which led to the closure of our Embassy in Beirut in June this year. Violence in the city, including attacks on diplomatic missions and then the military advance by Israel stopped the small Australian resident mission from doing its job effectively. Its functions were, therefore, transferred to Damascus where the Ambassadors to Syria and the Lebanon remained in residence where they could operate most effectively. Since then the Ambassador, the Charge d'Affaires of the Beirut embassy and several other staff members from the Damascus embassy have made regular visits to Beirut to assess the general political and security situation, to oversee Australian property and to maintain contact with our locally engaged staff in Beirut. I have been encouraged by the fact that the Lebanese Government has made considerable progress in restoring law and order. The Australian Charge d'Affaires was able to return to Beirut on 20 October. Having received his report, I am happy to be able to inform the Parliament that the Australian embassy in Beirut will be resuming operations this week.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Acting Prime Minister seen the statement by the outgoing Liberal Premier of South Australia that unemployment was the chief cause of his defeat and that the election result was 'a very salutary lesson for Mr Fraser'? In view of this statement does the Acting Prime Minister still maintain that the election was fought on State issues and had little to do with Federal politics?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There seem to be a lot of statements about the South Australian election. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party tries very hard to claim the result as a major victory. I think it is a pyrrhic victory. The Labor Party has not even got a majority yet; it seems that it will be governing with a minority. One can hardly claim that as a great victory. The facts are that the South Australian election-I think the honourable member for Wills made the statement- was fought on South Australian issues. The election certainly had nothing to do with Federal issues. Even if it did concern Federal issues, the result is not very convincing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really would not want to waste my time by talking about the uranium issue to the Australian Labor Party. One finds it very hard to get a convincing point of view out of the Labor Party on whether it wants uranium development or whether it does not. The South Australian Government has not made up its mind about uranium enrichment. Although it did make a rather qualified statement that it would allow uranium development to proceed in South Australia, particularly at Roxby Downs, it has reserved its position on uranium enrichment. If the South Australian Government wants to disqualify South Australian sites from consideration by the UEGA study group which is now doing a commercial evaluation it can. If it does disqualify South Australia, the only other site that looks likely is in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have, of course, seen the statement referred to by the honourable member. The Acting Prime Minister was referring to the package of proposals which have been pursued since the Prime Minister put down a program for international co-operation in the whole field of trade. There was nothing new in what was put down. The underlying factor is that we-the Prime Minister, the Acting Prime Minister and others-have said at all times that in no way would Australia act unilaterally. What we are seeking to get, in concert with our trading partners, is a more liberal trading world. But we are not going to oversee the demise of Australian industry by acting on our own.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2843" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENNELONG" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform the honourable member for Barton that the progress the Government has made so far this financial year with the sale of government securities not only has been highly satisfactory but also has produced a number of quite different patterns from what has prevailed in earlier years. So far this financial year we have succeeded in selling about $2,677m worth of government securities to the public. In the same period in 1980-81 we had sold only $597m. There has been a particularly strong take-up by the non-bank public where the sales have been $1,825m compared with only $218m in the same period last year. We are well on the way to achieving the monetary projection that was set out in the Budget Speech, and that remains a very important element of the Government's overall economic policy. Success in controlling the rate of growth in the money supply remains the single most important element so far as our anti -inflationary strategy is concerned. It is interesting to note that so far this year sales of Australian savings bonds, which are particularly welcome in a monetary control sense because they go exclusively to the non-bank public, have been much stronger than in earlier years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other two points that need to be made are firstly that the new tender system for the sale of Commonwealth bonds is infinitely superior to the systems which it replaced and secondly that there has been a very heavy investment by Japanese institutions into Australian bonds and semi-government securities. That has also played a very major role in the take-up of government securities which occurred during the September quarter of this financial year. As honourable gentlemen will know, the September quarter of a financial year is normally the time at which sales of government securities and inflow of private capital are weaker. This year the reverse has proved to be the case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Health to his reply to my question on 28 October when he said that I do my sums carefully, that I was being unkind about Medibank and that he saw some encouraging movement. When the Minister looked at the 1981-82 annual report of Medibank Private was he given explanatory notes which explain that the so-called encouraging movement amounted to Medibank being insolvent or, in other words, an undeclared bankrupt in South Australia as at 30 June 1982 and being almost insolvent or similarly bankrupt in New South Wales and Western Australia? Now that the Minister has had more time to examine the report can he tell people who are members of the fund that financially it is either dead or dangerously ill in some States and outside Victoria has not the reserve requirements to meet an epidemic of even minor proportions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2843" SPEAKER="Carlton The Hon J.J." NAMEID="DF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="MACKELLAR" MINISTERIAL="HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly examined very carefully the report on the Health Insurance Commission before presenting it to the Parliament. I acknowledged to the honourable member for Fadden that the remarks he made on an earlier occasion were factually correct. However, I did say on that occasion that I thought he was being a little unkind to the Commission and the management of Medibank Private because they had taken a number of steps which had improved the financial position of Medibank over the year in question. This is certainly true . I am fully aware that the levels of reserves in some of the States are not equal to those that occur in most of the private funds at this time. I have also visited the South Australian office and spent some two or three hours discussing with the management the precise situation in that State. I am confident that the management is of high quality. It is my concern to look at ways and means by which this government-run body, which has high levels of costs compared with private enterprise insurance funds, can compete adequately in the market place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have indicated that I have under way on this matter a study which is looking in great detail at the structure of the HIC. But I would merely emphasise that any government body which is forced, under the rules to operate according to public sector guidelines, to pay public sector superannuation rates and to follow public sector industrial relations practices will not be able to compete adequately with private enterprise without some special support. My objective, on behalf of the contributors, on behalf of the staff of Medibank Private, for whom I have a particular responsibility, and on behalf of the Commission and the management which have been doing a good job in improving the situation of Medibank Private, is to come forward with proposals to address these very real issues. But I point out to the House that it should take this matter as a good example of the need to be wary of any further encroachments by the Government on private sector activity. The policy of the Australian Labor Party in this regard is to transfer all of this activity into the public sector, necessarily at higher cost to contributors and taxpayers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address a question to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer agree that , in these difficult economic times, it is in the national interest that the Parliament have access to the broadest possible range of information, especially information of a statistical nature and information that might be characterised as official forecasts? If he agrees, could he inform the House why statement No. 2 of the Budget Papers did not contain certain important information this year on such matters as Department of the Treasury forecasts on work force growth and on the unemployment outlook, as it has in the past? Is it correct that the only information on this sensitive subject of employment published in statement No. 2 was the figure for average numbers of recipients of unemployment benefit, a figure demonstrated on Budget night by my colleague, the shadow Minister for employment, to be patently incorrect? Why were more important forecasts such as the expected rate of growth in employment not in the statement? Is it correct that statement No. 2 presented to Parliament does not represent the full and considered view of the Treasury Department but is, in fact, an edited version of its submission, the editing having been undertaken by a member of the Treasurer' s political staff, Professor John Hewson? Will the Treasurer, in the interests of informed national debate on the real state of the economy, table the original unedited Treasury Department draft of statement No. 2?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose the first observation I should make about that question is that apparently the Opposition wants to have it both ways. A few weeks ago when the honourable member for Wills was trying to embarrass me on the subject of employment forecasts, by quoting some thoroughly innocent and innocuous remarks made by the head of the Treasury to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure a few months ago, he tried to establish that all of the documents presented to the Parliament, including statement No. 2, are not in fact Treasury documents but are in fact the documents of the Minister and of the Government. Now, by implication, the honourable member for Blaxland is trying to call me to task simply because-and I quite freely admit this-I go over statement No. 2. I do not uncritically accept Budget statements that are presented to me by my Department. I think I would be failing in my job if I did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me also make it quite clear to the honourable member for Blaxland that I will examine statement No. 2 for this year's Budget, particularly in relation to forecasts regarding employment and unemployment levels, to see to what extent the practice adopted on this occasion differed, as alleged by the honourable member for Blaxland, from the practice adopted on earlier occasions. I would certainly agree with the honourable member for Blaxland that, at all times and not only at a time of economic difficulty, it is important that the Parliament have in its possession and be provided with as much statistical information as is possible. I think it is also important, out of fairness to the people in the Treasury Department and other departments who prepare this information, to recognise that the information is in reality not always in the nature of forecasts but is the best projection that departments and officials can provide to the Government at any given time. Quite often some of the projections that are provided in good faith by departments lead, because of changed circumstances , to their being unfairly accused and to the Government's being unfairly accused of misrepresenting the position. I will examine what the honourable member has said and I will see to what extent statement No. 2 on this occasion differed from statement No. 2 on earlier occasions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members know, negotiations have been going on since 1980 for closer economic relations between Australia and New Zealand. In June this year a draft report was released to this Parliament and to industry for consideration. The reaction of Australian industry to that draft report was that in principle it believed in the idea but there needed to be some further modifications. As directed by the Government, I had further discussions with the New Zealand Government the week before last and concessions were made on two items of irritation to Australian industry, particularly manufacturing industry. These were the rate of entry into the New Zealand market, including the way in which New Zealand gave access with its import licensing system, and the elimination of export incentives. In both of these areas considerable additional progress was made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those proposals were then presented to both governments. The New Zealand Government has now accepted the package and this morning my Government looked at the proposals and accepted them. There will be an announcement made tomorrow in the Parliament spelling the proposals out in more detail. This is a most historic occasion: We are now witnessing the gradual, predictable and programmed freeing of trade between our two countries over a period of years. We want to see a minimum of disruption to industries on both sides. I believe the majority of Australian and New Zealand people believe it is in the long term interests of both countries to have maximum commerce between our two countries so that we can capitalise on the resources of both.</PARA>

Why has the Government not yet referred to the Temporary Assistance Authority a reference for an inquiry into the level of assistance to John Lysaght (Aust.)

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last week or so requests have been received from John Lysaght. This means, of course, that the normal practice is being followed; namely, questionnaires have been sent to the company and we have asked it to complete those questionnaires expeditiously. Other elements of the industry have to be advised. Their responses will be evaluated and I will then consider whether a request to refer the matter to the Temporary Assistance Authority should be granted. It will be recalled that, because the industry was in difficulty some months ago, the Government referred matters to the TAA. The Authority found that increased imports were not the major contributing factor to the difficulties being experienced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is happening in Australia is not unique to Australia. There are major retrenchments and plant closures in many countries. Despite the fact that the TAA reached this finding, the Government felt that the industry could be vulnerable to further increases in imports and so it imposed, as will be recalled by the honourable member, tariff quotas with 150 per cent duty on any increase over the 1981-82 levels. The Government had to consider the effect of increased protection for steel on downstream industries. To accept the proposition that the decision was irresponsible is not to take account of the findings of the TAA itself. Whilst the immediate situation referred to by the honourable member is of very great concern, it is of particular concern and even greater importance to create circumstances conducive to sound long term development. The Government naturally is giving careful consideration to what should be done in this respect. We will have the Industries Assistance Commission report and the views of the newly formed Steel Industry Advisory Council. I reiterate: I am awaiting the responses to the questionnaire and awaiting the reactions to other elements of the industry before I make the decision of whether or not to make a reference.</PARA>

The Press reports seemed to indicate that the Premier of Queensland had taken the initiative in getting the meeting to agree to declare the remaining sections of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park-that is the far northern section, the Whitsunday area and the Townsville area-as a matter of urgency. That is not quite the truth because the initiatives came from the Commonwealth Government. Firstly, a vastly increased amount of money was allocated in the Budget. Secondly, we took the initiative at the ministerial council meeting in May to ensure that the remaining areas were declared as soon as possible. In September, my colleague the Minister for Science and Technology , in my absence, tabled in this Parliament the results of the communique of that meeting and indicated that we would be pursuing as a matter of urgency the declaration of the remaining areas. So to sum up, the truth of the matter is that the remaining areas of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park will be declared together as a matter of urgency due to the initiative of the Commonwealth Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We put to the ministerial council meeting last Friday our plans as to how and when the declaration should be made. I think that my colleague the Minister for Science and Technology, as a result of excellent advocacy, persuaded the Queensland Premier and the Queensland Minister to accept our proposals to accelerate the program, so much so that the meeting agreed as a matter of urgency to have the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority come up with a proposition for our next meeting in March of next year wherein the boundaries for the areas will be specified taking into account the sensitivity of certain reefs, particularly in the far northern area, and also taking into account, as was done in the declaration of the Cairns and Cormorant Park sections, the need to ensure that the cities of Townsville and Mackay are not unduly discriminated against in regard to areas which contain no reef and which are required by local people for shipping and recreational purposes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Defence, follows a question asked by the honourable member for Canning a couple of weeks ago in respect of when a ship would be home ported at Cockburn Sound, to which the Minister replied that he was looking at speeding it up. I also refer to statements the Minister made recently at a seminar in Western Australia that this matter was still being looked at, although it looked more difficult. Is the Minister aware that of the combat vessels of the Royal Australian Navy there are 12 destroyers, 6 submarines and 14 patrol boats home ported on the east coast compared with one patrol boat in Western Australia? Is the Minister aware that in the 1977 election campaign his Government promised that two destroyers and two submarines would be home ported in Cockburn Sound by 1980? Will the Minister now guarantee that next year a destroyer will be home ported in Western Australia? Will he also give an assurance that the originally intended deployment will be incorporated within the current five-year rolling program? If not, will he undertake to make a detailed statement to the House on the reasons for the failure to implement past promises on this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted with this new-found interest in defence that the Opposition seems to have now. I have had a question today on defence and a matter of public importance concerning defence is listed. Things must have been a bit quiet in the echelons in the Labor Caucus this week. I am delighted too that the honourable gentleman read the remarks I made at Port Hedland. Had he done so with a little more precision than seems apparent he would have realised that in 1983 a significant number of Royal Australian Navy vessels not only will be operating in and around HMAS Stirling but also will call at a number of ports in Western Australia. A number of exercises will be run throughout the year. The point is-Mr Speaker, you as a Western Australian would know this-that over in Western Australia there is a very real interest in defence issues, and the Government has been giving attention to the way by which we can show our presence there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Learmonth will be completed this year as an Air Force base. Indeed, only a few weeks ago there was a very worthwhile deployment of Mirage aircraft to that base to test the extent to which the facilities were adequate for the purpose. This year we are commencing work on the construction of Derby Airfield. In the general discussion at Port Hedland there was quite apparently a concern to know that adequate emphasis was being placed on the presence of all the units of the three Services and personnel in the west and in the north of Australia. With respect to home porting, as I responded a few weeks ago to the honourable member for Canning, the intention of this Government is to home port there additional Royal Australian Navy vessels as soon as adequate residential facilities for the naval personnel concerned are available. My advice is that probably that will be towards the end of next year. The important part of the whole subject is not just their being home ported there but their operating out of Western Australian ports. Indeed, in 1983 they will be doing that very extensively.</PARA>

The Victorian Government has what it calls a drought committee that is supposed to be reviewing this matter from time to time, month to month or whatever. Regrettably, when the matter has been before that drought committee either a majority has not recommended acceptance or the Government has not taken up the issue seriously. As I understand it, the Victorian farmers and graziers certainly want it and their organisation is seeking it. The fact is that the Premier of Victoria and his Government have stubbornly refused to introduce it. Therefore this has caused some difficulty for the farmers and graziers involved and sheep are being slaughtered without the benefit of the assistance that the Commonwealth generously offered as part of a total package to assist in ameliorating effects of this drought.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is the Minister aware of plans conveyed to employees of the International Harvester company to the effect that they can expect their employment to terminate totally within the next six months, meaning a loss of a current 680 jobs in Geelong and a total loss of job opportunities in excess of 2,400, which is the normal employment factor of that company?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member, as he has indicated, is aware of the response that I felt bound to make to him in view of the representations he had made in regard to International Harvester Australia Ltd's difficulty. The Government is well aware of International Harvester's significant position in both the truck and agricultural equipment industries and its importance as a major employer in both Geelong and Dandenong. The present difficulties of International Harvester arise from a number of factors, including the situation of the parent company overseas, severe competition on the Australian market, lack of competitiveness and, frankly, reduced sales of agricultural equipment because of the drought. As a result the company is heavily in debt, is carrying a high interest burden and is in need of an injection of further funds to enable it to carry on. Although the honourable member assumes that all will be laid off, and bearing in mind the judgment of Mr Justice Beach, we still have the reality that a petition to the Victorian Supreme Court calling for the winding up of International Harvester is described by the receivers as a protective device not affecting the company's desire to restructure its operations to enable continued trading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage I have nothing further to add in response to the representations that the honourable member made. For those who have indicated that the Government has not been prepared to assist International Harvester in the past, I remind honourable members that the company itself received $2.8m under the agricultural tractors bounty scheme and $2.2m under bounty arrange- ments applying to components for heavy commercial vehicles in 1980-81-a total of $5m from this Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Budget Speech, as the Leader of the Opposition correctly recalls, there was a reference to the possible release of one per cent of the statutory reserve deposit being held by the Reserve Bank. If the honourable gentleman studies the Budget Speech carefully he will observe that the reference was couched in the nature of a statement of intention on the part of the Government to request the Reserve Bank to release the statutory reserve deposit. The honourable gentleman will be aware from his own experience that the question of the level of the SRD and the use of the SRD instrument is primarily a matter for the jurisdiction of the Reserve Bank of Australia, although, as he correctly pointed out, there are provisions in the Banking Act to resolve differences of opinion that might arise between the Government and the Reserve Bank in respect of any matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are only two things that I can further tell the honourable gentleman at this stage. Firstly, this matter has been subject to a number of discussions between the Governor of the Reserve bank and me. Secondly, I inform the honourable gentleman, because this aspect is relevant to the issue, that, as a result of the measures that were put in place in the statement that I made to the House on 18 March, the volume of money being made available for housing by the banks in particular has increased significantly over the past few months. In a number of cases there are examples of banks finding that the number of applicants for housing loans is not as great as will be required to meet the targets which are implicit for those individual banks in the additional commitment of some $400m which was made to the Government at the time of that statement of 18 March.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent discussions with representatives of the Japanese East Asia Shipping Conferences, Ministers, including the Minister for Trade and Resources, indicated that the issue of competition to conferences and the possible effects of that competition were matters that properly should be handled in the commercial negotiations between the shipowners and the shippers. The Ministers also indicated to Conference representatives that the Government would be concerned if non-commercial, state-owned competition from the Soviet FESCO Line, for instance, created disruption in the organised Conference shipping services that have served the Australian export industry very satisfactorily over a period of years. In expressing these views the Ministers were mindful of advice by shippers and shipowner representatives that the existing legislative framework of Part X of the Trade Practices Act continues to be appropriate. They did not seek any amendment of the existing legislation, which does provide for the interests of the shippers and the Conference lines by providing facility for the export of Australian goods. But I understand that the Conference lines and FESCO have made arrangements to have discussions in Japan about this matter. It should be noted that the main effect of competition is on the southbound trade to Australia rather than the northbound trade. The Government would not wish to be drawn into the issue unless there was a real threat to the organised shipping services that have served Australian trade extremely well. I hope that the discussions that will take place in Japan between the Conference lines and FESCO will result in a sensible agreement being reached in respect of orderly shipping both to and from Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Brisbane Telegraph of 28 October and in last Sunday's National Times there was a suggestion that I had apparently prepared a list-in one case a hit list-of schools which would be denied funding under the Australian Labor Party's education policy. I want to say that this is a misrepresentation. There exists no list of non-government schools which would lose Commonwealth funding under the ALP's policy. As will be revealed on Sunday, the overwhelming majority of the 2,000 non-government schools which still operate below acceptable standards will, in fact, be eligible for additional funds. As for those schools which may be excluded from eligibility for funding, it will be a matter of choice for those schools to decide whether they want to continue to operate at a level which would not justify continued public subsidy. There have been reported remarks also on behalf of the Catholic Parents and Friends Association in Sydney. I want to assure the Association that no school in the Catholic system will receive less funds than it does now and most will be eligible for more.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Justice Woodward, in his 'Further Report of the Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking', recommended that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The evidence concerning Harry Wainwright, Nugan Hand Limited and its associated companies, and the affairs of Murray Stewart Riley (and in particular his associates as revealed in evidence) be referred to appropriate law enforcement bodies for further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) proposed to the Premier of New South Wales that the terms of reference of the Comonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking be varied to enable it to investigate these matters. The Premier agreed to this course. He noted that that investigation should not conflict with the work of the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission and welcomed the Commonwealth's offer to provide any assistance to the Corporate Affairs Commission in its investigation of Nugan Hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Task Force reported in January 1982 on the activities of Harry Wainwright and Murray Stewart Riley and their known financial dealings with the Nugan Hand group of companies. The Joint Task Force recommended, and both governments accepted, that that report should not be made public. All recommendations in that report have been accepted and put into effect by governments. Because of their nature, some of these actions must remain confidential. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Task Force recommended that the report on Nugan Hand be tabled with certain specified deletions. Views on those deletions have been obtained from Mr Justice Stewart, the Federal-State Royal Commissioner inquiring into drug trafficking, and the Attorney-General of New South Wales in the context of the Corporate Affairs Commission inquiry. Neither Mr Justice Stewart nor Mr Walker had objections to the tabling of the version recommended by the Joint Task Force . Because of the references to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and intelligence agencies the views of the Director-General of security were also sought. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> After careful consideration of the (report), including the references to this Organisation, I believe that from Australia's national security point of view there need be no impediment to the public release of the (report), even in the full, confidential version. </PARA>
<PARA> After careful review, and consultation with New South Wales on the Commonwealth 's suggestions for reinstatement of deleted material, a further version of the report has been produced with fewer deletions than recommended by the Joint Task Force. That version is being tabled today. Some material has still had to be withheld to avoid compromising criminal investigations or prosecutions, to protect the privacy of individuals against whom unsubstantiated allegations have been made, and to keep confidential the methodology of investigations. Nothing has been withheld on national security grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> The activities of Nugan Hand have been a matter of considerable public speculation. There have been allegations of drug running, arms dealing, and involvement of intelligence agencies. The report will help to shed light on these allegations and to dispel some of the speculation. More work remains to be done by the Joint Task Force, particularly into the involvement of retired United States military and government officials in Nugan Hand from 1977 to 1980. In this regard, following approval by the two governments to a recent proposal by the Joint Task Force, investigators are proceeding overseas shortly to pursue their investigations. The terms of reference of the Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking, under Mr Justice Stewart, are being expanded to enable it to take the work of the Joint Task Force further and to bring into the light of day the broader aspects of Nugan Hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The report contains compelling evidence that Nugan Hand, in its many manifestations, paid little regard to the laws of the land and engaged in illegal and criminal activities. In particular, it knowingly laundered and moved money internationally for drug traffickers. Whether or not it was involved in drug trafficking itself is less clear. Even so, it is worth nothing that at page 284 of the report the Joint Task Force states:</PARA>
<PARA> While substantial evidence of drug related activity by those involved with the Nugan Hand group of companies was forthcoming, many inquiries simply proved the negative: That allegations made were false or that a 'suspect' client or employee was not involved. With few exceptions, where this occurred there is no reference to the inquiry in the report. In some instances, the view was held that in fairness it should be reported that such a matter had been investigated; for example in the case of widespread rumours respecting well known individuals.</PARA>
<PARA>On gun running, at page 490 of the report the Joint Task Force observes:</PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence from a number of sources that Nugan Hand was involved, or attempted to become involved, in the international sale of military arms and other weaponry to government and non-government forces, though the evidence is insufficient to accurately define the extent or be certain of the success or otherwise of that activity. </PARA>
<PARA>The allegations of intelligence activity and interference in Australia's affairs are not confirmed by the report. Certainly, American citizens who might reasonably be thought to have had an intelligence background were closely involved in the affairs of Nugan Hand in the late 1970s. But the Joint Task Force at page 440 makes the point that:</PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be strongly emphasised here that no conclusion should be inferred from that which follows, nor has any conclusion been reached by the task force, about any US or other intelligence agency having a role in the operation of Nugan Hand. It is merely a statement of facts as they are presently understood to exist and a description of the environment under investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government has had assurance from the United States Government, at most senior levels, that there was no link between the Central Intelligence Agency and Nugan Hand. Further, the public affairs division of the Central Intelligence Agency on 26 March 1982 took the unusual step of issuing the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition Labor Party has produced documents alleging narcotics links between the collapsed Nugan-Hand Bank and the CIA. There are also resurgent charges that CIA engaged in operations against the Labor Government in Australia several years ago. Comment: The Agency rarely comments on such allegations but in this case we emphatically deny these charges; the CIA has not engaged in operations against the Australian Government, has no ties with Nugan-Hand and does not involve itself in drug trafficking. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government understands that the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has recently been examining alleged CIA involvement in Nugan Hand. The outcome of that Committee's inquiries is awaited. </PARA>
<PARA> Against the above background, a short chronology puts events into perspective. Houghton and Hand, who were thought to have intelligence backgrounds, settled in Australia in 1967. Nugan and Hand and others were involved in a number of dubious companies from 1972. Nugan Hand Needham was established on 6 July 1973. That company's name was changed to Nugan Hand Ltd in mid-1974. Hand left Australia in December 1974, severing his formal connection with the Nugan Hand group, but seeming to maintain informal contact. He visited Sydney in July 1975. He rejoined the Nugan Hand group on 16 March 1976. Nugan Hand's involvement in moving money for drug traffickers seems to have begun in November 1975. The influx of retired American military officers to Nugan Hand commenced in 1977 and reached its peak in 1979. Houghton formally joined Nugan Hand in October 1978. Nugan Hand collapsed in early 1980 after Nugan's suicide. Finally, Hand left Australia in June 1980, travelling on a fraudulently obtained passport. </PARA>
<PARA> There was apparently a personal relationship between Houghton and Mr Leo Carter , a regional director of ASIO, who vouched for Houghton in early 1972 when he arrived in Australia with an expired entry visa. The Joint Task Force quotes ASIO, on pages 405 and 406 of the report, as stating that it has no record of Houghton and that it is only possible to speculate that Mr Carter, who is now dead, may have known Houghton privately as a restaurateur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government deplores the erosion of business morality as evidenced in the incidence of white collar crime in the 1970s, the consequences of which have become apparent in recent times. The Joint Task Force report, which is based on largely historical investigation, illustrates this breakdown. All the Joint Task Force's holding of information will be provided to Mr Justice Stewart. The Government will act decisively on his recommendations, just as it has acted speedily on the recommendations of the Joint Task Force. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition, like the Government, is very concerned at the erosion of business morality due to the incidence of white collar crime. It is evident from what has occurred in this Parliament in recent weeks that white collar crime has made tremendous inroads into political and public morality in Australia. Of course, Nugan Hand Ltd was concerned with crime . The other serious question for the nation is whether intelligence agencies have been more interested in crime than in intelligence. I emphasise that there have been a number of allegations of involvement by people who have close connection with intelligence agencies or by former employees of such agencies in both domestic and international illegal activities. Intelligence agencies have a direct responsibility to gather intelligence but, the human element being what it is, that sort of cover, that sort of cloak, might be used to give to the same people a chance to engage in massive illegal activities. That is why we seem to be failing to identify the real issue. We know very well the criminals involved, but that begs the question whether people who were legitimately gathering intelligence perhaps engaged in illegal activities to gain funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should bear in mind that the first report of the Joint Task Force had to be kept confidential. I note that the Government is now saying that the matters which are the subject of the present report will be terms of reference for the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking under Mr Justice Stewart. I put it quite forcibly to the Government that the terms of reference ought to be expanded to include the actions of international intelligence agencies and particularly those people who have been named in this report and elsewhere as being associated with those intelligence agencies. In other words, we should not limit the Stewart Royal Commission to events in Australia. It ought to be given a charter similar to that which has been given to a Senate committee in the United States. A select committee of the United States Senate is now probing the activities of Nugan Hand. It is interesting that the Central Intelligence Agency gave confidential evidence to that Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to see the Stewart Royal Commission have access to that information and to any other information that the United States Senate committee has because it could reveal a close connection between Nugan Hand, drug trafficking, arms dealing and personnel or former personnel of the CIA. One is not accusing the CIA as such of any activity, but its personnel have certainly come under a searchlight in discussion in Australia and in America as to whether they were entitled to engage in the activities in which they did. In addition to these terms of reference, I think it imperative that the Stewart Royal Commission be given an opportunity to examine not only contraventions of Australian law but also whether there was any international arms dealing. I say that because, earlier this year, I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) whether he was aware that allegations had been made of international arms dealing involving a number of countries and merchant banks such as Ward, Knight and Dunn Ltd and Nugan Hand. The Costigan Royal Commission into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and other inquiries have clearly identified these merchant banks as being involved in 'gun running'. There is in America prima facie evidence that at least $30m from an arms contract with Argentina was laundered through the Nugan Hand bank in Australia. I say that it is prima facie evidence because it was a verbal arrangement. I wrote to the Prime Minister about this matter and he quite fairly replied that the Reserve Bank's records did not reveal whether any such transaction had taken place. That really means that there is nothing to examine because the Bank does not ask about such transactions. That seemed to be an unfair result. I wrote back to the Prime Minister as recently as August suggesting that in future the Reserve Bank keep at least some sort of register of all the individuals and corporations, including transnationals and multinationals, which may be engaged in arms dealings, so that we will not have such a blank spot or vacant result when we want to find out what has happened from the Australian currency point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing to the Opposition to be given what one could call confidential intelligence advice that there was no evidence of any relationship between any members of Nugan Hand and intelligence agencies and then to read this report, which I think is to the contrary. I am talking particularly about matters that have been identified in the report. If one goes through the pages of it one will see that Air America, formerly Civil Air Transport, is identified as a Central Intelligence Agency controlled airline. It follows that people who were involved in that airline would have some connection with an intelligence agency. It was well known that that airline was involved in activities apart from just flying people into and out of airports. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the questions that arises is how Mr Houghton came to Australia. If we take a close look at this report we will find that according to Houghton he entered Australia from Saigon in 1972. He was allowed to stay because of a telephone call to one of our Australian Security Intelligence Organisation representatives, Mr Carter, who is now dead. I think it would be well known in intelligence circles-it would be well known, for example, by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, which certainly had a base in Saigon-that if Houghton was leaving that area for Australia and if he was engaged in intelligence activities for the CIA he would be given a clearance when he arrived in Australia. I think it would be a matter of record that our own intelligence agencies in Saigon indicated to our own intelligence agencies in Australia that Houghton should be allowed in, which he was as a result of a telephone call to Mr Carter. I do not think the whole issue should be put on the late Mr Carter. Certainly our intelligence agencies would have known when Houghton left Saigon. I think that is very clear indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Houghton allegedly had a top connection with the United States Administration. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> On the information available it is probable that Houghton was associated with US intelligence personnel in South East Asia and Australia, and had some type of association with personnel in Australia's ASIO . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It was Houghton who introduced Rear Admiral Yates, retired, and Yates who introduced most of those who were associated with the Nugan Hand bank. So we can clearly see some sort of panel of connection between names. I think it is just gilding the lily to suggest here that perhaps we have not got the fine evidence that we need. We should bear in mind that our own Narcotics Bureau had to be disbanded. We should bear in mind that the Wilsons were murdered. We should also bear in mind the activities of the Clarke syndicate and the Mr Asia problem, which were related to illegal transactions involving massive amounts of money. </PARA>
<PARA> We come then to the matter which I tried to raise recently and which is called the Volkman case. Volkman, who happened to be just a Commonwealth employee, gave evidence of the most sensational kind in camera to the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. Quite extraordinarily, he was charged by the Government after that. In the course of an investigation carried out with a search warrant his in camera evidence was taken and copied. In that in camera evidence Volkman talked about massive involvement with narcotics by intelligence agencies. He expanded that evidence later to indicate clearly informants who were also named in the Nugan task force report. He went on to name people who are still, he alleges, in the Customs area and who are still in receipt of money. He talked about plane flights to Alice Springs, which can have only one association with an intelligence agency. He named a person called Cosgrave, who is now dead. In other words, we see again a whole chapter and verse of details of names and facts which I think cannot be contradicted. </PARA>
<PARA> The most disappointing thing was that one of our own employees gave this sort of evidence-both in camera and outside obviously, because it now appears that the personnel assisting the Williams Royal Commission were also Commonwealth employees and reported Volkman to their superior officers for giving such evidence-and was the subject of what one might call malicious prosecution by this Government. I cannot understand why. I am not naming any Minister for this. It seems incredible that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) went to the extent of filing an ex officio indictment to bring this man to the courts on the basis of some serious conspiracy when in fact there was no real evidence of such a conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make my final point to which nobody has adverted. Certainly it ought to be put on the record. It concerns a statement made by Mr Neil Evans, a former bank executive of the Nugan Hand bank, to the entire American television network as recently as 22 September. What does Evans have to say in this interview? In the preamble to the interview the reference is to the collapse of the Nugan Hand bank, the mysterious death of Frank Nugan and the question of illegal currency transactions, big time drug operations and the Central Intelligence Agency. In Evans's statement to the whole of the American network he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We were to become--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Nugan Hand-</PARA>
<PARA>the paymasters for the CIA around the world. </PARA>
<PARA>He was a former bank executive. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we were putting ourselves in the position to disperse funds for the CIA to whoever they were directed. </PARA>
<PARA>That was his own statement. As the interviewer said Mr Neil Evans was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . given immunity from prosecution, agreed to talk about the Nugan Hand operation on Australian television. From his account and others, the bank had its genesis during the Vietnam War. Four of the original stockholders were Americans who listed their addreses as Air America, Army Post Office, San Francisco. Air America was the CIA airline in Indochina, hauling men and supplies on clandestine missions. And according to former CIA agents, even drugs out of the so-called Golden Triangle, where the borders of Burma, Laos and Thailand converged. Nugan Hand sent Neil Evans to the Thai city of Chiang Mai, the commercial centre of the drug trade. He claims the CIA made millions and used the money to finance some of its secret projects. </PARA>
<PARA>Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> The idea was that money would be deposited with the Nugan Hand Bank by the CIA through various channels and also that the Nugan Hand Bank would be the repository for funds coming in from various CIA enterprises, namely drugs and Thailand, marijuana in particular. And that the bank-the Nugan Hand Bank would then be responsible for rerouting that money to an account in America with a New York bank. </PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Nugan Hand was not your ordinary bank. There were secret numbered accounts and hardly any of its top people were bankers. Many were American civilians and former high ranking military officers with ties to United States intelligence. </PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer went on to say that Michael Hand, an American Green Beret who served two tours in Vietnam-one for the Central Intelligence Agency-had disappeared and was now believed to be dead. The interviewer then talked about a person named Edwin Wilson, who is now under indictment for selling arms and explosives to Libya. Honourable members will see that this matter is current in the United States at present. What I am saying is that we now have the Stewart Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking and it would be unfair to limit its terms of reference so as not to be able to inquire into the matters that I have now raised. If the United States Senate can do this surely we can have a commission in Australia to get the same information. </PARA>
<PARA> White collar crime knows no levels. It can involve the very highest. If there are intelligence officers who are legitimate in their intelligence operations but who are also acting illegitimately because of illegal extra-curricula activities then they are no longer entitled to the cloak of respectability. They ought to be removed from office. They should not be in either Australian intelligence or American intelligence. It is unfair and dangerous to think that we can have that sort of secret organisation operating for its own financial gain. I know it is virtually a matter of record-it would be if we could identify it-that there has been massive arms dealing with the Nugan Hand bank as a clearing house. We want to get to the bottom of this matter. I think it is unfair that the likes of Mr Volkman and others who want to raise these issues have been so persecuted in the past. I urge the Government to expand the terms of reference to encompass the matters that I have now mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No subject should have more agreement in this Parliament and the nation than defence. There is no subject on which a long term commitment by the Australian people has been more significant or more continuing . Regrettably, the Australian people's preparedness to spend funds and to commit themselves to adequate defence planning is not shared, nor is it carried through by significant policy actions or responsible administration, by this Government. The state of Australia's defence is probably at its worst since the Second World War. Certainly the understanding of the Australian community-even the defence planners-of the Government's policy cannot be other than confused. The policy reflects short term political opportunism as a substitute for realistic long term planning for the nation's defence needs. In the last couple of years the Government has totally destabilised the whole defence debate in Australia. It has acted in a manner which can only create a situation where, should any threat develop to Australia, Australians will be found to be totally and completely unprepared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After this Government came to office it made a statement to the Parliament in November 1976 setting out the defence aims of the Government. That statement was significant. One would have to say that it was well argued in respect of Australian defence. It was never put into effect, nor was it ever treated seriously by the Government in its defence planning. In no year following the announcement of that policy-the White Paper on defence-were the funds allocated to carry through the program. It was finally abandoned in 1980 although it has never actually been abandoned in a statement to this Parliament or in a public statement. It was replaced by what has to be described as a fairly grandiose, emotional and somewhat insubstantial statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) following the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. It was one of those statements large on histrionics and short on practical application, but it did contain commitments to carry out certain defence programs as a consequence of what the Government saw as a changed strategic situation. Those commitments were quickly forgotten. In March 1980 the then Minister for Defence made an expansionary statement in Parliament following those commitments. Among the new programs announced as part of the post-Afghanistan program were additional patrol boats for the Australian Navy, now deferred, and an underway replenishment ship, now deferred. There was a program of advertising to increase the size and capabilities of the Australian Defence Force Reserve. The money was spent, and the program attracted the young people who wanted to commit themselves to Australia's defence. The Government forgot all about the fact that attracting numbers to the reserves does not add to the reserves' capacity. It totally deserted the reserves as far as providing them with the wherewithal, the necessary capabilities and the necessary training arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> That statement also stated that the Government would build up supplies of fuel and other necessary basic stores in order to cope with any defence situation. In the last two Budgets the levels of stores and fuels were cut back to a point at which they are now dangerously low. The Government also announced-I have a quote from the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) as late as a couple of weeks ago- that it would increase the capital equipment program for the defence forces. In fact the 1980 statement said that within five years the capital equipment segment of the defence vote would increase to 25 per cent. Since then the Government has been progressively running away from that figure. It has been trying to suggest that that is not the figure it meant. Certainly its budgetary statements indicate that it did not mean that at all. In fact the last three Budgets since the announcement of the proposed increase to 25 per cent of the capital vote show that the expenditure level of 14.7 per cent in 1980 fell the next year to 14.1 per cent and last year to 10.7 per cent; it is expected to be 13.7 per cent this year. That 13.7 per cent includes a significant proportion derived from the deferment of payments which fell due last year and will cost up to $30m extra this year because of changes in the valuation of the Australian currency as compared with the United States dollar and inflation. This year we will spend $30m of our equipment vote to pay for the Invincible which we did not get and for which the deferments were made. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, because of the devastating effect of the completely ill-planned and ill-considered venture into an aircraft carrier-it should be understood that the Government knew that the Melbourne was coming to the end of her effective life and had probably reached its defence effective life termination by the time it was taken out of service-almost as an afterthought the Governmen announced a program to review the future of the Fleet Air Arm. The Invincible came on the market, a carrier which had previously been rejected by the Australian Navy as not suiting Australia's requirements, and the whole defence capital equipment budget was thrown into the air like confetti and those who could catch some dollar notes on their way down got them. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year's capital equipment program was a total disaster for Australia's defence planning and has set back any program of re-equipment by several years. This year the Minister claimed a 21 per cent increase in the capital equipment vote. It is a 21 per cent increase on a total amount which represented under 80 per cent of the amount allocated last year; if we spent nothing we could claim a 100 per cent increase. In fact last year the defence capital equipment vote was devastated by the Invincible and this year's capital equipment vote is now more than 20 per cent below that which it would have been had it been the same as that which was allocated in last year's Budget. A substantial proportion of that which is allocated goes to meet deferred payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in other statements, said that he believes that a considerable emphasis should be placed on the defence of Western Australia. He made a statement in Question Time about home porting. That is probably the most fallacious and dishonest aspect of government defence policy we have ever seen in this Parliament. In 1977 the Prime Minister made a statement in Western Australia three days before the State election to the effect that within three years home porting would be introduced in that State. Knowing the record of the Government and its Prime Minister, who would suggest that that statement had any purpose but to use defence for electoral purposes? If honourable members think that that was a coincidence, a similar announcement was made four days before the next State election. I asked the then Minister for Defence some time ago whether the announcement would be made again at the next State election. His answer was that he did not know the date of the State election. There was no denial that the two previous statements had nothing to do with defence. They were completely insincere statements designed to bolster the political needs of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. That was what they were all about- politics! The announcement will be able to be made again at the next Western Australian elections because they are due next year and nothing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> We have as a consequence six years of statements and rhetoric about the importance of defence, the Government's commitment to defence and the Government 's total failure to meet those commitments with hard cash and solid planning. It is a defence policy which the Minister and the Government know nothing about, and on a daily basis different statements are made about the defence requirements of Australia. The Government does not know what its defence policies are because it has never sorted out anything other than its immediate political needs. That is the basis of our defence policy as enunciated by the Government. If honourable members look at item No. 33 of today's House of Representatives Notice Paper they will see the most insincere motion ever brought into this Parliament. It was brought into the Parliament as a matter of urgency on 19 August in order to debate the North West Cape issue. It was not designed to strengthen the American alliance; in fact, if anything, it was designed to weaken it by creating divisions in the Australian community and the Australian political scene for the purposes of short term political gain. What did the motion say? The motion said that we will wipe out the local government commissioner at Learmonth. The Parliament spent one day debating that motion in the hope that the Government could score some cheap, shoddy political points because it has no policies on defence. </PARA>

The honourable member does not do himself credit by lending himself to that sort of cheapening of the defence debate. Defence is a serious problem; it should be above the cheapness of politics, and the Government should accept its responsibility to the Parliament and to this nation and set out its defence aims and its defence policies and what we will need to carry out those policies. The Government should enunciate them in the Parliament and should not run around the country telling everyone that it will give them this and that when it knows damn well that it will not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the improved defence of the north-west of Australia. The Minister was over there the other day. During Question Time today he said that the Government will start the Derby Airport this year. He forgot to say that it was programmed to be completed within two years. It has been deferred by two years by this Government. Australia's defence industries are in an absolutely disastrous situation. Only after over a year of fighting has the Bendigo Ordnance Factory been temporarily relieved of the threat of being disposed of. The Lithgow Small Arms Factory has no guarantee of continuance of operation at all; it is under total threat. Maintenance workers employed by private firms contracting to the Army at Puckapunyal have been placed on a three-day week and have no guarantee that they will be employed in future. Some 400 specialised aircraft workers who will be needed for the FA18 program at the Government Aircraft Factories are under threat of retrenchment. The Government Clothing Factory, obviously a necessity in any time of hostilities, is about to be sold to private enterprise, and the capabilities of providing the armed forces with uniforms and other clothing will very quickly dissipate if the thing is not written off for tax losses. We do not know what will happen to the Williamstown Naval Dockyard. It is fairly obvious that the Government is doing everything possible to justify the purchase of its follow-on destroyers outside Australia. Certainly, there is pressure for that.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently the contracts for autoclave steam cleaning operatives for Government Aircraft Factories were placed in the United States on the pretext of a lower tender when in fact the Australian contractor was told that certain equipment, the price of which was lower than the highest specification in the program, would not be acceptable to GAF and therefore did not submit a tender, and the Government took the opportunity to place the tender outside Australia. Where is the seriousness in this Government's approach to Australia's defence policy? The more important question is: What is the defence policy of this Government? If it does not know whether it needs an aircraft carrier how does it explain the long term force structure which it is seeking to develop in its defence plan? The one must follow the other. If we say that we have an adequate defence capability to defend the West, where is it? If it has to be transferred from the eastern States, how is it to get to the West? If we need defence industries, why are they being closed down as fast as they can be under this Government's program? Up to 10,000 people in defence industries are currently under threat. The Government is seeking excuses to place further orders outside Australia. Where is the Jindalee program? Where are the air fuel tankers? Where is the policy?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was appointed Minister for Defence in May of this year. So, it was with some interest today that I heard the first question without notice on defence matters asked of me by a member of the Opposition since my appointment. I might add that it was not asked by the shadow spokesman for defence in this place, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). It is of interest that the subject of this debate is a matter of public importance proposed in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The destabilising effect on Australia's defence capabilities of conflicting statements . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the first part of the proposal. I still have to hear which statements are in conflict and with what. The matter proposed for discussion continues:</PARA>
<PARA>and the indecisive defence policies of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I assure the honourable member for Corio who proposed this matter for debate today that there is nothing indecisive about our concern for the defence of Australia. Indeed, the honourable member began by setting out his own attitude towards what he sees as the principal concerns, presumably summarised in his proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to those three points. I want to look at just what has happened in the area of defence and what are the Australian Labor Party's attitudes and views. Firstly, the honourable member thinks defence is a very serious subject. So it is. So are the consequences of a lack of defence. Those who are responsible, ministerially, departmentally and in the three armed Services have an acceptance of the very serious costs of maintaining an adequate defence not just for Western Australia but also for Australia. Secondly, he said that there should be an agreement between honourable members on both sides of the Parliament. I will say a little about that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned, non-alignment-which is where the Labor Party is heading at the moment-is no policy for honourable members on this side of the House. Any suggestion that there should be a withdrawal from our commitment within ANZUS, with our Western friends and with the Western alliance, would be absolutely nonsensical given the present state of concern that there is about the continued buildup in Soviet aggressive capability and about the extent to which the Soviet Union, over the last 15 years, has spent at a significantly greater rate than the Western powers-certainly the United States of America. It has developed capabilities which, when examined, can be identified only as having an aggressive and not defensive capability. Yet honourable members on the other side of the House are talking about a nuclear free hemisphere. They are moving towards non-alignment, moving away from our arrangements and relationships with the United States. Presumably they are moving away also from our five-power defence arrangements with the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia and New Zealand. So there certainly is no agreement between honourable members on both sides of this House. The Government stands very strongly behind its ANZUS arrangements. I will say a little about that aspect in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that the honourable member made was that the state of our defences is the worst since the war. What arrant nonsense! In fact, directly the reverse is true. At this stage, Australia's defence capability in the area of sophisticated equipment and in the training and competence of those who are members of the three armed Services is at the highest state ever. Not only is it not the worst since the war but also it is the most adequately prepared defence capability that Australia has ever enjoyed. I pay a particular compliment to my predecessor, the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen), for his role ministerially, and to all those in the central Department of Defence and in the three armed Services who have contributed to that state and to the very high measure of effectiveness that I have found in the time that I have been Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The third allegation that the honourable member for Corio made was that our defence planners are confused. I acknowledge that, in the planning of defence, there is an abundance of committees. All honourable members will have an opportunity tomorrow when I table the final Utz Committee report on the managerial structures of defence to see how those 90 committees in some ways cause difficulties in simplicity of planning effort. Yet it is essential, if we are to develop adequately and to reconcile as between the competing claims of the three uniform services a single purchasing policy, that there be planned within and between all of the three uniform Services a program which identifies how those scarce defence dollars can be spent. </PARA>
<PARA> No one should think that, in the Labor days, the then Government was prepared to allocate greater resources to defence spending. Of course every government has that problem of allocating sufficient resources to ensure that we can meet all aspirations towards augmenting our defence capabilities. But I will not accept that our defence planners are confused. I will accept that, in the development of defence objectives, stratagems and purchasing programs, it is essential that we take account of all the differing points of view of those who are part and parcel of the three armed Services and the central Department of Defence to try to work out the preferred course by which we should set down our acquisition program and our five-year defence plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corio suggested that we have some type of short term political expediency in mind when we talk about individual defence programs. Indeed, completely the reverse is the case. I point out to the House that when we have talked about the acquisition of a carrier we have been talking about having a naval capability at and beyond 2000 or 2010, that is, looking at least 25 years ahead. We have very much in mind in the review that is now being undertaken within the defence area to determine what sort of carrier or other major acquisition program should be developed for the Royal Australian Navy the fact that we do not just want a short term solution. We want to work out the long term structure of the Navy so that we can be sure, when taking into account the three armed Services, that we will be spending our dollars in the way best suited to meet our prime defence requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> But, looking at the background behind the matter proposed for discussion one cannot but notice that the Australian Labor Party's new interest coincides with several statements made by the Soviet Union on the 65th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution. I wonder to what degree the article written by Mr Vladimir Sazanov, is the real genisis of today's debate. I understand that Mr Sazanov is an analyst from one of the Soviet news- agencies, Novosti, which is laying down the line which so many members of the Labor Party espouse with respect to defence. In an article in the Australian of 9 November, we read:</PARA>
<PARA> Moscow has paid attention to three reports which came from Canberra almost on the same day: the opening ceremony at the American Omega navigation base . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is a tremendous facility. Those honourable members who have travelled on the Ansett Boeing 737s will know that they have the new Omega navigation capability. They will know what a magnificent instrument that is for the safety of civilian aircraft and also ships. Any suggestion that that facility is in some way a threat to world stability really needs to be well and truly laid at the heels of this Soviet author and the left wing members of the Labor Party who support him. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>the decision of the Australian Government to extend the range and number of flights of US B-52 strategic bombers over Australian territory . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that our co-operation within the ANZUS arrangement is extraordinarily important. Our co-operation with the United States in providing those landing rights at Darwin and low level flights across three States-the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia-is very important in maintaining that Western deterrent to Soviet expansion in the Indian and Pacific Ocean areas. The author continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and the visit of James Hartinger, chief of the United States Space Command . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is a suggestion that in some way that visit is a threat to world peace. I do not want to go through all that. It seems to me remarkable that at a time when we have the 65th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, we have a display of Soviet military might, and a number of aggressive comments by various members of the Politburo, including Mr Viktor Grishin. We have an article by an analyst in Novosti. All this seems to be the genesis of today's debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at where the Labor Party is going. Let us talk about ANZUS. We all remember that on 13 September 1976 the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), as the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, signed an advertisement in the National Times calling for an independent and non-aligned Australia. The advertisement stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned--</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Wills being one-</PARA>
<PARA>consider that military alliances are a source of international tensions . . . Therefore, we the undersigned, support the campaign for an independent and non- aligned Australia which stands for . . . opposition to non-military alliances, foreign military bases and military interventions. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the Labor Party is moving towards non-alignment. So much for the Labor Party and any accord that it has with the very determined commitment of honourable members on this side of the House to our ANZUS arrangements. For those who think that example is only in the past, we have Senator Melzer's signing of a further National Times advertisement on 26 April 1980 which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia should develop an independent, non-aligned foreign policy, ( including the) removal of the US bases on Australian soil and cessation of Australian military operations under the ANZUS Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>But enough of that. Honourable members will recall that this year John Cain, the Premier of Victoria, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stating:</PARA>
<PARA> I . . . give you early notice of my Government's policy that it will not permit visits of nuclear powered or nuclear armed vessels to Victorian ports. </PARA>
<PARA>We all recall the developments since then. The fact is that there was within the speeches of the spokesmen for the Labor Party a total inconsistency as to what they wanted. Honourable members will recall that there seemed to be four separate ALP positions on the issue. I have just referred to that of the Victorian Premier, Mr Cain. Mr Wran bans visits by nuclear powered ships but allows stops by conventionally powered vessels without insisting on knowing whether they are carrying nuclear weapons. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) apparently opposes visits-I am not too sure what he does now but he did then-by nuclear armed ships but is relaxed about nuclear powered vessels which do not carry nuclear weapons. He insists that Australians should be told if a visiting vessel is carrying nuclear arms. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) says that a Labor government will allow visits by nuclear armed ships provided they are simply refuelling and not conducting some staging exercise. The same gentleman is seeking to have some type of nuclear free Southern Hemisphere, presumably banning all American ships, all the deterrents, throughout the whole of the Southern Hemisphere. What arrant nonsense that is!</PARA>
<PARA> Without running through the correspondence on the issue, there are frequent references to the Leader of the Opposition's inconsistency on defence. I draw the attention of honourable members only to an article in the Australian of 9 July 1982 by its defence correspondent, William Pinwill, to that effect. We have the fact that we had to introduce in this House the Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill to make sure that the Government's policy of permitting US ships to visit Australia is properly validated and authorised by the Federal Parliament in the exercise of its Federal power. We all recall the communique that was issued after the ANZUS Council's thirty-first meeting in Canberra earlier this year and the comments by Ambassador Walter J. Stoessel, then Deputy Secretary of State of the United States. The communique stated-Walter Stoessel subsequently confirmed this-that the parties to the agreement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . recognized the importance of access by United States naval ships to the ports of its Treaty partners as a critical factor in its efforts to maintain strategic deterrence and in order to carry out its responsibilities under the terms of the Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>I comment on all these things because the Labor Party is demonstrably moving away from alignment. It is moving towards non-alignment. The Labor Party is not prepared to accept the consequences of the ANZUS commitment. I have before me many contributions that identify the extent to which the Labor Party has nothing in common with the Government in terms of developing an adequate defence effort. In contrast, we on this side of the House have increased successively our defence vote. There has been a 148 per cent increase in defence spending since 1975-76. This year defence spending is to total $4.6 billion, an 11.8 per cent increase over last year. </PARA>
<PARA> As I explained in the debate in this chamber on the defence estimates, we have not reinstated those items which were deleted when we took the decision on HMS Invincible because we are still to take the decision as to a replacement carrier or otherwise for the Australian defence forces. We do not believe it appropriate to augment in any way the defence vote until that decision has been taken. Within the Department of Defence that decision is well under way. I am advised that it should shortly be taken by the senior committees of the Department. It will then be referred to me. Of course, from that technical appraisal not only of the capability of a carrier but also of whatever aircraft are to fly on it I will be in a position to make a recommendation to the Government and the Government will be in a position to take a decision on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Any suggestion that we have cut back on defence spending for anything other than proper and valid reasons to augment Australia's defencive capabilities and to ensure that we are able to meet not only our alliance responsibilities with the United States and New Zealand within ANZUS but also within our five-power arrangements and our independent regional capability is arrant nonsense. We demonstrably are increasing our capability through northern Australia and in Western Australia. This Government is committed not only to maintaining our international obligations but also to ensuring an independent regional capability. I completely rebut the allegations and assertions made as part of this matter of public importance. I believe that the statements made by the Opposition's spokesman on defence are inaccurate. I do not believe in any way that the very significant effort this year whereby defence expenditure will represent 2.9 per cent of gross domestic product moving to 3 per cent next year is anything other than an adequate recognition by this Government of the responsibilities that should properly be accorded to the development of an adequate defence effort by this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of us were puzzled as to precisely why a Minister with a proven record of incompetence should be put in to run a department that quite clearly is the most administratively complex department that any Minister in an Australian Government has to administer. We who were puzzled by that event had our answer here today. The Minister has been placed in that position not because he has the skills that are necessary for the immediate needs of the Department of Defence but because he has an instinct for the political jugular. There is a requirement for this Government to explain the manifest inadequacies of its defence policies. It cannot explain them, so it will automatically be obliged to confuse the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) confused the debate, as he has been confusing it since he was appointed, by transgressing in the portfolio of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) in the most incompetent and ridiculous manner. He has been worried about our not pointing to confusion in his defence statements. I will be getting on to some of that confusion in a minute. I ask the House to note the statements that he made about an immediate and grave Soviet threat today because I will go on later to quote statements from him in which he actually repudiated that position about two or three weeks ago. We should not be surprised about that because really this Minister does not know what he is doing. He presides over confusion. Anybody who has anything to do with the Department of Defence knows that that confusion exists-it does not exist within the Defence Department, which the Minister tried to imply, but it exists in the relations between the Minister's office and the Minister and the Defence Department. That is where the confusion exists. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's Department knows what it wants to do. His Department has had the bipartisan support of this side of the House in what it wants to do. Over the last two years his Department has been destabilised by the attitudes of this Minister and the change of mind of his predecessor. His confusion starts with the strategic assessment. It proceeds through the gluts and bottlenecks in his procurement program, worsened by his continued tinkering with the carrier option , and ends in ridiculous efforts to paper over major inadequacies in the defence infrastructure in our areas of vulnerability in the north and west by reference to United States of America ship visits and joint exercises. The Minister's confusion begins as I said with his strategic priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Until very recently, this Government enjoyed bipartisan support. We acknowledged no immediate threat to ourselves and our region; we all acknowledged that priority was to be given to the defence of Australia and orderly planning attached to it; we mutually agreed that the north and west were our areas of vulnerability; and we concluded that the planning of our procurement and force structures should closely relate to these assessments. On both sides of the House we set off on a sensible course of action-this Government continuing the priorities laid down by the Whitlam Government. What has gone wrong has been the adolescent attention span of Ministers of this Government when presented with the advice of their advisers. They crave, contrary to their advisers' advice, the simplicity of an immediate Soviet threat . They crave, contrary to their advisers' advice, the certainty and security of the old forward defence doctrine when all we needed to do was to plan a force structure to plug into that of our allies-never mind about our need for an independent logistics capability and supply problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of this process has been involved in the Minister meandering around the countries of South East Asia defining for our allies in South East Asia the nature of the threats to them and to our security. His posturing on issues which are more appropriately handled by the Minister for Foreign Affairs has produced the most amazing backing and filling which calls into serious question the process by which this Minister obtains advice. I will quote from a recent publication of an interview between the Minister and the journalist Peter Hastings as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald some weeks ago. This interview has not received the publicity that it deserves because it reveals the true genius of this Minister and his complete incompetence in this area. Hastings asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Minister, when you were in Manila you mentioned increasing visits of Soviet air and naval units to Da Nang and Cam Ranh Bay, and yet a few days later the US Commander-in-Chief Pacific, Admiral Long, said they had levelled off if not fallen. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer from Minister Sinclair was:</PARA>
<PARA> It's not a great usage, I agree. Anyway, I've stopped saying it because I also saw the commander-in-chief's brief. I made the remark originally because I had been briefed by Admiral Dunleavy in Manila, but of course Admiral Long is his superior. </PARA>
<PARA>The public should bear that in mind. What a Minister and the public are obliged to do is not to look for advice from the Office of National Assessment, not to look for advice from the Strategic and International Policy Division of the Department of Defence. What we have to look for is the order of precedence in the United States Pacific Fleet because at any one time depending on that order of precedence the Minister will be receiving advice on the nature of the soviet threat. But the Minister does not leave it at that. He is asked the question:</PARA>
<PARA> On the alleged Russian Threat in South-East Asia there is evidence that Hanoi drags its feet on Russian facilities access requests. It regards the USSR as an ally but at the same time does not want to get too close. Now you say Russia is a major destabilising influence in Asia. If that is so, why has it not sought to destabilise Thailand? Why has it apparently restrained Vietnam from seeking to do so?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer from Minister Sinclair was:</PARA>
<PARA> I had one other motive in referring to the USSR. I think it important for ASEAN countries to work together in defence terms, that it is better they should work at some perceivable threat rather than at very difficult internal political divisions of Cambodia, Vietnam or Laos. </PARA>
<PARA> China, after all, is moving away from some of its earlier attitudes, although for how long and to what degree goodness only knows. But our interests lie in trying to get ASEAN countries not just to look at the internal actions of, say, the Filipino forces. </PARA>
<PARA>The questioner says:</PARA>
<PARA> But they're not. They also look at China. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister replies:</PARA>
<PARA> I started off saying I could see no perceivable threat. </PARA>
<PARA>He reverses the position he announced today. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps in my answers I am a little too anti-Soviet in one sense. I think there is a possible enemy there, as there is in China. </PARA>
<PARA>God help us, he has now added China to the list, despite the face that his Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is trying to establish an alliance with them. The Minister for Defence continues:</PARA>
<PARA> We would be foolish not to try to develop some collective capability against them . . . However, there is not much merit in an Australian minister rushing around and saying that China's the possible foe, even though Paul Hasluck might have in days gone by. </PARA>
<PARA>So in three statements the Minister has reversed his position a couple of times on the Soviet threat and told the Association of South East Asian Nations not to keep worrying about the Vietnamese, as the Government has been inviting ASEAN to do for some considerable time. Instead it suggested to ASEAN that it ought to be developing some sort of collective security effort against the threat which he said in the previous paragraph does not exist. That is the state of this Minister's mind, such as it is, when it comes to defence matters. The problem is that he is concealing, no matter how he attempts to paper over it, very serious inadequacies in the planning of our defence arrangements. There has been a reduction from an amount of 48.3 per cent in non-manpower expenditures in the previous Budget to 45.8 per cent in this Budget. For example in one area, the area which really relates to our readiness, equipment and stores, there is a cut from $256.5m down to $243.1m in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister ought to be alerted to the fact that none of the items of expenditure delayed, dropped or cut back by the proposed Invincible purchase have been reinstated. His explanation today is not an explanation. The initial cuts related to expenditures anticipated in the forthcoming year. No matter what the Minister does with a carrier he is not going to entail expenditure now. There has been a massive increase in the forward commitment burden of the Defence Department. It has escalated from $1.5 billion in 1980-81-I am talking in 1979-80 constant dollars-to $4 billion for 1983-84. That is a glut of major proportions that is going to be a problem for him and his successor, whenever his successor comes into office. Into that glut, which affects our capacity to purchase the F18 aircraft, which affects our capacity to proceed with a follow- on destroyer program, to name just a few vital programs he throws willy nilly, without consideration to what strategic purposes it will serve, the purchase of an aircraft carrier. When anyone raises those issues with the Minister all he does is seek to slander. This is obviously what we can expect in defence debates from now on. We can expect no answers to the points that we raise in the same way as I got no answer to the question I asked him this morning. This Minister is not here to do in the Defence Department what needs to be done. This Minister is not here to advance Australia's security. This Minister is here to get this Government over a serious political problem that is a result of developments that it has allowed to occur, particularly as it affects the Western Australian area where the Government has a number of marginal seats because he is well known to have an instinct for the jugular. Unfortunately this is going to be very much to the detriment of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Opposition spokesman on defence matters the honourable members for Corio (Mr Scholes) has claimed that the Government has made conflicting statements on defence policy and that our policy on defence is indecisive. I totally reject his claim. He is totally wrong; he is totally incorrect. The Australian Government's policy on defence is decisive and positive. It is interesting to note that the Opposition spokesman did not refer to one alleged conflicting statement made by the Government. The Hansard record of his speech will show that. Yet he has the temerity to raise in this House today a matter of public importance stating that there are conflicting statements. However, he does not refer to any. The Opposition spokesman, in his speech, did not make one positive statement as to what the Australian Labor Party would do in the defence area. It was all negativism and criticism. There was not one positive element in the Opposition spokesman's statement. He said that the state of Australian's defence was the worst that it had been at any time since the Second World War. That is false; it is wrong, it is incorrect and it is totally misleading. I think it is disgraceful that the Opposition spokesman should make that claim in this House at this time. On the one hand the Opposition claims that it wants a bipartisan policy and on the other hand Opposition members scare the people of Australia with incorrect information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition spokesman has not proved his case at all. He asked: What are our defence policies? He has heard from the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) who is at the table what they are. He said that the Government is indecisive. What is indecisive about our commitment to buy four guided missile frigates? What is indecisive about the orders placed for the new Phalanx weapons system which is a fully automatic, close-in defence system against sea skimming missiles of the Exocet type. These will be fitted on HMAS Darwin and HMAS Sydney. Is he against that? Is that indecisive? Of course it is not. It is decisive. The Government has acquired harpoon missiles for its P3C Orion aircraft, submarines and frigates. They are a better weapon than Exocet. We did not hear about that today because that is another example of the Government's decisive policies. We did not hear any criticism from the Opposition of our decision to acquire 18 light helicopters because our decisions are positive. The Government has announced that 75 FA18 fighters--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was proving how decisive and positive the Australian Government's defence policy was. I was referring to our decision to acquire 75 F18 aircraft, many of which will be assembled and built in Australia with the introduction of new technology and what that means for Australian defence infrastructure. We did not hear today from the Opposition remarks about the $40m for the new PAVETACK system for the F111s. We did not hear about the contract for 10 new P3C Orion aircraft which has been signed. We did not hear about the new Fremantle class patrol boats which are being built. There were many other things about which we did not hear from the Opposition because it knows that this Government is positive about the defence of Australia. I will move on. The Opposition has totally and abysmally failed to prove its case. The Opposition talks of conflicting statements. What a joke! Last week we heard the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) make his statement on the Schildberger show and the rejection by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) of that statement. The Opposition talks of conflicting statements when the honourable member for Wills is about to make a leadership challenge and that is denied the next minute! We do not know where the Australian Labor Party stands on leadership. I will move on because that matter is too political.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition talks about conflicting statements. I was pointing out the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in talking about conflicting statements. I will move on to nuclear issues and the matter of warships visiting Australia. The Minister for Defence pointed out that there are at least four different ALP policies on visits to Australia by American warships. By these four different policies I can conclude only that basically the ALP is against the American alliance and against warships visiting this country. Let us look at the North West Cape position. I believe that what the Leader of the Opposition has said about that matter amounts to a veto. After the ANZUS conference and after the discussions of the Leader of the Opposition with Mr Stoessel at the ANZUS conference the demands of the Leader of the Opposition raise serious questions and real doubts as to what his policy is on defence co-operation with the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at where Australia fits into the Western alliance. Australia is part of the Western alliance system. We are part of a system of mutual agreement . Only the Western alliance can muster the array of power necessary to match the growth of Soviet military expansionism in the world. The United States cannot do that alone. Australia takes its part as a middle power in the Western alliance. We have decided where we stand. However, look at the Australian Labor Party. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), in a speech on 11 August, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is part of what is archaically called the 'West'. </PARA>
<PARA>In that speech the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has rejected the Western alliance. He is moving the Australian Labor Party to a policy of neutralism and isolationism and the risks that involves for Australia. That is what that policy involves. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is against Australia's participation in the Western alliance. That is set out in that speech for all people in Australia to see. Let me move on to Australia's position. I have described how we fit into the Western alliance. The ANZUS relationship with the United States is vital and is the most important defence umbrella relationship for the country. Australia maintains a defence force which can deal with the lesser situations not involving a Soviet super-power threat. We are capable of an adequate military response. Such a force is a deterrent in the short term to any power other than a super-power challenging us. However, if the situation dramatically changed, if intentions of a potentially hostile power were to become apparent, our defence policy, defence force and infrastructure provide the basis for expansion to match the buildup following any changed situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to move on to other statements the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made. There is a total conflict in the Labor Party about these matters. The Labor Party is split. At its July conference it narrowly voted to retain the ANZUS alliance. There is a substantial amount of opinion in the Australian Labor Party in favour of pulling Australia out of ANZUS and out of its relationships with the United States. The only reason the vote went through narrowly at the Labor Party conference in July this year is that the Labor Party is trying to have a patch-up and is trying to present a package to the electorate because it feels that there might be an election. The real situation is that the socialist left is in control of foreign policy in the Australian Labor Party. The defence spokesman of the Opposition has not caught up with the fact that defence and foreign policy are interlinked and are cohesive, as I think the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) recognised in his speech. But he ought to tell the defence spokesman. I take it from the speech of the defence spokesman that he totally rejects the notion that there is any relationship between foreign policy and defence policy. The point is that this Government has coherent defence and foreign policies which it recognises are interlinked in the best interests of the people of Australia. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be naive, and dangerously so, to ask Parliament to base our foreign policy on implicitly trusting the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>I take it that the Opposition does not trust the United States. The Deputy Leader has also said that US policy is 'unprincipled and transparent'. I go back to the position on port access which was referred to earlier. When the Australian Labor Party's policy is considered alongside existing policy on the wider Western alliance which I have talked about-the joint facilities, the B52 agreement and the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers contribution-the only possible conclusion that can be drawn is that the Labor Party's objective is the isolation and withdrawal of Australia from security arrangements. </PARA>

<TITLE>Proposed Student Loans Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Restrict Access to Education-People from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts. These people, if they enrol, will be forced to amass loan debts. Richer students do not face this handicap.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Undermine the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme-TEAS should cover the basic living costs of students. Currently the scheme only assists 38% of full- time students and the maximum level of TEAS is a mere $49.67. Government statements indicated TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Disadvantage Women-Women students would be disadvantaged by a loans scheme as they have a lesser ability to repay loan debts, because on average women earn less and have a higher unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Disadvantage Mature-Age Students-Usually mature age students forego income to study and already have large financial commitments. They could not return to study if it meant incurring substantial debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Distort Educational Choices-Mounting loan debts would force students into studying shorter courses or not continuing with post-graduate study.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Result in Massive Attrition Rates-Students will attempt to undertake extensive part-time work or overload courses to minimise their loans. Increased failure rates will result forcing students to 'drop-out' rather than continuing study and increase their debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Cause Administrative &amp; Financial Difficulties-Overseas experience shows high default rates will occur on student loans. Government money will be channelled away from TEAS to paying off banks. The government will also bear the administrative burden of pursing defaulters.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the proposed student loans scheme will have disasterous effects on tertiary education, which we believe benefits the whole community, not just the individual student.</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia being employees of Repco Research Pty Ltd and Repco Manufacturing Services both situated at South Gippsland Highway, Dandenong within the Commonwealth electoral division of Holt shows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the petitioners, representing substantially the whole workforce, offer their unanimous support for the published statements by the Chairman of Repco, Mr Neil Walford, in his address to the Annual General Meeting referring to free trade principles now operating, in which he has unquestionably identified the reason for this country's current decline as a progressive manufacturing nation.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The petitioners work for an Australian owned company which has shown a dedication towards the development and promotion of vital industrial arts through training of young Australians and support of the well known Australian innovative industrial skills. Unrestricted free trade principles are being allowed to threaten the progressive and positive attitudes that thrive in this Australian manufacturing company and many others as well. It is these attitudes which will decide in the long run whether Australia will be a nation with a future or whether she will only offer very limited employment opportunities in agriculture and mining only.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray:</PARA>
<PARA> That the House take action to protect Australian manufacturing industry in the best interests of all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at the lack of effective Federal environmental protection legislation and urge that suitable legislation be enacted immediately.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners are concerned that National Estate areas such as South West Tasmania, the Great Barrier Reef and the Western Australian Jarrah Forests cannot be fully protected until adequate legislation exists and is enforced. Your humble petitioners therefore call upon the House of Representatives to ensure that all provisions of the Heritage Act and the Environment Impact of Proposals Act are fully complied with in respect of National Estate Areas.

<PARA> That the requested amendments be made. </PARA>
<PARA>Following the passage of the Customs Tariff Bill through the House it went to the Senate. In the course of its deliberations the Senate referred the Bill to its Scrutiny of Bills Committee which effectively came back with a recommendation, conveyed to me in writing by the Chairman of that Committee, that the Bill be amended. The requested amendments are simple in nature and are supported on bipartisan lines both in the Senate and, I believe, in the House. The requested amendments relate to the provisions in the Bill for the Minister to publish in the Gazette a substitutes and imitations notice where goods are considered to be substitutes for, or an imitation of, goods of another kind. Such a notice has the effect of imposing on the substitutes the rate of duty in respect of them as if they were goods of that other kind. The purpose of the requested amendments sought by the Senate is for the Parliament to be given the same powers and restrictions as to disallowance of a notice as apply to a regulation and to prevent notices from increasing duty retrospectively. I believe, on behalf of the Government, that the request for the amendments by the Senate is a reasonable one. The Government intended to move towards such amendments in any event next year. The Senate has requested them now and the Government is very happy to meet the request. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) said, the request of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee was made on bipartisan grounds. As he anticipated, the Opposition in this place supports these requested amendments. I add merely that this move perhaps should have been made some time ago but it is better late than never. There is no reason why the Parliament should not have had a lot earlier the same powers over notices as it has over regulations in this area. It is an area in which I have a number of reservations. It so happens that while the Parliament is not sitting changes in duty are merely gazetted and become law. Changes are debated in the Parliament only once a year unless we debate them when the Parliament is sitting immediately notice is given by a Minister of such changes. Not enough attention has been given to the details of tariff changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister is probably aware that on a great number of occasions-indeed, at every opportunity I have had-I have suggested that the House of Representatives which, by the Westminster tradition, has more power over financial matters should have a committee to look at the details of changes. This would lead to many more members of parliament being familiar with changes in tariffs. I am sorry that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee did not make a recommendation along those lines. It may not have been within its power to do so. At least I am taking another opportunity to remind the House of my personal view on this matter; that is, that we ought to look at the details of changes. At least these requested amendments, which have bipartisan support, will mean that the Parliament has a little more power in this area. I repeat: The Opposition supports the change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once we get into the area of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and, indeed, the whole field of industrial relations, this House is entitled to be deeply suspicious of the actions of the Government. I think it is a matter of deep misfortune for this country that the Government's approach to industrial relations ever since the end of 1975 when it came to power has not been a constructive one of trying to analyse the issues in consultation with the trade union movement and employers to see how best the powers of government can be exercised either administratively or legislatively to improve the climate of industrial relations. Rather, as the record shows, more than any other government in the history of Federation, this Government has sought to pursue the policies of confrontation. This has been shown on many occasions in its approach to legislation reflecting the belief that if one brings in tougher and harder legislation somehow or other that is going to improve the industrial relations climate in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think one can say, without being accused of being partisan in this matter, that the record in this country and other countries shows that this sort of approach is not productive, that one is never going to improve the industrial relations climate here or in any other democracy by the processes of coercion. What is required, as I think the House will know I have consistently said over the years, is an approach whereby government seeks to use its undoubted powers to bring parties together in a constructive, co-operative fashion. Having said that, I do not want it to be inferred by others that the Opposition is simply going to oppose this legislation on the basis that it represents a continuation of the sort of approach by government to which I have alluded. I will be making it clear that we believe that the legislation is not necessary. I doubt very much that the Government itself believes it is necessary. We will move amendments at the end of my speech and when the Conciliation and Arbitration ( Management of Organisations) Amendment Bill is being considered at the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> There are things that I think need to be said about this legislation and its background. Of course, we in the House understand the background to the Bill. The Government really sought to move against two unions-the Builders Labourers Federation and the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia. It has done this by way of establishing a royal commission in the case of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union and deregulation proceedings in the case of the Builders Labourers Federation. It is an interesting fact of political life that, certainly in respect of the fishing expedition that was conducted against the Ship Painters and Dockers Union, it has produced results far beyond the anticipation of the Government. Of course, if the Government could have its life over again, which is one of the luxuries that we cannot enjoy, we can be absolutely certain that one of the decisions it would not have taken is the one to establish a royal commission to investigate the Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Unquestionably, this is the decision that the Government has most deeply regretted since it took office at the end of 1975 not because of anything that may or may not have been turned out in regard to the Ship Painters and Dockers Union but because of other ancillary matters which have flowed therefrom. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us come to the direct point of the legislation. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) in his second reading speech-I will go through that speech in a little more detail later-pointed out that the Bill really is concerned with two areas. One is the question of the fitness of certain people to hold office in trade unions because of their involvement with certain offences. The second is the question of the conditions under which loans can be made by unions. As I say, I will deal with each of these areas in a little more detail in a moment. However, I think it is important if we are to consider legislation of this kind that we get the record straight about the character and quality of the Australian trade union movement generally. Before I say anything about that, I think we on this side of the House are indebted to the Minister for the responsible way in which he has approached this matter. He was generous enough in his second reading speech to indicate that he certainly did not believe that the character of the Australian trade union movement generally warranted the sort of legislation which he was bringing before the House. He is right in saying that. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess that no member of the House would deny me the right to say that I probably know the Australian trade union movement better than any other member of the House. I can say, I believe without the possibility of contradiction, that overall the Australian trade union movement is an honest movement, staffed and serviced by dedicated men and women whose main and overriding consideration is the pursuit, honestly and according to the law, of the interest of the working Australian men and women whom they represent. It may well be that at times in the pursuit of those objectives they may make decisions with which some of us would disagree. But, overwhelmingly, they are honest people who act legally according to their perception of what is in the best interest of the people whom they represent and I believe consistently with what they believe to be the interest of Australia as a whole. They are ordinary Australian men and women. It is necessary that that be said because too often there is a tendency in some conservative areas in this country to try to create an impression that somehow or other the people who inhabit the trade union movement almost come from a different planet, that they are not ordinary Australian men and women. Of course they are. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Council of Trade Unions, which is the central body and the umbrella under which the trade union movement operates, covers over two million of our fellow Australian men and women. It cannot be stressed too hard-and it must be, of course, stressed very hard in a consideration of a Bill of this kind -that overwhelmingly as I say again, the full time and part time officials of the trade union movement at branch, State and Federal level are honest, competent, loyal and dedicated Australians. I suggest that it is even more necessary that that be emphasised at this stage because, if one looks back over the last few years, one would find that many of those loudest in their condemnation of the Australian trade union movement for not abiding by the law of this country have been revealed themselves as absolute hypocrites who are prepared either to break the law or to avoid the provisions of the law for their own aggrandisement and to deny the contribution that they should make to the welfare of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in this context, it is very interesting to see the language that was used by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 30 August when he made a speech in South Australia. I hope that he goes to South Australia to make a lot more speeches because he does not seem to have made a good impact as far as we can judge from the results of last Saturday's election. But this is what the Prime Minister had to say on 30 August, speaking at a meeting in the electorate of Kingston:</PARA>
<PARA> I have said in my State, that I think those high priced lawyers and accountants who have devised and promoted tax avoidance schemes do more damage to the basis of this society than a thousand Gallaghers in this world, or a thousand Builders Labourers Federations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was an occasion on which the Prime Minister, getting into the area of industrial relations, albeit peripherally, spoke with a great deal of perspicacity and truth. I think it is appropriate to get this balance into place in the consideration of this legislation. We have here a piece of legislation concerned with ensuring that officials of the trade union movement act honourably and according to the law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is as well in our consideration of the Bill that we have clearly in our minds the words of the Prime Minister in respect of people engaged in tax avoidance. I remind the House that the Prime Minister was not talking about evasion. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . high priced lawyers and accountants who have devised and promoted tax avoidance schemes do more damage to the basis of this society than a thousand Gallaghers in this world, or a thousand Builders' Labourers Federations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, he is right. However, one would have hoped, in the circumstances of that unequivocal condemnation of people engaged in tax avoidance as being so much more dangerous than the union people to whom the Prime Minister alluded, that he would not have adhered to the position that he adopted subsequently when he came into the House and said that tax avoiders were not ogres and not the sort of people who did such great damage to the fabric of society. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the way in which the Prime Minister and the Government went to water on this issue and made this very significant distinction in this matter. Nevertheless, the point I am making is that we have there from the mouth of the Prime Minister an indication of the sort of perspective that this society should have in relation to where the greatest danger to the welfare of this society lies. Much more danger is posed to the fabric of this society by the people engaged in tax evasion and tax avoidance than by any trade union official or trade union in this country. The authority for that is the Prime Minister of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context I come now to the actual proposals of the Bill we are considering. As the Minister indicated, there have been discussions by the Government through the apparatus of the National Labour Consultative Council, which provides, as we all know, the mechanism for discussions with the trade union movement and the organised employers of this country. I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that the position of the ACTU, as put there and elsewhere, was not that it welcomed the Bill and said the Bill was necessary. Rather it put to the Minister and, indeed, to the Opposition in discussions that it believes that the Bill is not necessary for the reasons I have put about the general honesty of the trade union movement and the existence of other provisions; but the ACTU takes the view that with the qualifications to which I will be alluding it should not take the position that the Bill should be vehemently opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Opposition, I will therefore look at the Bill in a little more detail to indicate the Opposition's position. First of all, I refer to proposed new section 132F, which relates to prescribed offences and which sets out the offences which would attract the penalty of inability to hold or retain office. In the Committee stage of debate I will be making more detailed observations about our position here. At the second reading stage I indicate that we believe that one part of the section dealing with prescribed offences should be deleted. I refer to the part dealing with offences in regard to certain sections and parts of the regulations thereunder of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Penalties are involved if the offences listed there are committed. We believe that this proposal smacks of double penalties in respect of trade union officials in that if trade union officials are guilty of the offences listed there the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides penalties in respect of those offences. If they are found guilty they will then suffer the penalty attached thereto. We think that this is a case of imposing a severe double penalty improperly and unnecessarily. I will perhaps go into that in more detail when I move the appropriate amendment at the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I refer to proposed new section 132F (1) (d) and point out that there is, if one likes, a looseness about the offence referred to. One of the prescribed offences is described in the Bill as:</PARA>
<PARA> (d) any other offence under a law of the Commonwealth, of a State, or a Territory or of another country, being an offence involving the intentional or reckless use of violence towards another person, the intentional or reckless causing of death or injury to another person or the intentional or reckless damaging or destruction of property. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out to the Minister that 'reckless' is not a commonly used term. I think the Minister is indicating that he acknowledges this. The term 'reckless' is not pre-defined in this Bill or anywhere else. Again, I will perhaps say more about that at the Committee stage of the debate. In setting out our general position in regard to the Bill, I think it is appropriate to point out to the Minister that we would be hoping in the Committee stage to tease out the sorts of situations that he envisages being covered by terminology of that sort. We hope we may be able to get some response to what seems to us to be the potential danger of the looseness of the language there used. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the concept of double penalties, I ask the Minister to consider the situation in regard to medical practitioners who have been found guilty of some offences under the relevant legislation. There is no suggestion that they not be allowed to continue their profession. Although they are required to put up some notice indicating that they have infringed the provisions of the legislation and been found guilty, they are allowed to practice without inhibition. I suggest to the Minister that this is a relevant consideration in terms of the point I am making about the double penalty that is involved in proposed new section 132F (1) (d) to which I have referred. I hope the Minister will take that into account. </PARA>
<PARA> So much at the second reading stage of the debate for that section of the Bill concerned with prescribed offences which would operate to preclude a person from holding or continuing to hold office as a member of a trade union if he or she has been found guilty of those offences. I turn now to the second purpose of the legislation and that is the purpose of dealing with the situation of loans or grants by officials of the trade union movement. It is important that we look at what the Minister has had to say in his second reading speech about this matter and contrast it with the provisions of the Bill. After referring to the background of the royal commissions that have been established by this Government in conjunction with the previous Victorian Government, the Minister referred to the Winneke report into the Builders Labourers Federation. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA> Another recommendation was made for an amendment to the Act to provide that the funds of any registered organisation, or any branch, should not be applied in the granting of loans to any officer or member of the organisation or branch unless the terms and conditions upon which the loan is to be granted have been fully disclosed to and approved by the membership of the organisation or branch in general meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister in his second reading speech to the House accurately puts the position as to the re- commendation that was involved in the Winneke report. There was concern about a looseness, as the Royal Commissioner saw it, of the conditions as he found under which-in the union he was looking at-loans were able to be made by the union to officials of that union. The Minister, in introducing this Bill and in giving his justifications for the provisions of this legislation, relies upon Royal Commissioner Winneke's report in that respect. One can follow that. It is quite logical that if that is being quoted out of the report of the Royal Commission, which this Government has established , that the Government should then say, 'All right, this is our royal commission. A recommendation has been made that we should cover the situation of unions being able to make loans to officers or member of that union'. One can follow that. That is perfectly logical, but that is not what the Bill does. If the Bill were confined to that, one could say: 'There is a logical sequence of events. You establish a royal commission, the royal commissioner looks at something, finds a problem, makes a recommendation and the Government comes in and gives effect to it.' The Government has gone much beyond that. It is not merely dealing with the provision of loans or grants to an officer or a member of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> What is being provided in this legislation are provisions for disclosure in respect of grants or loans to anyone or to any organisation; it is not just to an officer or a member of the union. This is what the Royal Commissioner reported on. What does that mean? It means that, as a result of the legislation, we are going to have a position where much of the trade union movement, as is well known, has an association with the Australian Labor Party. It will make donations at particular times to the Labor Party and it has made them to other political parties. What we are getting at here is legislation which will make it compulsory for the disclosure of that sort of financial transaction. The Royal Commissioner was not concerned about that. This is not what the Minister is referring to in his speech, but that is what the legislation deals with. I am aware of the fact that under the existing regulations there are provisions whereby people can get access to that information, but I notice that the Minister is quite straightforward. He realises this is creating a different situation and is adding to it by legislation. It is certainly-I think the Minister must agree-not something which flows as a matter of logic from what the Royal Commissioner was talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make the position of the Labor Party clear on this issue in case there be any possibility of misrepresentation. We are not taking a position where we would oppose the legislation operating in a way which would provide for disclosure of donations by a trade union to a political party. We are not trying to have anything hidden in that way. That is not our point. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Minister must agree that if he brings in legislation which goes far beyond what the Royal Commission was concerned about-that is, the provision and the conditions under which loans are provided to officials or members of the union in the terms of his legislation so that all financial transactions are required to be disclosed including transactions involving grants or loans to a political party-then the fair thing in those circumstances is that the Minister should ensure that steps are taken to get even-handedness in this approach. The Minister will recall that. He justifies the approach he takes in this legislation in regard to offences by saying: 'We are trying to get an even- handedness. You have provisions under the relevant companies legislation which preclude the situation of men or women holding offices as directors if they have committed certain offences and you want to get a certain even-handedness'. It is very hard to argue against that. The Minister must accept what follows in the terms of what I am putting; that is, if we are going to have this even- handedness then the trade unions will be compelled to disclose their donations to political parties as they must do under this legislation. Let us ensure even- handedness and ensure that the Government takes steps to provide for the same principle of disclosure of donations on the part of companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The logic of it all is inexorable. I will repeat it briefly. It has been said that there has been a royal commission and that certain recommendations require a tightening up and disclosure of the conditions under which loans and grants are made by trade unions to its officials and members. That is okay, but the Government has gone beyond that. It has gone to a situation where it is not talking about loans or grants to the officials or members, it has gone to a situation which will cover any loans or grants above $1,000. This will embrace inevitably-I think the Minister agrees-the situation of donations to a political party. The Minister has justified his approach in respect of offences on the basis that he wants to get even-handedness between trade unions and companies. That is all very well. Let him take his logic through and make sure that if this approach is going to have this effect upon trade unions in ensuring the disclosure on their part of political donations that he will, through the Government, move to see that the appropriate action is taken to get the same position in regard to companies. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not generally opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House calls on the Government to extend the principle of disclosure of donations by organisations and to legislate immediately to require full disclosure by companies of all donations of a political nature made by them'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of his remarks the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) never once referred to employer organisations. It is necessary to bear in mind that the amendments contained in the Conciliation and Arbitration (Management of Organizations) Amendment Bill are to apply both to employer and employee organisations; that is, to trade unions and to employer organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. To take the point last made by the honourable member, when one looks at the position of loans and the restrictions that apply under proposed new section 133B those restrictions apply equally to employer and employee organisations just as do the other restrictions in this Bill. Both employers and employees are treated on the same basis and without discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills did not say very much in his speech about the provisions in the Bill so far as those provisions deal with disqualification of members or of individuals from holding office or from election to office in registered organisations: That is again-I make the point-both trade unions and employer organisations. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) has outlined in his second reading speech how the provisions are to apply but it is worth while, in the light of the failure of the honourable member for Wills to refer to the operation of the provisions, to outline briefly how the disqualification provisions are to apply. In brief, it is to be found in proposed new section 132B, which states that a person who has, whether before or after the commencement of the Act, been convicted of a prescribed offence-I will come to those offences at a later stage-effectively cannot be a candidate, hold office or be appointed to an office within an organisation for a period of five years unless he is granted exemption. That period of five years applies either from the date of conviction of the offence or, if the person has served a term of imprisonment, from the date on which he was released from prison. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of that kind of provision is perfectly plain. We all know there are people who, by their actions and by their record, have rendered themselves quite unfit to be trusted, and it is to meet that kind of situation that the disqualification provisions are framed. I doubt that any person in this chamber would say that some of the persons who have been referred to in Mr Costigan's Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union should ever hold office in a union or in any other body at all, be it an employer organisation or a company. It is in the interests of that public good that these provisions are introduced. For my part I welcome them. I do not believe that many persons will be affected. I agree with the honourable member for Wills when he says that most members of the Australian trade union movement are good citizens amd most of their officials are seeking to do the best by their members. I have no quarrel with that proposition. Most members and most officials of employer organisations answer precisely the same description. Nevertheless, there will be cases, and the painters and dockers have provided us with a superb example, which will lead any reasonable person to say that certain individuals should not be allowed to manage the affairs of an organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Bill we are dealing with trade unions or employer organisations. The Companies Act, from which these provisions are drawn, deals with companies, be they $2 companies or companies the size of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. I particularly welcome these disqualification provisions since I have advocated their adoption for about the last 18 months-first of all to the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) during his short tenure as Minister for Industrial Relations, then to his successor and, lastly, to the present Minister , and of course through them to the Government. In a grievance debate on 19 August I advocated essentially what appears in the Bill in relation to disqualification of persons from holding offices. The reason is plain and it has been touched upon; it is the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now say something about the operation of the prescribed offences provisions. The honourable member for Wills said two things about the disqualification provision, and only two things. First of all he said that the provisions are not necessary. How it is possible for him to say that these provisions are not necessary in light of what we know about the painters and dockers escapes, I think, any reasonable mind. There we see a situation in which , on the evidence disclosed, a union-it is very much an isolated example-is controlled by criminals. How he can say that there is no need to legislate against the possibility of this kind of abuse in the future is astonishing. There is an interest not only for the public at large but also for members of trade unions and for members of employer organisations to make sure that rogues do not take over the government of organisations, be they employer organisations or trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The other criticism that the honourable member for Wills had to make about the disqualification provisions related to the provisions which are to be found in proposed new section 132F (1) (b). It sets out a description of the kind of offences which are to attract the disqualification provisions. It seems that the honourable member for Wills has no quarrel with the first of the four heads that appear in that provision; namely, where there has been committed an offence under a law of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or of another country involving fraud or dishonesty punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period of not less than three months. I would understand him to say of that, although he said nothing, that it is perfectly reasonable; that we would not want those sorts of people to be in charge of organisations immediately after conviction or immediately after release from prison until they have either been vetted by a court or have gone through a probationary period. Nor does he have, it appears, any particular quarrel with the last two provisions. The first deals with offences in connection with the formation, registration or management of an association or organisation-that is, a trade union or an employer's organisation . He does not object to the last provision, subject to one qualification, which deals with offences involving intentional or reckless use of violence towards another person, the intentional or reckless causing of death or injury to another person or the intentional or reckless damage or destruction of property. As I understand him, the word 'reckless' in that context is vague and therefore needs to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> But what the honourable member did complain about are offences listed in new section 132F (1) (b), and these are all offences which are defined by relation to provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or regulations made under the Concilation and Arbitration Act. What he says about those offences is: 'It is a double penalty'. If he is right, that argument applies equally to all offences and not just to offences under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It applies equally to an offence involving fraud or dishonesty which has nothing to do with the Act as it is does to an offence which arises under the Act. All one can say as to that is that it is a piece of special pleading and it seeks to exempt certain offences from the disqualification provisions that attract the operation of the Act. Why? Because, apparently, they are offences under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and not for any other reason at all. The honourable member said that they are double penalties. All I can say is that it is the application of a double standard; that is, if one has been convicted of an offence under the Act it should not affect one's position in a registered organisation, although the honourable member was of course concerned only with unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I now draw attention to one anomaly in this Bill that relates to the operation of the disqualification provisions. The Minister pointed out in his second reading speech that the operation of the disqualification provisions does not apply to persons who hold office, be they elected officers or appointed officers , but that those disqualification provisions apply to persons who seek to be elected or appointed to office after the passage of this legislation. So we have the wholly anomalous position where persons who now hold office, who were, shall we assume, convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty two years ago, are entitled to continue to hold office when the Bill becomes law, yet, if their period of office expires within five years of their conviction or five years after their discharge from prison and they have to seek re-election or re- appointment then apparently they are not qualified for that and they are subject to the disqualification provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Bill would be very much improved if it applied both to future office holders and to those who presently hold office whose past conduct would otherwise attract the operation of the disqualification provisions. Any hardship can be met very simply by an application to the court under the Act to demonstrate that in all the circumstances such persons should be entitled to continue to hold office. A great amount of publicity has been given to the activities of some of the members of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Do not all honourable members really think many of those persons, by reason of their past conduct, have disqualified themselves from continuance in office and should attract the operation of the provisions now before the House? Yet, as I have said, we have this anomaly that those provisions will not apply to present office holders but only to future office holders. </PARA>
<PARA> I pass now to the criticism made by the honourable member for Wills of the provisions concerning loans. He said that the recommendation to which the Minister referred was one thing and yet the provision which we now have before us is another. He gave the example of the application of the provision to grants to the Australian Labor Party. He said that, in effect, it is all too wide. He again overlooked the fact that the Bill applies both to employer and employee organisations. So it would apply equally to trade union organisations and employer organisations. I suppose if an employer organisation makes a grant that comes within the Bill to the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Australian Labor Party, that organisation will have to disclose that fact in accordance with the Bill, and so it should, or it will have to ensure that the loan has been properly made, and so it should. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills referred to the fact that companies are in a somewhat different position. If one looks at the position of companies under the Companies Act one finds that some wide ranging prohibitions on loans are being given to directors, spouses of directors or other persons. It is perfectly true that these provisions do not go as far as the provisions now before the House. But let me state one very good reason why they should not. Employer organisations and trade unions are concerned with advancing the interests of their members. They are not trading organisations. In particular, if one looks to the position of a trade union, one sees that the trade union's source of funds is what it receives from its members and what it may have by way of investment income. As honourable members would know, some unions are now very large organisations and do have some investment income. But it is perfectly right that since what is held is effectively held in trust for members and not for trading purposes stringent restrictions should apply to the kinds of loans that trade unions or employer organisations can make. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suggest that this Bill will have a widespread application. As I have said, I agree with what the honourable member for Wills has said about officials in the trade union movement. I would think very few would be affected. But history must demonstrate to this House that there is a need for this sort of legislation. If the legislation had been in position some years ago it is very likely that many of the activities which have been examined by Mr Costigan in his inquiry into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union could never have taken place. It would have been a very good thing for this country if that had been the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before the House introduces new sections into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which attempt to bring that Act into line with the Companies Act in relation to the prescribed offences and disqualification provisions. However, when one looks at the Conciliation and Arbitration (Management of Organizations) Amendment Bill which is before the House one has to ask: Why is the Bill before us? I believe it is a political piece of legislation-if I can use that term. It has no industrial base. It will do absolutely nothing for industrial relations. Yet we have it before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) and the Government know that this whole legislation is a fraud. It is a front. Why is it a front? If one digs deeply enough one will find that our flagging economy might be one point in question. With over half a million people unemployed, the inflation rate at 12 per cent and interest rates extremely high, I think the Government is looking for other avenues in order to divert attention. After all, this Government has a unique record in the area of international affairs. Unemployment is rocketing up at the same time as inflation. The American economy , for instance, which admittedly has around 17 per cent registered unemployed and people looking for full time work has an inflation rate which is down to a few percentage points. But this Government has the unique record of having both arrows going in the one direction-that is, up. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take the letter of the legislation we see that it deals more with confrontation, which we have been used to in the last seven years, than with conciliation. It is a pity that this Government did not put as much effort into the eradication of unemployment as it has into these draconian pieces of conciliation and arbitration legislation. When one recalls the Minister's second reading speech, one would be excused for wondering why the Government is saying that unions are full of crooks. Of course they are not. The Minister at least acknowledged that in the second reading speech when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not doubt that by far the majority of registered organisations are honestly run . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again one asks: Why do we have this piece of legislation before us? One could ask that question after almost every sentence because it just does not add up. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) in his speech kept referring to the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia and how this legislation seeks to eradicate the Painters and Dockers Union. Really, it is a little bit like having a fly annoying one in the house on a hot day, running down to the local supermarket to buy every can of aerosol one can find, running back home and emptying the lot over the inside of the house to eradicate this one poor fly. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in the Bill whilst fixing, one might say, the problem of the Painters and Dockers Union-if that is what the Government's problem is-would gather in a lot of other people. Proposed new section 132F (1) (a), which has been alluded to before, states that a 'prescribed offence' means:</PARA>
<PARA>an offence . . . involving fraud or dishonesty punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period of not less than 3 months. </PARA>
<PARA>That raises a lot of other points. The legislation will not gather in many people at present. I agree with that. In fact, 99 per cent of the unions and registered organisations in general are honestly run and have honest and good people in them. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of this legislation differ from the effects of the Companies Act. When the Companies Act disqualifies someone from taking part in the management of a corporation, those people usually are in the middle aged bracket and, supposedly, should know better, one might say, than to get into trouble and find themselves in court. I am concerned about the young people who wish to take up a career in a registered organisation, namely, trade unions, probably more than any other type of organisation. At some young silly age-this was brought up in the Victorian Parliament some years ago-people do some stupid acts such as pinching a watch. Many people-I would say that many in this chamber too, may have done or been involved with some stupid things in their life. But they have outgrown that stage and have matured in their late teens. They then settle down and go on to their careers. Under this legislation, if someone does something silly at 17 or 18 years of age, is convicted of that offence and punished with three months imprisonment that person can then find himself or herself disqualified for up to five years from entering the career that he or she wishes to follow. That can mean that that person is 23 or 24 before being allowed to be appointed or elected to a registered organisation. That really can quite markedly put the brakes on one's career. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout our society we very rarely hear of the professions and the very detailed and good occupations involved especially with the trade union movement. These opportunities have grown over the years. I think this Government is to blame for some of that lack of knowledge. The occupation of industrial advocate has blossomed over the years. Many learned people from all walks of life with university degrees have entered the trade union movement and have started on very long and successful careers. If they are silly at a young age, a big damper is put on them. Under this Bill they are disqualified for five years from being elected or appointed to an office within any registered organisation. Why, one must ask also, does that person have to suffer a double penalty? Under the law of the land that person was convicted and sentenced to three months, six months or whatever period of imprisonment. The legislation provides that a person is not eligible to be elected or appointed until five years after release from prison. So, people come out of prison only to find that they have another penalty, not one which was prescribed by the judge or magistrate at the time of sentence but one set by the Federal Government under this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me continue for a moment on the term 'prescribed offence'. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has alluded to paragraph (b) of proposed new section 132F (1). We will move an amendment to this provision in the Committee stage. The paragraph is concerned with some 25 provisions-20 sections under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and five regulations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Regulations-under which one may commit a prescribed offence. Some of them might be reasonable, such as that concerned with the rigging of ballots. The Bill refers to section 143 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act-that is, the application for cancellation of registration, the deregistration proceedings . That concerns me somewhat. In proposed new section 132F (1) (d) the word ' reckless' is used on three separate occasions. This provision could be used by a government of any persuasion for political reasons. One could make sure that at a demonstration where a union official or, for that matter, any member of a registered organisation was present at and he or she became involved in a skirmish. That person could be removed from office. Under this legislation, bingo, out he or she would go. If one does not like a particular official, one can easily set him or her up under this legislation. That is what the legislation provides. The Minister may say that that is not really what the legislation is intended to do, but that is what can occur under the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is good enough for a Minister to introduce into this House legislation with a clause that, for example, provides for 'intentional' or ' reckless' use of violence. What does 'reckless' mean? I ask the Minister whether he can define it. The honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher) suggested to me before this debate-I believe he was a learned member of the legal fraternity before entering the State Parliament in New South Wales-that the situation is, in fact, like backing a car out of a parking lot. In doing that, someone could be considered to be driving recklessly, if one looks at the meaning of 'reckless ' use of violence under the legislation. Such a person could find himself or herself disqualified from holding union positions under this legislation. It seems to me that those words have been put into the legislation intentionally; otherwise, as the honourable member for Wills said, why have such unusual words been used? I ask the Minister to explain that point at a later time in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not carrying a candle for anyone, let alone a trade union or trade union official who does not do the right thing. There is no legitimate reason for legislation of this nature. It will not assist in achieving good industrial relations. Therefore, it will not assist our flagging economy, nor will it foster a better type of person, as the Government might put it, in the industrial movement. All this is achieved by fostering better industrial relations, conciliation, and granting the union movement and occupations and professions concerned therein the high amount of respect that they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say at this point that the degree of professionalism and integrity in the trade union movement and all registered organisations is extremely high. The number of people becoming interested in such occupations is increasing. This is very good to see. Considering that, I again ask: Why do we have this double penalty type of legislation before us? The honourable member for North Sydney suggested that it covered all employer organisations too. Of course, the legislation is concerned with registered organisations. As the honourable member for North Sydney, who practised at the bar and in the industrial scene, would know, not all employer organisations are registered organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I spent quite some time before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the television area, shall I say good humouredly striking blows with an employer organisation which was not registered, which never had been registered and which, unless something dramatic has happened, still is not registered today. Therefore, that organisation would not have to comply with the loans, grants and donations section of the legislation. The honourable member for North Sydney talked about loans but he conveniently forgot to talk about donations. That is what we are looking at. We do not mind disclosing our sources of donations. Let us hope that this will be the first step towards a full disclosure of all moneys advanced to political parties, whether by registered organisations or otherwise. I hope that this is what the Government is intending to do. I wonder whether we will have similar legislation requiring companies to state where their donations go. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot find any good reason for this legislation. This whole debate is probably an academic one because just about every honourable member who has spoken has agreed that 99.9 per cent of the personnel in registered organisations-let us be honest, we are talking about trade union officials-are beyond reproach. So why are we trying to swat a fly with a whole host of fly swatters? It just does not make sense. I again quote the honourable member for North Sydney, who said that the reasons are plain, that it is in the public interest. He talked about the painters and dockers being 'controlled by criminals'. Page 5 of the Bill, under prescribed offences, refers to a person being convicted and imprisoned for a period of not less than three months. I hope that not everyone who has pinched a watch or who has been convicted of such a paltry offence-not that we are condoning any such thing-would be described as a criminal, which is what the honourable member for North Sydney has suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> We will move certain amendments at the Committee stage of the debate and I will have more to say then. I really do not believe that this piece of legislation assists industrial relations in this country at all. I cannot see any good reason for it in any way, shape or form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Conciliation and Arbitration (Management of Organizations) Amendment Bill does not add a great deal to the general body of legislation which is necessary to regulate industrial relations in our country. If the Government were concerned, as I think we all are, about allegations that certain officers of unions had abused the trust reposed in them by virtue of their holding an office and had used that office for criminal purposes, legislation which was directed specifically at meeting that contention -that is at heart the contention which underlies the basis of the Government's whole approach-would have been drafted. My opposition to the prescribed offences that operate in this legislation is that they are too broadly drafted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give the House a simple illustration of that. One cannot accept the simplistic statement of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) that because officers of certain unions have been involved in what he described as criminal offences-they were almost a class offence-they are not entitled to hold any position in any responsible structure in our society. It is that approach and that concept that I want to examine. It would not be unknown to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) that it is a common practice at the end of the year for employer organisations to have social functions to which union officials are invited and for union organisations to have social functions to which employers are invited. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put to the House a situation which, I think, is possibly not unknown to the Minister of an active member of a union who does not necessarily hold any office and who, on attending such a function, celebrates excessively, has too much to drink, and is involved in a motor car accident on his way home in which damage is done to property and someone is injured. As a result of that unfortunate set of circumstances he is convicted and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment. In all other respects, everyone would agree that he is a responsible and decent citizen and this particular act was an aberration. After he does his 12 months sentence he could be asked to stand for or seek union office. He would then find himself under a circumscription in terms of his rights and capacity to do that. Is it not extraordinary that if he chooses to nominate for a seat in the Federal Parliament-this Parliament-he would be under no such circumscription? Once he has done his period in gaol he can be elected to this House. Indeed, if his party wins government, he may find himself in the exalted position that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, occupy. Is it not an extraordinary scenario that we have drawn for ourselves in what seems to me to be a government 's over-reaction to a set of allegations? With due respect to the findings of the royal commissioners, they are no more than allegations until such time as those matters have been tried and tested in our courts. This Parliament and this Government could be charged with what is an extraordinary set of double standards if the Government says, presumably, that it regards the Parliament as not as important as any one of the registered unions in our community. I do not believe that the Government believes that. I do not believe that the Minister believes it. </PARA>
<PARA> It was good enough for our founding fathers in their wisdom to take the view that a citizen convicted of any major crime which is less than treason should not be disqualified from standing for Parliament once he has served his sentence . While he is under sentence or in gaol he is disqualified but once the sentence is completed, as far as this Parliament and our Constitution are concerned, he has the same right as every other citizen. What an extraordinary set of double standards it is to say that that will be the rule for the Parliament but will not be the rule for the same citizen who, in the circumstances I have outlined, wants to contest an office in a registered organisation under the Act. That is what I mean by overreaction. I would like to have tabled and incorporated in Hansard a letter which was kindly given to me by my colleague the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) in respect of--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply acknowledge my indebtedness to the honourable member who, in terms of the circumstances I have just outlined to the Parliament, had that legal position confirmed for him by the Acting Chief Australian Electoral Officer as to the restrictions on the rights of citizens standing for Parliament . I believe that when we are looking at these disqualification provisions we have to see them in the broad context of what is the problem with which we are endeavouring to come to grips and, therefore, what is an appropriate amendment to deal with the problem. In my view what is contained in this legislation in terms of prescribed offences is an overreaction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The history of the trade union movement shows a number of distinguished officers, men who have in the past, because of the nature of Australian society and by virtue of the social circumstances under which they lived in a society in which economic conditions were far more difficult than they are now-although, God knows, we seem to be getting that way under this Government-in fact, had a conviction. Having discharged their debt to society they went on to hold responsible positions within the trade union movement and, ultimately, were a credit not merely to the trade union movement but to society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that this legislation meets the needs of the complexities of the social structures because trade unions are social structures which reflect the social aspirations of the group in the community they represent. I do not believe that legislation which is not geared to meet the complexities of those social structures will work. If it does not work all we are doing is putting on to the statute book one more piece of legislation which does not make industrial relations any easier. It makes them more complex. It is perfectly true to say that there is no great excitement or enthusiasm in the trade union movement, or indeed I suspect even amongst employer groups, one way or the other, about this legislation. Most of the unions and the employer organisations concerned do not see this legislation as affecting them particularly in their day to day operations. Officers of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with whom members of the Opposition discussed this legislation in order to ascertain their views, have made it perfectly clear that they regret this legislation coming forward as a somewhat meaningless cheap, political exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the legislation deals with the amendments the Government requires in regard to rules of unions to provide that the committee of management has to satisfy itself as to the details of any loan, grant or donation and which require such details to be filed annually with the Industrial Registrar. As one who, over many years, has had both a legal and a political relationship with a large number of unions it has been my experience that, for the most part, unions are very prudent and cautious-indeed, to the point of being conservative-in the handling of union funds. In the presentation of their balance sheets and accounts to their members they are very open. </PARA>
<PARA> I am bound to say, again from my experience, that the average union organisation and the average union secretary is far more open and candid in the presentation of the accounts of the unions, its finances and its balance sheets, than are many of those who run our large financial institutions operating within the corporate sector. From time to time-it is public knowledge in my party-my party has sought political donations from the trade union movement. When I was president of the Victorian branch of the Labor Party I, like every president before me, sought contributions. When those contributions were made they were not made secretly. They were publicly acknowledged in both the records of the union and the records of the Labor Party. More often than not a picture would be taken and published in the union journal which went to all the union's members of, usually, the union secretary or perhaps the president writing a cheque or making a donation to the Labor Party for the forthcoming election compaign. There was no secret about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister that we on this side of the House are putting the Government on notice. The Government is not entitled to say to the trade union movement that it will disclose its donations but that there will be another rule entirely for the corporate sector. A director of a large public company is as responsible for the management of his company's funds as a union secretary. If this Government is saying that we now require the trade union movement to make public its donations, the Minister may rest assured-regardless of whether he does it-that a future Labor government will have absolutely no hesitation at all in taking this precedent and saying that what is good enough for the trade union movement, which already handles its situation in this matter with an openness and a candour which is not repeated in the corporate sector, will certainly apply to the corporate sector. There is no reason why as a matter of law, principle or logic this Minister is entitled to say that we will make the requirement of disclosure operative upon a trade union secretary who wants to give $1,000 to the party of his political choice-usually that is the Labor Party -but that the director of a large company who wants to give a $50,000 donation to the Liberal Party will not have a similar requirement imposed on him. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason the Opposition, in order to test the sincerity of the Government on this issue, foreshadowed the amendment to the motion for the second reading which has been moved by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke ). It is a logical amendment. In my view the principle is unarguable. I would hope that, as the Government has adopted this standard for the trade union movement and its officers-let me say that this provision is not seen as being any great pain or penalty by trade unions or their officers because they already do this-we will see whether this Government has the sincerity of its convictions when it says that we will not have one rule for the trade union movement and another for the corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, in terms of its requirements for disclosure and in terms of its requirements that union funds be properly accounted for, goes further-as has already been pointed out by the honourable member for Wills-than the actual recommendation of the Royal Commission into the Activities of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation. Again we are not terribly excited about that, but we believe that point ought to be made. Of course, as the Commissioner recommended, loans made to officers of a union certainly ought to be fully accounted for and subject to full disclosure to the committee of management and to the membership. There again the Minister knows, as I know, that within that part of the corporate sector which is involved in the lending of funds many officers of companies get privileged treatment compared with that given to the general public and shareholders of the company when it comes to seeking a loan for housing purposes. I am not saying that there is anything irregular in that. If the manager of a large financial institution is disposed to give to a senior officer of the company who is of importance to the company a loan to buy a house or for some other purpose at interest rates well below the requirement of the general market, is that a matter that ought to be disclosed to the shareholders of the company? Is that not a matter on which again the standards ought to be the same?</PARA>
<PARA> I think the problem with this legislation essentially is that the Government has had recommendations from two royal commissions and, without looking at the social context or the history of the unions involved and without looking at the extent of practices essentially operating within a very limited area and relating to the history of the industries concerned, it has produced legislation which I believe, for the reasons I have outlined to the House, goes further than is necessary. When the Government goes further than is necessary in the field of industrial relations it often produces a result completely adverse to the result it is intending to achieve. I beleive the Minister would do well to ponder the remarks that have been made and to consider whether some of the proposals made by the Opposition in respect of this legislation should be incorporated in it before it passes to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles) have actually shown considerable misunderstandings about the nature of this legislation. I shall deal with their remarks in a few moments . I start with the remarks of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). In fact I wish to congratuate the honourable member for North Sydney for the work that he has done over time to help introduce a piece of legislation of this kind. He has spoken about it quite often and he has been helpful in its preparation. As he said, I do not think any reasonable person would doubt the necessity for legislation of this kind. As he and all other speakers have acknowledged, and I acknowledge, we expect it to be used rarely. That does not in any way gainsay the need for legislation of this character. I shall dispel the misunderstandings of the Opposition as I proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will be seen that this legislation is in no way an overreaction or too extensive to meet the quite limited but serious situation to which it is directed. The honourable member for Wills in his approach and in moving his amendment was concerned that we be even-handed. I remind him that in my second reading speech I acknowledged that we were endeavouring to draw upon the Companies Act. I also said:</PARA>
<PARA> The policy in relation to these companies provisions is under consideration in the context of the planned exposure draft of the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1983. It is hoped that the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities will later this year agree to this exposure draft being made available for public comment. The Attorney- General (Senator Durack) has directed his Department to ensure that when the public comments on the exposure draft are being examined, consideration is given to the question whether the companies provisions need any amendment so that, as far as possible, they cover the same range of offences as those set out in proposed sub-section 132F (1) contained in this Bill and to the question whether any other adjustments would be desirable to the companies legislation to bring it into line with the relevant provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>In that spirit the Government has sought to marry together the concepts of the Companies Act with the concepts which it believes should prevail in respect of office holders of registered organisations under this legislation. Where we have found them to be out of kilter we have indicated a willingness to seek to have the Companies Act brought into line with this amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same spirit I am quite happy to refer to my colleague the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N.A. Brown) the matters referred to in this amendment in order to have them examined by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, because it is, of course, uniform with legislation enacted by the State governments. I have no difficulty at all in putting that forward even though I agree with the points made by the honourable member for North Sydney that the even-handedness of this provision lies in its application to all registered organisations, whether they are employer organisations or trade unions. Nevertheless, as we have been drawing so liberally upon the Companies Act, quite clearly I would be happy to refer that to the Acting Attorney-General to see whether similar provisions can be extended to that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> When I come to deal with the remarks of several of the Opposition speakers regarding donations it will be seen that the legislation is nowhere near as extensive and embarrassing to organisations as has been painted by some Opposition speakers. But there is no question that the public would consider that the response of this Bill to the revelations of both the Winneke Royal Commission on the Activities of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation and the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union is appropriate. We are talking of an abuse of office and the unfitness of persons to hold office. We have said, and all speakers have said, that this will apply to only a very small minority of registered organisations. But there is no doubt from a reading of the reports of those two royal commissions that serious offences occur in relation to the holding of office in the case of the Builders Labourers Federation and that the most grave aspersions one can imagine have been cast in relation to the criminal records and therefore the unfitness to hold office of some of the persons who currently hold office or who have held office in the Ship Painters and Dockers Union. There is just no question in my mind that legislation of this kind is necessary. It is equally necessary in respect of the Companies Act. As the honourable member for North Sydney said, there are $2 companies and some of them have been involved in Nugan Hand-type operations. They are the smallest possible percentage of registered companies. But no company director finds offence at having this kind of legislation applied to him or her. Equally no officals of a registered organisation, an employer organisation or a trade union, should be at all offended by the application of these kinds of provisions to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Isaacs made the point that not all employer organisations are registered under the Act. That is true. If they are not registered under the principal Act or under a State Act similar to it, they do not get the benefit of tax deductibility for their funds. Not all the trade unions, of course, are registered either. Some have been deregistered; some have never been registered. Certainly the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the labour councils have not sought registration. </PARA>

I do not really think we need to take up the debate with these very minor points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Isaacs spoke of the Government's approach as being confrontationist. He said that it was not conciliatory. In fact, the legislation is designed to cure a quite specific defect. We are tackling this matter in what we think is a most appropriate and fair way. The legislation is certainly not designed to be confrontationist. Our support for the Australian Trade Union Training Authority, which again has received a quite substantial increase in funding in the Budget, is evidence of our concern to have effective professional trade union officials. I think that this measure could be seen to be complementary to our quite positive approach to training trade union officials. The Government parties when in Opposition always supported the Trade Union Training Authority. When we were in Opposition I was a foundation member of the council of the Authority. Since becoming Minister I have renewed my deep interest and direct involvement in the activities of that organisation. We have been quite bipartisan in our approach to that matter. I think this approach of weeding out or debarring people who are on any reasonable community standards unfit to hold office is a complementary side to our very positive support for an increased professionalism in the trade union and employer organisation ranks. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Isaacs used, in my opinion, some very intemperate and foolish words such as 'fraud' and 'front' in marked contrast with the very measured words of the honourable member for Wills. There certainly is justification on industrial relations grounds for this legislation in that it does seek to bar from office persons who are by any general community standards unfit to hold office. Certainly, and more importantly, what this legislation will do is protect the members of registered organisations from any corrupt officials. No one denies that there are some corrupt officials. Certainly, on the employer organisations side, I would not be the least bit surprised if over time there were people who had their finger in the till or who otherwise contravened the provisions of this legislation. I would not be at all surprised if over time more people in some smaller registered employer organisations were picked up. This is not an anti-union Bill; it is a Bill designed to protect the interests and financial concerns of members of organisations no matter which side of the industrial fence they are on. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made of youthful escapades. The honourable member for Isaacs referred two or three times to the stealing of a watch. I think the honourable member has overlooked the criteria and the case law which has been built up over a number of years in respect of the Companies Act. In fact, those criteria, which are quite explicit, are set out in clause 4 of the Bill. A great deal of experience has been gained and a great deal of guidance will therefore be available to the Federal Court in discharging its obligations under this Bill. A person could be convicted of some minor misdemeanour which is nonetheless technically a misdemeanour. However, a more serious criminal offence certainly has to be taken account of. As the House will note, under proposed section 132E the nature of the prescribed offence, the circumstances and nature of the person 's involvement in the commission of the prescribed offence, the general character of the person, the fitness of the person to be involved in the management of organisations having regard to his conviction of the prescribed offence and any other matter which in the opinion of the court is relevant, have to be examined. So this is a very carefully designed piece of legislation embodying the criteria of the Companies Act and case law and guiding the Federal Court in the application of the Bill. I do not think we could have been fairer or more thorough in the way in which we have prepared this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills said that the Bill provides for a double penalty in that there is provision already for offences under the principal Act and people may have paid their due penalty under that Act. He asked why they should be debarred from holding office if we believe that they have paid their debt under the current provisions of the legislation. We believe, and I believe, that society would support us, that if the offences to which he is referring are serious offences in respect of the discharge of office or if they go to the character of a person and there is a pattern of conduct-not an aberration but a pattern of conduct-which reflects adversely on the fitness of the person to hold office, it is the responsibility of the Government to protect members of the organisation from such a person and at least to expose the matter to judicial review. It is not that these people are debarred from holding office under this legislation. What we are doing is obliging the courts to examine a person's fitness against the criteria to which I have referred and in accordance with case law under the Companies Act. It is not in the nature of a double penalty; it is a protection for the organisation concerned that its office holders are people who conform with the basic codes of conduct which our society expects. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to the remarks that were made by the honourable member for Wills in respect of the provisions concerning recklessness. These words were drafted with some care. In fact, a great deal of thought was given to the way in which proposed sections 132F and 132D were drafted because we wanted to exclude the kinds of petty offences or wrongdoings that might otherwise get caught up. We all know that in the industrial relations arena not only can there be the sort of Christmas party festivities and so forth to which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred but also that at times of tension in industrial dispute settlement people sometimes can get into arguments in pubs and elsewhere and might even inflict unintended but nonetheless fairly serious injury upon someone. We wanted to try to exclude that sort of situation so we put in the word 'intentional'. It could be that the pattern is not one of thuggery. The tension of the moment could get the better of somebody who ordinarily would not resort to fisticuffs or whatever. We wanted to make sure that we did not catch up an otherwise impeccable career of an official. We do not want him to be ineligible to continue in office or to serve because of some slur of criminality . That is the reason for the inclusion of the word 'intentional'. The 'reckless use of violence' provision was deliberately designed not to catch the inadvertent damage by motor vehicle or some such thing but more the nature and pattern of the thuggery which has characterised some aspects of the building industry in particular where damage to persons and property has been part of the mode of operation and something which is quite intolerable to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the reasons. It is certainly true, as the honourable member for Wills says, that we have not drawn upon other legislation. But I think the courts are so used to expressions such as 'intentional' or 'wilful' that they will be able in the spirit of this legislation and having regard to the criteria set out in the immediately preceding section to understand the intention of the Parliament so that we do not catch up some much more innocent event. The honourable member for Wills raised the question of medical practitioners having been found to engage in reckless or negligent conduct and being able to continue to practice. I will refer that matter to the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) to see whether the Commonwealth has any role in that respect. But, quite frankly, we thought we drew that section in a way which was very much in keeping with the pattern of behaviour revealed by the two royal commissions and designed to prevent the inequities that otherwise might have appeared. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I have covered many of the points made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I hope I have covered the motor manslaughter provisions. If that offence is connected with excessive alcohol, it is rightly regarded as a criminal offence. If that offence was an aberration, under those criteria the courts can reduce the five-year period of disbarment. If a gaol sentence was involved, one would expect that the official would not any longer continue running the organisation from gaol but would, in fact, be ineligible to serve during that period anyway as a matter of practice. The community should not and does not take drink driving and, therefore, manslaughter cases arising out of it , lightly. Therefore, there is nothing in this Bill in respect of the period of disbarment that could be said to be unduly punitive. I stress again that this matter is open to judicial review and the penalty can be reduced. For example, in the event of a person going home from a dispute settlement and going to sleep at the wheel from sheer exhaustion, again the courts could take that into account. If a charge of manslaughter ensued, of course, the penalty would have to be reviewed judicially. I am sure if it involved an aberration in conduct, the courts would, under those criteria, take that factor seriously. I believe nobody could object to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Opposition in respect of the loans and donations matter has been quite paranoid. It was not our intention to do other than to conform with the Act as it currently stands. As the Act currently stands, Part VIIIAA and the supporting regulations cover all loans, grants and donations over $1,000, and contain provisions which enable members or the industrial registrar to get details of those loans or grants or donations from the organisation. That was a recommendation of the National Labour Consultative Council. As I am informed, the Australian Council of Trade Unions had no difficulty in accepting that proposal. In fact, this Bill does not require that these donations be published. It simply says that they must be approved by the committee of management, that there must be adequate security in the repayment arrangements in respect of loans and they must be made available to a member of the organisation at that person's request. </PARA>
<PARA> We could not have drawn the provision more narrowly. Had we tried to do so we would have excluded the very sorts of loans that were revealed in the Winneke Royal Commission into the activities of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation. For example, there were loans by the Builders Labourers Federation to persons who were not members of that union. It would not be in the interests of union members to have donations to persons who were not members of the unions exempted from this provision. What a nonsense it would be if the BLF members were entitled to find out about loans to members of the unions but not loans to friends of union officials. That is the very point which the Winneke report was concerned about. Neither the words of that report nor the words of my second reading speech should be seen as not narrowing that down. I cannot accept the amendment proposed but will refer it to the Attorney-General in the manner described and certainly take note of the concerns of the Opposition in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition wishes to move an amendment, which has been circulated in my name, relating to clause 4, page 5, lines 14 to 18 of the Conciliation and Arbitration (Management of Organisations) Amendment Bill. The amendment is in regard to proposed new section 132F (1) (b). I can be brief as I dealt with this matter in the second reading debate. So, I just indicate here that that proposed new section includes as prescribed offences those offences listed under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and its associated regulations . I simply make the point to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) that we regard this as a situation in which the legislation lays down its own set of penalties. We regard it as inappropriate that, in the circumstances of an official of a union or an employers organisation being found guilty of an offence and paying the penalty, there should be imposed this quite severe additional double penalty which is involved in making such an offence a prescribed offence for the purpose of exclusion from office. For those reasons, we say to the Minister that it would be appropriate that he should accept the Opposition amendment excluding that part of proposed new section 132F (1) (b) from the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I again make the point that in regard to the approach that has been adopted, the example that I gave before of members of the medical profession being involved in a fraud or dishonesty under the relevant regulations was not, I think, picked up by the Minister in his reply. I suggest to the Minister that there is really a double standard here. If a member of the medical profession has been so found guilty all that happens, as I am instructed, is that a statement is put up on his surgery wall or somewhere to say that he has been so found guilty. There is no suggestion of a double penalty in respect of his being precluded from pursuing his profession. I suggest to the Minister that this provision represents a double standard approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I also briefly make the point that I did not find entirely convincing the Minister's observations in regard to proposed new section 132F (1) (d). I simply flag that in respect of that provision I hope, whatever the good intention of the Minister was, that we do not find a situation where acts of officials, which he would not intend to attract the penalty of being excluded from office, by the vagueness of the wording of 'reckless' use of violence or the causing of death or injury to another person or the reckless damaging or destruction of property will be caught up. We may find that that paragraph is capable of catching up acts which were neither intended by the Royal Commisioner to be covered by what he was talking about nor indeed are in the mind of the Minister. Having made these points, I simply move the amendment which I have circulated and which I repeat seeks to exclude from the legislation the proposed new section 132F (1) ( b). I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that I have already in my summing up on the second reading covered that point. While I am not sure that we have any legislative authority in respect of fraud and dishonesty by doctors-I think it is purely a State matter-I will take the matter up with the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton). Without condoning fraud or dishonesty by the medical profession, I could see a difference to the effect that having been guilty of fraud or dishonesty of itself does not disqualify a person from being an effective medical practitioner in the strict sense. Of course, this provision is aimed at the conduct of people in respect of the holding of office. Therefore, anyone who has been guilty of any of the offences listed here has been involved in something which clearly is improper, whether it is tampering with ballots, the defalcation of union funds or whatever. That does go very much to that person's character.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will refer that matter to the Minister for Health. Again, whatever the shortcomings of that legislation, State or Federal, for the time being it does not gainsay in my view and in the Government's very firm view the judgment that members of an organisation, whether they are employers or unions, are entitled to be protected from officials who would contravene what is generally seen to be a proper standard of behaviour. There is an avenue for judicial review. If the application of this section is, in the eyes of the courts, deemed to be harsh in a particular case the court may reduce the period of disbarment from five years to nothing at all. So really there is total discretion there. The Opposition would be wise to see how this matter works out in practice. Certainly through the National Labour Consultative Council and through a review of the Act which is now under way and which will find its way back to the National Labour Consultative Council there will be avenues for review on a tripartite basis and certainly on a government basis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I wish to say that the Opposition does not oppose the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill. We welcome it. I will not refer to all the details of the 11 or so amendments because the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) detailed them very thoroughly in his second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum. On behalf of members of the Opposition I wish to record our thanks to the Australian Wheat Growers Federation for keeping us well informed of the genesis of these amendments, part of which flowed from the national grains conference last year. The way the Federation argued them through its own conferences and its own associations has been very encouraging indeed because these measures represent quite an advance in the marketing of wheat. The Australian Labor Party still backs the Australian Wheat Board as a single seller of wheat, but in these times when there is a fair amount of debate going on about flexibility I do not think we should wipe out discussion-I emphasise the word 'discussion'-about the flexibility that could be granted to licensed agents . The Opposition has no clear policy on that matter; it is something that should be discussed in the interests of flexibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we are all aware, the wheat industry is to go before the Industries Assistance Commission for the next five-year plan, and the IAC will have to report by about 30 September 1983. Tonight we are discussing interim adjustments -if I may put it that way-to the present plan. We will have a new wheat Act for the 1985 season. In terms of these amendments and the marketing flexibility that the Wheat Board will now have, I should also like to take this opportunity to say that it is just as important to pay attention to the role, the function, the organisation and the composition of the Australian Wheat Board. The Labor Party hopes that some of these matters will be given attention, as well as marketing flexibility, because the Wheat Board is a statutory marketing authority that handles very large sums of money-something like $2.5 billion last year-and it is very important that it be properly structured, that adjustments and changes to the way in which it acts be put through the Parliament and that it be given as much flexibility as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of discussion in this Parliament and in the past one about ministerial responsibility, ministerial control, the delegation of authority, and accountability, and the Australian Wheat Board has been at the centre of some of these discussions and findings by committees. We welcome the fact that the Wheat Board is coming out of a period in which it was under a lot of attack, particularly by the Auditor-General with respect to the presentation of its accounts. One of the amendments tonight makes it easier for the Board to record accounts and the closing of its pools from one season to the next. We welcome this measure very much indeed. I think it is very important that the policy of the Wheat Board be separated from marketing to a functional degree because the marketing arm of the Wheat Board certainly requires as much flexibility as possible. The marketing arrangements in this Bill are a great advance. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess it is appropriate to look quickly at the world scene and the Australian scene. There is a large crop of wheat in the world at present. The United States price support program will probably keep prices at about their current level. Production is up in Western Europe and it is down in Eastern Europe. There is a near record crop in the United States, and there is a disastrous crop in Australia. I think we are all very much aware that the present drought, as far as Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland are concerned, is very much a wheat belt drought. I hope that the Government will recognise that fact next season as some wheat growers will not get all that much advantage from the generous drought measures announced by the Government in terms of the provision for buying seed for next year's planting. </PARA>
<PARA> The world situation always concerns Australian wheat growers. One could take a very pessimistic and a very optimistic view of how our future will go in this regard but it seems to me that the reality always comes down somewhere in between. If we did have two or three bumper harvests in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and a rapid expansion in the European Economic Community, if the Americans used their loan rates and commodity credit programs, and if stocks went up and then they provided a lot of credit facilities, this would cause a lot of trouble in this country. On the other hand, if the USSR has continuing problems with its wheat production, if there are downturns in United States of America and Canadian production and if there are some reforms in some of the inadvised economic policies of the EEC, we would have a situation where world prices would boom. As I have said, I think the situation is always somewhere in between. I would think that next season, as the Americans have their granaries full to overflowing, they would willingly activate their set aside program. World trade this year will be of the order of a 100 million tonnes. This figure is probably a bit up on what it was last year or so. Recently President Reagan announced that he would be sending more wheat to the USSR. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of our policies with respect to wheat, and the situation of Afghanistan. Australia, under the Fraser Government, went along with President Carter who put grain bans on the USSR. We had a problem inasmuch as we did not know which United States Administration slavishly to follow. Of course we ended up not following. We just paid a bit of lip service to both Administrations as our trade with the USSR has gone up many times. I think we should move to more regular trade with the USSR instead of abusing that country selectively for domestic political advantage. The realities of world politics are such that in moral terms I cannot see what is diferent from the USSR policy, the murder in Afghanistan, United States policy with respect to Nicaragua, El Salvador or, going back a decade, Vietnam. It is not just a question of ideology . It is a question of large powers acting out their own interests. Of course I accept that the United States is an ally. It is a friend of this country. In the case of wheat, of course, it is a competitor. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Australian situation we see that our wheat output was estimated by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics at the end of October to be 8. 9 million tonnes. It is my understanding that that estimate has gone down a bit further to about 8.6 million tonnes which is barely half of last year's crop. Barley and oats are in the same position. If I can just read from the BAE's grain estimates, the winter cereal production is estimated at 11.6 million tonnes-about 10 million tonnes less than last year. Of course this is due entirely to the failure of the critical spring rains over most of eastern Australia. There have been some patchy rains in parts of these States in September but they were not sufficient to stop further large reductions in the size of the crops. Some of the seeded areas are being grazed off, have been grazed off, or are being cut for hay but, of course, farmers wish to avoid the risk of total loss on fields severely stretched by moisture deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Three south-eastern States-New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia-are expected to produce only about 2.8 million tonnes of wheat this year. That is the lowest output for these States since 1957. The worst State is Victoria where the crop is estimated at a little bit over half a million tonnes which is only 24 per cent of last year's crop and the smallest in that State since 1934. The overall picture would have been even worse but for the average or better rains received during August and September in most of the Western Australian grain belt. That State's wheat crop should yield slightly better than average this year and is forecast to produce about 5.5 million tonnes, although my colleague Senator Peter Walsh from Western Australia tells me that the wheat in some parts of Western Australia is not as good as he expected when he was there recently. As I have said, it is very much a wheat belt drought. Interest rate provisions under the drought assistance measures introduced by this Government will help wheat producers, particularly those who have bought machinery. Many wheat producers will try to sit this drought out and hope for a better season next year. I hope that this Government is open to any requests from wheat producers. Perhaps it can help with seed purchases when they replant. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall go through the amendments briefly. They will apply from 1 October 1982 for two seasons. As I said, the current IAC hearings are intended to recommend the arrangements thereafter. The revised arrangements will be backed up with changes in legislation in each State as the whole system depends on complementary Commonwealth-State legislation. The proposals came from the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and the Australian Wheat Board and aim to improve the commercial flexibility of the Board. I think a lot of this arose from the grains conference of last year. These 11 amendments have become necessary to complete the operation of the five-year plan introduced in 1979. One additional measure that the Government has initiated, of course, is the amendment with respect to the import of wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> The substantive amendments are that the Australian Wheat Board will be allowed to hedge sales of wheat and commercial borrowings through the wheat futures markets and the financial futures market. The legislation is carefully drafted to define hedging so that there is no speculation on future markets. If one speaks to wheat growers one finds that they are still a little worried or concerned about the whole idea of futures. I guess that it is a fair statement to say that most people do not understand futures markets and they are somewhat worried. However, the bill is very carefully drafted. The Wheat Board will proceed with this added flexibility in a very thorough and professional manner. There is not any risk in the way that this venture on to the futures markets is going to take place. Another substantive amendment will be to give the growers a choice between several deferred payment systems to receive the guaranteed minimum price. Another amendment is that the accounting year becomes a seasonal year from October to September. As I have said, that will help the Wheat Board in its accounting. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment allows the Wheat Board to make provisional allowances and charges to cover quality and freight and then to adjust them later-again another measure for flexibility. Another amendment is to allow small quantities of wheat to be transferred between annual pools to get them finalised earlier. I think this again gives added flexibility. Another amendment allows wheat to be redelivered to growers for stock feed purposes at a discounted Australian Wheat Board price. This is in the interests of growers, particularly in a drought or where they have delivered more wheat than was wise. There is an allowance also for the Australian Wheat Board to accumulate reserves. I think this is to be welcomed. The financal relationship between the Board and the authorised receivers in each State will be altered to some degree. Another amendment, as I have said already, will allow the Wheat Board to import wheat. There will also be tighter control over the requirement for Board members to disclose their pecuniary interests in a matter being discussed by the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an amendment that states that food aid commitments on behalf of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau can be met by buying overseas wheat . I noticed yesterday that the Australian Wheat Board announced its estimate of receivals for this year to be 7.9 million tonnes based on a production estimate of 8.6 million tonnes. This means that the expected gross income from this year' s crop is about $1,480m. Last year the gross value of wheat produced was $2,535m . When we look at exports we find that the BAE estimates our export income from wheat will be down by about $200m even though Australia's production will be down by half. This means that this year there will be only about a three per cent or four per cent decline in the value of rural exports from a drought affected wheat industry. Next year may be a very different case indeed. The Wheat Board has been selling off its stock to meet its export commitments. Quite apart from the problems for the wheat industry the problems for the economy will come next year if we do not have a bumper crop to meet our export and local demand and replenish our stocks. I think it is proper to say that the drought and the situation of the Wheat Board should be a very good demonstration to people in the cities of how dependent we are on our rural exports for export income and how critical this is to our balance of payments situation. We have a balance of trade deficit of something like $9 billion. That necessitates maintaining high interest rates to get capital inflow. If we had a bigger wheat crop this year, and certainly stocks available for sales next year, we would be in a healthy position. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole situation makes me somewhat concerned about the Government's ability to manage the situation if there is not a bumper crop next year. I would like to explain why this is so because the wheat industry links very directly to the general macroeconomic management of this economy. Other than a paragraph at the outset of the Budget handed down by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on 17 August no indication was given that there was a major drought in eastern Australia. There was no indication that hundreds of millions of dollars would shortly be allocated for drought relief. At 17 August the Budget deficit was estimated at $ 1.6 billion. As honourable members know it was an election Budget and the Government was prepared to expand the deficit by that degree. Less than two weeks later we had an indication that the deficit could easily double. It could double because export income would be down and government expenditure would be up probably by $700m part of which was with respect to two drought measures-the fodder subsidy and the interest rate subsidy, let alone the extra funds for carry on finance and other drought measures. The Budget deficit figures are clearly going to be blown out by wrong estimates of the unemployment levels and that has been the centre of debate in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government announced its expenditure on drought relief with almost no consultation with any of the States involved which have to administer the schemes. From my reading of the Senate's Estimates Committee transcript it was probably against the better advice of the Department of Primary Industry in its administrative procedures. The legislation was certainly rushed through Parliament. Will this Government ever have any long range plans for primary industry or will it simply react to crises and in the process create more crises ? I am pleased that the Government and the Minister for Primary Industry have commissioned a 600-farm survey to assess the impact of the drought on primary producers. I understand that the BAE will carry out the survey in the next three weeks and prepare a report for the Australian Agricultural Council. The Opposition hopes that the result of this survey will prove to the Government that there is a need for a long term drought policy, not ad hoc measures after the event. The question is: How are primary producers expected to budget and do their farm management planning when from one day to the next they do not know what assistance this Government will or will not provide? As I said on earlier occasions, I think droughts are different disasters from floods, fires or cyclones. For example, I know of producers in Victoria in drought declared areas who bought fodder the day before the fodder subsidy measures became operable. These producers will not be eligible for any assistance. I do not blame any one government for that but I am trying to illustrate the fact that when measures are not in place all the time some absurd situations occur. The example I have given is quite inequitable and one which the farming community finds impossible to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before in this House, the package of drought measures rewrites not only the farm management guide book for Australian agriculture but also our macroeconomic management policy. It is clear, from what has transpired, that the annual budget is not as important in this Government's management policy as this Government previously had us believe. Within two weeks the deficit looked as though it would double and by six weeks there were projections of it being $4 billion. In these amendments to the Wheat Marketing Act 1979 which is before us are references to the Government and the Minister for Primary Industry overseeing some of the commercial management decisions of the Australian Wheat Board which these amendments will allow. I hope that eventually these sorts of questions are defined more thoroughly with respect to all the statutory marketing authorities under the Minister's control. The questions of ministerial delegation and powers of direction are something that need to be more clearly specified. I can only say that given this Government's performance as an economic manager I do not see that provision as being much of a guarantee for the Australian public or the wheat growers. The Minister for Primary Industry's performance as overseer in the meat substitution scandal and with respect to P.T . Indomilk and the Reserve Bank of Australia loans to dairy farmers and the previous Minister for Primary Industry's performance with respect to the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd affair do not give me much faith in those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Wheat Marketing Act are to improve the commercial flexibility of the Australian Wheat Board and to allow it to use its commercial judgment in management decisions. I hope that this commercial judgment will extend to a recognition of what is also required by wheat growers. For example, the Barley Board has announced that barley growers will receive an earlier payment than usual to assist them through the drought period. I would hope that the Wheat Board will consider the similar plight of its suppliers and not just the best interests of the Wheat Board alone. It certainly has a very difficult job on its hands. </PARA>
<PARA> I touch briefly on the matter of domestic price. I think we are all agreed that the guaranteed minimum price mechanism is working very well; but, given the drought, there has been a bit of debate recently about the situation of the domestic price. By and large the present plan provides for the domestic price to be about 20 per cent above the export price. As we export so much, we have about a 15 per cent or 20 per cent premium on an average of 8 per cent of the crop. So , it is not something that gives the growers a great deal of benefit but it causes some concern to internal consumers. The domestic price is at present above the export price. For most of the period of the various wheat plans, the wheat growers have subsidised domestic consumers. That involves the transfer of well over $1 billion if one takes the full period since, I think, about 1947-48. I cannot remember the exact figure, but something like $1.4 billion seems to come to mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have to stick with this sort of arrangement. I think it is in the long term interest of the wheat industry and domestic consumers that we have some ups and downs, some flexibility and some sort of formula. One of the matters that is not recognised particularly by the community is that the flour mills are carried by the Wheat Board or the wheat growers inasmuch as the wheat is stored by the wheat industry and, effectively, credit is carried through the year so that the flour mills in Australia have their wheat flowing throughout the year and get the choice of the best qualities. The wheat industry is helping domestic consumers in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements for the pricing of wheat sold on the domestic market recognise the different uses of wheat-namely, for human consumption, stock feed and industrial purposes. The present Act provides for a fixed domestic price for wheat used for human consumption which applies throughout the marketing year and is uniform at all ports of export throughout Australia. That price is determined annually by the Minister based on a formula set out in the Act. For stock feed wheat, the Wheat Board can exercise more its own judgment. The formula takes account of the estimated current season's export price, movements in export prices over the previous eight seasons and those of the previous year in the index of prices paid by farmers. Movements in the formula price from year to year are subjected to a limit of 20 per cent. This limit applied in both 1980 and 1981. In addition, a further component is included in the domestic price of wheat used for human consumption to meet the cost of shipping wheat to Tasmania from the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia will produce an exportable surplus with or without government intervention. The principal function of intervention on the domestic market is price stabilisation and not price support. I am not fixed in my attitude about how best to provide price stabilisation but I would like to make a few points. The price paid on the domestic market over the longer term should reflect the prices received from sales to overseas countries of comparable grade wheat. I think it should be recognised by the industry that any premium built into the longer term price has only a marginal impact on growers' returns. This is because the domestic market absorbs such a relatively small proportion of total production. However, any premium falls heavily on Australian consumers and other rural producers. In fact, consumers bear the direct and indirect costs of any premium. That is, the premium is reflected, for example, in bread prices as well as in the price of eggs because of the feed wheat fed to hens and the nature of the intensive livestock industry in general. </PARA>
<PARA> I think consideration should be given to using the guaranteed minimum price as the instrument for stabilisation with no premium extracted from the domestic market. I am saying only that that is something that should be floated. I do not hold firmly to that view but it is something I expect the IAC will examine. I point out by way of qualification a consideration that under certain circumstances in the short term there is a case for including a premium under the domestic pricing formula. For example, when production is down, say, as a result of drought or world prices suddenly fall substantially below trend, growers returns and cost ratios fall for reasons totally outside their control. In those sorts of circumstances short term transfer from Australian consumers to wheat growers is justified as a useful supplement to a more general package of assistance. Advocates of a freer domestic market must recognise that such policies are likely to conflict with stabilisation objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to canvass two other matters briefly. They concern the transport, handling and storage of wheat. These remain the major problems facing the wheat industry, with the capacity or ability still to threaten the wheat industry's future prosperity. Any reform of the existing system will require existing participants to acknowledge that they are part of a national system and are not self-contained, autonomous components. The Wheat Board needs greater influence over the transport, handling and storage of wheat, but there are quite a few political impediments to prevent that from occurring. The State bulk handling authorities and the Wheat Board at various stages have not even been able to talk freely. If Australia is to minimise grower costs and to maximise marketing options, it needs to be able to specify where and when grain is to be transported and how it is to be segregated. To undertake this function adequately, the research effort of the Wheat Board also needs to be extended. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to talk about research. There is still within the wheat industry a quite active debate as to the extent to which potential yields flow through and are of direct assistance to the growers, the extent to which wheat breeding should still concentrate on top quality bread making and the extent to which wheat breeding should concentrate on disease resistance. As part of my research with respect to the plant variety rights debate I went to quite a few wheat breeding institutions and saw the magnificant work being carried out with respect to disease resistance, particularly at Wagga and some of the other public plant breeding institutions where scientists were very actively engaged in this form of research for the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is still an excessively bureaucratic system of committees and organisations with respect to research, and there is a need for some mission- oriented program of research. There are various committees in each State. While I would not say that they should be torn down, because they have been there for quite a while and the industry thinks they have served it well, I think there is a need to look at the overall research program and to give it a bit more mission orientation. Some recent work was published about the yield potential of wheat and how much of that flowed through. One study showed that of a 5.2 per cent increase in wheat yield only about 0.9 per cent was actually due to the plant breeding. It was more a question of the yield potential being reached because of technology, rotations, agronomic practice and farm management. I think there is still a lot of room for reform with respect to the overall classification of Australian standard wheat in Australia's wheat breeding programs. It seems to me -I think the Wheat Growers Federation agrees-that too many wheats are placed into the one overall grade and that there is a need for more indications, more messages, more signals, to be sent back to the industry in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not take up the time of the House any longer. The Opposition welcomes these measures. They give the industry a lot more flexibility. They came from the industry itself. They did not come from the Government. The Government has acted reasonably quickly on this occasion to implement the wishes of the wheat industry. I have stressed through this speech that they will give the Wheat Board a lot more marketing flexibility. They will give the Wheat Board the chance to exercise its commercial judgment. What is needed more and more is for the big agricultural marketing authorities which show the potential, the ability and the capacity to exercise commercial judgment to be given the opportunity to do so. They should be free from as many controls as is possible. The Opposition welcomes the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill contains some very significant and widespread amendments to the Wheat Marketing Act 1979. The implementation of these amendments will bring into being those proposals put forward by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and the Australian Wheat Board for variations to the existing wheat marketing and pricing arrangements. This season, as the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has already said, the cereal production throughout Australia will be very much reduced. The very severe drought that we are experiencing, particularly in the eastern States, also coincides with a world-wide economic recession and this has resulted in a major loss of confidence in our rural areas. Many economic uncertainties exist today across the whole face of rural Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess all of us realise that drought is an inevitable part of rural life. It is also a paradox that the worst farming conditions on the eastern side of Australia in at least 40 years follow one of the most incredibly productive seasons in Australia's cereal industry-the 1981 season. We all appreciated, too, that rural communities are total communities. Farmers, small business people and rural wage earners appreciate their dependence on each other and it will need a combined effort using all our resources to overcome the difficulties of the months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural sector of Australia has undergone massive change over the last 50 years. The farming sector generally has been able to meet the challenges of technology, the impact of rapidly increasing fuel prices and the destructiveness of inflation by improved farm techniques and increased productivity. I think this drought is now bringing home to many people in our urban areas the importance of agriculture to the economic viability of this country. The amount of $8,000m annually has been the average of rural export returns over the last 10 years. I believe we have the capacity to double this amount over the next 10 years. Unfortunately, at the present time, world economies are sluggish and protectionist policies throughout the world are growing. Major markets, such as the European Economic Community, Japan and the United States of America, are restricting trade, and trade with the Soviet Union and its allies is always subject to political interference. The months that follow will be a testing time for all our communities because of the drought, declining farm returns, high interest rates, and, as I have said, tariff barriers. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does a number of things. The proposals in this Bill empower the Australian Wheat Board to operate on wheat futures and financial futures markets , to establish financial reserves and to introduce options in arrangements for the payment of a guaranteed minimum price. Proposals put forward by the Australian Wheat Board will be accommodated in this Bill in the context of the current severe drought conditions. The Bill will empower the Board to import and market domestically foreign wheat should the need arise. Additionally, the Bill will enable the Australian Wheat Board to act on behalf of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau to secure foreign wheat for Australia's food aid program if necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing marketing and pricing arrangements will rely on complementary Commonwealth-State legislation and each of the States intends to amend its legislation to put the revised arrangement into effect. The revised arrangement will apply to the 1982-83 season, beginning on 1 October 1982. As I have said, the Australian wheat industry and particularly the Australian Wheat Board will experience very severe difficulties in the month ahead, particularly in the marketing area. Severely reduced production will make it difficult to service our major markets-markets that have been developed with great expertise and effort over the years-and will make it difficult for the Australian Wheat Board to meet Australia's responsibilities to the world food needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates released earlier this month by the Australian Wheat Board and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics indicate that the 1982-83 wheat crop will be well down on the 1981-82 level of 16.3m tonnes. The BAE had estimated that the 1982-83 production would be about 8.9m tonnes while the Australian Wheat Board's estimate was 8.6m tonnes, which is the lowest since 1972. I believe that this estimate could be well reduced even further in the days and months ahead. As I said production is down significantly in all our eastern States but fortunately, in contrast, I hope that in Western Australia we will have a record crop for harvesting. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some of the specific proposals in this Bill. Probably the most significant proposal is that which will give the power to the Australian Wheat Board to operate on wheat, financial and currency future markets. It will give the Australian Wheat Board use of futures markets which will enable the Board to hedge on the wheat future market of the world. It will give the Australian Wheat Board the ability to hedge on the currency futures market and financial futures market to protect Australian wheat sales and also its commercial borrowings used to finance payments to growers. It will provide authority for the Board to hedge transactions on futures markets which will enable it to use a marketing mechanism that is accepted in the international commercial trading of grain. Of course, it will allow secure price assurances for our unsold wheat. I also emphasise in relation to this proposal that the definition of hedging has been included in the Bill to preclude any suggestion of speculation by the Board on futures markets. Of course, the Board's future operation will be subject to very strict guidelines approved by the Minister for Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A further proposal in clause 6 of the Bill enables the Australian Wheat Board to establish financial reserves from the 1982-83 season onwards and to deduct money from the sale of wheat and wheat products from those reserves. It will allow for deductions for reserves and these will be excluded from the guaranteed minimum price arrangements. Details of reserves will be disclosed in the Board's annual reports. When reserves are no longer required money in the reserves can be distributed for the benefit of the wheat industry. In this Bill we have assured that the Government's financial liability under the guaranteed minimum price arrangements will not be increased as a result of deductions made from these reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> For a number of years-particularly in my electorate which is one of the major wheat growing regions of Victoria and Australia-growers have been requesting a better system of payment. One of the proposals contained in the Bill will enable this to take place. Farming today is of a sophisticated, modern nature. It requires more flexibility and a better ability by the wheat industry to manage its financial situation. As a result of the proposal which is contained in clause 7 the Australian Wheat Board will be able to enter into optional arrangements for the payment of the initial advance of the guaranteed minimum price entitlement to growers. Under these arrangements growers will still be able to receive their guaranteed minimum price entitlements as a lump sum on delivery of wheat or, if preferred, in the form of two or more payments on conditions as determined by agreement by the Australian Wheat Board and the grower, subject to equity being preserved between growers. </PARA>
<PARA> A further proposal simply gives authority for the Australian Wheat Board to make advance payments to growers other than the initial advance without the approval of the Minister for Primary Industry. This will remove an unnecessary control and quicken procedures for payment. Contained in clause 6 of the Bill as well is a proposal that will enable the Australian Wheat Board to transfer a residual stock of wheat from one pool to another subject to the Australian Wheat Board having determined a price for that wheat. Of course, it is the intention of the Minister to consult with the Board as to the desirability of its determining and announcing each season its policy in respect of the residual stock which is intended to be transferred to these later pools. </PARA>
<PARA> In another proposal contained in clause 11 the Australian Wheat Board will be able to allow growers to redeliver wheat of one season to a grower subject to the terms and conditions determined by that Board. It will ensure that the redelivery provisions give growers the option of obtaining stock feed wheat by taking delivery of wheat delivered by them. The delivered wheat of course need not be of the same quality as that of the previously delivered wheat. The price charged for redelivered wheat will be determined by the Australian Wheat Board and will be equitable between growers. This will be based primarily on recovering the guaranteed minimum price with adjustments for quality and storage and handling costs. A further proposal in the Bill will enable the Australian Wheat Board to make payments to authorised receivers on the basis of rates determined by the authorised receiver in each State and in accordance with the remuneration agreements in force at the time. That is contained in clause 17, and it allows for that remuneration by the Australian Wheat Board for costs incurred by its authorised receivers to be at specified rates. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other proposals in this Bill, but one which is important, in view of the current discussions relating to statutory authorities in this country, is the adoption of an accounting period in line with the crop year ending 30 September. This will bring the Australian Wheat Board's financial year in line with the crop year and ease administrative overloads. Following on from this change, the Australian Wheat Board's annual report will be submitted to the Minister for Primary Industry by 31 March of each year, instead of 30 June, unless a later date has been approved by the Minister. It may, of course, be necessary to extend the reporting period for the Board's next annual meeting, which will be during the transition year. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one further proposal that should be mentioned is the proposal in the Bill that will enable the Australian Wheat Board to determine provisional allowances for the quality of wheat delivered, and for State freight, handling and storage charges, and to make adjustments with respect to individual growers by the amount that the provisions differ from the allowances determined at their final level. This will be more equitable than the existing arrangements under which the full amounts of the charges and allowances, which can differ significantly between growers, are not necessarily brought to the account of those individual growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to that proposal which empowers the Australian Wheat Board to import and market domestically foreign wheat should the need arise. This measure has been brought about because of the current widespread drought. Its purpose is to give the Australian Wheat Board increased flexibility in the complex task of allocating limited wheat supplies from the 1982-83 crop amongst the needs of its regular and major export markets and the requirement of the domestic market and for our food aid programs. Any imports of wheat will need to satisfy quarantine requirements and be subject to the approval of the Minister for Primary Industry under the Customs regulations. Before the Minister gives approval under these regulations to the import of any specific shipments of wheat he will need to be satisfied that the import arrangements are in respect of a specific demonstrated requirement for that wheat, that it will comply with quarantine requirements, that it is consistent with the existing orderly marketing arrangements under the Wheat Marketing Act and that it will not create logistical problems at Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to satisfy these requirements and in view of the Australian Wheat Board's predominant position in wheat marketing arrangements, it is expected that any application to import wheat will emanate from the Australian Wheat Board. I believe it is important that the marketing arrangements for domestic and foreign wheat are consistent, otherwise they will be inequitable between users and will undermine existing orderly marketing arrangements. Accordingly, the price charged for foreign wheat will need to be consistent with the pricing policies for Australian Wheat as set out under the Wheat Marketing Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The final proposal that is of some significance to our aid programs is the proposal that will allow the Australian Wheat Board to act on behalf of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau to secure foreign wheat for Australia's food aid programs. The Act is being amended to enable the Australian Wheat Board to act on behalf of the ADAB in securing foreign wheat to meet our food aid commitments, and it is important that the Australian Wheat Boards' expertise is used in negotiating shipments of foreign wheat direct to Australia's food aid recipients. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979 the Government adopted recommendations made by the Bowen Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest relating to a code of conduct for all persons holding statutory positions of public trust, including members of statutory authorities. Accordingly the opportunity has been taken in these Bills to incorporate the necessary change to existing provisions in the Act regarding conduct of members of the Board to align them with the requirements of that code of conduct. The provisions as amended by the Bill are consistent with such provisions in legislation enacted since 1979. Similar amendments are being made to statutory authority legislation in force prior to 1979 as the opportunity arises. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Opposition does not oppose this Bill, which was obvious from the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa as he tended to speak about issues other than those contained in this Bill. I assure him that if he wishes to travel into the farming community area which is suffering from widespread drought at this time, he will find that the Government's very significant and generous proposals that have been put forward concerning a number of drought measures are understood and appreciated. I can assure the honourable member that no more generous proposals than these have been initiated by any Federal government in Australia. This Bill, as I said earlier, does give effect to the specific requests of the Australian wheat industry. It provides a new flexibility to meet current conditions and gives the Australian Wheat Board the capacity to operate in a sophisticated trading environment. Of course the amendments are a product of the wide consultative process that this Government, and particularly the Minister for Primary Industry, conducts with the Australian wheat industry and all other rural industries in this country. Of course, the Government very strongly supports the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Australian Labor Party also to support the proposals put forward by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and the Australian Wheat Board. In doing so I make it quite clear that it does not necessarily mean that the Australian Labor Party supports either the National Party or the Liberal Party. Here we have legislation enacted on behalf of those people who are putting forward proposals to the Government. It must save the Government a lot of problems and work when organisations such as the Wheat Growers Federation and the Australian Wheat Board are prepared to put so much time into drawing up proposals to enable the Government to bring down legislation. It is no trouble for the Opposition to come into this Parliament tonight and actively support these proposals because it is quite clear that even from the first and last paragraphs of the speech made tonight by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) the work has been done by the industry. It just goes to show what sort of a situation can develop if there is a little socialism in the planning of the wheat industry rather than the so- called free enterprise that members on the Government side are always putting forward. It is no problem to us on the Labor Party side actively to support proposals put forward by the Wheat Growers Federation. There is no doubt that the organisation of a national wheat industry certainly is to the benefit of the wheat growers and to the general economy of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I go through my speech I will be able to point out to the wheat growers and to the public of Australia that they have a lot of problems as they would know at the moment not only with the drought and the world economy but also the Government which sits back and allows them to put forward proposals and which runs the economy to their disadvantage. The proposal of a guaranteed minimum price in the Wheat Marketing Act allowed for early payment to wheat growers with a 15 per cent variation limit. Something that needs to be pointed out is that many operations are funded by borrowings by the Wheat Board. Among the sorts of borrowings that last year created for the Government a lot of heartburn was the fact that the Wheat Board had to go on to the open market for funds at a time when the monetarist policies of this Government were such that people going on to the market for funds were creating enormous pressures on interest. Those interest pressures have rebounded very solidly against the farming community. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the adverse effects of the Government's policies in relation to farmers and particularly the wheat industry. One of the most crippling factors, besides the drought, that farmers face at present are interest rates. We know that because of the drought the Government has decided to give some rebate on interest rates, but that will not go to the majority of farmers. There is no doubt that they will find that out as time goes along. The assistance which some farmers will receive until it rains will not be of any benefit in comparison with what good economic management of this country would have achieved. In fact, if the Government had collected its taxes from the time when it took over in 1975 and started to collect the oil levy within my area in Gippsland-and it probably had the best economic base of any government in the Western world upon which to govern the country-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill clearly changes the Act in such a way that allows the Wheat Board to do certain things in the economy, including the futures market and hedging, for example, which are definitely economic adjustment matters. What I am saying is that, whilst the Wheat board can put forward proposals which are of assistance to it, this Government, by its own policies, is counterbalancing that assistance to the detriment of the wheat industry. One of the great costs in the industry is fuel. If fuel is not an issue as far as the wheat industry is concerned, I do not know what is. Of course the cost of diesel has gone up by something like 6c per litre . The farmers have to pay that sum and then seek a rebate. We are looking to another increase of 6c on 1 January. This results from the management of the economy because of which the value of our money is going down in relation to the value of American money. Many wheat farmers are well aware of the sort of approach that this Government has taken in respect of the economy. All these measures that the Government would like to take credit for are not those of the Government. If we look at the Government's policies, either those of the Liberal party or of the National party, we will not find too much in them about the sorts of matters in this Bill. Industry has to come forward with these proposals for the Government to be able to take action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have a counter-balance. We have a Bill which is of benefit to the farmers. It has been counter-balanced by the poor policies of the Government.

<PARA> I now move on to a point regarding the domestic consumption price. Over many years we have had a set price for domestic wheat which at times, even though it is only a small proportion of the amount of wheat that is produced, has been far in excess of the world export price. At one time, one could say that the domestic consumer was subsidising the wheat industry to some degree; but any proper evaluation over a period clearly shows that the position equals itself out over a period. There is no doubt that the policy that the Wheat Board has had in operation for many years is one that whilst at times is harder on the domestic consumer over a period equals itself out. Even though at times it is playing to the producer there will be other times when the producer will subsidise the consumer. That is one point in this Bill that we do not oppose but we believe that it needs consistently to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to a couple of other points. One is mentioned in the Minister's second reading speech, a copy of which I have before me and which relates to the powers of the Board and its futures operations. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will empower the Board to hedge wheat and financial transactions on future markets thus enabling the Board to secure price assurances for its unsold wheat. The Government accepts the view of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation that the Board should be authorised to hedge on future markets at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again the Government does not take the decision on its own. It clearly outlines that that is the view of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The authorising of the Board to hedge transactions on futures markets will enable it to use a marketing mechanism that is accepted in international commercial trading of grain. Experience has shown that the hedging of transactions on futures markets facilitates grain trading. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth making a couple of comments in that area. Of course our traders will be going into an area where thay have not had the experience that other people overseas have had. I hope that the Government will see that the right sorts of experienced people are appointed to deal with these futures markets so as to protect Australian industry and the Australian economy. The Minister further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposed arrangements the Board will be able to hedge on wheat futures markets, currency futures markets, and financial futures markets to protect its wheat sales and also its commercial borrowings used to finance payments to growers. </PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about a very vital issue. I would like now to quote from the ' World Agricultural Report', thirteenth volume, dated September 1982, an article by Greg Ansley entitled 'Collapse in rural America'. I think this is something of which all Australians, and all wheat growers in particular, should be well aware. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Rural America, with the rest of the nation, is in the grip of a slump that has all-too-ominous overtones of the Depression of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> Net farm income, adjusted for inflation, is at its lowest ebb since 1938. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers are living off their equity and many this year will pay more in interest than they'll earn from the property. </PARA>
<PARA> Total farm debt stands at more than $200 billion, with a debt/income ratio of more than 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> By mid-June the Commodity Credit Corporation had spent $10.5 billion on farm price supports and loans, against previous annual outlays of less than $3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>A massive increase in United States Government Budget spending is creating an enormous surplus. Mr Ansley continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The way things are going, federal farm price supports may add $9-$13 billion to a budget deficit that has already topped $100 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Support industries are in chaos. The collapse of elevator companies is so serious that the US Department of Agriculture has issued advice to farmers on how to reclaim their grain from bankrupt businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> Farm machinery and equipment sales continue to fall, with a combined $223.7m loss for the April quarter, posted by International Harvester and Massey- Ferguson alone. </PARA>
<PARA>We know what effect International Harvester Australia Ltd is having in Victoria at present. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment is running at 9.4 per cent, the highest level for 40 years. International Harvester has laid off more than 40,000 workers since 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasing pressure for more protection, especially retaliatory action against the EEC, is a major threat. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade warned that current world production trends could spark another 1930s-style crash. </PARA>
<PARA> Record crop projections and mounting stockpiles add to the problem, especially as there seems little chance of an early turnabout on global commodity markets. </PARA>
<PARA>These are the markets and the types of atmosphere into which this Government is now going to send Wheat Board futures dealers. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> For the grain trade--</PARA>
<PARA>This is vital to the wheat industry in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>those stocks are potentially devastating. If the US is moving to sell them off under subsidy it could launch what Australian Wheat Board Chairman Sir Leslie Price fears would be 'the greatest grain price war in history'. </PARA>
<PARA> And through it all, the overall US economy limps along with what even some Reaganomics supporters say is a slim (at best) chance of an early reversal. </PARA>
<PARA>It probably has as much chance as Fraser economics. Mr Ansley goes on with this vital paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> What happens now in the US is of immense importance to the rest of the world. Only America can inflict more harm on other economies than they can return and most farm sectors are depending on a US-led recovery for their own well-being.</PARA>
<PARA>Although we have had a big downturn in our wheat production because of drought it is of great concern to think that we are moving into a situation where the things that have been mentioned in this article could be vital to the future economy and the wheat growers of this nation. Mr Ansley further states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the rest of the world, probably the greatest threat of America's current woes lies in its potential for promoting greater trade protection. </PARA>
<PARA> The US believes it is getting the sharp end of the trade stick, especially in agriculture. Pressures for greater protection and retaliatory action are behind much of the current campaign against EEC farm subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA> Americans argue that the EEC is blatantly flouting an informal understanding reached in Tokyo not to cause disruption to their traditional agricultural market. </PARA>
<PARA> The US calculates that EEC subsidies have: boosted annual wheat exports from an 'historic' 7 m tonnes a year to 14 mt; cornered 20 per cent of the global sugar market; challenged Australia as the world's number one beef exporter; and snatched 35 per cent of the international broiler trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Europeans justify this on the grounds of the US trade deficit with the EEC, and last year's world-wide farm trade surplus of almost $27 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is warning that growing protection could spark an international liquidity crisis that could see a return to the 1930s style insolvencies. It says that we are following the run- up to the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA>I will now make just a few comments on the economy in Australia at the present time. As I said earlier, we could have been in a very strong position if our legitimate taxpayers had paid their share of taxes and this Government had been able to keep out of the market for funds. We may have had a situation in which interest rates were not as high as they are in Australia. We may have had a situation in which the economy was in a better position to withstand some of the excesses that it is feeling at the present time. International Harvester is in trouble not only in the United States of America but also in Australia. Wheat farmers are not buying tractors. They are not buying the equipment that they were buying previously. Not only because of the drought but also because of high interest rates. The Government must take some of the blame because of its economic approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to page 6 of the Minister's speech and speak a little about the finalisation of pools. The Minister in his speech states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wheat Growers Federation has proposed that when the stock of wheat held in respect of a season is reduced to a residual level the Board should be enabled to transfer it from one season to another. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition does not disagree with that proposal; in fact, it fully supports it. The Minister further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the Board should transfer residual stocks from one pool to another only when it has priced the wheat and such a transfer could not potentially cause or add to a call on the Government's commitment under the guaranteed minimum price arrangements. I will be taking up with the Board the desirability of it determining and announcing each season its policy in respect of the residual stock which is intended to be transferred to a later pool. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that the Minister should take a much stronger stand on that . He is saying that he will be taking up with the Board the desirability of determining policy. I think the Minister should have it clearly in his mind just what the position should be as far as transferring residual stocks from one season to another is concerned. He should clearly lay down some guidelines rather than take up at this stage with the Board the desirability of doing something. Surely to goodness the Government can do something on its own without waiting for the Board to give it advice. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to the last paragraph of the Minister's speech. I was rather intrigued by it. It clearly indicates the position from which I started. The speech states:</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments contained in this Bill arise essentially from proposals put forward by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and the Australian Wheat Board . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether the Government is trying to put itself in the position where if anything goes wrong it is not responsible for it. Certainly, the Minister has been putting paragraph after paragraph into his speech stating that these are proposals put forward by somebody else and not by the Government. The speech continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The revised arrangements take account of changed circumstances for the marketing of wheat since the current five-year plan was introduced in 1979. These proposals, especially in respect of imports and hedging, will assist the Australian Wheat Board in its complex task of marketing the Australian crop to the best advantage. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that this is a very complex task. Australia is very fortunate to have a wheat board and a wheat growers federation that are in such a strong position that they can clearly put to this Government advice which is of benefit to the industry. The Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA> Experience with the revised arrangements will be reviewed in the context of consideration of wheat marketing arrangements beyond 1983-84. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps the National Party of Australia and the Liberal Party and their organisations may be able to come forward with plans which will provide some stability in the wheat industry. Nowadays those parties place all their emphasis on proposals put forward by other organisations I point out to the Government and to the political parties that support it that perhaps they need some of those people back in their organisations. I know that a lot of those people are in the Australian Labor Party and we are very glad to have them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-One cannot help but be amused by the approach taken by the honourable member for McMillan ( Mr Cunningham). He tried, first of all, to chide the Government because of the continued co-operation and consultation that exists between the Government and the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. He chided the Government because it is prepared to accept amendments that have been worked through by the Federation after a great deal of consultation with me as Minister and with my Department over a couple of years. Of course, the honourable member for McMillan would not be aware of that bit of history. Strangely enough he then turned around and said that the Australian Labor Party has no trouble in accepting these proposals because they were put forward by the Wheat Growers Federation. He is trying to have his cake and eat it too. I am not sure what he is getting at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One thing I can say about the speech of the honourable member for McMillan is that Ralph Willis, the shadow Treasurer, is not at any risk. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) will recognise that. The simplistic approach of the honourable member for McMillan to the economy will ensure that he has no chance of ever being shadow Treasurer even though someone who sits in front of him might be a contender. At least Ralph Willis can rest easy on that point. There is no contention that the honourable member for McMillan has any mastery of economics at all. </PARA>

That is all we got out of the honourable member for Werriwa. That is about all the Australian Labor Party has in terms of agricultural policy at the best of times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been agreed the we have a cognate debate covering the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 1982, which will amend the Royal Commissions Act of 1902, and the National Crimes Commission Bill 1982, a new piece of legislation to establish the National Crimes Commission. The Opposition will move amendments to both measures. These amendments have been circulated. The amendments to the Royal Commissions Act will give commissions the power to summon witnesses and take evidence. A provision is contained in the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill for dealing with people who fail to attend hearings or who fail to produce documents. It deals also with the question of search warrants and self-incrimination. We accept some of those matters but we have moved amendments to this legislation to give more safeguards to the rights of people affected by it. A number of amendments to the National Crimes Commission Bill have been circulated. They relate to protecting the rights of people who may be obliged to appear before the Commission. If honourable members look at the drafting of the legislation they will see a suggestion that a commission has power to obtain evidence and search warrants. The question arises whether the hearings should be public as well as private. Of course none of this will relate to the prosecution; it is like a pre-trial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important when we are dealing with crime that we balance the situation and the rights of the individual are not affected. That is where we think these two pieces of legislation are defective. We want the Government to accept the amendments which have been on notice for some time. If the Government does not see its way clear to accept them we think that the legislation has a fatal flaw and we cannot be expected to support the proposals, not that we do not want to get to the real issues in dealing with crime. I think that is where one would like to start the debate on this matter. If honourable members look at Hansard for this session of Parliament they will see that we have spent an enormous number of days discussing what is called white collar crime, the failure to prosecute white collar crime and the failure to detect white collar crime. We have had a plethora of reports in a number of areas, whether it be the meat scandal, the tax scandal or something to do with the painters and dockers. One sees a whole mass of action taking place merely to try to tell us something that perhaps most people in the community know. That is that an enormous amount of crime is being committed. It is not being detected and it is not being dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make this point. We still have to adhere to the principles of justice. Anybody who is prosecuting a person has to have evidence. Everybody who is prosecuted is entitled to be assumed innocent until it is proven beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty. It is probably significant that earlier today a report by the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking entitled 'Nugan Hand (Part 1)' was tabled. Nugan Hand bank has disappeared. Nugan has died. Hand cannot be found and it is thought that he is dead. If one looks at the ramifications of the report one will see enormous problems in the normal course of events to detect and deal with high level crime . Legislation and statutes have obviously been designed for what one could call the horse and buggy days because that is about the extent of the technology, by way of transport or anything else, that was applied. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have massive international arrangements dealing with intelligence operations; the ability to gather intelligence across the world without leaving one's country; the ability to transmit funds into international bank accounts; and the ability to use aircraft. All sorts of extraordinary additions have come into play. These measures ostensibly assist a country in the normal course of its trade and commerce or defence, whether it be military activity or intelligence gathering. If the personnel who are involved in those sorts of actions becomes corrupt or addicated to criminal activity in a sense we say that perhaps we are unable to deal with it. That cannot be the situation. If one looks at Chapter 10 of the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, which I think came to light in September this year, one will see a number of matters which the Commissioner, quite properly identified as being of very great significance. </PARA>
<PARA> He mentioned the two unpublished reports which none of us, except the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and perhaps the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden ), has seen because they were confidential reports. In addressing his mind to those reports he spoke about the very serious nature of organised crime. He said that there are currently discussions in the highest places concerning the need for a Crimes Commission. Now the Government has gone on post haste, to say that it will set up a crimes commission. I would have thought, and I know that people thinking about this matter would have thought, that the Government would have been able to act at least in co-operation with the State governments irrespective of their political views. But the Government has not done that. In rushing this legislation into the Parliament it has bypassed the States. That is an extraordinary gaff in getting any sort of intelligent understanding of what we are about. Anybody who has been discussing a unit, a commission, a group or any sort of special secretariat has said that what we need is a body composed of a judge, the police and representatives of the public who are able to marshal all the resources that are needed to detect crime as against prosecuting criminals. There needs to be some co-ordination between all levels of crime detection in Australia. This will not happen under this proposed commission. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most significant suggestions of the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs was that there be access to tax records. Costigan also makes this valid point also. One is really stretching one's imagination to suggest that criminals who give evidence will tell the truth. In fact, he makes it very clear that they will continue to lie. That is their natural predilection. They have no intention of telling the truth. He said that it is only when one gets to the documentary evidence that one can ascertain that, in fact, they are lying. So one wonders why we will have a commission of unknown quality. The chairman might be a judge but the rest of the members could be any people one likes to name. This group will ascertain all the rights and wrongs of complaints and will assemble, with a view to prosecution of the offender, evidence of the commission of an offence. I think that is the wrong way to go about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am mindful of the fact that one has to get some balance on the question of what it is all about. Whenever the control of organised crime is considered, the investigative powers are stressed. But if the proposed Crimes Commission is to be properly constituted its hearings would have to be either secret or public. If they were secret, the possibility of all kinds of abuse cannot be overlooked. If, on the other hand, it operated openly and publicly and with the possibility of media coverage for the witnesses, there would be the real danger of trial by association. So honourable members can see the real problems of such a concept. Where do the rights of a citizen be if, in one sense, he is being investigated in secret or, in another sense, investigated in public. Both can do him or her untold damage. </PARA>
<PARA> We should look at the examples that we have had before us in recent times in this Parliament. I refer to the Berthelsen case which has nothing to do with crime as such. Berthelsen was an employee of the Department of Defence. He left that Department and joined the Auditor-General's Office. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence inquired into defence purchasing and Berthelsen gave evidence in camera to that Committee. One would expect that evidence to be confidential and secret and not made public to anybody. The evidence was that there was something wrong with the communications section of the Department of Defence and, as honourable members know if they look at the reports of this Parliament, that evidence caused the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges to meet. It took evidence from the top present or former public servants. It was noticed that a number of them were overseas at the time and were unable to give evidence. But those who gave evidence said that they found nothing wrong with Berthelsen. They said he was the pillar of propriety and an excellent person. However, Berthelsen made the point, which was subsequently substantiated by the Committee, that because he had given evidence in camera he was victimised. In fact, he was placed on what is called the reserve list of the Public Service, which is the nearest thing to commercial extinction one can find from the point of view of continuing to belong to the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making is that the man gave evidence in secret to a group of politicians of this nation, but there was no secret about what was said. Putting the situation at its best. The evidence he gave was immediately leaked to the Department of Defence. In fact, quite extraordinarily, the evidence was sent through the post, which seems to be our method of giving people some cover. Mr Berthelsen's evidence was sent to the Defence Department and he got somebody's else's transcript. If one looks at the minutes of the Defence Department one sees that the people in that Department solemnly met to consider how to counteract Berthelsen's evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter had nothing to do with criminal conduct but it had everything to do with the rights of a person who gave legitimate evidence in camera on what he felt was wrong with the communications system. I have made the point that he was about to be removed from the Auditor-General's Office and placed on the reserve list. All the witnesses who came before us said that there was nothing wrong with him but when we looked at the files we found that this man was ready for the high jump because he had done this dreadful deed of telling elected members of the national Parliament there might be something wrong with their communications system. </PARA>
<PARA> If one also looks at what happened recently in the Volkman case one must begin to wonder where the integrity of governments lies. The Volkman case involved a man who felt entitled to make a complaint to the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs that there was something dramatically wrong with the former Federal Narcotics Bureau. Volkman's evidence, which he gave in camera to the Williams Royal Commission, named individuals who were associated with white collar crime. He virtually wanted the appropriate authorities to have a look at whether there was some substance in what he was talking about. I have a copy of this evidence which was given in 1978. Volkman complained bitterly that he felt something was dramatically wrong with the Narcotics Bureau because it was not grappling with crime. He mentioned the Nugan Hand Bank; he mentioned the involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency intelligence; and mentioned people in high places. He talked about the laundering of money. He also talked about the mafia. But nothing was ever done. </PARA>
<PARA> Because this gentleman had enough courage and integrity to go before the Williams Royal Commission to give evidence in camera what happened to him? As it turned out, none of the evidence was in camera. The unfortunate person gave evidence, but some of the people who were apparently assisting the Commission-to use that term-felt they might have had a duty also to tell their superiors in the Public Service that Volkman had blown the whistle on them, to use the vernacular. What happened to Volkman after that? This is the modern day and age of democracy. Volkman was charged with sending birds out of the country. Of course, one of the things he had to do in the course of his job was to police that occurrence but he was charged with that offence. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the charges being laid a search warrant was issued. Officers went to his premises and immediately grabbed from him a copy of the in-camera evidence in which he named most of his colleagues-if one can call them that-who were guilty of some crime. He beat the first charge in a prima facie hearing on which the Government spent a lot of time. It even appealed against the magistrate's decision to allow evidence. He beat all those cases. The magistrate said: 'I do not think there is enough evidence to have a trial by jury'. Nine months went by and the present Attorney-General (Senator Durack) filed an ex officio indictment against Volkman. Eventually that too was quashed, but only after the Government spent millions of dollars prosecuting this man. It called 56 witnesses, including some from the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States. This poor unfortunate had to mortgage his home to defend himself.</PARA>
<PARA> What is the lesson in this? In the process of giving that evidence he began to talk about matters mentioned in the report on Nugan Hand, by the Commonwealth- New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking, presented today. He referred to massive international crime, to narcotics, to Nugan Hand, to the Central Intelligence Agency, to Australian Security Intelligence Organisation influence, to intelligence officers not doing their job but instead becoming mixed up in rackets for personal gain, and to the use of aircraft in and out of this country. He referred also to people who have since met their demise because perhaps they were involved in these crimes. It is a pretty horrendous story and in that these facts are known, is not being over-dramatised. </PARA>
<PARA> The guilt must lie in very high places. What was the real pressure upon the Government to persecute this man to such an extent? If he had been charged and found guilty of just exporting birds he would have been subjected to a pecuniary penalty but, instead, he was charged with conspiracy under the Crimes Act, which seems to be a novelty reserved for tax evaders and avoiders, because he might then have to do five years in gaol. The Government should look at its own intelligence operations and the motivation and influence for the Attorney- General spending so much of the taxpayers' money in pursuing a man whose only crime was to give evidence in camera. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are two examples of what can happen in a Crimes commission type of situation. Who would be prepared to go before a Crimes Commission and make a statement about something that he believed was wrong? Let me make the position very clear. There is a great and urgent need for a type of criminal investigation unit conducted at the highest level but I do not know that it ought to have a permanent structure. That would present dangers. The best safeguards would be to use the judiciary and not the police force, in the first instance. Because the judiciary would be removed from direct affiliation with the investigation of crime, if a citizen such as Volkman or Berthelsen felt that there was rottenness or corruption, whether in the Government, the Opposition, the bureaucracy or the police force, he could go somewhere and make a complaint to a judge, whether Federal or State, and say: 'I think something is dramatically wrong. Perhaps the taxation records or banking records would show it.' If the resources of the intelligence agencies would reveal it access to them could also be provided as well. The complainant would be protected. He would not be 'rubbed out', as happened to Cosgrave, one of the persons whom Volkman mentioned, or the Wilsons, who were buried because they had the unfortunate tenacity to make complaints. If a person comes in conflict with high level criminals the hit people, as is very evident from the Wilson situation in the United States, can soon get him. Wilson was a former CIA agent who was engaged in gun running, but no witness to the crime seems now to be available. </PARA>
<PARA> If all of these facts are put together and a need is seen to provide some sort of structure, the way proposed in this legislation is not the way to go. Who would want to appear before the proposed National Crimes Commission and make a complaint? One could not trust the fact that it was deemed to be made in private , especially in view of what happened to Volkman. Nothing can be private if evidence has to be given that way. It is far more important that a citizen be able to appear before some recognised official who would not disclose his identity, who could make appropriate investigations and then send such information as may be required to the Attorney-General or to the police for further action. In the process of building up such a structure it is important, as has been identified by all who are interested in the subject, that since we have police forces and other sources of information permanently employed, they ought at least be involved with each other in guaranteeing that there will be no mismanagement of information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed miserably by trying to bypass the States in this matter. It has no hope of running effective crime detection units if it bypasses the States. In most cases the States would have immediate access to known criminals through their police forces and would have details of all the company structures through their corporate affairs commissions. </PARA>

The Government has raced this Bill into the House. What chance do the States have to co-operate with this Government under this Bill?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the few minutes left to me let me advert to what the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) said in May. He said that organised crime had penetrated all Australian States and that there had to be action to ferret out the politicians and businessmen involved. I do not know what evidence he had of the involvement of politicians and businessmen but he said that he could have spent at least five sitting days in the parliament under parliamentary privilege having a real fling at a couple of people in government, had he wanted to do so. His duty was to do so. We have not heard from him since in that regard. At the same time the police chief said that he had no evidence at all against politicians. I do not know the motivation at the time of the Minister in charge of the police. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at other statements the Minister was making back in May. He said that we were losing the fight against crime and that a series of royal commissions had shown that we have major problems, including drug trafficking, arms dealing, the laundering of money, the corruption of officials and terrorism . Is it not about time that we had some real action in this regard? His own Commissioner of Police, then Sir Colin Woods, said that while he was reluctant to speak openly about other police forces, he was a strong supporter of joint efforts with other police forces to attack entrenched organised crime. The Opposition wants to help the Government to get an intelligent approach to this matter, because it is a question not of votes but of how we are to look at crime . </PARA>
<PARA> What did the Costigan Royal Commission into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union identify as the big problems? Costigan said that perhaps we do not have the appropriate personnel and that the right personnel have to be trained. He also raised the question of how that personnel might be equipped. He said that those personnel are not the police forces that we now have; they have to be a bit above that. He said that it was very difficult for federal police officers to understand white collar crime at its highest level. He said that white collar crime involved a number of people-not only the low grade criminal who might perpetrate the final act but also the mastermind behind the organisation. He mentioned the entrepreneur, the investor and the type of financier who was rarely present at the commission of a crime and who acquired a fair amount of financial acumen. He said that the amount of money involved was measured in millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not just a straight proposition. For example, Costigan said that drug trafficking required the movement of money out of Australia by international transactions. Nugan Hand was a way in which to do that. We cannot expect the average policeman to follow that sort of train of events. The Reserve Bank and other institutions should have had registers of money coming in and going out. It would not have been too hard to look at tax records. It would not have been too difficult to understand who were the sorts of people who might be involved. Had an intelligence agency used an aircraft to move heroine into the country, at least there should have been some suveillance of it. There should certainly have been some observation of people who were going in and out of the country without passports or visas and who perhaps were identified with crime. We need at the highest level some organisation that can clearly investigate justifiable complaints. Volkman made such complaints. Costigan talked about the problems of high level crime and how it runs into millions of dollars. He said that he was satisfied that the criminal organisation which is described in this report is flourishing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Just because the Government is establishing a National Crimes Commission it cannot really expect that it will deal with the problems. I suggest that the Government needs an intelligence unit. An intelligence unit would pick up all the intelligence sources within Australia, including the State sources. It would pick up the source of their intelligence information. The Government will make itself virtually counterproductive if it ignores the States and if they become hostile. I note from the public media that none of them now wants to be involved with the Federal Government in the establishment of a National Crimes Commission , not even Queensland or Western Australia. They feel the Government is trying to set up something of which they will not be a part. I can understand their concern, but what does it do for the Australian citizen who is very concerned about the fact that crime is rampant in Australia and when there is evidence of this from Costigan himself? Mr Costigan said:</PARA>
<PARA> The scope of this criminal organisation should not be assumed to be limited to Australia. It certainly includes . . . South East Asian countries. It stretches its tentacles to the USA and there is some evidence to suggest that the criminal elements of that country play a role in the execution of the schemes of this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>So they do. It is very clear that they do. The organisation went as far as international arms trafficking. Some of the deals mentioned were laundered by Nugan Hand. Who received the money? Surely that ought to be a source of interest to both the United States and Australia. Here we are bereft of any aptitude or evidence to try to establish what happened. I have asked the Prime Minister whether he had any evidence and he said: 'No, we have not'. People who have had any dealings with arms going to Argentina would know that at least one $30m contract went through Nugan Hand. Let us consider the massive amount of heroin which was imported into this country. Where did it come from? It did not come from within the country; it came from outside it. The people involved brought this material into the country by air. Apparently they had some sort of protective device because they were deemed to be associated wih intelligence activities when, in fact, they were associated with criminal activities. Nothing was done. Ever since there has been death and destruction and it is permeating our society. The correct remark was made today by the Minister who said that there has been an erosion of business morality. It is not limited to business morality; it permeates our whole structure. If the nation feels that the Government cannot grapple with this situation it must think that it is completely inept, as it would appear to be. </PARA>
<PARA> My plea to the Government in the final minutes of my speech is to have another look at the structure of the National Crimes Commission. We will agree with the necessity to deal with the ability to identify high level crime, but is this the way to go? The answer is no. Is it right to ignore the States? The answer is that it is not. Is it right to get some sort of co-operation whereby criminals can be dealt with both inside and outside Australia? Is it important to talk about the corporate structure and to ensure that it does not engage in continual crime, as it is doing? Costigan talked about Nugan Hand and others in the corporate structure who were mixed up with the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. He made the point that that was just a cosmetic front and that if the Painters and Dockers Union was closed down those organisations would certainly find another front-it would not matter to them. What is the Government doing about the criminals involved in these activities? Costigan virtually named them. The activities are not just limited to tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point, as which Costigan made very well, that the Government needs to appoint specially trained people-I would start with the judiciary-to identify the merits of the complaint. That would guarantee the protection of the informant who, in my view, would be at risk. If members of the judiciary were able to say: 'Yes, I have found some evidence', the matter should go to the appropriate body-whether it be the Federal Attorney-General or a State Attorney- General-to consider prosecution. That would not interfere with the rights of the citizen. It would be a case of merely obtaining access to the intelligence which was already available in Australia. It would mean that our own intelligence agencies were not above the law. It would mean that the Central Intelligence Agency was not above the law simply because it had some intelligent cover. The white collar criminals in this country would be dealt with. We have to establish that sort of concept. The Opposition's amendments to the legislation will merely try to give some rights to the citizen. I think the Government ought to have another look at the National Crimes Commission Bill to see whether it could be redrafted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to join briefly in this cognate debate on the National Crimes Commission Bill and the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill. The stated objective of this legislation, which is to secure investigation and prosecution of offences of a serious kind, particularly offences in the nature of organised crime, is, of course, commendable. Whether the apparatus to be set up to achieve these objectives is the best way of going about it is another matter, and I will come to that in a short while. What is interesting is the apparent rethinking or even the double take by the Australian Labor Party which seems to have rather belatedly signalled its support, albeit qualified support, for the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not long ago that the Opposition was firm in its public antagonism towards these measures. The gyrations of the Opposition culminating in a complete about face, as I see it, is something of a mystery to the interested observer. The Opposition's spokesman on legal matters, Senator Evans, gave an interview a couple of weeks ago on Australian Broadcasting Commission radio which did not give much of a clue as to the reasons for his party's change of heart. He did, however, confirm that the Labor Party was unlikely to oppose the legislation although again his rationale was not all that clear. The shadow Minister made one comment worthy of attention. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our concern is that although this is probably an effective model for a permanent crimes commission in the future, the real justification for it in the mind of Mr Fraser is to use it as an excuse for winding down, terminating eventually the services of Mr Costigan, who's been doing such an effective job, and replacing him, in effect, with someone more to this Government's political taste. </PARA>
<PARA>By intimating a preference for the appointment of Mr Costigan to head up the National Crimes Commission in the terms that he used, Senator Evans may simply have intended to divert attention from his party's back flip. The accusation that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was motivated by a wish to curtail Mr Costigan's work is clearly spurious. This Government appointed Mr Costigan to inquire into the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. It subsequently, when those investigations revealed large scale tax frauds, extended the terms of references to enable the royal commissioner to take in this new line of inquiry. That is hardly evidence of the Prime Minister's or the Government's preoccupation with Mr Costigan's politics or his political preferences. However, it does say something about the importance that Senator Evans places on the political affiliations of appointees to royal commissions and if that is carried through to the nth degree that can only be deplored. Questionable also must be the changes of mind, apparently at the behest of their masters who comprise the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, by the Premiers of Victoria and New South Wales. Mr Cain and Mr Wran were less than enthusiastic about the creation of a national crimes commission before Senator Evans made his proclamation. Even now the silence of the New South Wales Minister for Police can only be described as deafening. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Government will, after the passage of these Bills through the Parliament, be committed to a national crimes commission, there is room for misgiving about the way that it has arrived at its decision. The Acting Attorney -General (Mr N.A. Brown), who is at the table, acknowledged in his second reading speech the emphasis that the Commonwealth gave to 'the greatest desirability of the States and the Northern Territory participating in this matter'. I would have put it even higher than that. The active and committed support of the States and the Northern Territory is essential. If the purpose is to harness the combined talents of anti-crime agencies to combat serious and organised crime around Australia, one could be forgiven for thinking that a prerequisite was the full co-operation of the States and the Northern Territory. After all, they control seven of the eight police forces in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the machinations of the Opposition and the fancy footwork of the Premiers of Victoria and New South Wales, the States are plainly not supportive of this proposition in its present form. To the extent that the misgivings and doubts of the States and the Northern Territory exist, they should have been satisfied before the Government took the unilateral step of introducing legislation. It is not consistent with the Government's federalist policies to act unilaterally while a series of ministerial and officer level conferences is in progress. Surely the Government could await the outcome of those conferences- the suggestions and good will that that process could produce. Even at this late stage I urge the Government to follow that course. </PARA>
<PARA> In so urging, I am mindful of the fact that as recently as 20 August this year a meeting of the Australian Police Ministers Council first considered the Commonwealth's proposal for a crimes commission. In acknowledging that the proposal embodied in this Bill was 'one possible option to be considered', the Police Ministers Council went on to add:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a second option advanced by Western Australia might be to upgrade and further develop the Australian Bureau of Criminal Investigation including the established links with operational law enforcement agencies around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent meetings in which Commonwealth representatives participated fully and a projected meeting in Melbourne last Friday, which did not eventuate because its deliberations were pre-empted by this legislation, were to be held to come up with constructive suggestions as to how to deal effectively with organised crime in Australia. One of the constructive suggestions for the consideration of the Commonwealth as well as the States and the Northern Territory called for the establishment of a national criminal intelligence commission. Such a commission could have used the existing law enforcement structures as they exist in Australia and would have involved upgrading the Australian Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The alternative to a national crimes commission in the form of a national criminal intelligence commission also remains worthy of consideration, even at this late stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is great concern in a number of quarters about this measure. There is a body of opinion that reckons the creation of a permanent royal commission, as proposed, is too dangerous. The Opposition's shadow Attorney- General is one who has expressed the fear that it could become a forum for destroying the reputations of individuals by eliciting malicious hearsay gossip which may prove to be unfounded. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has already mentioned those possibilities. The crime committee report to the executive of the Western Australian Law Society Council commented, in relation to the proposed commission, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) would tend to interfere with and cause confusion within the present State and Federal Police Forces. There would certainly be competition and an overlap of the various forces. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) also, such a Commission would constitute a serious threat to the historical rights of its citizens for the reasons given by Mr Clifford in his comments of July 1982, which include the words: 'if it is secret--</PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about the crimes commission-</PARA>
<PARA>then the possibility of all kinds of abuse cannot be overlooked. If on the other hand it operates openly publicly, with the possibility of media coverage for the witnesses that it subpoenas, then there is a real danger of ''trial by association'' and a denial of all the human rights which the Civil Liberties Organisations are so concerned about.'</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the Commission could in time lose its impetus and driving force and become a hindrance rather than a help. </PARA>
<PARA>Mention has been made of comments made in July of this year by Mr Clifford, who is the Director of the Institute of Criminology. On that occasion Mr Clifford also said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is disturbing to see the way in which Crime Commissions are being linked with the control of organised crime, as if one necessarily implied the other. The United States has a number of Crimes Commissions and as most people know, it still has a very flourishing organised crime industry which the Crime Commissions may harass or embarrass from time to time, which they may even check at certain times or in certain places, but which they are quite evidently in no position to properly control. In some places a Crime Commission has been a political exercise, a kind of posturing for the benefit of the taxpayer without any appreciable effect on the amount of organised crime in the area. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the end of that part of his dissertation. The crime committee of the Western Australian Law Society drew the conclusion from those quoted remarks that Mr Clifford's comments are supportive of an alternative approach to controlling organised crime in Australia along the lines possible if a criminal intelligence commission is established instead of a national crimes commission. The Chairman of the Victorian Bar Council also has serious misgivings. He has written:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council sees the dangers associated with a Crimes Commission as greatly outweighing its advantages. </PARA>
<PARA>In a letter to me which advances much more argument than I intend to quote the Chairman of the Victorian Bar Council concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> Insofar as such a commission is sought to be defenced by reference to US counterparts, it should not be forgotten that the United States Bill of Rights confers constitutional guarantees of individual liberties. Such guarantees are not present in the Australian constitution and therefore any Australian Commission will not be subject to the same degree of control by the courts, as would be the case in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bar Council regards the proposal as a grave threat to the fundamental civil liberties of all Australians. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest there is some truth in that. Given the opinions or stated preferences of the Victorian Bar Council, the relevant committee of the Western Australian Law Society, the Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology and the former chief of the Australian Federal Police, Sir Colin Woods, there is a case for moving cautiously towards the creation of a crimes commission or some other body with similar objectives. I believe there are others active in criminal law, and in law enforcement generally, who share the concerns of those I have already cited. Couple their concerns with those of the States and the Northern Territory and we have good reason for thoroughly thinking through the measures we may take effectively to combat organised crime. I hope the Government will be persuaded to look at the matter again and that it will accept a proposition to defer this legislation until a course of action which will have widespread support can be embarked on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not, at the moment anyway, support the amendments foreshadowed by the Opposition-not because one or more of them have no merit, I add. Basically I do not support them at this stage because the whole basis of this legislation and what it seeks to do is too dicey and uncertain. I simply put it to the House that after 80 years without a national crimes commission or similar body another few months is not too long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the concept of the National Crimes Commission Bill. Equally I support the amendments moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). I disagree with the Government as to the procedure. Nobody will disagree with the claim that organised crime is escalating throughout this country. The cost to the Australian community of organised crime has been estimated at a massive $5 billion. Crime reaches into every city, every town, every home and every pocket. It has forced up insurance rates, cost taxpayers more to meet the payroll of expanding law enforcement agencies and pushed social services costs to cope with an increasing army of drug addicts. It has corrupted. Its putrefaction has spread through every level of society. It has tainted professions, including those with the task of administering the law-the police, the legal fraternity, the judiciary and politicians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to be assured that economic crime will be dealt with by the Commission. The seven elements that constitute economic crime are listed to become beyond doubt one of the major questions in the 1980s. They are white collar crime, corporate crime, computer-related crime-about which, I suggest to the Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown), we ought quickly to give a reference to the Law Reform Commission-bank-related fraud, organised crime, official corruption and miscellaneous frauds. Those are the seven. Who bears the cost? Is it the corporate entity? Is it the finance house? Is it the Government? Of course not; it is the average man in the street, the consumer, the end user. He is the one who bears the brunt-not the Bar Council of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The director of the Institute of Criminology, Mr Bill Clifford, has pointed out :</PARA>
<PARA> Far more money is taken at the end of a ball point than at the end of a smoking .38. </PARA>
<PARA>Justice Moffitt made this observation on organised crime:</PARA>
<PARA> It will arrive within the Trojan horse of legitimate business, fashioned for concealment and apparent respectability by the witting or unwitting aid of expert accountants, lawyers and businessmen. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government wants to pad them up with plenty of packing under the guise of civil liberties and human rights. I wonder whether the Bar Council wrote to me about the Greeks charged with fraud in relation to social services-not that I remember. But I get plenty of letters from the Bar Council when it comes to spivs, charlatans and corporate crooks. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the solutions to the crime problem. The knowledge that organised and sophisticated white collar crime can be committed with impunity is obviously destructive to the morale of society and encourages a general attitude of contempt for the law. Much more sophisticated efforts and much greater resources than have been employed until now are required in this area if the cancer of organised corporate and syndicated and white collar crime is to be effectively dealt with. The extraordinary complexity of the area of crime is also presenting great problems for the court system, and the conventional methods of trial seem to be barely adequate to cope with it. I have heard no one tonight put up any constructive suggestions. Chief Justice King, in Adelaide, had this to say and it is basic, although many of my colleagues will disagree with it:</PARA>
<PARA> The basic truth must be recognised that the causes of crime are fundamentally moral causes and a radical reduction in the rate of crime will only occur when there is a profound and widespread improvement in the moral and civic attitudes of people generally. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a need for consistent law. The big problem about controlling modern crime is that our criminal justice services-this is what Clifford was talking about, and not what has been alluded to-the police, courts and prisons, were really designed for the nineteenth century and for dealing with conventional crime. Modern transnational, technically sophisticated and well organised criminal cartels are distinctly twentieth century. International law is bogged down in sovereignty limits of jurisdiction while the globally oriented modern criminal can move from country to country or move assets from country to country in a way which often makes him immune to the best efforts of national police forces, with instant access to a very sophisticated information system, all outside the control of those with the national jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of this spills over to Australia, where our separate jurisdictions are a godsend for the slick operator with appropriate legal services. That is the problem-the States. In the treatment of crime, Australia has indulged itself for too long in the luxury of separate State systems which not only leave the Australian citizen vulnerable but make Australia itself more vulnerable in international terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have been operating like petty kingdoms. Criminals have not been slow to take advantage of the boundaries which one State imposes on another or the limits of Federal jurisdiction. Federal and State police forces are handicapped by the differences in law, by the differences in bureaucracy and by boundaries which still apply in attitudes as well as in the law. Australia began constitutionally by a fairly simple combination of six States and a Federation. We had all the chances in the world to avoid the hopeless mishmash of impotence which now afflicts the United States of America and which the Government wants to continue to inflict on this country. Yet step by step we have approached the same morass with divisions arising in company law, the development of Federal courts, the setting up of independent law reform commissions, corporate affairs commissions and now a national crimes commission bereft of effective State support. Everything is piecemeal and correspondingly designed to bloat the bureaucracy without really embarrassing the best organised offenders who have the kind of legal advice which makes them experts in the limits of jurisdiction. Efficiency will be obtained when both think more nationally than parochially and concentrate on the need to prevent the criminal escaping their attention. I ask the Minister: Does this Bill help to correct the problems facing this nation? Certainly it is based on good intentions, but so is Hell. We need to know if we are not to descend further. In principle I support the Bill, but in my view it does not go far enough. The roots of our problems are deeper and more long term than will be dealt with by a super police power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Victorian Assistant Police Commissioner, Mr Paul Delianis, recently warned that organised crime will become so closely interwoven with legitimate business that there will be a need for penetrating intelligence resources and specialist investigators to unravel its complexities and that fighting organised crime may be beyond the boundaries of present day law enforcement expertise. He believes the battle against crime infiltration of legitimate business will be further frustrated by the emergence of untouchable crime bosses and that professional assistance in the way of well qualified commercial lawyers and accountants will become more commonplace while avenues of gathering intelligence that are currently available to police will need to be exploited further. He also noted the trend towards world wide organised groups being interrelated for criminal purposes and modern business techniques being applied to crime.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the United States. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) quoted Clifford. I suggest he go back and has another look at what he said in the full context. The establishment of 11 crime commissions in the United States was generally justified-let us look at the reasons-by frustration at the failure of conventional enforcement to deal with organised crime. Statistical studies showed that more than half the indictments gained against known organised crime figures were being dismissed. When convictions did result the criminal was not sent to prison in the majority of cases. Unconventional approaches were therefore sought to counter the capacity of crime bosses to distance themselves from the dirty work and exploit legal rights to the limit with the aid of talented counsel. The rationale for the crimes commissions was that they were to supply alternative controls on the crime bosses by publicly exposing them, by discovering administrative reforms which would put roadblocks in the way of organised crime, by collecting evidence of corruption or impropriety by public officials who were captives of organised crime, and by providing a backdoor method of imprisoning crime bosses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the honourable member to wait a moment. He has had his say and he should let me have mine. I do not think he put forward anything that was very constructive. The hands of this Commission will be tied when State law is being contravened, when police structures need to be reformed, when juries cannot be found to sit for a year or more and when politicians get involved at the State level as well as the Federal level. There can be no doubt that since the late 1970s the rate at which leading American organised crime figures have been convicted has increased enormously. That can be attributed to a package of measures-I make no apology for this because I agree with it-in which the civil liberties of a small number of people have been traded off against the reduction in organised crime. Society ultimately will have to make that decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rationale for the Crimes Commission in the United States of America has been very similar to the reasons that are given in Australia for having royal commissions. They operate in an inquisitorial mode rather than in an adversary one. They depend on an ongoing team of specialists for support rather than the recruitment of new staff and the setting up of a new administrative structure for each reference.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the planning role. The Crimes Commission should have the major task of co-ordinating a criminal justice service in each State. If we really want to talk to Clifford about the question, that is what he was really saying. What this nation has to do is to retool the criminal justice system. We badly need that. That is what the Minister ought to devote his mind to. I think it is an almost impossible task to get a common criminal code for this nation. It is an indictment on the State systems that we have separate criminal codes for each State. That is the task to which the Minister ought to apply his mind. This would mean investigating the malfunctioning of the present system and inquiring into allegations of corruption or the wastage of resources. The proposed commission, as I see it, will have neither the power nor the expertise to apply its mind to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it has to be acknowledged-the Minister must face this point-that more than 80 per cent of all expenditure on criminal justice lies with the States. It will therefore be difficult to persuade the States that the Federal Government is not seeking to extend this authority by setting up a national crimes commission. That is the Minister's dilemma. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is correct; we will have to find a procedure different from the one on which the Government is embarking. Even when dealing with offences under Commonwealth law, the resources of the States are needed-police resources, courts, or corrective services. We need commissions at the local level which will consist of officers from within the services who know best how to run them as well as academics, lawyers and private citizens who can bring our democratic society into the twenty-first century in dealing with crime. If a centralised co -ordinating body is established I do not believe there will be any constitutional or political problems. In fact, such a concept ought to be welcomed by the States.</PARA>
<PARA> It took the Federal and State governments-I know how hard this matter was worked on at a Federal level-13 years to set up an Australian Institute of Criminology. It will take almost as long, I suggest to the Minister with all honesty, to set up the National Crimes Commission. The Institute of Criminology now provides research into policy making around the country at a rate which challenges that of any other institute of comparable size in the world. When I was in Washington recently I discussed the National Crimes Commission with officials of the Department of Justice who informed me that the Institute of Criminology has world status. There is no question of that. It was an enormous task to establish that Institute. I suggest, as an example of Federal-State co- operation, that the Institute of Criminology has no rival in this country. It ought to be supported. It is an integral part of the machinery which operates against organised or white collar crime. Its expert capacity ought to be used to the fullest advantage in planning crime commissions.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to what the honourable member for Curtin who has just left the chamber, had to say. He envisages setting up co-operation with the States in the same way as we have with company law. We have inflicted upon the corporate sector of this country an enormous, ineffective bureaucracy. What the corporate sector badly needs and deserves is a federal companies law. There is no question about that. If this Government follows this same system by imposing a crimes commission on the States we will have the same problems. We have to approach these problems on the basis of at least co-operating and talking to the States and trying to get some organised system to deal with crime in all its aspects.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by suggesting to the Minister that crime commissions are far from being automatic and convenient clamps on our rarefied problem of organised crime . I think the Government will have to work at the problem a lot harder than it already has. I do not think the Government will be able to continue or succeed in this area if it chooses to ignore the States. I agree that the Government has to continue with the concept of a crimes commission but it has to entice the States to co-operate to the maximum degree. I simply suggest to the Minister that if he gets these things wrong now it will cost a great deal more to get us out of them than it has cost to get us into them.</PARA>
<PARA> I make no apology to anybody. I have struggled for a long time to achieve fulfilment of this concept of a national crimes commission. I suggest to the Minister that the way in which he is going about the establishment of this Commission is fraught with many problems. I think the suggestion that was made by my colleague opposite was sensible. Before this Government places this legislation on the statute book it should go back to the States to try, at least as far as possible, to get some agreement with them to retool the law and the judiciary in particular. We struggle to get a single penal code throughout this country. If we can achieve that we will go a long way towards combatting organised crime.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Crimes Commission Bill raises three questions of truly national importance: First, the dimensions of the threat posed to our society by organised crime; second, the means that should be adopted to combat this threat; and, third, if a national crimes commission is the right means, is the model proposed by the Bill the right one?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By its very nature it is impossible to know the dimensions of organised crime. There are no statistics on it. But we do know that reported crime, which is a very different thing from actual crime, is on the increase everywhere. If we exclude drug offences, reported crime in Australia increased by a staggering 62 per cent between 1974 and 1979. But while it is impossible to be certain of the true dimensions of the problem two things seem indisputable: that organised crime exists in Australia and that it is on the increase. It is also indisputable that the growth of organised crime in recent years has been significant and dangerous as criminal elements have responded to opportunities of the times. As the noted criminologists Sir Leon Radzinowicz and Joan King have pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> Crime is nothing if not responsive and nothing if not opportunist. </PARA>
<PARA>As society changes and becomes more wealthy and more permissive, as patterns of social organisation become more complex, as communications become faster and more elusive of surveillance, as commercial arrangements and corporate structures and the means of storage and retrieval of information and wealth become more intricate and sophisticated, so opportunities for criminal exploitation develop. </PARA>
<PARA> It is natural that criminals should respond by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to them in areas such as the illegal trafficking of drugs, organised gambling, organised prostitution and corporate frauds, to name but a few of the areas open to exploitation. A highly organised world begets highly organised crime. So crime has become-it has been for many years-big business, traversing State and national boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all of us conscious of the growth of organised crime. Its growth has become part of international and Australian folklore attested to by a wealth of anecdotal evidence, by growing public concern, by growing public debate and by acceptance in our language of such expressions as those used by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) such as 'white collar crime', 'computer fraud' and as well, of course, 'the Mafia'. More concretely, however, the growth in organised crime is attested to by the increase in specialist inquiries that concern or unearth organised criminal activities. I take but a few examples: The Moffiatt Commission on Alleged Organised Crime in Registered Clubs in New South Wales, which was referred to by the honourable member for Hawker; the Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking; the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking; the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry and the McCabe-Lafranchi special investigation under the Companies Act of Victoria, the latter an instance of the growing use of special investigations under the Companies Act to detect corporate frauds. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the means to be adopted to combat this evil? Premier Wran in a policy statement to the New South Wales Parliament on 27 February 1979 said:</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, organised crime presents a threat to our society. It is equally clear that it is the responsibility of the Governments of this State and this nation to devise means whereby they can counter and combat the threat that is posed. </PARA>
<PARA>One might say that the States have been very reluctant thus far to come to the party. The courses are basically two: To seek to improve the traditional means of law enforcement and especially the police forces or to do this and at the same time to adopt a fresh and major initiative. The record thus far of the conventional law enforcement agencies in the detection, in the bringing to trial and the conviction of those involved in organised crime is lamentable. Striking evidence of the deficiencies of the conventional approach is provided by the evidence of the widespread and highly organised stripping and dumping of companies exposed by Mr Costigan's Royal Commission and by the McCabe-Lafranchi special investigation. Without these kinds of investigations it seems plain that the activities described in those reports would never have been discovered by our existing law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Costigan Royal Commission and the McCabe-Lafranchi special investigation demonstrate cogent reasons for the establishment of a national crimes commission . First, the activities reported on were exposed by specialised investigation. Second, those investigations have not been conducted by the police, although police are used as part of the investigative team set up under Mr Costigan, and nor were conventional police methods of investigation used. Third, the aptitudes , skills and techniques brought to bear in these investigations, particularly those outlined in Mr Costigan's edited chapter on strategies employed in his investigations, are not to be found in the police forces of Australia whose structure, manning and investigative techniques have yet to catch up with organised criminal techniques and activities. As Mr Costigan said:</PARA>
<PARA> The law enforcement agencies have not identified in any meaningful way the nature and extent of organised crime operating here. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Costigan has pointed to three difficulties in the path of law enforcement agencies in the suppression of organised crime. They are: Inadequate personnel; inadequate equipment; and inadequate powers. Whilst, if the determination and the funds are available, defects in equipment and powers can be overcome it will take many years to remedy the deficiencies in personnel in Australian police forces even supposing that the police forces are ready for the fairly radical restructuring that this would require. Bluntly stated, our police forces are decades behind what we need to combat effectively organised crime. We cannot wait for them to catch up; the problem is too urgent-hence, in my view, the need for a national crimes commission. </PARA>
<PARA> To establish a national crimes commission does not mean that we should not at the same time seek to improve the standards of our existing law enforcement agencies. Its establishment simply recognises the deficiencies in those agencies and the urgency of the threat posed by organised crime. What then of the proposed model? The proposed Commission is open to the obvious criticism-this criticism has been made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) -that it would be better to have State co-operation. No doubt this is so, but the record of State and Federal co-operation inspires no confidence in the prospects of a speedy agreement on either the need for the Commission or the form it should take. We have not so many years left to us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for State participation so that the States, if they wish, can participate. That is an option which is left open to them. Essentially, what the Bill proposes is a standing royal commission with a time limit of five years. Its brief is twofold: Firstly, the investigation of offences and the assembly of evidence for the prosecution of offenders engaged in organised and sophisticated criminal activities; and, secondly, the reporting on patterns of criminal activities-particularly organised criminal activities-and the making of recommendations for changes in the laws and administrative actions needed to combat those activities. To secure these aims the Commission is given four broad areas of power: The power to recruit highly specialised and competent staff; the power to apply directly for search warrants and to retain custody, for a reasonable period, of papers and things discovered in searches; the power to apply for an order for delivery to the Commission of the passport of a witness; and the power to conduct, in public or private, compulsory inquisitorial examinations. The power to recruit specialised personnel is, of course, essential. The success of the Commission will depend almost entirely on the quality of those who run it and those who staff it. The powers concerning searches and passports are certainly wide ranging but, in my view, necessary. In each case application must be made to a judge for an order. This should be sufficient to prevent abuse. The powers given to the Commission to conduct inquisitorial hearings seem to me to go too far. </PARA>
<PARA> Our system of criminal law is based on two premises: The presumption of innocence; and that it is for the Crown to prove its case and not for the accused to establish his innocence. Basic to the accusitorial system is the right of a person who is accused of a crime or who is questioned about a crime to remain silent. Our system is in strong contrast to the inquisitorial system of continental Europe. It reflects the public revulsion to what has been described by an American judge as 'the inquisitorial and manifestly unjust methods of interrogating accused persons, which has long obtained in the continental system'. </PARA>
<PARA> The two major departures from the principle that a person is not to be required to answer questions which may disclose criminal action by him or to present documents which may disclose criminal action by him are to be found in Acts setting up royal commissions and in the provisions of the companies Acts which control special investigations. These two forms of inquiries are in many respects similar in procedure. Both operate on an inquisitorial basis and both require, subject to some safeguards, answers to questions. But what is here proposed is a major breach of the right to remain silent. It is a major breach because the whole purpose of the Commission is to investigate criminal activities. The grave nature of what is proposed can be simply illustrated: While neither the police nor the courts can compel answers to be given concerning criminal activities this Commission, frequently perhaps at the request of the police, can do what neither the courts nor the police can do. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perfectly true that some protection is to be given to a person called before the Commission. In brief, before a person is required to incriminate himself there must be an undertaking given by the Attorney-General, binding on the Crown, that the answers will not be used against him in criminal proceedings save proceedings for the offence of seeking to mislead the Commission. This undertaking does not extend to things or documents and experience teaches one-Mr Costigan points this out-that in the case of organised and sophisticated criminal activities documents will often be a more profitable and more telling form of evidence than oral evidence. I therefore think that the protection which is to be afforded by the undertaking of the Attorney-General should extend to the production of documents or things. But to extend the protection given by the undertaking to documents and things does not end the danger presented by the adoption of an inquisitorial system. Anyone with experience in royal commissions or special investigations knows that if a witness, on compulsion, gives evidence that incriminates him and if one gets some slight understanding from him of what the tale is by compulsion through questions, despite the fact that the evidence cannot be used against him it will frequently happen that other means of proving the offence can be found. The protection that the undertaking is designed to give can therefore become illusory. </PARA>
<PARA> To permit the Crown indiscriminately to compel witnesses to incriminate themselves by the expedient of giving an undertaking not to use the compelled evidence would be to make a major breach in the citizen's right to remain silent . There would be nothing to prevent the Crown giving such an undertaking to every witness summoned before the Commission. As the whole purpose of the Commission is to concern itself with crime we could, inadvertently, be taking a major step towards the adoption of an inquisitorial system of criminal justice. In my view if we are to establish a commission with inquisitorial powers, and a life span of at least five years, the power to compel witnesses to produce documents or answer questions that may incriminate them should be limited to special and exceptional cases. The determination of what amounts to such a special and exceptional case should not be left to the Commission. The possibility of abuse, simply from an excess of zeal, is far too obvious. Instead , it should be placed in the hands of someone outside the Commission who is answerable for his actions. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the person who should make this decision should be the Attorney-General who should be required, when giving the undertaking, to certify that in his opinion there are special grounds that, in the public interest, require the answers given or documents or things produced by the witnesses and he should state what those grounds are. Not only would the Attorney-General be answerable to Parliament for any misuse of this power but also misuse of the power would be challengeable in the courts. Unquestionably, what I propose and what the amendments in my name set forth will slow down some of the Commission's work and perhaps make it less effective. But inquisitorial powers proposed by the Bill are far too radical a departure from our criminal system of justice. The restrictions I suggest on the use of these powers are necessary to maintain the substance of one of the most deeply rooted rights that citizens have-the right to remain silent. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three other areas of general comment on the Bill. I believe that the Government, if it agrees to amendments which will be put forward by me, which I understand it may do, will come some distance to meet the comments that I now make. In the first place many witnesses may prefer to give evidence in private. In my experience they are frequently more forthcoming in private. Their views should be included as a specific matter for consideration under section 16 (6) of the proposed Act. Furthermore, I can see no good reason why section 6D sub- section (2) of the Royal Commission Act which provides that witnesses before a royal commission whose evidence may unfairly prejudice the profits or financial interest of any person should not, in a proper case, have their evidence taken in private. Witnesses should not only be entitled to witness expenses which they receive under the Royal Commissions Act but not under this Bill-although I believe that the Government would accede to a proposal that that entitlement now be granted to them under the Bill-but also in a proper case they should be reimbursed their legal expenses. I say this simply because persons called before the kind of commission that is proposed, no matter how innocent they may be of wrong doing, are well advised to be legally represented. Since the purpose of the Commission is very much a public interest purpose it is right that those who assist it should do so at no cost to themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, clause 37 provides for the furnishing of an annual report to Parliament . Clause 10 provides for reports on specific matters. In my view the protection given by those clauses concerning the naming of witnesses should be extended. It should be provided that the proposed commission shall take reasonable care to ensure that the identity of a person is not revealed if to reveal his identity might, when taken together with any material appearing in a report, prejudice the safety or reputation of the person or the fair trial of a person who has been or who may be charged with an offence. Trial by public reports, trial by the media and trial by the Parliament, so impossible to refute and so insidiously damaging, have no place in this country. If people are to be judged, let them be judged by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> We can never hope to eradicate corporate crime or organised crime. We can hope to limit and to contain it. But we could only hope to limit and contain it if we were willing to take fresh approaches to the problems presented by organised crime. What the Bill proposes is a beginning. In my view, we must progress to a united national approach. I agree with much of what the honourable member for Hawker said on this subject. This means an end to the idiocies of jurisdictional complexities and jealousies and, finally, I should think, to a common criminal code as the honourable member proposed or, at least, to a common criminal code designed to deal with organised crime. But let me add one warning. Let us be slow to breach fundamental rights. It is perfectly true that criminals can make bad use of those rights. But it is true also that those rights have protected citizens for hundreds of years. We should be very careful before we throw them to one side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this debate thus far indicates that all honourable members have agreed that society has a duty to protect its institutions and its people against the attacks of organised crime. I think there has been some measure of agreement that there is a need to co-ordinate and organise the resources of State and Commonwealth law enforcement agencies and authorities to meet not merely the problems of organised crime but the new forms of crime which were listed by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi). He has continuously, I think to his credit, pointed out in this House the development and the nature of the developments of corporate criminal activities within our society. Part of the problem which he highlighted correctly was that, for the most part, all State specialist police services which have the prime responsibility for the enforcement of law, whether they be in Victoria or New South Wales, are understaffed and underfinanced and the specialist officers who man them are largely underpaid. Caught in this situation, this Parliament is entitled, I believe, to ask itself the question: Has the Government done all that is possible to strengthen, co-ordinate and assist in the reframing and particularly in the refinancing of State government law enforcement agencies. I believe that, if one looked at what occurred with this Government, the answer to that very important question must be in the negative. I am bound to say that I, for one, am deeply concerned about the extent of the provisions and the width of the powers which are sought in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me refer the House to the functions of the proposed commission. We will create a commission which has powers to investigate, on its own motion or at the request of the Attorney-General, any circumstances suggesting that an offence may have been made or may be being committed against the law of the Commonwealth or, indeed, any allegation-it does not have to be a circumstance-that an offence has been or is being committed against a law of the Commonwealth or Territory can produce an active investigation by the Commission or at the behest of the Attorney-General. I believe those powers are too wide. I believe this House is in grave danger in giving to any Attorney-General or to any commission powers of such an extensive nature. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is an overreaction to some of the facts that I think have been properly brought to the attention of the people of Australia in the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Instead of endeavouring to co-ordinate and finance the law enforcement agencies whose job it is to prosecute the law and to investigate, we are creating an ongoing, permanent commission which, on its own motion or on the request of the Attorney-General, without reference to the Parliament, can commence an inquisitorial process into any section of our community. In the final analysis I believe that what separates a democratic society from a totalitarian society are those institutions which ultimately, when choosing between the rights of the state and the rights of the citizen, will opt for the rights of the citizen. I am opposed to the development of the inquisitorial process and I am opposed to the development of that process in the way which is contemplated in this legislation. I do not believe that any government or any Attorney-General should seek to have these powers and I do not believe the Parliament should readily concede these powers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard honourable gentlemen opposite cast grave reflections upon the Attorney-General of New South Wales. I have heard it suggested in this House that from time to time he has abused his office. If that can be said by way of political thrust in respect of a State Attorney-General why can it not be said in respect of a Commonwealth Attorney-General? These powers are wide enough to enable not necessarily this Attorney-General but some future Attorney-General to say: 'I believe that the tax avoidance industry poses a grave threat to the revenue collecting facilities of the Commonwealth'. There is lots of evidence to show that certainly what has occurred has involved breaches of the law. I have heard it said in this House by people who hold very responsible positions that many of the funds which came from taxation evasion finished in the coffers of the Liberal Party. I do not know whether that is true or false. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the honourable gentlemen opposite that there is nothing to stop an Attorney-General who is so minded from saying on the basis of that allegation: ' We will have an investigation to see whether that allegation against the Liberal Party and its collective membership is true and we shall place the Liberal Party into the inquisitorial process'. Honourable members opposite, especially the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N.A. Brown), who is sitting at the table, might say in the Parliament that that is not what was intended. They might say: 'We did not intend that'. What do we mean when we talk about organised crime? This legislation, as drafted, is wide enough to include the Liberal Party. It is wide enough to include any of the fringe political groups in our community. </PARA>

I suspect that this political party has breached the laws of the Commonwealth. I suspect this trade union. I suspect this company'. On the basis of that act, which does not have to be ratified by the Parliament, that company, that individual, that trade union, can be subjected to a process which, if it is reported in the media, can be tremendously damaging. It can destroy the innocent as well as pursue those who are involved in criminal activities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had occasion tonight to look over again one of the great debates in this Parliament, the debate on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. The basis of that legislation was an attempt to dissolve the Communist Party of Australia. All the arguments and all the presumptions that founded that legislation could be used tomorrow by the Acting Attorney-General to start a commission of inquiry into the Communist Party or any other political or religious group in our society that he believed he wanted to investigate. I do not say he would. But does this Parliament accept those presumptions as easily and as lightly as has been suggested simply on the basis that we are going to do something about organised crime?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I share, and I voice, the concern that has been expressed by such bodies as the Victorian Bar Council. I do not always agree with it and I do not expect all honourable members here to take the view that what the Victorian Bar Council puts forth has to be accepted as gospel. But no one could describe the Victorian Bar Council as a group of young political radicals. When an eminent body such as that, with such a wide range and diversity of political opinions, expresses itself in the way in which it already has and not merely cautions this House against this legislation but advises against it because of the dangers in it for the rights and liberties of the Australian citizen, I believe we must take cognisance of it. I would not seek these powers for a Labor government. I certainly would not concede these powers in their present form to this Government. I do not doubt the sincerity of honourable members opposite when they say that they are concerned to deal with organised crime. But if they believe that they are going to do it with some form of super inquisition which puts at peril the rights and liberties of Australian citizens, then that for me is too high a price to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this Parliament should think deeply. If it thinks deeply it will realise that the proper approach to this matter is to co-operate with the law enforcement agencies of the States and to be prepared to fund the kind of specialist services which are clearly needed. If there is to be some kind of commission of inquiry which is felt necessary by the States and the Commonwealth in respect of the pursuit of organised crime, I believe that can be done with a prudence and a caution which is not evident in this legislation. It has taken the Australian people, as it has taken the people of the British Commonwealth, a long time to develop the rights of the individual citizen. The protection of the courts, which ultimately is the only protection-whatever the inadequacies of our system-stands between the individual citizen and the power of the state. I do not believe those rights should be put in jeopardy. I do not believe the state should seek the kinds of powers which strengthen a process which by its very nature is abhorrent to the whole tradition of our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA> I would need to be convinced, in respect of any individual case, that the Parliament ought to act in a way which is now being contemplated. For that reason, I will not merely support the amendments moved by the Opposition but also I say very sincerely to the Minister and the Government, and to the voices of concern that have been expressed on that side of the House, that the best thing this Government could do would be to take this legislation away and think about it far more deeply than it has. Organised crime is not about to go on a gala festival between now and the new year. We need better legislation than this . We certainly need legislation which will not imperil the rights of the Australian citizen in the way in which this legislation does. </PARA>

Secondly, there is the protection of individuals in relation to the nature of the inquiries that might be pursued by the proposed national crimes commission. I wish to address myself this evening, firstly, to the relationship that the Commonwealth has with the States of Australia and to indicate some of the reservations I have about the way in which the legislation is framed. I will make some suggestions to the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N.A. Brown) as to some alternative approaches that might be taken. However, I very much agree with the thrust of the legislation. The speeches of the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), detailed the reasons why we have a requirement for a national crimes commission. The two honourable members spelt out the nature and extent of the problem which had been revealed by various inquiries and also the work of the Australian Institute of Criminology. I do not think it is necessary for me to go over those matters again.

<PARA> The National Crimes Commission Bill has been framed so as to give to the Commonwealth certain limited powers to investigate breaches of law. The Bill is limited because the breaches of law are only breaches of Commonwealth laws that might be investigated by the proposed commission, unless the States specifically refer matters to the commission. Some might say that that is a co-operative approach, but I suggest to the Acting Attorney that if the States prove, as it appears to this point, to be unwilling to co-operate and unwilling to take this referral on board they ought to have regard to some of the recent case decisions which have said that the Commonwealth's power might very well be extended in a number of areas and in a number of ways. The States ought to have regard to the extent to which the Commonwealth might be able to legislate further than it has seen fit to do in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I address the Acting Attorney-General's attention to some of the articles that have been written about an implied national power that the Commonwealth Government might have to legislate in important areas such as this. This power has been considered recently in what is known as the Australian Assistance Plan case. In that case the High Court was considering the validity of an appropriation by the Commonwealth to fund the Australian Assistance Plan which was an initiative of the previous Labor Administration. Under section 81 of the Constitution, which is the appropriation power, appropriations must be made for the purposes of the Commonwealth. None of the justices in that case took a narrow view of the appropriation power. They did not assume that the purposes of the Commonwealth was the narrow range of purposes that are outlined in section 51 and section 52 of the Constitution which are normally thought to constitute the Commonwealth's powers. The Court thought that the purposes were somewhat wider than that. I direct the attention of the Acting Attorney to some of the views of what might be described as the more conservative judges who address themselves to this matter in that case. Mr Justice Jacobs had some comments to make. I will quote briefly one of them. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The growth of national identity results in a corresponding growth in the area of activities which have an Australian rather than a local flavour. </PARA>
<PARA>The then Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The extent of powers which are inherent in the fact of nationhood and of international personality has not been fully explored. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that would be regarded as a particularly cautious statement by that gentleman; yet it indicates that we really have not traversed the extent of our nationhood power. That is a matter that might be addressed. I also suggest that the Acting Attorney look at the comments of Mr Justice Mason. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>the existence and character of the Commonwealth as a national government in combination with the incidental power . . . and the executive power . . . gave the Commonwealth a capacity to engage in activities which could only be effectively carried out by a national government. </PARA>
<PARA>Some people have thought that that runs only to the more obvious examples such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and some research and exploratory organisations. But I think there are wider national interests involved in this issue which might all be addressed in legislation such as the National Crimes Commission Bill. I think there would be few who would deny that this is a very important area, an area where national interests are affected and where if we look at the nature of crime not only national but also international the Commonwealth has a great responsibility. The fact that this legislation is called legislation for a National Crimes Commission highlights that. </PARA>
<PARA> I also suggest that the Acting Attorney look at the trade and commerce power. There have been some suggestions that under the trade and commerce power, raised under section 45D of the Trade Practices Act in the Actors Equity case, the Commonwealth has a power not only to regulate but also to protect. I would think that the sort of protection that we would want from criminal activity might be such that our trade and commerce power would enable the Commonwealth to regulate a much wider variety of interstate criminal activity or quasi-criminal activites . That is a matter that might be looked at. There is also the important Koowarta case involving the Queensland Government and the extent of the Commonwealth's power in relation to the question of our Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst time does not permit me to canvass many details of that matter, there are some international conventions which deal with drug trafficking which Australia has signed and which might well provide a proper base for Commonwealth laws dealing with drug trafficking and the like. The Commonwealth could enact laws and these matters could be investigated by a National Crimes Commission under the powers given in this legislation. I would like to cover many more matters, particularly in relation to the question of powers. However, I would encourage the Acting Attorney to look at these matters and to raise them with the States. They might very well become a proper basis on which the States would realise that if they are not prepared to co-operate the Commonwealth might be able to go it alone. </PARA>
<PARA> I will address the second matter, the protection of individual rights, on another occasion. I therefore seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of weeks ago I met in King's Hall a Mr Michael Shelley and his wife Katherine, who asked me to read the rather voluminous papers which set out their grievance. The couple are Nazarite Christians. They were barefooted, informally dressed but obviously scrupulously clean. Their principal grievance was that child welfare authorities in Queensland had taken their son Elijah from them and delivered him to a foster parent. I have since examined their papers and while it is not an easy case and involved conflict of two valid principles-the duty of society to see that children are adequately cared for versus the rights of parents-I believe the wrong decision was made in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Michael and Katherine Shelley are Nazarite Christians and their understanding of christianity is that they must adopt a particular lifestyle, which is in conflict at several points with the normal way of life of our society. To take some examples, the Shelley's beliefs commit them to living from day to day; eating only simple and natural food; wearing clothing only of natural fibres and going shoeless; not cutting their hair or shaving, and not even binding up their hair; not using household appliances, including washing machines and refrigerators, nevertheless keeping scrupulously clean, which includes daily hand washing of clothing; not using drugs and alcohol; refusing medical attention in times of illness and instead employing prayer and anointing of the sick person; and constant travelling, as they say, 'nearly every day in faith for our Lord Jesus Christ'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the view of most people, these principles are eccentric if not bizarre. However, most people would not deny the Shelleys the right to seek to live out the dictates of their conscience. Despite our community's professed commitment to freedom of conscience, on various occasions the Shelleys have been gaoled on vagrancy charges. Inevitably during their travels the Shelleys have attracted the attention of the conscientious child welfare authorities of South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland concerning the well-being of Elijah. According to Mr Shelley the authorities in New South Wales and South Australia, after their investigations, saw no need for further action. Mr Shelley has also supplied me with a copy of a document from the Queensland Department of Children's Services at Rockhampton, dated 22 April 1981, which states that as a result of the examination of Elijah by several paediatric experts it had been agreed that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . while Mr and Mrs Shelley lead an unconventional transient lifestyle, there is no doubt that Elijah receives the highest level of emotional care and love. Elijah's vegetarian diet is quite unusual for a child his age, but medical advice is that the diet is well balanced and appears to be adequate. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the same expert and conscientious opinion was that in the interests of the child there should be regular monitoring of Elijah's state of health and therefore his parents were requested to seek medical examination of their son at three-monthly intervals for the next six months from the local paediatrician in whatever town they might be in. On that occasion the Shelleys agreed to meet this request but Mr Shelley has since stated that he has withdrawn his assent, and this has had very serious consequences. The Queensland authorities saw fit to remove Elijah from his parents' custody and now Mr Shelley is most dissatisfied with and very concerned about the care that Elijah has received at the hands of both the Queensland authorities and his foster parent. </PARA>
<PARA> It does seem that no serious attempt has been made to take account of the parents' conscientious values and religious susceptibilities by those who have taken upon themselves the raising of Elijah Shelley. It does not seem that either the Queensland authorities or the Queensland State Ombudsman have come up with any less harsh solution to this problem. There are grounds for believing that the rights of the Shelley family have not received their due from the authorities. Surely some less arbitrary, less brutal, procedures can be applied in this admittedly difficult case. Surely the only recourse open to the authorities is not the traumatic breakup of a loving family. Surely further attempts at a compromise can and should be made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a number of occasions in this House I have found it necessary to draw attention to the meanness and what virtually amounts to criminal negligence in relation to pensioners caused by the policies of the Federal Government. Tonight I wish to draw attention to the circumstances of Mrs Brigitte Wustemann of 37 King Street, Bayswater, Victoria, which illustrate so clearly the plight of pensioners under the social security system administered by this Government. Mrs Wustemann is a 42-year-old widow with a 17-year-old son and a 15-year-old daughter. She is presently receiving a widow's pension with all the attendant fringe benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two children have left school and are at present seeking work. One of the failures of the present school system in Victoria-which the State Australian Labor Party Government hopes to remedy-is the inability of the system to provide invigorating educational programs which will attract young people at a time when their learning capacity is at its height. Nonetheless, the two children have made the decision to leave school and take their chances in the job market. The problem for Mrs Wustemann is that as soon as her daughter reaches the age of 16 years, in a few months' time, Mrs Wustemann will lose her entitlement to her widow's pension and the associated fringe benefits, including rate rebates and discounts on telephone rental and public transport. At age 42 years with work experience related to 18 years ago Mrs Wustemann is now forced to seek work. In such circumstances her job opportunities are minimal to say the least and it is almost certain that she will be obliged to apply for unemployment benefits. At her age and with no recent work experience she will be expected to look for work in a job market where more than half a million people are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be appreciated that there is another class of person similarly affected, that is, the single parent pensioner. Apart from the high unemployment levels for the working population in general unemployment is particularly high for women. The official figures for July indicate unemployment rates of 20.7 per cent for 15 to 19-year-old young women and 17.9 per cent for all women. These rates are much higher than the general unemployment level for men which is 5.8 per cent and 15.6 per cent for the 15 to 19-year-olds. Many women such as Mrs Wustemann will find it impossible to enter the work force having devoted their lives to their families and having lost or not having had the opportunity to obtain the relevant skills which are necessary. At age 40 years or more their retirement age is only 10 years or less away. For this reason alone many employers are unwilling to offer a job to women in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> A community group, Women in Search, has published studies indicating that women in the 40 to 50 years age group who lose the widow's pension suffer considerable emotional anguish at being unable to obtain employment and experience feelings of hopelessness and insecurity in relation to their future. As a result these women are increasingly falling prey to ill health. Those who do not succumb to illness, having lost the widow's pension and being unable to obtain work, must seek the unemployment benefit with the associated loss of fringe benefits. It seems that the Government continually fails to appreciate the considerable financial drain resulting from the loss of fringe benefits. This figure can be quantified as being a minimum of $20 a week with many people losing as much as $ 30 a week or more. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the widow or single parent is attempting to meet housing repayments the financial consequences are even more disastrous. Women in Search suggests that the age eligibility for the widow's pension should be reduced from 50 years to 40 years. This reduction in the age eligibility would give the women concerned the security of a pension card with all the attendant fringe benefits. It should not be forgotten that retraining schemes are also necessary for unskilled women who wish to enter or re-enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> It is high time that the Federal Government indicated more compassion for widows and suporting parents who find themselves faced with the future financial prospects which Mrs Wustermann will experience in several months time. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) should accept that the Government has a responsibility to assist widows in need by making the age qualifications for the widows pension more realistic by recognising the special problems of people such as Mrs Wustermann. Of course, it can be argued that there are many other disadvantaged groups which also deserve support, but my intention tonight has been to draw attention to one group which is often overlooked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to express my concern at the decision of the Polish martial law authorities last month to abolish the free trade union movement Solidarity. I want to join with other members of parliament who have expressed their dismay at the way in which the Polish Government has again displayed its brutal and repressive arrogance by totally ignoring the expressed wishes of the Polish people. The free world has supported this almost unique and certainly courageous attempt by the Poles to establish for themselves a more just and more democratic society through this free and independent union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Sinclair) said on 9 October that the Australian Government believed this step was likely to hinder the process of national conciliation so desperately needed in Poland today. I think that this sentiment has been best expressed by Magda Wojeck, a key member of the Solidarity Co-ordinating Office Abroad located in Brussels. In a letter to the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), who has been a strong supporter of the Solidarity movement, she said, in response to the abolition of Solidarity:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Union does not exist on paper it exists in the minds of the people in Poland and the work they do-you can formally delegalise a union but you cannot delegalise 10 million people. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to add my support to the people of Poland in their struggle. In particular, I want to reiterate my support for the Polish community of Perth which, naturally, is most distressed with the current situation in Poland and with the martial law authorities. The Polish community of Perth, during the course of this year, has expressed its solidarity with Solidarity in a most tangible way. As Chairman of the Western Australian State Committee for Relief to Poland, I want to thank the Polish community of Western Australia for their most generous and energetic contribution to this appeal, which concludes this Friday. The great bulk of the funds raised has been raised by the Polish community of Western Australia, which has worked tirelessly to ensure that through its efforts and through this appeal it can help to provide food, clothing and medical supplies to the people of Poland who need the physical sustenance and the moral support for their struggle which these funds, raised voluntarily throughout the Western World, will help provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, on 17 October, the Polish community, at yet another fund raising function for this appeal, passed a resolution addressed to the Prime Minister of Australia in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> We urge you, Sir, to commit, on the international arena, the good name and prestige of the Australian Government, to the unequivocal condemnation of the regime governing Poland for the most flagrant violation of human rights. For the use of force, suppression and detentions perpetrated on its own people. For reducing the economy to the state of ruin and for submitting, openly and shamelessly to the wishes and dictates of an unfriendly neighbouring power. </PARA>
<PARA> We also urge you, Sir, to instigate and give support to any prudent but resolute policies intended to bring relief to the Polish Nation which has suffered too much for too long. </PARA>
<PARA>At a public meeting on 23 October-there was also a public march through Perth, organised by the Federated Clerks Union and the Polish community in which I took part-another resolution was passed. The resolution read:</PARA>
<PARA> This meeting deplores the dissolution of Solidarity by the repressive Polish authorities and calls upon the Federal Government to advise the Polish Ambassador of our concern at the dissolution, to press for a guarantee that no citizen will be penalised in any way for being a member or supporter of Solidarity, and to seek an assurance that all members or supporters of Solidarity who are either imprisoned or interned will be immediately released with the restoration of all citizen rights. </PARA>
<PARA>On 27 October I presented both these resolutions to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I congratulate the Polish community of Western Australia and other members of the Western Australian community on the support that they have given to the Solidarity movement, particularly through the appeal of the Western Australian State Committee for Relief to Poland, and I call on the Federal Government to take action to ensure that the Polish authorities are made aware of the concern which we as a government and as a people feel regarding the callous disregard that they have shown towards the fundamental rights of their own people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several weeks ago a constituent of mine approached me about a postal matter. She was wishing to establish a business and required a private post office box. She was expecting to receive approximately 50 letters or documents each day through the post. She lives in Five Dock, which is part of the electorate of Lowe, and she went to the Five Dock Post Office and found that no post office boxes were available. She went to the Drummoyne Post Office and found there was none there. She went to Gladesville across the Parramatta River and none was available there. She went to small post offices. She found that many of them, particularly the sub-post offices had no post office box facilities at all. She went in towards the city to Pyrmont and there was none there. Eventually she found an out of the way post office in the city where she could obtain a post office box. This was no good to the lady at all. I was quite surprised to hear of this. I have written to the Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown) about the issue. The constituent wanted to start a business and provide some employment but she just could not get off the ground in the local area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I and my secretary rang local post offices all around the electorate of Lowe and stretching into some of the other electorates, where a business person might go to try to get a post office box. It is quite a reasonable assumption that one can obtain these facilities. At Burwood, in the heart of my electorate, no post office boxes are available and there is a waiting list of several years. The post office building is a National Trust classified building and no work can be done to extend the facilities. No post office boxes are available at Burwood North and there is a waiting list. At Concord none was available and we were referred to another post office. At Croydon there was none available. We were told that the post office was also a National Trust building and there were no facilities and no room to expand. At Hunter's Hill, which is quite close to my electorate, there was none available. At Ryde, just out of the electorate, where my secretary lives, no post office boxes were available. There were and still are post office boxes at Strathfield, which is a new post office, but it is an impossibility to park near it. It is on a very busy intersection and business people or local charities do not want to take a post office box that they cannot get at easily day or night, because it is right on a very busy intersection. We were told that some small post office boxes were available at Enfield and there were also small boxes at Strathfield. But Enfield is on the Hume Highway, the main thoroughfare between Sydney and Melbourne, and people just cannot park in such places. </PARA>
<PARA> I was most concerned about this lady's complaint because I believe we must, as members of parliament, do everything possible to encourage business activity to help small business people get off the ground. I have looked at the Postal Services Act which states that the Australian Postal Commission:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . shall perform its functions in such a manner as will best meet the social , industrial and commercial needs of the Australian people for postal services . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I submit to the House tonight that the Australian Postal Commission is not exercising its duties in a manner that will best meet the social, industrial and commercial needs of the Australian people. I notice in the Act that the Minister may give directions to the Commission. I am drawing this to the attention of the House tonight in the hope that the Minister will bring this problem to the attention of the Commission because I think it is a reasonable expectation that a person opening a business is able to obtain a post office box. I believe the boxes save money for Australia Post. They provide a community service to local business people and to charities and in addition they raise revenue. I feel it is time that the Postal Commission looked at this matter seriously and looked at the whole question of providing these facilities for the business community and for the charities and local organisations which need these services. I am sure that any honourable member in the House will find in his own area, particularly in the older, established suburbs, that these facilities are just not available and there is no plan by the Australian Postal Commission to provide them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is an excellent book. It will serve a great educative role in our community, particularly for general practitioners, many of whom need to be further educated and alerted to the peculiar problems of Aboriginal health . I know that this has been an issue that many members of this House and of State parliaments have studied closely over the last few years and have put a lot of time and attention into. I am aware the the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs addressed the problem several years ago in an inquiry directed towards Aboriginal health. Similarly, the same Standing Committee tabled a report in this place on Thursday, 28 October with regard to Aboriginal fringe camps. That report which reflected on the problems in town camps highlighted many of the problems related to Aboriginal health. I did not agree with all of the recommendations in that report. In fact, I was a signatory to a dissent in that report on some of the issues relating to Aboriginal health. But it is good to see that these issues are being addressed, particularly by groups such as the Australian Medical Association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also draw the attention of members, the public and doctors to many of the statements that were made yesterday at the launching of that booklet by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Wilson) who naturally praised the publication of the booklet. He drew attention to many of the problems and highlighted a number of issues. But what impressed me particularly, probably in light of the dissent that I lodged with regard to the town camps inquiry, was the political point that a Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has addressed with regard to the differing responsibilities between the Commonwealth Government and State and territory governments in the fields of functional responsibilities such as health, education and welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Minister's report should be commended to the media and to all interested people because it shows a fresh view by a Minister at the direction that this Government is obviously looking as far as financial relationships between the various governments are concerned. I think the Minister in his address yesterday set out to define the respective roles and responsibilities. He pointed out quite clearly that it is incumbent on State governments to take up and provide services for Aboriginals at the same standard and at the same level. The Minister stated quite clearly that the primary objective of the Commonwealth was to accelerate the work done by the States and in particular to look at what can be termed the areas of double disadvantage or the severe disadvantage which results to people caused by their peculiar aboriginality. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Minister's statement in full to many people who should look at it and at the concurrent responsibilities between the various levels of government not just in the health area but in all areas in which there are State responsibilities. It is quite refreshing to see that a Minister has picked up and not just blindly walked into what everybody has been quoting as to what the 1967 referendum did. He defined and put down in a new way quite clearly that there is a concurrent responsibility between all levels of government and in particular groups such as medical associations and others who intend to try to assist in these important areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very concerned tonight at the lack of services provided by the Adult Migrant Education Service. I think this Government is exposed in regard to its lack of commitment to migrants who are very disadvantaged by their lack of knowledge of the English language. The adoption of the report of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs shows a drop in funds to the AMES on-arrival program of $2.7m and an overall reduction in funding for the adult migrant education services in real terms of $1.3m compared with the level for the last financial year. But the real failure of this Government lies in the fact that it has not recognised the needs of migrants in Australia and the damage planned to the courses already provided. For example, the teacher-student ratio this year will be worsened by 33 per cent from 1:15 to 1:20. Whilst theoretically all migrants now have access to full time courses of 300 hours, in future such courses will be available to only 20 per cent of those in need and the course length will be reduced to 240 hours. Others though will have to be content with part time courses over 10 to 12 weeks comprising only 150 to 180 hours instruction. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ( Mr Hodges) is well aware that educational studies indicate that at least 900 hours is the optimum course length.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from this reduction for future immigrants to Australia, 525,000 migrants already in Australia are in real need of tuition in the English language. A command of the English language is essential for migrant workers who are seeking employment during periods of record unemployment and job shedding in the manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has failed to discharge its responsibilities in this area. It still refuses to provide the States with adequate funds to establish a permanent education service for migrants. Despite projections of future migrant intakes and the existing need of over half a million Australians the Government refuses to provide the extra meagre $4m or $5m necessary for the establishment of a permanent AMES. Instead the program all around Australia is staffed almost totally by casual teachers, many of whom work full time but are employed on an hourly casual basis. According to a New South Wales Industrial Commission statement of 18 August last, these people are subsidising the AMES. For example, approximately 60 per cent of the instruction time in New South Wales is taught by casual teachers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government should immediately take the first step towards a permanent education service by providing funds to convert all full time positions to permanent ones. For example, I think the current position in New South Wales is that there are only 130 permanent positions and 50 of those are administrative, which means that there are only 80 permanent teachers in the service and 200 casual teachers. In my electorate of Cunningham, which has the highest percentage of local population born overseas, there are only four permanent teachers and 80 casuals. This is a disgrace. The New South Wales Ethnic Communities Council and the New South Wales Ethnic Affairs Commission both believe that full time teachers should be permanent and not casual. They know that this would provide a stable education service and show a true commitment by the Government to the migrants that it encourages to come to Australia. We call on this Government to provide an immediate and extra grant to the States to upgrade the AMES as a matter of urgency and to increase the rate of permanency in the adult migrant education service in Australia. </PARA>

For example, he had impact on Sir William Dobell, whose paintings Rudy Komon first marketed, if you like, from the back of a truck in eastern suburbs of Sydney- door by door.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fred Williams, indeed. Not only did Rudy assist Fred Williams by discovering him, promoting him and supporting him but also, much to the late Fred Williams's delight, he introduced him to high quality wine, of which Rudy Komon was immensely fond. In fact, Komon managed to convince quite a few of his artist friends, many of whom he friendly regarded as barbarians, about the delights of drinking wine. In fact, he was very proud of the claim that he had convinced even Ian Fairweather that he should switch from whisky to wine. As I understand it, Len French and Fred Williams ended up with quite good cellars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The incredible thing about Rudy Komon was that all this interest in what some people could well regard as the activities of a rich group, an upper class, a select collection of elitists, was his natural delight. He came here, as I said, a poor migrant from Czechoslovakia. He died a man renowned and loved by many people whom he had enthusiastically called barbarians during his life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was unaware of that. I must say that I was glad to have been called a barbarian by Rudy. That he regarded me sufficiently as a friend to call me a barbarian cheered me immensely. I know of no other person who has on his own contributed so much to the development of so many artists in their pursuit of excellence as has Rudy Komon. He, appropriately enough, was the subject of a painting which caused some controversy in the awarding of the latest Archibald Prize. He was, of course, a man who enjoyed controversy. In his 32 years in Australia the contribution that he made was enormous. We will all miss him. Only a fortnight before he died I drove him home from the opening of the Australian National Gallery when he commented on the magnificence of the Australian collection there. If any man would know whether that collection was magnificent it should be Komon, who contributed so much to the development of excellence in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Sunday, 24 October, the Sunday Telegraph carried an article headed 'School Head in Centre of Racist Uproar'. That article dealt with alleged statements made by the principal of the King's School at the school 's speech day. That matter was picked up in a speech concerning the estimates for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs by my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay). The honourable member said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the report in the Sydney Sunday Telegraph which related to statements that are alleged to have been made by Canon Stanley Kurrle, the headmaster of the King's School at Parramatta. It was suggested in the Sunday Telegraph that Canon Kurrle made a number of assertions about migrants not being brought to Australia in a time of recession. Indeed, it is suggested in that article that he said that there should be assistance to repatriate those people.</PARA>
<PARA> I find it disturbing that a person who purports to be a Christian would make those types of remarks. I think that, if Canon Kurrle did make those remarks, he should look into his own heart. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in his address he went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think that all of us as Australians should put aside these incredible racist approaches that are starting to surface in our community at present. </PARA>
<PARA>He further added:</PARA>
<PARA> I think the types of remarks that have been attributed to Canon Kurrle are repulsive, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I took a point of order which was not upheld by you, I suspect, Mr Deputy Speaker. I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I ask whether honourable members have to vouch for the accuracy of articles from which they quote. I was at that function at Kings School and I do not recall remarks of the sort that were mentioned in that newspaper article. I would like to know whether the honourable member has checked the accuracy of the article. </PARA>
<PARA>The question was clearly raised in my mind because I was at the function and I did not recall any remarks of that sort being made. On 25 October, the day before this matter was raised in the House, the Principal of The King's School wrote to me. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I imagine that you will be aproached over remarks I was supposed to have made at the Speech Day you attended. In case you require the information, I enclose a copy of the Sunday Telegraph's report, a transcript of what I actually said, and a copy of the printed report. Towards the end of this there is a reference to the need for national unity. I doubt whether anything in that paragraph would give grounds for the report in the Sunday Telegraph. </PARA>
<PARA>Last weekend the Sunday Telegraph carried a retraction of its report. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>APOLOGY TO REV. CANON S.W. KURRLE</PARA>
<PARA> In the edition of The Sunday Telegraph of October 24, an article was published headed ''School head in centre of 'racist' uproar.'' That article attributed to Canon S.W. Kurrle, the headmaster of The King's School, Parramatta, statements at the school's speech day which were not made. </PARA>
<PARA> Canon Kurrle has informed us that what he wished to suggest was that, in the light of the severe economic difficulties which confront the Australian economy today, and in particular in the light of the severe unemployment facing young people, it was desirable that newcomers should become Australians as quickly as possible, so that Australia could attain the unity necessary to overcome its problem as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a copy of the relevant tape containing the remarks that Canon Kurrle made on Australia's multicultural policy. He related those remarks particularly to the question of unemployment which was a matter of concern and which was raised in his address at the school. I have looked through the transcript of the tape. No reference is made to migrants being sent back from where they came. As I have mentioned, there was a questioning of the policy of multiculturalism. I did not agree with the way in which the Principal expressed them but I do not think it could be suggested in any way that his remarks were racist. For the benefit of honourable members I would like to table the extract from the tape of the Principal's speech as well as the formal printed address that he gave on Saturday, 16 October. I have sought the permission of honourable members opposite to table the tape extract and the address. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) 862.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) 254.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 305 persons were deported as a consequence of contravention of the conditions of their temporary entry and stay-these included overstayed visitors but separate statistics for that category are not maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 67.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Nil (working without authority is not one of the grounds specified in the Migration Act for making a Deportation Order).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Section 21A of the Migration Act 1958 provides that:</PARA>
<PARA> where the Commonwealth makes arrangements for the conveyance of a deportee from Australia, the deportee is liable to pay the Commonwealth an amount equal to the passage money and other charges;</PARA>
<PARA> a deportee is liable to pay the Commonwealth in respect of the cost of keeping and maintaining him while in custody, a daily maintenance rate determined by the Minister and published in the Gazette; and</PARA>
<PARA> an amount payable to the Commonwealth under these provisions as a debt due to the Commonwealth may be recovered in a Court.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department seeks to obtain payment voluntarily before departure ( instituting legal proceedings would delay departure and increase costs overall). Where a deportee has an airline ticket, that ticket is applied toward the departure. The Department records debts and letters are sent to each deportee advising them of their obligations and requesting payment. If this proves to be unsuccessful further letters are sent requesting payment by instalments if necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> The total expenditure from the detection, custody and deportation vote during 1981-82 was $1,266,646. This figure included the cost of maintenance in custody and the removal of deportees, however, without examining all individual files, it is not feasible to say how much of that expenditure was recoverable by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> The amount recovered during 1981-82 was $30,895. I should point out that the amounts not recovered included the cost of maintaining custody of the 146 people who attempted illegal immigration from the vessel VT838 and also includes the custody of other groups who were eventually expelled from Australia after rejection of claims of refugee status. These were unusual costs not normally encountered.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Australia relies heavily on the international sugar trade. In 1981 about 85 per cent of Australia's production of sugar was exported. In 1981/82 Australia exported 2.5 million tonnes of sugar worth about $764m.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The continuing problems in Soviet sugar production are of indirect benefit to Australia as the USSR usually sources most of its imported sugar from Cuba under a special arrangement, with the European Economic Community (EEC) being the next major supplier. In the past the USSR has not been a major market for Australian sugar; a shipment in 1981 of around 20,000 tonnes was the first sale of Australian sugar to the USSR since 1975. The main benefit to Australia is that because of its recent domestic shortages the USSR has absorbed some of the large surpluses of sugar produced by the EEC. Soviet imports of sugar from the EEC have grown from nothing in 1975 to 873,107 tonnes in 1981. Without this additional demand the world price may have been even lower than the present depressed level of US 6 cents per pound. However the effect of USSR domestic production shortages on the world market as a whole has been limited, as in recent years EEC exports have grown dramatically from 701,766 tonnes in 1975 to 5,343,752 tonnes in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Commonwealth Government has made strenuous representations to the EEC over the adverse effects that the Community's exports have had on the trade of efficient agricultural producers such as Australia. On sugar in particular Australia has made continuous efforts within the GATT to have the EEC accept disciplines on the subsidised export of its surplus sugar production. Through the irresponsible use of excessive price supports and export subsidies, the EEC has changed its position from that of a net sugar importer in 1976 to that of a major net exporter of sugar in 1981. At a time when the world's sugar trade is characterised by declining consumption, increasing protectionism in major markets and increasing competition from sugar substitutes, the effect of additional competition from subsidised EEC exports has been to depress the returns of efficient producers such as Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Commonwealth Government prefers to leave commodity marketing primarily to the private sector. On the question of new markets, however, the Commonwealth Government provides assistance to Australian exporters through the Trade Commissioner Service and the benefits available under the Export Markets Development Grants Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I understand that fuel ethanol production using sugar cane as a feed stock is uneconomic at current world oil prices. While the Commonwealth Government understands the problems faced by the Australian sugar industry due to low world sugar prices, the Commonwealth Government does not consider that these problems will be solved by providing financial assistance to encourage ethanol production as an alternative use of Australian sugar cane.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes. The suggestion is that service families be given the option to hire furniture for use in a service married quarter or rented home, whilst waiting for their own furniture to be delivered rather than remaining in temporary motel accommodation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question, based upon advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 16 March there were approximately 307 applicants awaiting provision of new services in the Woolloongabba Exchange district. Of these, 280 were deferred awaiting exchange equipment whilst the remaining 27 were delayed because of insufficient cable capacity in their area. About 300 of these deferred applications are now in the process of being connected.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Installation staff were diverted from the Woolloongabba Exchange to the South Brisbane Exchange in mid-January to complete that project because of the larger backlog of potential subscribers awaiting service in the South Brisbane area.</PARA>
<PARA> The staff diverted from the Woolloongabba Exchange were additional to normal staff and engaged solely in the installation of new exchange equipment. Their withdrawal from this project had no detrimental effect on the quality of service provided by the Woolloongabba Exchange as the normal maintenance staff remained.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government no longer requires Telecom to observe staff ceilings.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Telecom regards advertising as essential to give its customers an awareness of the wide range of products and services it provides. At the same time Telecom endeavours to ensure that its advertising is within the bounds of customer acceptance. In line with this, action has been taken recently within Telecom to scale down some of its newspaper advertisements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware that there has been comment and speculation in the press in recent times on matters relating to supporting parent's benefit. I am unable to comment on how these media reports have been interpreted in certain sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The provisions of the 1982-83 Budget in relation to my portfolio have shown that there are no changes to existing eligibility conditions for supporting parent's benefit. Existing provisions which require a claimant to take reasonable action for maintenance will be applied. Additionally, the law has been amended so that supporting parent beneficiaries are subject to the same income test as are widow pensioners-where maintenance for a child in excess of $ 6 per week is received, the excess will be treated as the income of the supporting parent beneficiary.</PARA>
<PARA> As is the case with all social security programs, supporting parent's benefit is subject to constant review to ensure that procedures employed effectively implement policy and that policy continues to be relevant in the light of changing circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A claim for supporting parent's benefit is determined as quickly as possible but where a delay is likely and hardship is evident, a counter payment may be made. There is no proposal to alter this procedure.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) There are a number of organisations which have the general characteristics of industry research associations, that is they perform or contract out research and development work and provide technical information and consultancy services for their members.</PARA>
<PARA> Under its research associations program the Government supports five associations which carry out these functions through income derived from members ' subscriptions and which make the results of research available to all members.</PARA>

Currently, new associations may be assisted through a once-only establishment grant of $40,000 and payment of an annual grant on a dollar for dollar basis, up to a maximum of $200,000, for a period of up to 5 years. Levels of support for associations recognised before 9 September 1980 is determined in the context of existing agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> The five associations supported through my Department receive grants which match industry research contributions in ratios either 1:1 or 1:2, up to certain maximum grant limits; in two cases (Sugar Research Institute and Bread Research Institute of Australia) this limit has been reached.</PARA>
<PARA> To gain recognition under the research associations program associations must fulfil certain criteria, two of the more important being:</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2942" SPEAKER="Anthony The Rt Hon J.D." NAMEID="BU4" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The article refers to a plan to build an experimental 3 megawatt wind generator on Orkney, to be completed in 1985 at a cost of #6m. This experiment, and other similar experiments in the United States of America and Europe will be monitored by the Department of National Development and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Considerable effort has been devoted to the investigation of wind power in Australia. Projects include the Bass Strait Wind Energy Study undertaken by the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Commission with support from the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration (NERD&amp;D) Program. The project recorded wind characteristics at selected sites on King and Flinders Islands, in order to assess the feasibility of using wind turbines to supplement the existing electricity supply.</PARA>
<PARA> Other wind power projects in Australia include: Projects associated with islands:</PARA>
<PARA> collection of wind data on Lord Howe Island by the University of New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA> installation and monitoring of a 50 kilowatt and a 22 kilowatt wind power generator on Rottnest Island by the State Energy Commission of Western Australia</PARA>
<PARA> Other projects:</PARA>
<PARA> various projects involving collection of wind data in North-West Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory, North-Western New South Wales and the Northern Territory;</PARA>
<PARA> collection of wind data from 550 locations throughout Australia by CSIRO, for a continental Wind Assessment;</PARA>
<PARA> testing and demonstration of a Dunlite hybrid energy system, producing electricity both from wind and from photovoltaic cells;</PARA>
<PARA> testing and display of small wind electric generators by the Gas and Fuel Corporation in Victoria;</PARA>
<PARA> investigations by CSIRO, the Australian National University, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and the University of Western Australia, into the feasibility of supplying wind-generated electricity to State electricity grids; and</PARA>
<PARA> development of a vertical axis wind turbine for water pumping by Royal Military College Duntroon.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As with most islands and remote settlements in Australia, Flinders Island relies on diesel generators for electricity generation. This results in electricity generation costs in excess of those prevailing on the Tasmanian mainland, which is reflected to some extent in the tariffs charged by the responsible authority, the Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Electricity consumption for the year ended 30 June 1982 was 1 million kilowatt hours. Over the past six years electricity consumption has increased at an average rate of 9.0 per cent per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Flinders Island currently has an installed diesel generating capacity of 400 kilowatts (kW). In 1980-81 the maximum demand for electricity was 280 kW.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) As far as I am aware no estimates of the cost of linking Flinders Island to the Tasmanian grid have been made. However, considering the high capital costs of undersea transmission cables and the relatively small quantities of electricity required it could be assumed that electricity supply from the Tasmanian grid would be much more expensive than diesel generation on the Island itself.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Bass Strait Wind Energy Survey has shown that both King and Flinders Islands have relatively high wind energy potentials. Average wind speeds at an optimal location on Flinders Island were in the order of 37 kilometres power hour. However the suitability of wind energy as a power source also depends on its economics, electricity load patterns, availability of reliable technology and availability of maintenance services.</PARA>
<PARA> The responsibility for the provision of power to Flinders Island rests with the Tasmanian Government, specifically with the Tasmanian Hydro-electric Commission. The Commission has investigated the use of wind generators to supplement power supply on the Bass Strait islands. Our understanding is that the investigations have shown that the use of wind power on these islands is not practical at this stage. The situation could change in the future as considerable world effort is being devoted to the development of improved wind generator equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) A 3 megawatt wind generator would be far in excess of the Island's total electricity requirements. Smaller units of up to 100 kilowatt capacity could be more appropriate for Flinders Island.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) to (5) The evalaution of contenders for the provision of a 155 mm general support weapon system (which includes the ammunition), was based on the available performance data for the contending weapon systems and compared with the specifications developed by Army.</PARA>
<PARA> The specifications for the 155 mm weapon system are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Range: 24,000 metres essential; 30,000 metres desirable.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Accuracy: (1) For Line-One metre for each 1,000 metres of range</PARA>
<PARA> (2) For Range-2.5 metres for each 1,000 metres or range</PARA>
<PARA> This capability is being sought in two stages:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The successful contender was the 155 mm M198 Howitzer now being purchased from the USA to replace Army's 5.5 inch guns. The M198 Howitzers are planned to enter service in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Modern technology ammunition is currently being evaluated overseas by a team from Departments of Defence and Defence Support. A decision on the types of ammunition to be adopted by Army is expected to be made in 1983, following which arrangements will be made for manufacture of the high usage types in Australia for entry into service in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> During evaluation of contenders for the replacement gun in 1977, none of the modern technology ammunition was available for firing trails to prove range and accuracy performance. Evaluation concentrated on assessing the contenders' characteristics against other requirements (eg., weight, mobility and ease of maintenance etc) and ensuring that the guns met the specifications required for the new types of ammunition now becoming available. The chosen weapon met this latter criterion.</PARA>
<PARA> Although evaluation is not yet complete the contending types of ammunition appear to meet range and accuracy requirements. This will be confirmed during the evaluation process, together with other factors such as cost, ease of manufacture and lethality. The choice will depend upon which contender best mets all requirements.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) On the basis of advice from Mercantile Mutual as to the difficulties it was confronted with and from Nationale Nederlanden on its proposed investment in Mercantile Mutual the Government accepted that a strengthening of the position of Mercantile Mutual's policyholders and shareholders could be expected to follow from the proposed 50 per cent equity participation in Mercantile Mutual by Nationale Nederlanden. In particular, Nationale Nederlanden emphasised its long term commitment to Mercantile Mutual. This equity participation was within the framework of relevant legislation including the Companies Act and the Insurance Act 1973 which do not require the giving of financial guarantees by parent or holding companies for subsidiary companies.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The existing requirements of the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945 imposed on foreign owned insurance companies carrying on insurance business or life insurance business in Australia are no less stringent than those applicable to Australian owned or controlled insurers.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) The most recent Annual Report of the Life Insurance Commissioner indicates that, in 1980-81, foreign controlled companies accounted for 22.3 per cent of total life insurance premium income earned in Australia and owned 14.8 per cent of total Statutory Fund Assets held in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No recent official statistics of this nature have been published. However, statistics published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 17 March 1978 indicate that, as at 30 June 1976, of the 215 general (non-life) insurance companies then operating in Australia, 107 were foreign controlled companies on the basis of the definition used by the Bureau; these foreign controlled companies wrote 37.8 per cent of business, as measured by premiums, in the year ended 30 June 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) The insurance sector is one of the areas of the economy where, because of national interest considerations, the Government imposes restrictions on foreign investment. It is the Government's policy to require the parties to foreign investment proposals in the insurance sector to first provide opportunities for Australian investors to express interest in acquiring the target businesses. If the Government is satisfied that the parties have made reasonable efforts in this direction then for approval proposals by foreign interests to acquire or increase a substantial interest in an existing insurance company must demonstrate that substantial benefits would be expected to accrue to Australia, taking account of the implications of the proposal for the financial sector and for the level of Australian ownership. In respect of proposals by foreign interests to establish a new insurance company, for approval proposals must also show substantial net economic benefits to Australia or, where the net economic benefits are small, must involve an effective partnership between Australian interests and the foreign investor in the ownership and control of the new company concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) See also (3) above. While the Government has introduced the Insurance Amendment Bill 1982 into Parliament for the purpose of strengthening the financial standards to be observed by all authorised insurance companies (ie both Australian owned and foreign owned and controled), it does not see a need for special additional standards to be imposed on foreign owned and controlled insurers. It is also pertinent to note that under the OECD Declaration on guidelines for multinational enterprises, Australia has agreed to accord to foreign interests treatment under laws and regulations no less favourable than that accorded in like situations to domestic enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Government's reference to State government insurance offices was mentioned in the context of one of a number of influences which had contributed to adverse underwriting results in the private sector of the general (non-life) insurance industry. However, the powers of the Commonwealth do not extend to insurance business conducted by the States except to the extent that the insurance business extends beyond the limits of the State concerned.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has the Technical Committee on Agricultural Chemicals (TCAC) cleared mirex for use in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Information concerning Clearances issued by the Technical Committee on Agricultural Chemicals (TCAC) is not made public as such information is deemed to be confidential. Premature disclosure could disadvantage the manufacturer by giving his competitors forewarning of his marketing intentions.</PARA>
<PARA> When the TCAC issues a clearance, the applicant is free to apply for registration in the States where it is intended to market the product. State registration authorities publish a list of registered products and information may be obtained from them on all products registered in their State.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The TCAC, in its consideration of submissions for clearance of any proposed use of an agricultural chemical takes into account all available information concerning the chemical and assesses this information in the light of the form in which the chemical is to be applied and the conditions under which it is to be used. The evaluation of this information is designed to determine, in respect to each product and proposed use, the usefulness, effectiveness, safety to users , by-standers, consumers, crops, livestock, wildlife and the natural environment , and possible effects on trade.</PARA>
<PARA> In the process of evaluating each use for each agricultural chemical, the TCAC obtains the advice and recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Poison Scheduling (Standing) Committee and pesticides and Agricultural chemicals (Standing) Committee on poison hazard, toxicity and residue issues. This would include characteristics such as whether a compound was carcinogenic, fetotoxic or teratogenic. In all these matters the TCAC seeks to obtain concensus among the nine separate authorities and organisations involved before issuing Clearance.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has published two Monographs on the Evaluation of the Carcenogenic Risk of Chemicals to Humans relevant to mirex (IARC (1974) Volume 5, pages 203-210 and IARC (1979) Volume 20 , pages 283-301). On page 295 of the latter it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 'In the absence of adequate data in humans it is reasonable, for practical purposes, to regard mirex as if it presented a carcinogenic risk to humans.'</PARA>
