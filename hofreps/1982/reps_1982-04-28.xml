<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Prime Minister, in light of the appalling escalation of organised crime: Is it a fact that the Minister for Administrative Services and the Attorney-General have repeatedly rejected my persistent calls over the past three years for a national crimes commission? Is it also a fact that the Prime Minister's Government is reluctant to agree to my proposal, as set out in the Notice Paper, to set up a Federal-State crimes commission? Has his attention been drawn to today's Press article relating to the setting up of such a commission? Will he take immediate steps to set up, preferably, a national crimes commission? If that is still not acceptable, will he set up, with the co- operation of the States, a Federal-State commission? Finally, will he give an assurance that any such commission will be given adequate powers to subpoena witnesses and evidence and, as well, adequate investigative powers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has happened with the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking, the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking goes some way towards the establishment of what might loosely be called a Federal or national crimes commission. It is an example of governments of the Commonwealth and the States working very closely together for purposes which I am sure all honourable members in this House, indeed everyone, would want to support. The Joint Task Force is another example of the kind of co-operation which has developed in more recent times because of a growing concern by governments and communities at the development and growth of crime involving high finance, drugs and whatever else people like to name. I think the time has come when we have to question whether the conventional means of law enforcement, as known in the past, are adequate to deal with the circumstances that we have to face at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In some senses the two joint royal commissions that have been established can be regarded as an experiment which could well lead to the establishment of a national crimes commission, but the Attorney-General and other Ministers are examining this and papers will come before the Government so that we can make a considered judgment about it in the not too distant future. In these objectives obviously one would hope to have the co-operation of the States. For a long while the States have regarded law enforcement in many areas as a close preserve of their own and have not relished the development of the Australian Federal Police or the growing involvement of the Commonwealth in areas of law enforcement, but necessarily, because of the nature of Commonwealth law and of crimes that are committed in the modern world, there has been a growing Commonwealth involvement. I suspect that that is likely to continue.</PARA>
<PARA> If there were a national crimes commission, there may be three areas that one would need to examine. Obviously one is the maintenance and enforcement of Commonwealth laws as they are. That in itself would give the commission very considerable power and would give it a very considerable field in which to operate. One would hope to be able to establish such a body in co-operation with the States so that it would be a joint body. One would hope also that such a body would be able to make recommendations on where changes of the law might be desirable as a result of its own findings. I believe that if the Commonwealth were to wait until it had the total agreement of all States, through either the Premiers Conference or the Attorneys-General, the youngest members here might be grey with age before that would be achieved. I do not really believe that as a nation we have time for that.</PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be understood that a national crimes commission-as the words are loosely used-would in many ways have the powers of a standing royal commission. I mentioned earlier that what is happening with the joint royal commissions is in a sense a precursor-an experiment-which could well lead to the development of a national crimes commission. When the Government made the decisions to establish those joint royal commissions I think that was in its mind, at least in part. The powers appropriate to a royal commission are probably appropriate for such a commission, but it needs to be said that while such a body might have special investigators it would still be operating with and through the normal police forces; it would not involve establishing a new arm or body of people for the normal enforcement of the law. Such a commission would be operating with and through the police forces of the Commonwealth and of the States.</PARA>
<PARA> Many people throughout the community believe that these issues need to be examined very seriously by governments at present. There is a widespread concern at the nature of crime, about which we read more and more as each year passes. Governments need to examine whether the traditional methods of law enforcement are adequate for the protection of the community. If there is corruption in high places, in a police force or anywhere else, and if it is not checked and rooted out, it tends to spread and become pervasive throughout society. That is something which I am sure this Parliament would be committed to preventing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services as the Minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police. I refer to the raid on 19 February on the Fertility Control Clinic in Melbourne and subsequently on the home of Dr Wainer. I ask questions concerning the purpose of the raid and the material seized. Specifically, how was the Press informed of the raid on the clinic? How many police were involved in the raid and what was the purpose of having whatever number were involved? Are any charges to be laid? Why were the business partners of Dr Wainer not involved in police action in the same way as his home was raided? What was the reason for the delay in the raid, having regard to the fact that the Commonwealth Department of Health made inquiries in May and June of last year into certain matters concerning the charging of medical benefits items at the clinic?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for giving me some warning earlier today that this question would be asked. I take note, Mr Speaker, of your caution about the sub judice rule. In relation to the question of the delay by the police in acting on the information, or the request, by the Department of Health -which I think was on 29 June-I am advised by the Police Commissioner that the amount of work and other matters referred to the police meant that their investigations were not completed until January of this year. The raid was then carried out. Secondly, as to the presence of the media at the clinic, I am further advised by the Police Commissioner that the media representatives did arrive 20 minutes after the raid commenced and that the police have no knowledge of how the media representatives may have arrived on the scene. I am advised that it was Dr Wainer who invited the media representatives to go inside after they had arrived on the scene.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member also asked for the number of policemen involved in the raid. I am advised by the Commissioner that 40 people were involved in the raid, and the Commissioner tells me that that was an operational decision; that that was the number of policemen needed, first of all, to execute 10 search warrants and interview eight people simultaneously. Of course, there were other related matters in the investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member asked why Dr Wainer's home was treated differently from those of his partners. Again, I am advised that nothing set Dr Wainer's home apart from the homes of his partners. I am advised that a warrant was executed at the home of Dr Bayliss and one was in existence for premises at 52 Albany Road, Toorak, shown in records of the Corporate Affairs Commission as the home of Dr Rutman. These premises were, however, found to be in the course of construction and unoccupied. The home of Dr Wainer at 2 Reynolds Road, Research, was searched on 25 February after the doctor withdrew a restraining order obtained by him on 19 February.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Prime Minister aware that the Queensland Premier, Mr Bjelke- Petersen, personally invited the USS Truxtun to visit Brisbane and that the nuclear warship will be arriving on Thursday, 29 April? Is he also aware that, when it appeared that Australian Atomic Energy Commission scientists might not be able to carry out radiation checks on the ship, the Queensland Premier was reported as saying that the Truxtun would berth in Brisbane whether or not radiation safety checks were made? Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to the fact that a radiation leak was detected from a sister ship of the USS Truxtun, the USS Longreach, while it was in port in Okinawa, Japan, in March 1980? Has his attention been drawn also to the recent statement by the Queensland Premier that primary responsibility for the overseeing of the nuclear industry should reside with the States? Finally, in view of the Queensland Premier's attitude to safety procedures surrounding the nuclear establishment, the USS Truxtun, what is his Government's policy with regard to Federal and State responsibility in the development of the nuclear industry and establishment of nuclear safeguards in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1926" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Government has established the procedures under which nuclear powered ships can visit Australian ports. Those procedures are clearly understood by port authorities. Provided those safety procedures are complied with, the policy of this Government is to encourage the visits of ships of allied navies and of the United States of America, and we will continue to do so. It has been my practice, when we are advised of an impending visit or a suggested visit by the United States, to write to the Premiers concerned to see whether they are agreeable to the visit. At this point I am not aware of any Premier having refused such a visit. I hope that those circumstances will not arise. The visits of nuclear powered warships to Cockburn Sound have been frequent and often in recent times. I believe that one of the nuclear powered aircraft carriers visited Hobart at an earlier point, but I stand subject to correction on that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was the Enterprise. Other visits have taken place. Visits to Brisbane by the USS Truxtun and maybe of other ships would be in conformity with existing policy and in support of the United States alliance. I hope the honourable member would support those visits and that practice, because, if we are to be allies of the United States, we need to make it quite plain that we establish the circumstance in which the alliance can be realistic. It can hardly be realistic if, even in spite of complying with all normal and appropriate safety requirements for nuclear powered ships, we say: 'Your ships cannot visit our ports'. I hope that that was not the position that the honourable member was adopting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EG4">Mr FISHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Communications aware of plans by Telecom Australia to close a large number of manual assistance centres throughout Australia? I particularly refer to the centres at Swan Hill and Horsham in my electorate that are scheduled to close in 1983. This would leave the region of northern and western Victoria without any personalised directory, emergency or manual assistance services. As earlier rationalisation and regionalisation has not proved to be satisfactory, will the Minister ensure that Telecom reviews its plans in the interests of service to the community and retaining country employment opportunities?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1927" SPEAKER="Sinclair The Rt Hon I.McC." NAMEID="5E4" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="NEW ENGLAND" MINISTERIAL="LEADER OF THE HOUSE; COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think all of us recognise the tremendous contribution that telephonists have made towards the efficiency of the telephone network throughout Australia over the years. However, there have been changes, and these are reflected in the upgrading of manual exchanges to automatic and the progressive upgrading of switching arrangements themselves to enable more efficient and more comprehensive services. For example, the introduction of international subscriber dialling has come with the upgrading of these service centres. At the same time there is a problem in providing an adequate manual assistance form, given the automation of the system, and Telecom, in recognising the needs of its customers, is developing a program which will see some changes over the next few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recognise the particular concern of the honourable gentleman which is reflected in quite a number of other areas. There is a worry about the extent to which these changes will disadvantage local employment and also affect the services available to local communities. Telecom hopes in the process of its analysis of its draft plans to take these factors into account. I have asked it to submit its recommendations to me before confirmation so that a final determination can be made taking into account the local employment opportunities and also the range of services that customers of Telecom rightly require.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Now that the Queen of Canada has granted her country full constitutional independence, will the Government request the Queen of Australia to do the same for our nation and, in particular, to remove the residual constitutional links between the Australian States and Britain which compromise Australian independence?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1927" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has been trying to get agreement between the States on this matter for quite some time. As the honourable member would know, to the extent that those residual links have any meaning, they are likely to affect the States more than they would affect the Commonwealth, or its powers and laws. The attitudes of the States have in fact been different. The matter will be discussed, and I hope discussed in depth and brought to finality, at the forthcoming Premiers Conference. If we cannot get agreement between all the States, maybe we can achieve a solution that will, so long as there is agreement between the Commonwealth and a State, be progressed in relation to the particular State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think most members in the House would understand that the situations in Canada and Australia were markedly different. The Canadian Constitution was drawn before ours and no doubt our founding fathers learnt from the deficiencies which were already evident in the Canadian Constitution and which have been rectified only as a result of Prime Minister Trudeau's action. There was nothing built into the Canadian Constitution about means of revising, changing, altering or amending the Constitution. That was a great and grievous fault. However difficult it may be, there are processes for amendment of our Constitution which have been successful on a number of occasions, and that is one quite remarkable difference.</PARA>
<PARA> I was advised recently that until a very few years ago it was the practice of Her Majesty to sign the appointments of all ambassadors from Canada to other countries. I would have thought that that would be an odd circumstance, one that would hardly meet with the approval of any of the Australian governments of recent times.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been many differences between the campaign in Canada to break the residual links, as has been done in an amicable and appropriate way, and the circumstances which prevail in Australia. I think there were restraints in relation to Canada. I do not believe that Australian citizens are conscious of any restraints in this country as a result of any residual links that may exist.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time of the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands this Government, because of the seriousness with which it viewed the situation, recalled our Ambassador, Mr Dan, for urgent consultations. The Canadian Government also recalled its Ambassador. Mr Dan left Argentina on 6 April and reported to me immediately he arrived here on 9 April. After a period of further consultations in the Department it was decided that Mr Dan should go to New York for consultations with the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations and others on United Nations aspects of the Falklands situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has now been decided, following those consultations, that Mr Dan should return to his post in Buenos Aires because a crucial and sensitive period in the Falklands crisis now lies ahead. It is a period in which every effort must be made to convince Argentina that its interests and those of the international community are best served through the process of negotiation rather than armed conflict. Upon his return to Argentina, Mr Dan will convey a personal message from me to the Argentine Foreign Minister. Although the contents of that message must remain confidential at this stage, it will make absolutely clear the seriousness with which this Government views the Argentine invasion of the Falklands and emphasise our belief that Argentina should comply with resolution 502 of the United Nations Security Council calling on it to withdraw its troops as the basis for a diplomatic solution.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dan, as is normal for an ambassador, will be reporting on developments in the Falklands and in Argentina.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Prime Minister a question. Is he correctly quoted in the current issue of the Bulletin which states that he claims his Government is ' taking less of each dollar produced in Australia, 2 to 2.5 less', whatever that may mean? Do the Budget Estimates for this year show that in fact his Government is collecting 25.5c in tax revenue for each dollar produced, compared with 25.2c per dollar in 1975-76? Is it not a fact that, far from reducing Federal tax, his Government has increased it by between 2c and 2.5c for each dollar produced? Is it not also a fact that his Government has become the highest taxing government in our history? Is this not a betrayal of promises solemnly made by the Prime Minister, at three elections over the past seven years, that taxes would be reduced?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Leader of the Opposition asks questions of this kind he always conveniently forgets that the deficits of Labor governments were leading to a deficit approaching 5 per cent of gross domestic product. If we want to find out the demands of government on the resources of the country, we have to take not only the actual taxation that is collected in any one year but also have to add to that the deficit which has to be funded in one way or another. While the Labor deficits were growing dramatically and approaching 5 per cent-I think they were 4.9 per cent at the maximum-under this Government the deficits have been reduced to around 1 per cent or less. At the end of the three years of the Labor Government that Government was taking about 6.5c more out of every dollar produced. After the period that this Government has been in office we are taking 2c to 2.5c less out of each dollar produced. That takes into account not only taxation revenue but also deficit financing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE6">Mr VINER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, the United Kingdom Employment Bill 1982 does have relevance to the legislation I presented to this House, which was passed by this House and is now before the Senate. The United Kingdom Employment Bill seeks to attack an area of fundamental concern to that country. This Government's Bill attacks the same area of concern; that is, the rights of the individual and the closed shop system of excluding people from their normal occupations unless they join a particular union. There is that similarity between what we are seeking to achieve in Australia and what the Thatcher Government is seeking to achieve in the United Kingdom. One other important area that the United Kingdom legislation opens up is to expose trade union funds to suits for damages. Of course, the House will be aware that in our legislation to support voluntary unionism we, likewise, will expose trade union funds to suits for damages or compensation at the hands of an individual who has been discriminated against or victimised because that individual has chosen to exercise his personal right not to belong to a union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United Kingdom legislation is going through the House of Commons. I was interested-if I might inform my colleague-to read some of the United Kingdom Press reports which, before the debate in the House of Commons, noted that there was no provision in the legislation with respect to what the British call 'lay- offs'. The term used in Australia, of course, is 'stand-downs'. It was seen in the United Kingdom that something needed to be done within its industrial relations legislation to allow employers to protect themselves against industrial action which meant that they could not continue usefully to employ their employees.</PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to note also, with respect to the United Kingdom legislation, that the Thatcher Government is concerned to outlaw what are, in effect, secondary boycotts brought by one union against a company which is not unionised . Of course, it is some years since we amended the Trade Practices Act to outlaw secondary boycotts in Australia. I know that it has been suggested in some quarters that our legislation is not widely supported in Australia. I believe that that assertion is quite wrong. In the three areas in which we have moved- voluntary unionism, standing down of employees and industry unions-there has been widespread support from the man or the woman in the street, from unions and from companies. The latest evidence of this widespread support comes from the National Farmers Federation which, at the conference being held at the moment, unanimously resolved to support the Government's legislation. A Press statement to that effect has been released today.</PARA>

In fact, the very averages themselves indicate that the reverse is the truth, because the Labor Government of 1972 inherited an economy that was strong and well-based but had relatively low levels of taxation and responsible levels of government expenditure. One has only to look at the 10 per cent increase in real terms in each of the following three years, which occurred under Labor, the massive increase in Commonwealth employment and the massive increases in expenditure-in one Budget alone, expenditure increased by 46 per cent in one year, and in other years it increased by figures between 20 per cent and 25 per cent-to realise that in these circumstances the Labor Government was on a rising plane of expenditure and a rising plane of demand on the nation's resources. It is not much consolation to the last of that failed lot of Treasurers to be able to say that the average was not all that bad, because they started with some good figures that they had inherited from an earlier administration. We inherited at the outset the kinds of figures that were left in the Labor Budget and we have been working to diminish the deficit, to diminish the demand for resources and to free resources so that they can be used by individuals in Australia rather than be absorbed and taken charge of totally by governments. So we are on a falling plane of demand for resources; the Labor Party was on a rising plane. The averages about which the Leader of the Opposition spoke totally distort the attitudes of the Labor Government and what he was trying to depict about the attitudes of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have only to take the circumstances in which the Leader of the Opposition has himself said that he is a high tax man-he has made that very plain-and in which his shadow Treasurer has said that Labor will face a mammoth task of persuading the electorate that it will have to fund a larger public sector under Labor than would be the case under this Government, to see that it is perfectly plain that, whatever the Labor Party may say, its real wishes are for a larger public sector, under Labor control, and that has to mean a larger deficit or higher taxation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. Is it a fact that one of the main problems facing disabled people is in finding employment and being trained so that they can obtain employment?

If so, will that work continue now that the IYDP is over?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that one of the major problems facing disabled people is in their obtaining work experience and training to enable them to obtain work , and to keep it, and to take a full part in normal community life. It is also true that during 1981, which was the International Year of Disabled Persons, the Commonwealth Government, with the States and through the Commonwealth Employment Service and a range of voluntary bodies, made considerable progress in improving the employability of very many disabled people. This was done through subsidies to employers to encourage them to take on disabled people and give them work experience and job opportunities. I think jobs were found last year for some 14, 000 disabled people, which was an increase of certainly over 50 per cent on 1980 . I can assure the honourable member that the efforts which were made during 1981 will certainly be continued this year and in the future. The Commonwealth Employment Service will continue to do everything possible to provide work experience and training for disabled people so that more of them can find employment, keep it and lead a useful, active and enjoyable life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the figures I have just referred to, I have reminded myself-and no doubt the honourable member will not be at all surprised to hear this-that his State of Queensland led in the creation of employment opportunities for disabled people. Last year in Queensland more than 5,000 people were placed in employment under our programs through the CES, which was some 2,000 more than the figure recorded by Queensland's nearest rival, New South Wales. But the national picture was indeed very good. Great improvements were made in the employment prospects for disabled people. We certainly will be taking every step to ensure that those efforts are continued.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the last part of the honourable gentleman's question I point out that both the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and the Joint Commonwealth-New South Wales Task Force on Drug Trafficking are specifically related to drugs. Anything related to those matters can be adequately covered by the royal commissions. If they cannot, as we have indicated on other occasions, we are fully prepared to see that the terms of reference are widened, if that can be demonstrated to be necessary. We have done that in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inquiry into Customs matters is an administrative one because clearly there have been some administrative shortfalls. This has been recognised by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Public Service Board over the last couple of years. New arrangements have been under examination and are shortly to be put in force. But the inquiry will enable those matters to be taken into account to see whether, in the judgment of a very experienced person, the new arrangements will be adequate and will contribute sufficiently to sort out other problems that may be within the Department. Having in mind the nature of the inquiry-it is forward looking and will make sure that the Department is functioning properly and that laws and rules are being equally and appropriately applied to all Australian citizens-and the terms in which it has been mounted, we believe it will best serve the needs as the Government sees them.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Justice Williams's recommendations have been acted upon in relation to the royal commissions and not in relation to the police at this point. I think the honourable member would recognise that even to make the records available to the royal commissioners under the same conditions of secrecy as applied to the Commissioner of Taxation would be a very substantial step indeed. It is a break with tradition and practice. The short answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question is that we believed that there was a necessity to take this step but we wanted to assess the results from that before considering whether further action ought to be taken. But a very substantial step has been taken in relation to the royal commissions and access to records. I hope that the Deputy Leader recognises that.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is only one way to describe the coal handling operations at Newcastle, and that is to say that there has been a tragic debacle within a series of industrial disputes and an inability of the New South Wales Government to resolve the arrangements for the building of further coal handling facilities. This has caused an undue delay to the point now where we have a rather embarrassing sight of anything up to 50 ships waiting off-shore incurring enormous demurrage costs. That demurrage has been calculated at something like $ 5 a tonne to the industry. When one considers that over the total tonnage going out of Newcastle one sees that an enormous amount of money is being lost to the industry in that region and to Australia. My understanding of the situation is that to try to meet the chaotic situation at the moment the New South Wales Government, the Joint Coal Board and the colliery owners have come together on a quota plan which is to operate from 1 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No spot sales or new contracts can be entered into for that year once the quota scheme is in operation. I think it is terribly unfortunate that at a time when we have market opportunities they have to be restricted because of this bungling that is going on. Obviously the plan will have an effect on development opportunities. That in turn will have an effect on job opportunities and the general progress of the Hunter region. Last year Australia had record sales of coal. We got up to 50 million tonnes. That was an increase of about 7 million tonnes on the previous year. But in New South Wales the increase was only 400, 000 tonnes. All the extra increase came basically from Queensland, where arrangements and facilities were better organised. I only hope that in this particular industry, one industry which has great market opportunities and a great chance of giving more activity to commercial life in Australia, we can get more co-operation from the unions and a little more foresight applied by the New South Wales Government.</PARA>

<PARA> A table in Statement No. 6 of last year's Budget Papers provides for receipts of all Commonwealth authorities and the public sector borrowing requirement, in both cases as a proportion of gross domestic product. If one totals those figures and takes the figure for each year from and including 1973-74 to 1980-81 , one establishes that the Prime Minister's assertion is dead wrong, and I presume knowingly wrong. It establishes that for every such year the proportion of resources demanded from the public by taxes as a proportion of gross domestic product has been higher under his Government than for any preceding post-war period but that of the Labor Government preceding his. In relation to the public sector borrowing requirement, or the measurement of the deficit, the deficit comes out as the highest proportion of gross domestic product for the year 1977- 78. In any case, the total for each year of the Fraser Government is higher than for any year under the Labor Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) referred to a statement I made in 1978 to the effect that if the Australian Labor Party did not win the election in 1980 it would face the prospect after the 1983 election of having to increase taxes to maintain a viable public sector. He made that statement in the context of trying to escape the charge that his Government is a high tax government. He neglected entirely, of course, to make the point that I had made that statement in 1978, at a time when the Government was actually cutting taxes after the 1977 election. Soon after I made that statement the Government totally reversed the thrust of its policy. In the 1978 Budget there was a complete turn around, with the breach of the election promise to cut taxes, the introduction of a surcharge on income tax and the abolition of the previous policy in respect of the crude oil levy, resulting in massive increases in that levy. We have since had the abolition of tax indexation and increases in indirect taxes. So, as the Prime Minister well knows, since I made that statement in 1978 the position has changed completely and utterly. To quote that statement as though it has some relevance today is a gross misrepresentation of my position.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A sound and dynamic relationship with China is accepted by both sides of the House as a vital element in Australia's foreign policy. It was with this in mind that in 1978 this Government moved to form the Australia-China Council. The Council has a distinguished membership which is committed to fostering contacts between Australian and Chinese media groups and specialists in the fields of science, the arts, social sciences, sport and education. It is now well established, and is performing creditably its intended role of furthering our ties with the People's Republic of China. While the Council has an important role to play, the Government during the year moved in other ways to consolidate Australia's relations with China. I bring some of these to the attention of honourable members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Visits in both directions at ministerial and vice-ministerial level have proved most valuable. My own visit to Beijing in January last year enabled me to meet Chinese leaders and to advance several bilateral issues. Official visits were also made by my colleagues, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and the former Minister for Health the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), who, during his visit, signed a technical co-operation agreement between Australia and China. A bilateral cultural exchanges agreement was signed during a visit to Australia by China's Minister for Culture in 1981. In September last year a protocol to the 1973 trade agreement was signed during a visit to Australia by the Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some activities of the Council during the year in question. With the active help of the Council, China's new English language newspaper the China Daily commenced publication in June 1981. Through the United Nations association , the Council sponsored a Joint Australia-China Press seminar in Beijing. The seminar looked at case studies of Press reporting in both countries about the other. </PARA>
<PARA> A most imaginative cultural venture was undertaken by the Australian company Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd during the year, when a priceless exhibition of classical Chinese paintings was brought to Australia. The outstanding success of this event was helped by the Council's efforts in bringing to this country several prominent Chinese artists to complement the exhibition. These artists were able to explain something of the techniques and meaning of Chinese art to Australians. Grants were made by the Council for exchanges of professional visits, study and collaborative research in various areas of science, medicine and engineering. One particular research program already under way in the field of geology is expected to yield valuable information on water and soil resources for both countries over the next few years. A group of Aboriginal health workers went to China during the year to study China's well developed system of rural health care. This project went ahead on the recommendation of the National Aboriginal Advisory Council. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, the Australia-China Council has initiated several programs which promote both the teaching of the Chinese language in Australian schools and the training of a corps of Australian interpreters with Chinese language skills. This body of trained interpreters will be invaluable in assisting both government and industry in further developing contacts with China. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Council in its day to day activities serves as a centre for advice and an organisation to which the general public can direct inquiries about China . Its regular newsletter is an important aspect of this advising and disseminating work. The Council's activities have the wholehearted support not only of this Government but also of the Chinese Government. It gives me great pleasure to table the Australia-China Council's report for 1980-81. </PARA>

The early flow of contacts and good will points to a relationship which is based on mutual benefit. Australians are always in awe of the intellectual discipline of the Chinese. We admire their sense of order and balance and their achievements in every field of human endeavour in over 2,000 years of recorded history. By the same token, we understand that the Chinese are somewhat interested in and to some extent awed by our wealth and vigour and the range of our achievements managed in less than two centuries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been some clear growth. It has been exceptional in the terms of commercial links. For example, during 1979-80 we imported more than $200m worth of miscellaneous manufactured products and foodstuffs from China. During the same period we exported to China more than $850m worth of cereals and miscellaneous manufactured products, the big emphasis being on wheat, which was worth more than $500m. I would like to make a few comments about the wheat market. I remember being in China in 1973. I was impressed that the Chinese placed great score by the fact that there needs to be healthy wheat production in Australia. It is of advantage to China, which can suffer from the ravages of famine. His Excellency Li Xiannian was anxious to say: 'Please keep Australian farmers growing wheat'. I was impressed by that. I note-this might interest members of the National Country Party-that the Americans seem to be getting a fair share of the action now. We should remind the Americans that we did not really go into the Latin American market on the understanding that we would have the Chinese market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that's a case of the wrong government. The point I was making is that the Americans have got the Latin American market and the Chinese market at the same time. I hope the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) will have the chance to discuss this matter with the Vice-President of the United States of America when he is on his visit here. On this question, I raise the more serious matter of our relationship with Japan, which in turn affects relationships with China. The American policy at present is to talk about sales of arms, not only to China and to Taiwan-which will certainly be embarrassing for President Reagan-but also to Japan. I think there will be problems with China and Korea if that sort of policy is continued. One would hope that it does not cause further disturbance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real issue is to get peace and stability in the region-a process in which China can certainly play a leading role. In fact, with China and Japan, we can do much to stabilise the whole of the region and bring peace between China and Vietnam and also guarantee peace to Kampuchea. These are important matters and we have to have an independent foreign policy to get that across. I hope the Chinese appreciate that position now. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to dispute the reported claim that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser ) seems to be more favourably known in higher circles in Beijing than any previous Australian Prime Minister. I would be remiss if I did not say that the first Australian Prime Minister known to the Chinese was Gough Whitlam-and so he ought to be known because he formalised relationships with China when we took office in 1972. We have to remember that China was able to be admitted to the United Nations in 1971 whilst the Liberal Government of 1971 refused to recognise its existence. If Mr Fraser is so well known in China, we want him to use his influence to defuse the situation in Indo-China in the way that I have mentioned; that is, by persuading the governments of China and Vietnam to get together and to withdraw all support from the genocidal Pol Pot. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to stress the vital part which language skills play in bringing together two peoples of widely different cultures. It is encouraging that more Chinese are learning English from Australian teachers and that increasing numbers of Australians are learning Chinese. The new Australian information officer in Beijing is very fluent in Mandarin and reads and writes Chinese. I assume that the films he has on loan are dubbed in Mandarin, are in good repair and are used in conjunction with the Chinese language material available in our embassy. Presumably the information officer works closely with the cultural attache and there is, of course, no duplication of effort. It is very essential to note the point that these two officers are very fluent in Chinese. The way to get the best results seems to be to have people in our embassies who are well versed in the language of the country in which they are placed. So, just as there is harmony, in the cultural area I hope that there is harmony right down the line, particularly with the Trade Commissioner Office of the Embassy which should be fully aware of the political issues which could affect Australia's trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Dealing with China, which has a quarter of the world's population, is a difficult task. We must ensure that Australia is served in the best possible way by its representatives overseas. I have no doubt that we are well served there at present. We want a co-ordinated well-informed group representing us in China. The Australia-China Council has set a good example of the type of effort but we must continue to do justice to the enormous task of having a worthwhile, permanent and peaceful relationship between our two peoples. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the needs for this debate has just been illustrated by the comments of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) who is sitting at the table. Much noise comes from the representatives of Tasmania in this House but there is very little creative thinking about the particular problems that face that State. The first thing that must be said about the economy of Tasmania is that in essence the very real problems Tasmania faces are the responsibility of the Government which sits in this place. One would say that of all the States whether they be Liberal or Labor. The fact that they face economic problems, that most of them today face stagnant economies and that relatively speaking all of them have high levels of unemployment is not primarily the responsibility of their State governments but the result of economic policies pursued from this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is about time in debates in this place that we avoided the simple and easy point-scoring tactics. If members want to have a go at some State government they blame it for unemployment, they blame it for inflation and they blame it for a stagnant economy. If we are to have a real and worthwhile debate, particularly about the regional economic problems that this country faces, we must tackle the problem other than by point-scoring tactics in which people simply pour scorn on particular State governments for aspects of their economic management and blame them for the problems which all Australian States suffer and which derive very much from the policies pursued in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> When we have economic arguments about the state of the nation, let us make it quite clear that the buck stops here. I am quite prepared to apply that principle to Labor and Liberal States. For instance, Tasmania and South Australia have competed over the last two years in terms of high unemployment rates. It is not a matter in respect of which competition is particularly admirable, but for the last 12 months those two States have competed for the position of having the highest rates of unemployment in this country. Let me say that the unemployment rates in those two States have very little to do either with the Lowe-Holgate State Government or the Tonkin Government. They have most to do with the Government that sits here. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just make one aside about the Premier of South Australia. Dr Tonkin's only error was to convince the South Australian people in the 1979 election that he could solve all these economic problems. He therefore generated expectations about State economic power which, of course, he was not able to meet. But the economic problems his Government now faces, just as the economic problems the Tasmanian Government faces, are primarily the responsibility of the Government here. The fact is that both the Tasmanian and South Australian economies at the present stage of Australia's economic development-this is not to say that this will last for all time; it certainly was not true at times in the past-are vulnerable and are most likely to suffer severely in periods of recession. If a recession is generated by economic policies pursued here from Canberra those vulnerable States such as South Australia and Tasmania and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Victoria, will be most severely affected. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems that this country will have to face in the 1980s is that it is creating potentially two Australias. One Australia will comprise the economically resource rich States possessing those resources which are valued at this stage of development. I refer to New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia as the resource rich States, the economically advantaged States. The second Australia will comprise Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria. Those States at this stage are have-not States. As I shall point out later, the policies pursued for the last seven years from the Government benches in this Parliament have tended to lay the foundations for a widening gap between the resource rich States and the other States whereas it should be the task of any Federal government to unite the nation, to pursue economic policies and direct them at States such as Tasmania because--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to the honourable member for Braddon. Given that this House has five members supposedly representing Tasmania, issues on Tasmania are practically never raised by this representation which will last for little more than another 18 months. As I suggested before these very noisy interruptions from the Tasmanian representatives, who are rarely heard in this House-in fact they have grown particularly quiet of late-the task of a responsible federal government should be to try to break down this economic division which may mean economic distributive policies in favour of those States which are weaker in the valued resources of a particular time. At the moment the resources which are much valued in economic development internationally and in this country are the transportable energy resources such as coal and gas-with which Tasmania is not well supplied-and of course bauxite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tasmania in many ways is the most vulnerable of the State economies, the one most dependent on intelligent federal economic policies. I quote an analysis by a Tasmanian economist, Mr Wilde, as to some forms of vulnerability in the Tasmanian economy:</PARA>
<PARA> Hampered by its very weak and inflexible financial base and physical isolation, and overwhelmed by outside economic forces, a Tasmanian government can do little to support or attract industry especially in competition with the wealthier States and is hard pressed to formulate feasible long term plans in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA>All of those points very much need stressing. They are: Tasmania's weak financial base, its physical isolation, the fact that it can so easily be overwhelmed by outside economic forces, the difficulties a Tasmanian government has in attracting industry, particularly in competition with the wealthier States, and the difficulties of a Tasmanian government formulating a feasible long term plan in isolation. It cannot do this without proper planning and backing from a Federal government with the economic resources. The same point has been made in one of the best reports on the Tasmanian economy that I have read. I would suggest that all honourable members from Tasmania read it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will wait until this noisy individual is finished. This document is a report of an inquiry into the structure of industry and the employment situation in Tasmania. In that excellent report there are some clear suggestions of things that the Federal Government could have been doing, in the four years since this report was published, to deal with these economic problems facing Tasmania. I quote from Sir Bede Callaghan's report entitled 'Inquiry into the Structure of Industry and the Employment Situation in Tasmania', which echoes the points I have just made and supports the proposals made by Mr Wilde. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As indicated to some extent above, the structure of the Tasmanian industry reflects the general position-declining rural and manufacturing activity and limited private tertiary sector development due to isolation, seasonality and/or transport disabilities with a cost/price squeeze apparent in almost every area. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure by the State Government from its own resources is limited, if only by a relatively small and declining revenue base. </PARA>
<PARA> He points out there the need for Commonwealth support in the development of this economy. What we are saying is that the Tasmanian economy needs the adoption of positive economic policies by a protective Federal government. It needs Federal public investment to offset the competitive disadvantages from which the Tasmanian economy suffers. Government policies directed at reducing the public sector-that has been the whole thrust of this Federal Government's policies-to satisfy a rampant business ideology that somehow alleges it is necessary to free capital for private investment simply damage States like Tasmania. In supposedly freeing those States and communities heavily dependent on public spending to generate economic activity, they simply force them to generate longer and longer unemployment queues. </PARA>
<PARA> Public investment and private investment in this country are complementary not antithetic. I draw the attention of the Minister for the Capital Territory to his bailiwick: Canberra is one of the great examples of this. For a long time- before some of the marauding activities of the present Government-public and private investment worked to develop this city. Again, if one looks at the whole history of Australian investment one will find that the great periods of growth in Australia, with one major exception, were periods in which private and public investment worked together to develop this country. Tasmanian experience exemplifies that superbly. The whole base of the successful Tasmanian economic experience of the 1950s and the 1960s was the product of major public investment by the Ogilvie and Cosgrove governments, which laid the foundation of Tasmanian growth and expansion. These are the roles that State government can play. I remind the questioning honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom), who is attempting to interject, that that activity by the Tasmanian State governments in the 1930s and the 1940s was very much supported by co-operative Liberal and Labor Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the sources of the vulnerability in the Tasmanian economy. First of all, the Tasmanian population is much more decentralised than that of other States. Therefore, the service demands on government will be greater. Every cut made in public services-the delivering of services to people-affects the States, but it affects particularly States like Tasmania which, because of the decentralisation of their population, need wide support services. Secondly, the work force in Tasmania represents a smaller percentage of the population than is the case in other States. That means that the number of people dependent on welfare provisions and old age support is much greater in Tasmania. Of course, there is much posturing by some Tasmanian members about the provisions made for the old in this society. This applies particularly to Tasmania, where there is a greater percentage of elderly people than there is in any other State. Let us look at the record of this Government over the last seven years in relation to the provision it has made for the old. At best, for seven years, it has been a static provision, in real terms. Indeed, if one looks at the income that people can earn over the basic levels, if one looks at the fringe benefit levels, one will find that in real terms in the past seven years there has been a cut in the provision made for the elderly. That cut affects Tasmania in particular because of the nature of its population. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, of course, Tasmania faces the problem of geographical isolation. Let it be said that, in relation to all of those four points, it is necessary that public investment, public activity, play a major role. Tasmania has a particularly vulnerable economy. I could go on at great length to illustrate what is occurring in a whole range of fields-for example, housing. No doubt we will listen to some defence of the present housing policies-perhaps by the honourable member for Braddon-and their effect on the Tasmanian economy. Let us look at the effect of the real cuts that have been made in funding for roads in Tasmania, although it is true that most other States are affected as well. I point to the slowing down of the whole program to support railway rehabilitation in Tasmania. Let us look at the overall picture of the cuts in funding. One can bring to bear an enormous amount of statistical evidence in this matter. Also, a specific threat is looming. Perhaps the Minister for the Capital Territory will tell us about it. It will occur if the changes in the percentage allocation to the States recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission inquiry on tax sharing last year are adopted. If they are followed, Tasmania will suffer particularly from this reallocation of tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to finish briefly on a creative note and to say that if we are to solve the sorts of problems that Tasmania and a number of other States face we must develop regional economic policies whereby, for instance, the tax sharing entitle- ments must be augmented by a Commonwealth program aimed to give a greater stimulus to private sector economic developments in States with weaker economic bases. There must be a planned and developed policy tied in with the general way of reimbursing the States so that we make up for the disadvantages of those States which at present-maybe not in the 1990s or in the next century- have weak economic bases. </PARA>
<PARA> It is imperative in this planning that we take into account the overall macroeconomic effect of the way in which the State spends its own grants. Secondly, it is equally important to ensure that a program exists to equalise regional opportunities. But without those sorts of programs, without a Federal government being prepared actively to develop and support regional economic programs, not only Tasmania but also South Australia and Victoria will be disadvantaged in the coming decades. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Tasmanian team will fight this blatantly false and politically motivated matter. I shall set the scene and my colleague, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck), will become the final executioner- and there is no better man to do that job. If there is a better man, it might be the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), who is now at the table. If any other Tasmanian members are elsewhere in the Parliament, they should come into the chamber. I am surprised that the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) should bring forward this discussion of a matter of public importance, because he is an expatriate Tasmanian-a man who won a Rhodes scholarship, got the benefit of education from Tasmania, and then left to live on the mainland. And he proposed this unfounded and dishonest matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For many years we have been told that the Labor Party has had a shadow Minister for Tasmania in this chamber somewhere. Where has he been? We have been waiting for him to appear. At last he has appeared. We in this place have been hearing about health for years from the honourable member for Bonython-but not a word about Tasmania. So at last he brings forward a matter on Tasmania. I ask: Why? Why is it timed now? What is so important about this moment? It is because an election is on. Obviously, the matter is politically inspired. It is interesting that the honourable member raises this issue on a non-broadcast day. Why? Because he is concerned about the performance of the State Labor Government in Tasmania he did not want the facts to be broadcast around the country. This man has been asked by Harry Holgate, the Premier of Tasmania-the most distrusted, discredited and disreputable Premier that any State has ever had-to prop him up in here today. It was that man, Mr Holgate, who stabbed the honest and popular Doug Lowe right between the shoulder blades, whose public approval rating recently was determined to be about 11 per cent and falling, and who closed down the Tasmanian Parliament so that the members of parliament there could not debate and discuss the policies of the Tasmanian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years the Tasmanian Labor governments have used the tactic of Canberra bashing. They have always pretended that every success in Tasmania was a direct result of policies of the Tasmanian State Government and that every failure was wholly and solely the responsibility of the Federal Government. That tactic no longer works. The people are sick and tired of it. The people of Tasmania know what the honourable member is on about. They know the conspiracy in which he is involved with the Premier of Tasmania. This tactic will not work. Tasmanians have woken up at last to this sort of tactic. They realise that it is an admission of failure. It is an admission of the State Government's own weakness, an admission of the Labor Government's neglect and its mismanagement of the Tasmanian economy. So we on this side of the House totally reject the suggestion that is brought before the House today. The honourable member for Bonython, a doctor of philosophy, a former university professor, should come down to earth. He should come to Tasmania and see what is happening there-how the initiatives of the Federal Fraser Government are working to assist Tasmanians. The Federal Government has been fair and generous. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and to thank the Cabinet members and all my colleagues from both the Government parties , and even the 'dries', for their understanding and their continuing support. Whenever Tasmania has needed some help of one kind or another the members on this side have always been prepared to get in and help and provide some initiative to help our small but important State. I also congratulate my four Tasmanian colleagues-the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), who is present, the honourable member for Franklin who is present, the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) who is present, and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), the member for Bass, who is involved in other business at present. I congratulate them all for their efforts on behalf of the people of Tasmania. Their hard work, their efforts and their dedication have resulted in many successes and a great deal of assistance being provided by the Federal Government. Let me refer to some of the initiatives. One was the freight equalisation scheme which was brought down in 1976. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1976 we brought in the freight equalisation scheme. This has been vital to the economy of our State. This financial year the Federal Government is providing $33m to help industries right around the State. This assistance has saved and secured many thousands of jobs. I make the point that we have no intention of decreasing assistance under the freight equalisation scheme or in any way downgrading that important scheme. It is worth while noting that this scheme now applies to air transport during strikes. When businesses cannot get their goods to market because of maritime strikes they can under that scheme get help from the Government for the cost of freighting their goods by air to markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another initiative is the landbridge formula which provides a subsidy for air fares between mainland Tasmania and mainland Australia. This has cushioned the impact of air fares on people going to and from our State. It is a 10 per cent subsidy. This important initiative will cost $4m in the present financal year. It is worth noting that this scheme also applies to Fokker Friendship services to the north-west provided by both Ansett Airlines of Australia and East West Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Another initiative has been the Callaghan report. The Minister for Administrative Services, who has just entered the chamber, is very much responsible for the important work under the Callaghan plan. This plan is now under active review. There has been a problem because of lack of co-operation by the Tasmanian Government in some areas-in some areas it has been co-operative- and a lack of imagination and a vision of what can be achieved in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bonython, who is from South Australia, talks about neglect, but he did not mention the second Hobart bridge. He did not mention the Australian Maritime College. He did not mention the Antarctic base in Hobart. He did not mention the assistance for the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd at a time when the people of Queenstown were very concerned because copper prices had gone down and that town and the jobs of the people employed by Mount Lyell were threatened. The Government provided ready assistance to secure the future of that important town on the west coast of Tasmania. Early last year when the town of Zeehan was threatened by serious bushfires the Prime Minister immediately expressed his personal concern and provided assistance for the people of Zeehan. That assistance was gratefully received by them. Help has also been given to the apple industry. The honourable member for Franklin has given great support to the apple industry and is always putting forward its interests in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> When I look at all of those initiatives and all that has been done, I ask: Where is the neglect? In almost every department and every area of expenditure Tasmanians are receiving more per capita than any of the other States. The average amount being paid by the Commonwealth per capita to Tasmanians is between $1,200 and $1,300. For the larger States it is $400 to $600. I do not want to over-emphasise those facts, but Tasmania receives about double the amount of the larger, more populous States. We are reasonably happy with that, but we are still fighting to see whether we can get more for our State. Those figures must be compared with the abysmal performance of the Harry Holgate Labor Government in Tasmania; the worst government, I suggest to the House, ever to hold office anywhere in Australia, if not the world. It set up a potato industry authority at great cost and then abandoned it. An amount of $16m was lost on the Electrona Canbide Industries Pty Ltd deal and Mr Holgate sold it for one dollar. There was a $13.5m deficit on hospital funding and again the Holgate Government tried to blame the Federal Government but clearly on the facts it was the responsibility of the State Government. Half a million dollars was lost on the installation of boilers at St Johns Park. An amount of $1m was lost on the infamous Bowen pyramids. That Government retained the services of the other Harry, Harry Butler, as a conservation consultant at $625 a day. </PARA>

There are broken promises galore, including that of the north-west regional water scheme. Promises were made and have been broken by Mr Holgate and his crew. He denied power to the people of King Island and Flinders Island. Evidence has come to light of a 30-year supply of land for housing. The Holgate Government screams for more money for housing. I suppose that is fair enough, but at the same time it has 30 years supply of land sitting all around that State. What is it doing with it.

But he should not be involved with this cunning and conniving Mr Harry Holgate and his Government of lifeless men. </PARA>
<PARA> We, on this side of the House-I am sure the honourable member for Franklin will support me-say that this claim made in the matter of public importance is totally false. We totally reject it on behalf of the Tasmanians that we represent. We have been fairly treated by this Federal Government. I suppose we could always ask for a bit more: that is true. But if all the hard facts and figures are looked at objectively and if we do not talk philosophy it will be seen that Tasmanians are, I would say, doing reasonably well at the moment out of the Commonwealth coffers. But that is not to say that the Tasmanian members of this Parliament are totally satisfied. We will continue to fight. The job is not done yet. We will continue to fight as hard as we can for the people we represent in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The people made a judgment in 1975. Before that there were five parliamentary members of the Australian Labor Party from Tasmania. Now there are five parliamentary Liberal Party members from Tasmania. All the Tasmanian seats are held by Liberals. We intend to keep it that way. The results are on the board. We have worked as hard as we can. The two Ministers, the honourable member for Bass and the honourable member for Denison, and the three back bench members from Tasmania have worked as hard as they can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We on this side of the House brought forward this matter of public importance because we believe that the Federal Government is neglecting the real needs of the Tasmanian economy. Nothing that the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) said has convinced me otherwise. It is a pity that he took it upon himself to abuse my colleague, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), rather than to discuss the issues. I take him up on one thing: If the Tasmanian members of this House are so deeply interested in everything that affects Tasmania, why is there not a single question on the Notice Paper by any of the Tasmanian members? Tasmania is represented federally in this House by five Government members. Clearly, when the real needs of Tasmania's economy are examined we come to the inescapable conclusion that the five sitting members do not fight hard enough. Perhaps they find it hard to fight the Liberal Party's economic philosophy even though their State suffers. Tasmania is experiencing all those economic ills that are affecting every State in Australia, but they are exacerbated because it is such a small State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The indications are that the level of unemployment-the approximate Australian average is 6.9 per cent-has risen to a dramatic 9.2 per cent in Tasmania. I have not heard any of the Tasmanian members mention that when we have been debating unemployment. Some 14,700 people are out of work in Tasmania, which has, without doubt, the worst record in Australia. Yet in this House we do not hear any condemnation from the Tasmanian members of those devastating figures. The social consequences of such a level of unemployment are horrific. Without doubt it is the policy of 'fight inflation first' pursued by this Government which is the main cause of increasingly high unemployment. While the total level of unemployment in mainland Aus- tralia has risen by 11.5 per cent in the year to March, in Tasmania the increase was 33.8 per cent. The young people in Tasmania are worse off with an unemployment level of 30.5 per cent. I consider these to be crisis figures and expect the Tasmanian members to urge the Government to reconsider its economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The philosophical commitment of this Government appears to be directed towards ensuring that the most deprived members of the community carry the heaviest burden which, in this case, is the Tasmanians. It is useless for Federal Government members to try to hang the blame for the high levels of unemployment in Tasmania on the Tasmanian Government. In this House we constantly hear every ill blamed on three years of the Whitlam Federal Government, but I remind the House, even though it is now six years later, that the complete acceptance has been, even by this Government, that the Federal Government's policies are responsible for unemployment. National growth in the work force was 2 per cent. In Tasmania the labour force fell by 0.8 per cent. This Government's policies are decimating Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's new tax sharing arrangements have profound implications for the people of Tasmania. Tasmania's tax sharing grant was increased by only 8.7 per cent in 1981-82. As the rate of inflation was 10.5 per cent the Commonwealth in fact reduced Tasmania's share in real terms, and its five members are quite happy about that. Unless the Commonwealth is prepared to maintain the value of the States grants in real terms, the State governments, and Tasmania as a prime example, will have to look for their income elsewhere. Must the Tasmanian people be forced to pay higher taxes within their State to compensate for the Commonwealth's inadequate funding? What do the Tasmanian members have to say about this? Does this not run counter to the Commonwealth's stated objective of reducing the overall burden of taxation in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat what I have said before in this House: This is the highest taxing government in the history of Australia. Tasmania actually received $18m less last year than the amount it would have received under the old guidelines. Couple this with the enormous drop-off in funding for health and Tasmania's disadvantaged position is clearly shown. Under the new health plan-Medibank Mark V or VI, or whatever it is-Tasmania was told by the Liberal Government to raise $33.5m from new charges. The State Government responsible advised the Commonwealth that the estimate was unreal and that it would find it difficult to raise $26m. In fact, Tasmania raised only $20m because of the number of patients who, under this Government's guidelines, were deemed to be non-chargeable. The Tasmanian Government was then faced with a $13.5m deficit in its public hospitals on top of the $18m less that it received from the tax sharing grants. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania the housing industry, an accepted economic indicator, is operating at its lowest level since the 1960s. This Government's policies on interest rates and taxation have adversely affected the building industry and, through it , the Tasmanian people. However, in spite of the Commonwealth's restricted financing for public and welfare housing throughout Australia, the Tasmanian Government must be congratulated in that it has been able to increase the annual addition to public housing stock. The public housing stock is a large proportion of total housing in Tasmania. In 1979-80 22 per cent of the total dwellings completed were in the public sector, compared with 6 per cent nationally. That is a great record for any government. The Tasmanian Government can also be congratulated in that it spent $25 per head on public housing in 1980-81 against the national average of $18 per head. Victorian members, who daily have constituents looking for cheaper housing, will envy what the Tasmanian Government has achieved. Now that we have a Labor Government in Victoria we will hope to see an increase in expenditure on public housing there also. I point out also that Tasmania's housing interest rates are on a par with those in New South Wales and are lower than those in most conservative States. Despite the severe restrictions placed upon its economy by this Government, the Tasmanian Government has done well by the people of Tasmania and will continue to do so. It is a great pity that the honourable members in this House who represent the State are not more assiduous in fighting the Liberal Government to get a better deal for Tasmanians. </PARA>
<PARA> I comment briefly on the fact that the Labor Party believes there should be an open and public environmental impact study on the entire issue of the south-west wilderness area of Tasmania. After all, the present Liberal Federal Government has nominated the area as one of the rare environmental treasures to be placed on the World Heritage List. In doing so the Commonwealth Government has assumed a responsibility for this area. The Liberal Party and the community generally are divided on the issue but we certainly are united in our call for a Federal environmental impact study on the entire issue. The Age editorial referred to this matter on Thursday, 25 February this year. This very good editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser must be joking. His claim to the Federal Parliament on Tuesday that the proposed Gordon-below-Franklin Dam in south-west Tasmania was purely a State responsibility, was wrong in principle and wrong in law. The Prime Minister has gladly accepted the praise for placing south-west Tasmania, including the Lower Gordon and Franklin Rivers on the register of the National Estate. His Government has now also nominated the area as one of the rare environmental treasures to be placed on the World Heritage List. These actions clearly place a moral responsibility on the Commonwealth to do its best to ensure that the timeless beauty of the wild rivers is not wantonly destroyed. To try to wash ones hands of the issue in these circumstances is a humbug. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, the editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA> To pretend that the Commonwealth can simply opt out and leave it to the States is not merely to repeat the mistakes of Lake Pedder, it is to invite Mr Bjelke- Petersen to do what he likes with the Great Barrier Reef and to allow any other parochial Premier to destroy part of the National Estate for a quick buck. That is not what the Australians want to expect from their Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That will not be necessary, Mr Minister. I quote further from this excellent editorial in the Age. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One should note that, on financial grounds, Mr Fraser virtually ruled out the prospect of infrastructure borrowing for the proposed dam in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It also ignores the obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by law. The Australian Heritage Commission Act forbids a Federal Minister taking action which would adversely affect any part of the National Estate unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative. In theory, as Mr Fraser says, Tasmania could pay for the $1116 million dam from its general loan allocation, or indeed from its own State revenue, without the Commonwealth being involved. In practice, general loan allocations have been cut so much that Tasmania could raise the necessary finance only by infrastructure borrowing. And this would require the approval of a Federal Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>That is wrong in law. He has no responsibility; he will be obliged to obey the Heritage Commission Act. At the very least, this would require a proper federal inquiry into the proposed dam and the alternatives to it. That is what we on this side of the House are calling for. I suggest to the Prime Minister that that is what he should do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) and the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) for making their maiden speeches on Tasmania. It has been excellent. They brought out a couple of very good points and I think that at a later date we should debate them. Unfortunately, they ruined things by bringing on this matter on a non-broadcasting day and on the eve of an election in Tasmania. Really, their motives have all gone astray. For that very reason I am afraid that we have to take a different tack and just tell them in a nice, polite way what has happened for Tasmania as a result of the representation it has had. The two honourable members from the Opposition said certain things but they did not have one word of praise for what has happened to Tasmania in the last seven years. Even the brilliant political strategists in Canberra all say that Tasmania has got far too much. Sometimes we are the centre of a joke here. The political commentators, honourable members on the other side and even some from our own side say: 'Not Tasmania again; you are not going to get another airport terminal down there?' Even the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) cried out in the wilderness, saying: 'Look, a new terminal for Tasmania and we don't have one for Canberra'. Honourable members representing Tasmania have endured this sort of thing ever since they have been here.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XD4">Mr GOODLUCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We do get a bit sick of it. Even the 'dries' of our own party sneer at us. What happened in regard to Mount Lyell? There was nearly a fight because we wanted to save Mount Lyell for the ordinary people whom the honourable member for Henty mentioned, the ordinary workers. We fought dashed hard for those people and for the ordinary families at Mount Lyell but we were the subject of ridicule as a result of it. So, I say to honourable members: 'Please do not tell us that we do not care for the ordinary or average person of Tasmania'. We know all about them. After spending about seven years in this Parliament, it is most evident to me that the harder we try, the more achievements we obtain for our State, the more we are criticised. To me, that is foreign. Even some of the great political writers up here that I have heard about for so many years seem to ridicule us. If we try hard and fight hard we can be the subject of ridicule because we talk too much. I just cannot understand that. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) outlined in some detail the things that have come to Tasmania as a result of the Fraser Government. Even the media editorials-in the Age, the Australian and of course the Examiner and the Mercury-have detailed very succinctly the fact that we have certain things that other States do not have and that we had better tell the State Labor Government to stop whingeing about those things because it is exacerbating the ridicule that we suffer as a result of coming to Canberra and trying for the State of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all know that an election will occur in Tasmania on 15 May and we all know that the Opposition has to do something to create in the minds of the Tasmanian people a feeling that the State Labor Government is not too bad. But even on the day of the launching of the campaign the media reports said that there was a total absence of razzamatazz, a minimum of applause, no banner waving, no placards and no uninhibited cheering. In fact, it was a very subdued affair-many said it was a result of the fact that never before had there been a Premier so unpopular. Harry Holgate is not a bad bloke. But he has a rating of only 11 per cent-the lowest of any Premier ever known in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has the audacity to try to move away from some of the things that have occurred in Tasmania. I will mention just a few. The honourable member for Braddon mentioned Electrona Carbide Industries Pty Ltd and the pyramids, which are a monument to the Honourable Bill Neilson, but a waste of money. Again , the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education cost $38m but is sitting up on the hill being wasted. Yet the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) has the audacity to say that we do not care for the ordinary people. I say to the honourable member that that money has been wasted. Tasmania has had good Labor Premiers. It had a Labor government for 43 years. Unfortunately, the nice looking Doug Lowe said: 'We will fight for Tasmania. We will win elections'. He certainly won the election, but what did he do for Tasmania? He procrastinated. He allowed the greenies and other people to come into the fray. They have ruined the economy of Tasmania as a result. All Tasmanians know about it. But unfortunately the situation has gone too far. Tasmania is in a perilous situation. As the honourable member for Henty said, the state of the economy there is bad. The level of unemployment is bad. We all know that, but it has been caused by inept, incompetent, stupid State politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, Harry Holgate-as I mentioned, he is not a bad fellow-as leader must be saddled with the responsibilities. Everybody is blaming him. Unfortunately, he will go out on his ear as a result of earlier, poor government . So it is useless to bring up a matter of public importance that tries to blame the Federal Government for the waste and incompetence that have occurred in Tasmania. In fact, the people of Tasmania have been conned. Let us hope that at the next election, on 15 May, they will be very sensible and will vote for a government that they hope will bring them out of the mess they are in. Let us hope that they will forget about some of the independents, who are extremely selfish. All they have been saying is 'We want to save the South-West. We are not interested in anything else'. They are not interested in all the other problems that the honourable member for Henty mentioned. Their theme is: 'We will get our pay only for saving that river'. If that is not being irresponsible , selfish and trying to ruin the economy completely I do not know what is. So the people of Tasmania will have to watch very carefully some of the independents who are hell-bent on destroying not only the Labor Party but also the Liberal Party and, in fact, the people of Tasmania. I only hope that Robin Gray in his speech of, I believe, tomorrow night mentions that fact. I hope that Harry Holgate comes out and mentions that we do not want in Tasmania politicians who care for one little thing rather than for all the other problems that the honourable member for Henty has mentioned. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), who is at the table, is ridiculed at times because he said that he was a $50,000m member. In fact, at the next election he will be a $ 1,000m--</PARA>

This matter of public importance, ladies and gentlemen, is a waste of time. The Opposition brought it up only to try to build up its little State Government in Tasmania, to boost its image. Unfortunately, the Opposition has gone too far. I do not want to be too critical but, because of the facts that I have mentioned, because of the selfish attitude of the independents down there, the economy of Tasmania could be ruined. Therefore, we will continue our fight. We will continue to fight as a team. My friend, the colonel, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), has just entered the chamber. The other day someone mentioned that he was doing a most adequate job. I agree. In Tasmania we need leaders and we certainly have one-the best-in the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill which is currently before the House encompasses a wide variety of measures to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act. These amendments include provisions to deal with tax avoidance-both on an international scale and domestically through trusts-short term capital gains and gifts of art work. There are also provisions dealing with zone allowances, living away from home allowances for Service personnel, depreciation for the steel industry, deductions for gifts to certain charities and changes to the rebate provisions for medical expenses. It is obvious, therefore, that this is a very complex and lengthy piece of legislation. I note that this Bill alone proposes to add some 40 pages and 24 clauses to the Income Tax Assessment Act, an Act which has become increasingly subject to amendment in recent years and which is accordingly becoming increasingly incomprehensible. By my count between 1976 and 1981 over 40 Bills came before this House to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Income Tax (Rates) Act. We have by now had to deal with around 700 pages of mostly complex legislation. The result is that the Income Tax Assessment Act alone now runs to over 1,000 pages. Unfortunately, the flurry of activity over the last six years has contributed little towards improving the equity and efficiency-it certainly has not added to the simplicity -of our tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Act has now reached the stage where it is urgently necessary to consider conducting a comprehensive inquiry into the structure and form of the Act with a view to an extensive rewrite of the major provisions. With the overriding aim to improve equity and efficiency, this recasting should aim at simplifying the Act wherever possible. This would reduce compliance costs on the part of both the taxing authorities and taxpayers. Most importantly, a considerable simplification would remove many loopholes which are the fertile breeding ground of tax avoidance. This would in turn enable tax reductions to be made for the great majority of wage and salary earners who currently bear the burden of tax losses caused by the tax avoiders. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government must bear the blame for the drastic deterioration of the Act since it took office. Four factors have contributed to this development. Firstly, this Government has almost totally ignored the recommendations of the Asprey Committee, which committee-established by the previous Labor Government- formulated an extensive program to reform our tax system. Many of the Committee' s recommendations were worthy of much closer consideration than they have received at the hands of this Government. Secondly, the Government's failure to encompass fully retrospective legislation against blatant tax avoidance schemes has meant a constant flood of extremely complex anti-avoidance legislation. Much of it is to close up loopholes which have been created by earlier anti-avoidance legislation. As I have already said, the complexity of such legislation often serves only to spawn even more tax avoidance schemes. Careful and selective use of fully retrospective legislation will put an end to tax avoidance once and for all and stop the eternal merry-go-round of the Australian Taxation Office chasing the tax avoider with no lasting success. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, we have the large number of tax concessions awarded by this Government to various vested interest groups. On my reckoning we have had over 40 new concessions granted since 1976. While some such concessions are justified, their cost is invariably hidden. Usually they are totally inequitable and mostly there is no way of knowing whether they are proving effective in meeting their stated purpose. Finally, we have the conscious restructuring of the tax scales to give tax cuts to the wealthy at the expense of higher taxes for the great majority of taxpayers. These effects have been exacerbated by the failure to fully index the tax scales against inflation. This has pushed all taxpayers into higher average tax rates and has subjected many low income earners to tax for the first time. These are the policy decisions by which the Government has destroyed the equity, efficiency and simplicity of Australia's tax system. It has done so to such an extent that most taxpayers are overwhelmed by the tax laws and have little, if any, faith in their operations. An incoming Labor government will, as a first priority, reverse these sorts of developments. An essential first step in recreating an understood and workable tax system must be the sort of inquiry which I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose now to look at the specific provisions of the Bill. Many are relatively insignificant. I do not propose to deal with them at length in order that I may devote the majority of my speech to what I regard as by far the most important proposal; this is-I am sure the House will agree-the proposal to insert a new Division 13 into the principal Act. This new Division is to be enacted to replace the existing section 136 in order to combat tax avoidance on the international scale-mainly by transnational corporations-through the device known as transfer pricing. Transnational corporations have experienced phenomenal growth in the post-war era and now extend a major influence over the international economy. Direct foreign investment throughout the world by United States of America corporations, for example, trebled during the 1950s and again during the 1960s. Most of this was accounted for by transnational corporations. Japanese and West German direct foreign investment grew at similarly rapid rates . By the end of the 1970s transnational corporations controlled between a quarter and a third of all world production while total sales by foreign affiliates of transnational corporations were estimated at around $850 billion. By this time there was a total of 11,000 transnational corporations with 82,000 affiliates or subsidiaries world wide, of which about three-quarters were in the developed industrial nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the international trade which these vast corporations conduct goes on within their own organisations-between the parent firm and its affiliates or between separate affiliates. This extensive intra-firm trade has been estimated by the authoritative Brandt report on international development issues to make up around one third of all world trade. In addition, a wide range of other transactions take place extensively between the different parts of these enterprises including, for example, the granting of loans, the licensing of technology and the provision of other services. It is little wonder that this web of transactions between affiliates of powerful corporations, and the ability which it creates for such corporations to manipulate financial flows, has become a major concern to governments world wide. Clearly the interests of a corporation which seeks to maximise its global profits will differ from the interests of host countries which attempt to maximise their national benefits from that corporation's activities. Nowhere is this conflict more in evidence than in the potential losses of tax revenue which may result from such corporations undertaking transfer pricing operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Transfer pricing basically involves corporations fixing prices for goods, services, capital or technology transferred between members of the group at an artificially determined level, which is not ralated to true market prices, to ensure that profits are made in countries with the lowest tax rates-or sometimes in countries where no tax is levied at all. Such a profit shifting arrangement was revealed last year in the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation case which was heard by the High Court of Australia. In this example of transfer pricing, the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation, which was indirectly owned by Kaiser Aluminium of the United States and Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation Ltd of the United Kingdom, contracted to sell bauxite to Japanese buyers. Rather than selling directly to Japan, the sale was carried out through an interposed company in Hong Kong which was jointly owned by Commonwealth Aluminium and the Japanese buyers. The Hong Kong company's only function was to buy bauxite from Australia at around 33 shillings a ton and then resell it to Japan at 40 shillings. </PARA>
<PARA> No physical transactions took place in this part of the deal. The Hong Kong company recorded only book entries while the bauxite was delivered directly from Australia to Japan. In this way profits which would normally have accrued to the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation in Australia, and have been taxed accordingly in this country, accrued instead in Hong Kong where they were taxed at low rates -the company tax rates there are about 15 per cent to 17 per cent-and the proceeds were split between the partners in the Hong Kong company. It has been estimated that Australia lost almost $3.5m in tax revenue out of this arrangement. The Taxation Office had no power to stop this massive revenue loss because section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act-our supposed anti-transfer pricing section-was again found wanting by a compliant High Court which continued its dubious record of supporting the tax avoiders against the best interests of all Australians. That was the record until very recently. Yet it was not as though the tax office and the Government had not been warned about the deficiencies of section 136, but I will say more on that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of another transfer pricing arrangement were revealed at around the same time as the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation case. This involved the subsidiary of another transnational corporation. According to reports at the time, Swiss Aluminium Australia, which is a major partner in the Gove venture in the Northern Territory, recorded a total trading surplus of over $122m over an eight-year period, but paid only negligible income tax. By contrast, its minority partner in the venture, Gove Alumina Ltd paid $5.7m tax in 1979-80 alone on pre-tax earnings of $11.1m. These results seem extraordinary and even more so in the light of allegations by the Government of Iceland that Swiss Aluminium's parent company, Alusuisse, understated the profits from its Icelandic smelter by $US47.5m over a period of seven years due to transfer pricing transactions involving purchases of bauxite from Australia. These transactions apparently involved increases in the price of bauxite at sea of over 50 per cent. Should these reports be correct, there is little likelihood, given the record of the courts, that the present provisions of the tax legislation will result in successful action to recover any tax avoided by the company. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure these two examples represent but the tip of the iceberg in abuse of Australia's tax system through international transactions. Australia is particularly vulnerable to this type of arrangement. We are a relatively wealthy nation, offering substantial rewards for transnational corporations' operations in this country. We are rich in mineral resources, our extractive and secondary industries are dominated by foreign based transnational corporations and we have a government which has for years adopted a wholeheartedly open approach to foreign investment regardless of cost or the greater national interest. The transnational corporations which have come to dominate our extractive industries especially tend to be vertically integrated and provide the major source of advanced expertise in exploration, extraction and processing of petroleum and minerals. In some areas, such as alumina, no reliable open market price exists for their product, making transfer pricing-type arrangements extremely difficult to detect. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the transnational corporations involved have built up over many years enormous knowledge and expertise regarding international financial transactions and tax systems and obviously have learned to exploit this knowledge to their greatest benefit. Of course, this is not to say that all transnational corporations are immersed in the mire of tax avoidance. I am sure that many aspire to be acceptable corporate citizens. However, the rewards are great and, as is shown by experience in Europe-where advanced nations have reportedly paid out hundreds of millions of dollars in transferred prices on petroleum and pharmaceutical products in recent years-Australia cannot afford to be complacent and not take every possible precaution to prevent this type of activity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important at this stage to examine briefly just what instruments are available to our taxing authorities to combat such abuses. The current powers which exist to control international tax avoidance fall into four areas: The Banking Act and system of tax clearance certificates to control the use of tax havens; Australia's double tax treaties to prevent international double taxation ; the new general anti-avoidance section introduced as Part IVA of the principal Act last year; and, finally, section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which is being amended in the Bill before the House. I will deal briefly with these in turn. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the tax treatment of persons and companies involved in dealings with tax havens is important. Tax havens are countries which levy little or no tax on certain income and which usually have minimal, if any, companies and securities requirements. Also tax havens usually offer an effective cloak of secrecy to potential users. These characteristics make the use of tax havens very attractive to potential tax avoiders and pose significant problems for taxing authorities. Such havens are often used by international corporations as part of their transfer pricing operations. For example, they may set up a holding company in any one of a number of low tax countries to collect income in one form or another from world-wide operations and, after it has been subjected to nominal tax, redistribute it in the form of loans, for example for the continuing use of members of the groups. </PARA>
<PARA> A European Economic Commission report in the mid-1970s stated that there were some 2,000 holding companies registered in Luxembourg, 20,000 in Liechtenstein and 10,000 in Switzerland-all recognised tax havens. Another method is for transnational corporations to use provisions of double tax treaties which limit witholding tax on royalties to route such payments for the use of patents, know- how and copyright through tax havens. Further arrangements involve payment for leasing equipment to tax havens, the use of off-shore banking activities, the establishment of captive insurance companies-1,000 such companies exist in Bermuda alone-or the registration of shipping fleets in countries such as Liberia and Panama. It would take hours to deal with the intricacies of such arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I have indicated the types of problems which exist. Control of this type of activity is an essential element of a policy effectively to control transfer pricing. Australia's weapons in this area are nowhere near effective. Consequently, the use of tax havens by both individuals and companies to avoid Australian tax is rife. The major defect in this area is the lack of a foreign tax credit system to subject to tax in Australia income earned by Australians overseas. Currently, such income, if it is being taxed overseas at even minimal rates, is in most cases exempt from further local tax. The Banking Act and the system of tax clearance certificates which were designed to stop the use of tax havens have, for a number of reasons which I do not have time to go into now, proved ineffective. There is thus an urgent need to move towards adopting a system of foreign tax credits as an integral part of a comprehensive attack on international tax avoidance. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) proposed such a scheme in 1978 but backed down quickly under pressure from business. A Labor government most certainly would not capitulate to such self-interested lobbying. </PARA>
<PARA> Double tax treaties, of which Australia currently has 12 in place, are designed to facilitate international flows of trade and capital by eliminating double taxation. Most aspects of Australia's treaties substantially reflect the principles of the model double tax convention of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and, in doing so, have facilitated the development of our financial and trading dealings with overseas countries. However, there is a need to examine closely the possibility which I mentioned earlier that transnational corporations are using the limitation imposed on withholding taxes on dividends and royalties paid overseas to exploit our tax system. Possibly the most significant aspect of our treaties, especially given the problems I have outlined, is the section modelled after article 9 of the model OECD agreement which allows the reconstruction of profits of associated entities which have obviously been engaging in transfer pricing activities. This provision has generally been regarded as a more effective weapon against transfer pricing than the current section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act because the provisions of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act prevail over the ordinary provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. However, as the use of this section is limited to treaty countries, and of the many recognised tax havens we have a treaty only with Switzerland, its usefulness is very limited and in no way precludes effective action in all the other areas I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The second important element in our tax treaties is that section which authorises the co-operation and exchange of information between the taxing authorities in each country. One of the major obstacles which face taxing authorities world-wide in dealing with transfer pricing is their inability to obtain accurate and reliable information in sufficient detail to enable them to untangle the web which transnational corporations often wind around their operations. To overcome transfer pricing in Australia, the Australian Taxation Office will need a substantial amount of reliable information about the activities of transnational corporations in many countries. While the tax treaty provisions-which I understand have been used to some degree-provide access to a certain amount of information, it is abundantly clear that it is nowhere near enough to allow the Taxation Office effectively to use the new powers which this Bill will provide. </PARA>
<PARA> What is needed in Australia is the enactment of a code of conduct to be observed by transnational corporations which involves, among other things, the provision of wide-ranging information to host governments. Guidelines formulated by the OECD, for example, require transnational corporations to disclose detailed information on their structure, operations of affiliates, areas of operation, employment, sales, pricing and investment policies and accounting procedures. Such guidelines in force in Australia would provide the Taxation Office with much of the information necessary to overcome transfer pricing. It is scandalous that this Government, obviously beholden to financial support from large corporations, has failed to take this absolutely necessary action even though such action has been strongly recommended by the OECD, which is hardly the most radical body. I doubt whether the Taxation Office will be able effectively to use its new powers under Division 13 introduced by this legislation unless it has available the sort of information which such a code of conduct would provide. I can assure the House that a Labor government will not shirk from ensuring that transnational corporations meet such requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Next in the armoury of weapons against international tax avoidance is the new general anti-tax avoidance section introduced last year as Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Part IVA applies to any scheme from which a taxpayer obtains a tax benefit, whether that scheme has been entered into or carried out in Australia, outside Australia or partly in Australia and partly outside Australia. Seemingly this would apply to transfer-pricing type arrangements but obviously the Government prefers specific legislation in this vital area, with the provisions of Part IVA as a fallback position, remembering of course that the provisions of Part IVA have yet to be tested. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the most direct weapon against transfer pricing-section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This section has a long history, originating from section 28 of the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1922. Broadly, this section operates so that, in the case of overseas controlled companies operating in Australia which produce either no taxable income or less than the amount of income which might be expected to arise from that business, the Commissioner of Taxation may determine a level of taxable profits which he regards as reasonable , given the nature of that business. On the face of it, this section seems to provide clear powers to deal with transfer pricing yet, like so many other sections of the tax Act, it has been rendered virtually meaningless by successive court decisions culminating in the High Court decision in the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation case, to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I might briefly point out that the deficiencies in section 136 have not just been revealed in the past few months. Indeed, it has been known from as far back as 1942 that certain problems existed in relation to this section and in 1975 the Asprey Taxation Review Committee pointed out precisely the defects which the High Court seized on in its recent decision. The Committee regarded the section as totally inadequate and recommended that it be replaced. Yet the Government ignored the Committee's findings and took no action whatsoever to meet the expected consequences. Since 1978 the Opposition has continually called for substantial revisions to section 136 but for two years these warnings fell on deaf ears. It was not until 1980 the the Government first indicated that it would look at revising the section, and it has taken a further two years to come up with the current proposals. It is now seven years since Asprey pointed out, in detail, the considerable loopholes in this section. Who knows how many hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue have been lost in this time because of the negligence of this Government?</PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, the weaknesses exposed in section 136 centre on the problem of defining a business which is 'controlled principally by non-residents' as set out in paragraph (a) of section 136. This paragraph could be easily avoided if a majority of shares were vested in residents, with a provision that those shares carry only a small fraction of rights or limited voting powers. Alternatively, as happened in the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation case, the operation of this paragraph could be prevented merely by having a majority, of Australian directors on the board, regardless of the fact that they may act solely in the interests of the company's foreign owners. Again as happened in the CAC case, paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 136 could be avoided by interposing a second company incorporated and resident in Australia but owned principally by foreigners for the purpose of holding the shares in the taxpayer company. Finally, with regard to section 136 the Commissioner is not given any specific powers and is severely limited in his ability to reconstruct a true level of taxable income from the transfer pricing arrangemens. </PARA>
<PARA> These, then, are the defects which have scuttled all attempts to date to stop transfer pricing through the use of section 136. In framing its new section, I am glad to say the Government has obviously taken note of Asprey's warnings and subsequent court decisions and has adopted an entirely new basis of attack. Certainly we regard this new approach as much more likely to succeed than its predecessor and promise the Government the full weight of Labor's support in its endeavours to stamp out such objectionable practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed Division 13 does not depend on basic tests of control or share ownership. Instead, the Commissioner will be authorised to apply the section where goods or services are supplied or acquired under an international agreement, where he is satisfied that any of the parties involved were not dealing at arm's length with each other and where the consideration involved is other than could be expected from independent persons dealing at arm's length. Where these tests apply the Commissioner will have much wider powers to reconstruct a true level of taxable income. Basically, the Commissioner will be required to use the 'arm's length principle' which refers to the consideration which might reasonably be expected to have passed between independent parties. This has become an accepted international principle for dealing with transfer- pricing situations: For example, it is used in the United States of America; it is the basis for Australia's double tax agreements; and it was recommended in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's guidelines on this problem put out in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> In some situations, however, it is not possible to determine an arm's length price. There may, for example, be a tightly controlled market with no directly comparable transactions between independent enterprises, or such data may not be available to taxing authorities. In this situation other methods need to be used to determine an arm's length price and the proposed section, rightly in our view , provides wide scope for the Commissioner to arrive at an appropriate level of taxable income. He may use any one of a number of alternatives. For example, he may use the cost plus basis which starts from the cost of producing the goods and services and adds whatever cost and profit mark-up is acceptable. Alternatively, he may use the so-called retail price method by starting at the final selling price and subtracting the cost and appropriate profit mark-up. Other methods are available, but these are the most commonly recommended. Of course, the Commissioner's calculations can be challenged in the courts, but at least legislative guidelines are to be provided, which is a big improvement over the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two further aspects of this new Division 13 to which I wish briefly to refer. Firstly, I congratulate the Government on adopting in regard to this Division a principle which Labor strongly advocated last year when this House was considering the new general anti-avoidance section, Part IVA, but which the Government refused to accept. The operation of Part IVA in our view was unduly restricted by applying only to schemes where tax avoidance could be seen to be the dominant purpose. This left untouched many schemes entered into for various purposes, but with undoubted tax avoidance implications, thus opening scope to avoid the operation of Part IVA. It now seems that the Government has realised that this approach is ill-advised and it intends that Division 13 should not be so restricted. Indeed it has adopted a very liberal approach to its operation. To quote the Treasurer's second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>'. . . the fact that tax saving is not a key purpose of a particular arrangement or transaction is no reason why we, as a nation, should not be in a position to counteract any loss to the Australian revenue inherent in it'. </PARA>
<PARA>These sentiments are thoroughly commendable and, I would think, just as commendable in the case of Part IVA where they do not exist. I can only hope that the Treasurer now intends to rethink his approach to Part IVA. My second concluding point on this aspect is one of criticism rather than praise. I find the approach to penalties associated with Division 13 to be curious indeed. I will have more to say about that during the Committee stage. But basically we regard the 10 per cent penalty as being absurdly low. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available I would like to refer briefly to two other amendments in this Bill. The amendment to section 26AAA is very important. Section 26AAA basically says that capital profits derived from the sale of property within 12 months of its purchase shall be included in assessable income and taxed accordingly. This section was initially introduced to overcome defects in the other section designed to tax capital gains, that is section 26 (a), where it was found almost impossible to prevent the intention by the taxpayer of profit making. From the outset section 26AAA was easily avoided by holding the assets for one day more than 12 months before selling. It became apparent several years ago that more loopholes had been found through the section and drastic changes were necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The most public illustration of the problems with this section was in April last year when Mr Holmes a Court's Bell Group of companies avoided its operation and made a spectacular tax free profit of $16.5m from its aborted takeover bid for Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd. During March last year the Bell Group quickly accumulated almost 20 per cent of shares in Elders. When, however, its takeover bid was blocked by unnamed friends of Elders, the Bell Group called off its bid and unloaded the shares at a $16.5m profit. Normally, such a profit would be taxable under section 26AAA but in this case the shares were held not by the Bell group directly but in an empty shell company with few other assets. When the bid was called off the shares themselves were not sold but rather the shell company, a subsidiary of the Bell Group, which had been owned for more than 12 months and therefore tax was avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some speculation that this profit could be taxed under section 25 of the Act if the Bell Group was in the business of profit making from takeover bids or under section 26 (a) as part of a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Neither of these sections seems readily applicable, if as seems the case , a genuine takeover bid was involved and Bell did not make a continuing business of this sort of operation. Certainly, these claims do not preclude effective action directly in the section 26AAA area. Of course, there have been other examples both by the Bell Group and the Bond Corporation of avoidance of this section. I do not have time to pursue the debate any further. I therefore move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the opinion that it is deficient in that-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) penalties contained in the Bill for participation in transfer pricing type tax avoidance arrangements are insufficient to provide suitable deterrents against tax avoidance and are inconsistent with penalties contained elsewhere in the Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) without the accompanying adoption of a code of conduct for transnational corporations, as recommended by the OECD and the United Nations, the effectiveness of Division 13 is likely to be limited by the difficulty confronting the Taxation Commissioner in obtaining adequate information;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the Bill fails to take retrospective action against persons flouting the tax system through the blatant avoidance schemes utilising section 26AAA of the Act; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) the Bill endorses use by the medical profession of corporate and trust arrangements with significant tax avoidance implications. </PARA>

If there is anything that will lose the Australian Labor Party votes and which will hang around its neck like an albatross when it goes on the hustings it is the question of retrospectivity in legislation.

I am glad the honourable member agrees because I really could not believe that I heard it correctly. I think that this House and the Australian public will remember that.

<PARA> I would like to make a few remarks about personal taxation. There would not be anyone in this House-there would probably not be anyone in Australia-who does not believe that personal taxation is too high. That has been acknowledged by Government and Opposition alike. The problem, of course, is how to reduce that taxation responsibility and at the same time provide enough money for the Government to conduct its affairs. But I believe it is the most important problem we face and it must be tackled in this coming Budget or before. Personal tax reform is badly needed in order to restore incentive to business and industry and personal work habits, to ease the excessive wage demands and to increase employment by inducing employers to expand their businesses. It is regrettable that the only industry to benefit from high personal taxation is the leisure industry. People leave the work force because they believe it is not worth it to pay the Government up to 60 per cent of their earnings in taxation. They would rather rearrange their affairs, perhaps with less income, and move into a leisure situation or a part time work situation in which they work less and enjoy themselves more. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, the problem is to reduce responsibly personal taxation. Apart from reducing the amount of taxation, about which I have spoken before, I believe that one of the great stumbling blocks for people in the present scheme is the three-tier taxation system. The leaps between these tiers are just too great. They go from 32 cents in the dollar, to 46 cents and then to 60 cents. I recommend that we return to a graduated scale where the rises are less steep. We used to have seven or eight tiers. It was said at the time that the scheme was too complicated but I do not believe it was. It was a simple scheme. At the end of the tax year people looked at the scale and saw the tax they had to pay. It was not difficult at all. What happens now, of course, is that when people are edging up to the next tax bracket they move heaven and earth to avoid moving into it. If it were a graduated scale, as it used to be, I do not believe people would worry so much. They would work hard to expand their businesses and maximise their incomes and where they finished up at the end of the year would not be of such great concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussion of a graduated tax scale leads to the question of flat rate tax-that is, the abolition of scales and the adoption of a flat rate tax. I do not want to dwell particularly on this question but it is an attractive scheme. There is no doubt about it. But when we look into it a little what we will do by adopting a flat rate tax is throw out the window a basic philosophy which I believe most of us on this side of the House hold, that is, that higher income earners pay a higher rate of tax. For this reason I reject a flat rate tax as unjust and inequitable. It disadvantages the lower income earners, and they are the bulk of the taxpayers. For example, according to the 1981 Budget figures, 4.8 million Australians were in the 32 cent bracket, 686,000 odd were in the 46 cent bracket and 48,000 were in the 60 cent bracket. I am not supporting those brackets, as I have already said. What I am saying is that the great bulk of Australian taxpayers are in the lowest tax bracket and a flat tax would badly disadvantage those people. These figures showing where the tax burden falls must be taken into account in any personal taxation revision. I certainly hope that that revision will not be too long in coming. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to be positive and bold in its approach to tax reform and not to fiddle around with the system or just fiddle around the edges. It must give demonstrable relief to Australians, particularly those who are caught in the pay-as-you-earn system. It is these people who are clearly approaching the point where their personal tax burden is becoming a load too heavy to bear. To effect a reduction in tax will necessitate some other form of income for the Government and I would strongly support the expansion of an indirect tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of tax avoidance. This legislation is designed to eliminate a section of the tax avoidance industry. While tax avoidance is larger than anyone would like to see, I do not believe that any Treasurer has done more than the present Treasurer (Mr Howard) to attempt to eliminate it. I believe that that should be acknowledged. With any fairness, it will be acknowledged by both sides of the House. Many holes remain to be plugged and I sincerely hope that this will be done. There is no justice in some people paying tax and others , who are on high incomes or reasonable incomes, paying little or no tax. There are many who should be paying their share of tax who are not. Take, for example, a man generally known as the leader of this tax avoidance system in Australia, Mr Peter Clyne, who dodges in and out of the country like a rabbit. He comes here and openly boasts about how he pays no tax. He gives expensive advice to others on how do to the same thing. While he is here, of course, he makes full use of all our facilities, our public services, our roads and our transport system. Does he consider that he is liable to share any of this burden? Not Mr Clyne. I have no doubt that if he were hit by a bus he would be the first person to want to use a public hospital. Others carry the burden and he reaps the benefits. Of course, he is not the only person involved. It is with some sense of gratification that I see that Mr Clyne has eventually been nailed. I understand it is unlikely that we will see him back in this country. Tax minimisation is legitimate and we all do it to reduce our tax to as low an amount as possible. Nobody wants to pay more tax. But those who are on high or reasonable incomes and pay no tax are a different kettle of fish altogether, be they companies or individuals. Such action cannot be justified or defended in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> I give an honourable mention to another group-those who are using the cash economy to the full and who do not pay any tax. In some areas-this applied particularly to my electorate until some months ago-it is difficult, almost impossible, to get tradesmen to work unless they receive cash in hand. Again, a sector of the community is escaping its fair burden. I believe the Government must look at this cash economy evasion. Unfortunately, I can see only one remedy to the situation with tradesmen-that is, the registration of all subcontractors. Under that system, if someone were to go to an employer, seek work and be put on , the employer would be obliged to ask for his registration number. If he were not registered as a subcontractor the employer would be obliged to deduct his tax at source. If the employer did not do that penalties against both the employer and the employee would have to be considered. Nobody likes less than I do to advocate registering anybody. On the other hand, I fail to see why we should condone the actions of a significant sector of the community which is escaping its burden of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, an argument which is fairly widely canvassed is that the high level of personal taxation which is rampant in this country is forcing honest men to become rogues. I must say that I have a certain sympathy for that argument, but I come back to one basic point: There is a law which states that we must pay a certain amount of tax. That law should stand. No law states that everyone should share the burden but that is what we must do if we are to have equality and justice in our tax system. I believe we have a responsibility to obey that law and to pay our taxes, although we may not like doing it very much. If we do not pay our fair share some people, particularly those caught in the pay-as-you-earn system, will carry a disproportionate burden of taxation. This Bill will further ensure, particularly in the company taxation area, that the burden falls equitably not only on those who do not have the desire, the means or the opportunity to avoid paying their share of tax but also on those who are now avoiding paying their share. I conclude with the observation that Australian society is divisive enough without the artificial division of inequitable tax. For that reason, because it is a step in what I believe is the right direction, I strongly support this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to underline some of the things that the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) suggested before he left the chamber. I think the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill is extremely important. In terms of taxation it is perhaps one of the most important pieces of legislation to come into the House. It is unfortunate that there appears to be little enthusiasm on the part of honourable members opposite for full scale debate on this measure. Of course, the matter of transfer pricing arises because of broader characteristics of international economies and because of the existence of transnational corporations and their dominance on the international scene. In no area of economic theory, in my view, is the Government's rhetoric- particularly the rhetoric of the so-called free traders or dries within the Government-more out of touch with reality than it is in this field of international economics. Those people believe-presumably, as they support the Treasurer (Mr Howard) who believes also-that trade in the modern world takes place within the context of competitive markets subject to laws of supply and demand; that is, it is a world in which one can sensibly talk about arm's length trading in which those countries which participate, as a result of the operations of the market, receive perhaps a fair share of the fruits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) pointed out, the existence of intra-firm trade-that is, trade within various arms of the same corporate network-on a massive scale destroys such illusory, even fanciful, views of the world. The real world is increasingly dominated by very large corporations or clusters of corporations which often conduct their principal transactions within their own vertically integrated structures. Putting it simply, they trade with themselves. It is this reality, so briefly referred to by the Treasurer in his second reading speech, which gives rise to the need for international tax avoidance or transfer pricing. This, as the honourable member for Gellibrand suggested, is the practice of transferring goods, services, capital or technology in such a way that profits are made as low as possible in those nations with the highest tax rates. It is not a new phenomenon. In 1975 the Asprey Taxation Review Committee suggested that section 136, as it was then drafted, was inadequate and that that section needed to be redrafted. If this Government, even in the last few years, had been as committed as it claimed it was to doing something about tax avoidance where it affects major corporations it would have done something about it before now. It has had seven years. It was really only after the High Court of Australia brought down a judgment against the Government in the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation case last year that finally the Government gave in and introduced this legislation. But it is not a new issue; it is not a new problem. The United States Tariff Commission, in a report in 1973, pointed to the dangers. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The chief strategy of tax minimisation by international companies is manipulation of transfer prices. </PARA>
<PARA>It stated further:</PARA>
<PARA> The prevalence of administered or arbitrary intra corporate pricing is a principal reason why multinational companies prefer 100 per cent ownership of foreign subsidiaries. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem, of course, of transfer pricing includes more than the matter of a tax. Allowed to flourish it results not only in a loss of tax revenue to the Government but also in a loss of what would otherwise be higher wages to workers and a loss of profits to local shareholders. It results in an increase in the profits of the transitional corporations. It has very serious impacts, for example, on Australia's balance of payments. It causes a loss of foreign exchange. I stress that when we consider this issue we need to look at it within a certain economic context. As Galbraith pointed out in the Modern Economy, the state, in dealing with transnational capital, is confronting not a market on which it seeks to impose order but an alternative planning system with which it must compete for power. When speaking of the United States, Galbraith said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the place of the market system, we must now assume for approximately half of all economic output there is a planning system. The planning system consists in the United States of at least 2,000 large corporations. In their transactions they have power that transcends the market. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia no doubt the top 200 firms fulfil a similar role as an alternative source of power and economic planning to that of governments. I want to spend some time dealing with a particular example of such corporate power which is extremely relevant to this issue. Indeed, the two examples cited in the speech of the honourable member for Gellibrand were drawn from the aluminium industry. I want to speak particularly about the nature and character of that industry, and why transfer pricing is likely to occur in it.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, one ought to underline the fact that this industry is highly oligopolistic; that is, it is dominated by six transnational corporations, sometimes referred to as the six sisters, which are vertically integrated through all stages of production and which own or control more than half of the world's productive capacity, including each of the three basic stages of production. They are, in approximate order of importance, Alcoa, Alcan, Reynolds , Kaiser, Pechiney and the Swiss Aluminium Co. Each is involved, either on its own or in partnership with other producers, in virtually every bauxite and alumina plant of any importance outside the centrally planned economies. All of these companies are operating in Australia and, one way or another, have a controlling interest in every major proposal in the industry at the various stages of the industry. As the Treasury pointed out in its submission to the Senate inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA> Not only are all phases of the aluminium industry effectively owned and controlled by (these) foreign corporations, but foreign ownership extends beyond equity in the various phases of the industry to include shares in reserves and output, to the extent that 'about two-thirds of estimated total resources of major bauxite deposits currently in production are ''owned'' by foreign customers and a similar proportion of the production from existing alumina projects is owned by foreign customers'. </PARA>
<PARA>I underline the word 'customers'. The submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, aluminium smelters constructed or in the course of construction, are all controlled by these major corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> As the International Bauxite Association has pointed out, the expansion of the aluminium industry in Australia, under the control of the so-called six sisters, is the principal factor preventing the development of more open and competitive international trading in aluminium and therefore a more genuine marketing system . In an extensive study titled 'Ownership and Control: The Changing Structure of the Bauxite, Alumina and Primary Aluminium Industries over the period 1961-1982' , the IBA concluded that while there may have been some slackening of control by the aluminium majors due to the creation of 'State-owned companies in Western Europe to control a certain share of primary aluminium in these countries', access to control by these major corporations of the Australian industry has been the most important single factor going in the opposite direction; that is, maintaining the control of the so-called six sisters over the Australian industry. Australia, by allowing dominance of the major companies in its expanding industry, has been assisting the preservation of an international oligopoly rather than assisting to produce a more open trading situation. I hope that some of the so-called dries within the Liberal Party will have a look at this situation in terms of how it lines up with their philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> The concentration and control were acknowledged by the Treasurer in introducing this legislation-the particular measures on which I am concentrating my remarks are in proposed new Division 13 of Part III of the Act-designed to combat transfer pricing in this and in other vertically integrated industries. There is in the aluminium industry little arm's length trading, because one is dealing essentially with a corporate planning system, not a market system. This fact was pointed out in yesterday's Age newspaper in a report concerning the Sumitomo company's cancellation of an order for alumina from Gove. David Uren, who wrote the report, commented:</PARA>
<PARA> Most smelters buy their alumina either in house or on long term contracts and there has only ever been a marginal spot market. With the reduction in smelter capacity world-wide, smelters are taking no more than their contracted tonnage ( of alumina)-that is, the market gets to be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA>This problem goes to the heart of the amendments proposed to section 136. To quote the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Commissioner of Taxation determines that the new provisions should apply, arm's length prices will be substituted for income tax purposes in place of those adopted in the profit shifting arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>But I ask the question, taking this industry as an example: What will be the relevance of 'arm's length prices' when the industry is so tightly controlled that one can argue that such prices do not really exist? How will one determine the appropriate price of metal moving from Boyne Island to the new subsidiary of Conzinc Rio Tinto of Australia, Showa Denko in Japan, of which CRA recently purchased a half share? Looking at the domestic pricing situation, there is no agreement about the basis of price fixing for ingot in Australia, where the companies have charged the same price for ingot and where the local price bears no necessary relationship to international prices. This much was established at the aborted Prices Justification Tribunal inquiry last year. </PARA>
<PARA> We must recognise that while it is very good that this legislation has been passed and that we have a new revamped section 136, and no doubt there will be some flexibility to look at various ways of determining what arm's length prices might mean, when we are confronted with highly integrated industries that control so much of world production that they are able to arrange prices between themselves, there will be real problems with determining what the so-called arm' s length price is about. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it not also time that we recognised that pricing itself is as much a political decision as it is an economic decision? Australian prices for bauxite, for example, have been determined very largely by political factors. This much was recognised by the IBA in its study of bauxite prices published in November 1979. That study concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, as the largest producer of bauxite in the world, exerts the largest influence on markets for metallurgical ore and consequently upon alumina-that exports of bauxite are not publicly reported but are sold at low prices and that much of the Australian alumina has been produced at low cost, relative to other countries, and sold at the lowest reported price in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The IBA report indicates that benefits to this country as opposed to the companies have been minimal because royalties have been ridiculously low, with taxation being amongst the lowest level of revenue per tonne of bauxite received by the various governments from private companies. Not only are taxes ridiculously low by world standards; our will to collect taxes from the companies appears to be extremely weak. For example, the Treasurer, in an answer to a question from me last November, revealed that the Taxation Office did not receive bauxite and alumina export data, even though the information was supplied to Ministers and other Government bodies such as the Bureau of Customs and the Department of Trade and Resources. Perhaps this is why it was the Icelandic Government and not the Australian Government which drew attention to the massive difference between the price of alumina leaving the company at Gove and that entering the related company in Iceland. The Taxation Office perhaps did not have at its disposal all the relevant information, and certainly was not being encouraged to seek it. The Government is to be congratulated that seven years on it has now at least implemented the Asprey committee's recommendation that section 136 should be rewritten to empower the Commissioner of Taxation to:</PARA>
<PARA>reconstruct the profits of non-residents derived from sources in Australia and the profits of residents dealing with associated non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA>It is important that the arm's length principle be accepted and applied to this area of transfer pricing. It is quite amazing that the Asprey Taxation Review Committee could have pointed out seven years ago what the High Court's judgment would be when a case was tested. This Government, which claims that it is interested in tax avoidance, had that report and did not act upon it until a company was found out, and then it was not able to be properly dealt with by the courts because appropriate amendments had not been drafted. One does not have much sympathy for the High Court because one knows what the High Court, in many respects, has been about; it has been about striking down legislation in this area in terms of extremely narrow interpretations. The Government had been warned but it had done nothing. But at least one can say that the Government has now finally acted and that the revisions to be carried out, in terms of the legislation at least, go some of the way towards dealing with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> But one ought to go on to point out that the legislation itself certainly will not be enough. There are weaknesses in the legislation. I think the penalties that are suggested represent more interest in taxes not paid rather than in any severe penalty. If the Government were really seriously interested in taking on the question of transfer pricing one would expect it to put into the Act very much stronger penalties. When we deal with these companies we are dealing, as I have suggested, with a planning system. If we are not prepared to put massive resources into the Taxation Office to seek information, we will not get very much more money out of these companies, because they are highly sophisticated organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> One can add to that comment the suggestion that is made by way of amendment, that is, that we ought to be adopting in this country codes of conduct such as those recommended by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which do not make it an option for companies to provide the range of information that is necessary to assess their income properly but require them to provide full scale information. Without the information it will not be possible to do the sorting out that is necessary to come to terms with the practices that are involved in industries such as the one that I have been speaking about. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, it seems to me that it is important and it is a good thing that this legislation has been introduced. The new section that is being introduced undoubtedly is in line with informed views about what ought to be done. So what remains is to ask the Government whether the will will be there to ensure that the section is pursued at least to the extent possible within the constraints which undoubtedly will arise when it is tested before the High Court. But certainly the scrutiny arrangements go a long way further than what is in the Act. The Opposition has no quibble with what is actually being done, but we suggest in the form of an amendment that the penalties ought to be strengthened and we suggest that there ought to be a code of conduct for transnational organisations which ensures that the Commissioner of Taxation gets information that currently it appears he is not able to get. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the introduction of these amendments which give effect to the new zone allowance arrangements which were announced in the Budget Speech last year but which were not finalised until 15 November last. It is very interesting to note that the Australian Labor Party has not made any substantive comment or offered support on the zone allowance amendments. It is questionable whether the ALP supports this important provision for people living in remote Australia. In so many areas of economic policy the ALP is deficient. In fact, every time the Government starts to do exciting things with the economy to save income tax the ALP leaders resort to putting on a condom and frustrating the efforts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The zone allowance decision is only a small component of this package of amendments but it is significant for people in the Northern Territory and in other remote areas of Australia. The amendment to section 79A of the principal Act will enact the three major parts of the Government's decision on zone allowances. First, the basic rebates for zone A and zone B will remain at their present levels of $216 and $36 respectively while the part of the rebate related to dependants will increase from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the relevant dependants rebates for people in zone A and from 4 per cent to 20 per cent for those in zone B. In addition, a whole new category of people eligible for further assistance, over and above that which is already available, has been created. For a taxpayer living in zone A or B, but at a place in excess of 250 kilometres by the shortest practicable surface route from the centre of a population centre of 2,500 people or more, the basic rebate will be at a special level of $750, instead of the ordinary basic amount of $216 or $36. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the package which I welcome is that the existing test for people to qualify for a zone rebate is to be modified so that a person who resides in a zone area for more than one-half of a calendar year but who, at present, does not satisfy the test in relation to an income year will receive a rebate. The modified test will first apply for the 1981 calendar year and the 1981-82 income year. So, if a person arrived in Darwin in mid-February this year and resided there until mid-December this year he will have had more than six months of the 1982 calendar year in the area and will thus be entitled to a zone rebate for the 1981-82 income year. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the recommendations of the Cox report into zone allowances which related to the realignment of zone boundaries was, I am pleased to say, rejected by the Government. The particular recommendation was for towns with a population of over 25,000 in zone A to become zone B and for zone B to be dropped from the zone areas. This decision means that Darwin will continue to be classified in zone A and eligible for the higher benefits. If the recommendation to transfer taxpayers resident in Darwin from zone A to zone B had been adopted it would have meant cash loss of approximately $611 per annum for an average family living in Darwin. I am sure honourable members will appreciate the very real problems this would have produced for family budgets and for industrial peace in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> When zone allowances were first introduced in 1945 it was stated that their purpose was to provide some means of income tax relief to taxpayers living in remote parts of the country. The three criteria used to determine remote zones were difficult climatic conditions, isolation, and the higher cost of living in these areas. Isolation is still very much a part of life in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory has a small, highly dispersed population. We are separated by long distances from the major population centres and economic centres in Australia. Travel from the Territory to other capital cities is costly and the distances involved are so great that people are forced to fly. The current economy class return air fare between Darwin and Canberra, for example, is $671. For a family of four this works out at just under $2,700. In addition, our access to educational, medical, cultural and recreational facilities and services to which persons in non-remote areas are accustomed is limited. </PARA>
<PARA> Territorians who wish to attend university or pursue many other areas of tertiary study are forced to go interstate. At the same time the cost of living in the Northern Territory is substantially higher than it is in the non-remote regions of Australia. The cost disadvantage is exacerbated by the impact of transport costs on the wide range of items which have to be imported; the smallness of local markets, which restricts the opportunities for achieving economies of scale; and high local labour costs. There are two broad objectives and justifications for zone allowances. Firstly, they are a compensation for disabilities and disadvantages; secondly, they are an incentive to permanent settlement in remote areas and the attendant development of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Having dealt with the disadvantages of living in remote areas, I would like to deal briefly with the need for development. From the point of view of defence and national security, there is considerable merit in promoting greater settlement in the northern region of Australia. Increased population in remote areas of Australia would facilitate the protection of the coastline and the preservation of our security against low-level contingencies such as illegal fishing in Australian waters, smuggling and illegal immigration. Of overriding importance, however, is the significant contribution to the rest of the country that the overwhelming wealth of these regions will bring about. The benefits of developing the north of Australia are evident if one considers the following points: The area of Australia which falls into the existing zone A tax boundary contains 85 per cent of Australia's iron ore, 85 per cent of its uranium, 80 per cent of its bauxite, 65 per cent of its copper, 60 per cent of its natural gas and 50 per cent of its silver, lead and zinc, yet we face the problem of attracting people to these areas and getting them to stay there, thus creating a stable population base for future development. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this area that the zone allowances can make a real contribution. The problem with zone allowances, however, is that they do not help people on income benefits, such as pensioners. This is an unfair situation and in many instances causes extreme cases of hardship and poverty. Often the high cost of living in more remote areas forces the elderly upon retirement, to leave and settle down in unfamiliar surroundings with unfamiliar people. The point is that zone allowances will assist only pensioners with additional income from investments. Assistance to the large majority of pensioners and welfare recipients can be achieved only by recognition by the Government that social security benefits and allowances should be substantially and proportionately increased where the recipient is resident in a zone classified for a taxation relief benefit. As one of the pensioners in my electorate put it to me in a letter; if zone allowances for people employed in the Territory are likely to be increased, why cannot something be done for the pensioner? To conclude I re-emphasise the importance of zone allowances. Although not the only consideration in the terms of these amendments, they are a very important measure to thousands of Australians living in remote areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the chance to say a few words on this matter. It is not a matter to which I normally would address my mind but it involves a lot of legal implications in respect of decisions of the High Court of Australia which have been made and which brought about amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act, particularly clause 19, which deals with international agreements and which also refers to the question of arm's length arrangements. I do not want to delay the House but I think the facts which are worthy of comment in my normal sphere of discussing matters in Australia relate to what is deemed to be a free market as against whether there has to be some control of a market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am interested in looking at the position which the Government is attempting to address its mind to, particularly that in respect of what is called ' international agreements'. It is a matter that perhaps would be more appropriately discussed in the Committee of the Whole, but I will not have the chance to do so. I do not wish to disagree with the legislation, except to say that the Government has, I think, drafted proposed section 136AC in a fashion which I do not think will protect it in all circumstances. I want to make the point that proposed new section 136AC which relates to international agreements, states:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) non-resident supplied or acquired property under the agreement otherwise than in connection with a business carried on in Australia by the non-resident at or through a permanent establishment of the non-resident in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>Let us say in a nutshell that transactions of a non-resident carrying on business in a permanent position, say in Sydney, for the sale of computer hardware in Hong Kong-I am talking about transfer pricing-would not be covered by that new section. Again there does not seem to be any provision for a resident. The proposed section continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a resident carrying on a business outside Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>What about a resident carrying on business in Australia? That is another point which I think is important. For example, I think there would be a problem if General Motors-Holden's Ltd, while carrying on business in Australia, decided to export an engine at a price which was below what was deemed to be a fair price. I am not objecting to the present proposals, but I would like to see proposed section 136AC written in this fashion:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an agreement is an international agreement if-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a non-resident supplied or acquired property under the agreement;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a resident carrying on a business outside Australia supplied or acquired property under the agreement, being property supplied or acquired in connection with that business; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a resident carrying on a business in Australia supplied or acquired property under the agreement, to or from a resident or non-resident carrying on a business outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I say that goes back to what I said at the outset. We now find that the High Court decision in what is known as the Comalco case-it was a dreadful decision and one not in accordance with what we would call any normal legal appreciation of the position-stated that because there were four resident directors the carrying on of business was not subject to the protection or control of this particular section of the Act. In fact Comalco was selling bauxite at a false price to a Hong Kong subsidiary to avoid tax in Australia. The High Court, as it was then comprised, particularly with the influence of the Chief Justice, decided to say that even though the company was virtually under the direction of non-residents, because there were resident directors it was exempt. I am pleased to say that Mr Justice Murphy made a very important point that that seemed to be a very superficial arrangement. In other words, we had better look at what the real transactions might be and not just look at them on the basis of what he called absurd formalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Again might I address honourable members to what has been happening in a number of other developments in Australia. A company in South Australia called Castalloy Ltd was charged $1,500 a tonne for aluminium produced in Australia. In other words it was really marked up at a high price but the same aluminium was sold to overseas subsidiaries of the aluminium company for $1,200 a tonne. Within Australia we see various operations of transfer pricing, perhaps not so much related to the Income Tax Assessment Act, which can put Australian corporations out of business. In other words that company sold aluminium at a higher price to the Australians than it did to the subsidiary overseas. With the Alusuisse case we saw the remarkable situation of bauxite being marked up about 54 per cent while it was on the high seas. </PARA>
<PARA> I am coming to the point that unless we have a strong Act defined in the fashion of what we are about, I think we will run into as many difficulties as the Government is trying to block. For example, at the moment the Repco company while carrying on business outside Australia could be importing back into Australia goods at a price that might not be controlled because it is a resident carrying on business outside Australia. General Motors-Holden's could also be exporting its engines at a price it wants to determine. I do not think this is really covered by the sections I have mentioned. A report brought out recently by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which mentioned marketing and distribution arrangements makes the point that most of the world trade is intra-firm; that is, within the one corporation. It is not at arm's length. There is a real fallacy here about the term 'arm's length'. The report goes on to state that government control is minimal, particularly in respect of transfer prices, when in the main its emphasis is on collection rather than on the effects on imports and exports, and also domestic production. I make the point that most of the world trade is now within the one corporation. It has got massive. Let us look at some of the statistics that have been produced in this area. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Between 30-40 per cent of all international trade is on an intra-firm or related -party basis, that another 30 per cent is likely to constitute State trading, that a further share of international trade is captive in nature as a result of sub-contracting or long-term and medium term contractual arrangements, and in the light of the vast array of other formal and informal links between the major trading agents, it is apparent that the concept of a freely competitive international trading market is illusory. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to give detailed estimates for individual countries. I will show it to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) and, if he agrees, I will seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. When talking about this question of being at arm's length, we come to the point of how the Taxation Commissioner will fix a fair consideration on this matter. How will it be able to do it in accordance with section 136AD, which talks about whether or not arm's length consideration is to be given. What input will it have? It will find it very difficult indeed because it will not have any real indication as to what the market prices should be. One will readily find from this report the problems the world is now facing in dealing with trade. We want to strengthen this section. I ask, firstly, whether it has been properly drafted to cover the matters that I have mentioned and, secondly, will there be the capacity actually to fix the proper consideration, bearing in mind that business is controlled in a very large number of ways?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to illustrate what is happening at present, as it is discussed by this UNCTAD report. For example, most of Japan's trade is carried on within nine major corporations called sogo shoshas. They are the most powerful and diversified of all trading corporations. The report says that whilst competition amongst the sogo shoshas seems to be keen, much of it is illusory because in fundamental matters they work together much more than they compete. The central part of the Japanese conglomerates is the strong financial backing and access to credit, provided not only by their own banks and insurance companies but also by interlinks with the Industrial Bank of Japan. The report goes on to give some indication of how it is expanding its operation. Brazilian exports of footwear, for example, were until recently controlled by the United States but now they are controlled primarily through one of the sogo shoshas and the non-leather footwear from Brazil comes through Mitsubishi. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, we can pick any country in the world now to indicate clearly the control exercised by a number of conglomerates, which will be involved in transfer pricing, the use of tax havens and certainly the use of retail outlets to fix prices in any area in which they want so to do. So, it is a very difficult situation, particularly in this country at present when we have people talking about the real advantages of what they call the effect of the free market being able to indicate clearly the efficient use of financial resources. That is laughable when we see that this report illustrates the great control exercised over the world commodity trade. Even the London Metal Market controls only a very small part of the world metals market. It is a relatively small private concern. So in that context one must ask what facilities the Taxation Commissioner will have to indicate clearly how it will have any access to the major corporate trading conglomerates of the world. I make this point again. The Journal of World Trade Law states:</PARA>
<PARA> In fact it can be said that the bulk of the international commodity trade is in the hands of about 50 companies, around which there is a great number of smaller companies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to list those companies. I add that there are no such Australian companies, and that is not surprising. There are plenty from the United States and also from France, and certainly from Japan. Again the point comes to how we in Australia can survive this domination of our market due to foreign interests and foreign benefit and gain. No matter what section on the market we look at we now find that the international conglomerates have made a decision that could well be against Australia at any level at all, whether it be at the production level in the first instance or whether it be at the level of getting a share of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Even in regard to the wheat trade we find that the Cargill company, one of the most important international grain merchants, has now expanded into a large number of areas. That is very important indeed. It is the world's largest grain trader. It does business with Russia and has a network covering 36 countries, and it can well establish the price of grain. It became a conglomerate through acquisitions and takeovers. It now deals not only with grain but also with cotton, metals, chemicals, steel et cetera. It has an insurance arm and offers life assurance as well. It also covers marketing as well as speculation. It uses tax havens for all of its international trading outside the United States and Canada, as do most of the other international grain traders. What will happen to the Australian Wheat Board? Does it think it will get a fair price if Cargill decides in some way to affect the market, as well might be the case? That organisation has a subsidiary called Tradex. Tradex, itself, is party owned by Salevia, which is a Swiss foundation whose members are all members of the two families who own Cargill. Between one-third and one-half of Cargill's United States sales are made intrafirm and some of the largest grain shipments from the United States to the Soviet Union were contracted by Tradex; in other words, within the one firm. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a question of thinking now that the world will be fair and reasonable and that matters will be dealt with at arms length. My question is not by way of objection but goes to the capacity of this Government in Australia to ascertain what is really happening when we have this sort of marketing and allocation of resources not by governments in Australia but by international conglomerates that can dictate whether we will have a business or not. I make the point that if the General Motors and Ford companies wanted to abandon their investment in Australia, it could happen tomorrow if they so decided. We would have no control over it. Again we should look at the fact that the conglomerates also control the retail outlets. Retail houses now buy heavily through their own agents and fix prices accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> We have people in Australia and in the Liberal Party trying to indicate that everything will be fair, free and above board simply because we are in Australia and somebody else is somewhere else, at arms length. That is a myth. It ought to be looked at knowing full well that Treasury advice on many occasions is that the only way to go is by what is called the free trade route; that is the most efficient way to go in this country and therefore unless an industry here can stand up for itself it should not be entitled to survive. We should bear in mind that the industry here might well be foreign owned and controlled, as most are. What chance does an industry have if it is up against the conglomerates in the world that are concerned with these matters I raise. So when we talk about this matter let everybody in Australia realise that not only do these people trade within themselves but also they enter into collusive arrangements. They guarantee who might tender in certain circumstances. That has been known and identified. They have arrangements as to who might be the most successful person and they can then make arrangements between themselves to share the wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a matter which is of not the least significance. Statements have been made in this House as to how Australia will do well in the diamond trade. I note that this report refers to the Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa. It makes the point that it is a majority owned subsidiary and De Beers-the South African giant-holds 41 per cent. De Beers and AAC together control the whole of the international gold and diamond market. In addition to the directly held subsidiaries, this corporation holds substantial interests through subsidiaries in Great Britain and also in Bermuda. It has 16 enterprises in the United States , Canada, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Zambia, Australia, Ireland, Portugal et cetera. So we are in the group that internationally could decide how to work out what will be the price of the diamonds we might have. This clearly indicates that not only is this corporation just interested in that. It now has many interests. It has a board of directors that is interlinked. The chairman of the Anglo-American Corporation also presides over the boards of the Anglo-American Trust and De Beers Consolidated Mines. He is also a member of the boards of directors of many other subsidiaries. So, there is no problem about how they will control pricing and dictate to the detriment of the Australian taxpayer from the point of view of getting a product. </PARA>
<PARA> What prospect is there of understanding the true position unless there be some kind of government intervention, or opportunity given to know the real price mechanism and thus the Australian tax that a given transaction ought to attract? The board in question has linkages with many expanding complexes. It has interests in the production of minerals and chemicals and, as well, is involved in a number of other activities, commodity trading in particular. It is in the process of acquiring Salomon Bros, one of the largest investment banking enterprises on Wall Street, the stated intention being to create an all-round trading house which services and finances the world's largest producers and consumers of commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the facts that I wanted to put before the House. I appreciate being given a chance to speak on the issue. The activities of those who are in public life are not confined to speaking in the Parliament. We also take part in a number of forums. I have always been mystified by the general acceptance of the fact that in Australia we are very protective: that we are not doing our taxpayers a service. Apparently a large section of the Liberal Party feels that we could well throw our industries open to what is called fair, free and competitive trade. I would not mind that if it were to be done on an equal basis , but that does not accord with what has now been established and published. Organisations such as the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development are endeavouring to establish a code of conduct to deal with these massive corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we to do about it? Are we just to sit down, pass this legislation and say: 'We hope everything will happen for the best'? That is not good enough. It is about time we looked at what is happening in the world today and acknowledged that trade is not at all free; it is very much fettered. A continuous endeavour will be made by these conglomerates, in view particularly of currency and exchange rate movements, in relation to which they have access to all these methods of financing and trading, to derive the greatest possible benefits for themselves and to pay the minimum amount of tax. For that reason I would like the Government to consider improving proposed new section 136AC in accordance with the terms I have suggested. </PARA>

<PARA>Clause 4 relates to section 26AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which is intended to ensure that when persons or corporations acquire property and sell the same within 12 months any profit made thereby shall be taxable. As I mentioned in my speech at the second reading stage, this section is being avoided. One simple way of avoiding it is to wait for 12 months and one day before selling a property. That is inherent in the very nature of the section. More seriously, what the Bill addresses itself to is avoidance, which has come to light in the last couple of years, by companies which make takeover raids, acquire shares in substantial numbers and sell them off at a higher price and in a way which means they pay no tax. That is done by putting the shares in a subsidiary company, the almost sole assets of which are those shares, and selling the company rather than the shares. Therefore section 26AAA as it now stand is avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three well-known examples of that happening over the last two or three years. In November 1979 the Bell group of companies made a takeover bid for Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. That attempt was eventually abandoned and the group sold off the shares through a subsidiary company and made a tax-free profit of $11m. Similarly, as I mentioned briefly in my speech at the second reading, in March of last year the same Bell group of companies made a takeover raid for Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd, acquired a substantial number of shares in that company, eventually abandoned the takeover attempt and sold off the shares through a subsidiary company-that is, sold that subsidiary company- and made a profit of $16 1/2m which was tax free because the group avoided section 26AAA by selling the company rather than the shares as such. The third well-known example concerns the Bond Corporation, which made a takeover bid for White Industries in August 1980. Like the Bell group, that corporation eventually abandoned the attempt but was able to sell off the shares through a subsidiary company and make a tax-free profit of $32m. Those three examples involve substantial amounts of money. On our calculations the amount of tax avoided in those three cases totalled around $27m. This is a substantial amount of money. Perhaps it is a relatively small amount when compared with the total tax revenue of the Government, but it is an amount which I would have thought this Government would be anxious to obtain. </PARA>
<PARA> What is proposed in the legislation now before us is that the operating date for the amendment to this section be 10 September 1981. The reason for taking that date is that it was the day on which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) finally got around to announcing to the world that he would legislate to block this massive loophole in section 26AAA. The policy of the Government in respect of tax avoidance is to operate amendments only from the time at which an announcement was made of the intention to legislate to block off an avoidance scheme. Therefore, the legislation which is before the Committee seeks to block off a tax avoidance scheme which is rampant and concerning which there are several known examples of large amounts of tax revenue being avoided. But the Government does not in any way attempt to obtain that revenue by backdating the legislation to the time of first known use so that $27m can be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition cannot see why the Government persists with this stupid approach to anti-tax avoidance legislation. By operating in this way-by continually saying: 'All we will do is to legislate from the time our intention to legislate was announced'-the Government is giving continuous encouragement to tax avoiders to get into new schemes. If one is first in with a scheme one can always get away with it because eventually, when the Government finds out about it, it does not attempt to backdate the legislation. The simply Government says: 'All right, we have now found out about that scheme. From today we will legislate against it '. So the tax avoider is always in front. There is a continual incentive to the tax avoider to generate new schemes knowing that for a while at any rate-perhaps a year or two-he will get away with the scheme before the Government catches up and legislates against it. It is an absurd situation. It is a continuous process of the Australian Taxation Office chasing the tax avoiders but never catching up with them. The situation is getting worse and worse year by year.</PARA>
<PARA> We have before us a specific example of how the Government is abandoning revenue of $27m, knowing that the revenue is there to be picked up simply by backdating the legislation to the time of first known use. What we propose by this amendment is that the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended to make the provision apply to the date of first known use. We suggest that it should operate from 1 July 1979 instead of September 1981. The reason we take that date is that it is a few months before the occurrence of the first case which is known to us; that is the case of the Bell group of companies making a takeover bid for Ansett Transport Industries in November 1979. Most of the shares in the Ansett case were probably acquired in the few weeks before the formal takeover bid which occurred, I think, around 25 November 1979. To make certain that we would be picking up most if not all of the shares involved in that transaction we suggest that the operative date be 1 July 1979. Setting the date at the beginning of the financial year would give a neat date from which to make the new legislation operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is always said by honourable members opposite that we cannot do things like this because it is a terrible thing; it is retrospective legislation . In general, of course, as a matter of principle we share the repudiation that Government members express of retrospective legislation. People may undertake activities which at the time are legal but which are subsequently made illegal by a change of the law. In some cases this seems to be a very undesirable procedure. But in this case we believe that principle has to stand up against the principle of equity for other taxpayers. If we intended to allow tax avoiders to escape retrospective action we must be saying-this Government is saying continuously-that by repudiating retrospectivity in respect of tax avoidance we will continue to allow the tax avoiders always to have a break on the Taxation Office. Therefore, tax avoidance must get worse and worse. </PARA>
<PARA> A matter of great principle is involved. We believe in this case the principle which must apply is the one of equity for all Australian taxpayers. We must stop tax avoidance becoming worse and worse, as has occurred over the last few years. I remind the Committee that the number of known tax avoiders was reported by the Commissioner of Taxation in his annual report as being 20 times higher during the last financial year than it was in the last year of the Labor Government. We can see that avoidance is exploding as an enormous problem with massive amounts of revenue being lost. It requires tough action to be taken by government. In those circumstances we believe that application of retrospectivity is justified where blatant tax avoidance is involved. In the case which we are considering now there can be no argument that there was blatant tax avoidance. There was no commercial reason to sell off the shares via these subsidiary companies. Those companies were probably created for the purpose of such transactions-that is, they were shelf companies with no other life or reason for being except for having within them these shares-so that the companies could be sold off to avoid tax by not selling the shares directly. This is absolutely blatant tax avoidance . </PARA>
<PARA> In that situation why should we not apply the law retrospectively, back to the time of first known use? Then we would not only collect the revenue in these cases but also we would say to the tax avoiders of Australia: 'We will pursue this principle in future. In all other cases of tax avoidance schemes which come to light requiring action by this Government we, the Government, will make sure that you do not get away with those tax avoidance schemes and will legislate against them back from the time of first known use'. Nothing would be more certain to dissuade tax avoiders in this country from undertaking their nefarious activities than some such action by this Government. It has the chance here today, by supporting this amendment, to make a break with the past and to say to the tax avoidance industry: 'Enough is enough. We will chop you off at the socks from this day on'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). I think it would be appalling if the Government rejected the amendments. If it is sincere about doing something about tax avoidance, surely it will accept the amendments. I have asked a series of questions dealing with what was earlier thought to be a breach of the Income Tax Amendment Act. It clearly was tax avoidance under section 26AAA. It deals with the Bonds, the Brierleys and the Holmes a Courts. The tragedy is that no statistics are kept on corporate takeovers, as I understand it, either by the Australian Taxation Office or by the National Companies and Securities Commission. When we talk about Brierley, Bond and Holmes a Court we are singling out three of a large number who could be caught in the same net. On 23 March 1982 I asked the following question without notice to the Treasurer:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . In the light of the judgments of Gibbs C. J. and Mason J. in the case of the Commissioner of Taxation v. Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd, is it a fact that the requirement of identity of property that has dogged the application of section 26A of the Income Tax Assessment Act to many transactions does not apply to the second limb of this section dealing with the profit from profit making undertakings and schemes? Therefore, will he instruct the Commissioner of Taxation to take proceedings under section 26A against the Bell group of companies for recovery of the tax payable on the share and property transactions involved in the Elder Smith Goldsborough Mort takeover? Finally, will he further instruct the Commissioner to investigate the many similar profit making schemes and undertakings involving the purchase of property and its resale in the manner used by the Bell group which have produced such huge tax free profits in recent years?</PARA>
<PARA>The question to be raised simply is this: If in fact the Government is not prepared to accept the amendments, people involved in corporate takeovers resulting in massive tax free profits will go free. In light of the High Court judgment, particularly in the light of the judgments of Gibbs, Mason and Murphy, the Commissioner of Taxation ought to contest section 26A. The answer from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to my question was simply this:</PARA>
<PARA> So far as this particular case is concerned, let me say to the honourable gentleman that I have no capacity to instruct the Commissioner of Taxation nor, indeed, does any Minister have any capacity to instruct the Commissioner to take particular action against individual taxpayers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I challenge that answer for a variety of reasons. The reason for inaction that is generally touted by Ministers relates to section 16, the secrecy provisions. I regret to say that far too often Ministers hide behind that facade. I think it is an essential rule in Australia that a Minister should be responsible to Parliament for the conduct of his Department. The Treasurer is responsible for the Commissioner's actions or his lack of action. If that be the case, it seems clear to me that the Minister can direct the Department to take a certain course of action and I believe it is the duty of the Department to carry out that action. Surely the Minister must be able to direct the Department to investigate a course of action or even to take a particular course of action. I am not asking that the secrecy provisions be breached and that details of a transaction be revealed but, surely, in the light of the High Court judgment, we have a right to instruct the Commissioner of Taxation to test cases. Five sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act set out the powers to assess and to initiate action. For example, section 166 states:</PARA>
<PARA> From the returns, and from any other information in his possession, or from any one or more of these sources, the Commissioner shall make an assessment of the amount of the taxable income of any taxpayer, and of the tax payable thereon. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 169 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where under this Act any person is liable to pay tax, the Commissioner may make an assessment of the amount of such tax. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn to section 170, which has a retrospective provision. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner may, subject to this section, at any time amend any assessment by making such alterations therein or additions thereto as he thinks necessary, notwithstanding that tax may have been paid in respect of the assessment. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 222 is the penal provision. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ''taxation prosecution'' means a proceeding by the Crown for the recovery of a pecuniary penalty under this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 233 states:</PARA>
<PARA> A taxation prosecution may be instituted in the name of the Commissioner by action in the High Court or in the Supreme Court of any State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that under most of these provisions the Commissioner has a discretion; the word used is 'may'. Presumably, if the Commissioner chooses not to assess or to prosecute someone under the Act and someone escapes tax liability, the Commissioner must answer to his Minister. If he answers to the Minister, he answers to the Parliament. Accordingly, the Minister surely ought to be able to direct certain action by his Department and expect it to be carried out. Section 222, which I have already quoted, is interesting. It refers to proceedings instituted by the Crown. This must mean the relevant Minister acting for the Crown. In this case, it is the Treasurer. Encel's book, Cabinet Government in Australia, states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the minister is responsible to parliament for the conduct of his department, and the actions of civil servants are, by convention, regarded as the acts of ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems that far too often in this Parliament Ministers hide behind section 16. Regrettably, it seems to be in part a result of the taxation secrecy provisions and the insularity that breeds, and in part a result of the lack of co- ordination. What bureaucrats in fact do not want or what they are worst at, that is co-ordination. In the light of the judgment to which I have referred-a very important judgment-the Commissioner of Taxation clearly has the power to test a case under either section 26A or section 25 (1). We, as a parliament, create the legislation and surely we are entitled to know whether it is being enforced. In my view it is wrong for the Treasurer to say that he cannot instruct his Commissioner in this matter. We are not asking him to breach the secrecy provisions. What we are asking him to do is to test the High Court judgment in cases of corporate takeovers such as those involving Brierley, Bond and Holmes a Court. </PARA>
<PARA> One alternative is that we parliamentarians wait until a legislative committee set up to deal with this Act can ask the Commissioner questions. At the moment we have to rely on his annual report, and I doubt very much whether we will find in it a notation as to whether action has been taken against companies controlled by these people and companies like them. Another alternative is that we wait until next year for the Estimates committees. A matter of $32m is involved in the Bond takeover and $16.5m in the dealings of the Holmes a Court Bell group. That is the tip of the iceberg. If we add up all the amounts, we find that millions upon millions of dollars turn on the High Court judgment. It is not a question of whether the amendments are accepted. My guess is that they will not be accepted. But the one thing the Government has a responsibility to ensure is that the Commissioner tests that judgment and act against the people who have tried to avoid their taxation obligations under section 26AAA or, in this case, section 26A. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make another observation. Had we not tightened up the Slutzkin loophole, in my view we would have had a further obligation to instruct the Commissioner to contest such schemes in the High Court. We ought to have done that. We ought not have waited for so long. I intend to pursue this matter right through the year to ensure that ultimately these people are taken to book either under the amended legislation or under section 26 (a) or section 25 (1). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the amendments moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) I would like to make a couple of brief observations, some of which arise out of matters raised by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi). Firstly, looking at the question of tax avoidance generally, the massive explosion of tax avoidance was revealed in the report of the Commissioner of Taxation tabled in Parliament on 29 October last year. In fact, that report showed that the Commissioner identified over 22,000 participants in tax avoidance schemes involving revenue losses of $973m or almost $43,000 in tax lost per tax avoider. The problem to which the honourable member for Gellibrand adverted on the question of retrospectivity in relation to tax avoidance schemes is, in my view, the essential aspect which this Government has not been prepared to tackle.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Hawker says, it is a test of credibility, and I propose to deal with that in a moment. But I want to make it clear for a start that we in the Australian Labor Party accept that as a general rule individuals should not in any way be disadvantaged as a result of legislation operating retrospectively. We believe that such legislation should not be contemplated other than in exceptional circumstances. But we in the Labor Party make no apology for the fact that we would legislate in the area of tax avoidance. We think it is essential to legislate against highly contrived and artificial schemes which are generally accepted as being inspired only by tax avoidance and which have no legitimate commercial function whatsoever. In those sorts of exceptional circumstances the magnitude of Australia's tax avoidance problem through blatantly artificial schemes cannot be stopped while in fact a situation arises, as it does today, where tax avoiders know that schemes will operate whether it be for one year, two years or three years. That is in fact what is happening now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The policy of this Government to legislate against tax avoidance schemes from the time they are discovered allows many schemes to operate for more than two years before being closed off. Then we have the absurd situation where the complexity of amending legislation is such that new loopholes are in fact opened up. The greatest deterrent in respect of the artificially inspired avoidance schemes is the threat of retrospective legislation. The whole issue of tax avoidance has clearly reached disease proportions in that people will use a tax avoidance scheme if they know that they will be able to obtain an advantage for a certain time. People involved in the tax avoidance industry will continue to operate this way until the Government bites the bullet on the question of retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which I think should be dealt with briefly at this stage is the question of the enforcement of the existing provisions of the Act. Very recently in this place I asked the Treasurer (Mr Howard) a question in relation to section 26 (a). On that occasion I think the Treasurer was somewhat confused in his answer because he seemed to refer to section 26AAA rather than section 26 (a). But the fact of the matter is that section 26 (a) is not being enforced at the moment as it ought to be. There are plenty of examples of this. One recent example involved an advertisement in the Melbourne Age that referred to money that could be invested in a building society, a fixed deposit or somewhere else. It pointed out that one could expect a return of about 16 per cent on one's money which would be subject to income tax. It also pointed out that because of inflation the real value of a person's capital would be reduced by 10 per cent at the end of 12 months. The advertisement went on to say that for investments in real estate-the real estate involved was a project called the Links at Tweed Heads-the capital gains, of course, are not taxable if the property is held for more than 12 months. That is in fact the basis upon which people are operating in Australia today. It is a disgraceful situation for any government to permit that sort of advertising to take place when what has been said is just not true. In fact, the intention to purchase is the crucial factor under the first limb of section 26 (a). If we let a situation continue in which people can buy properties under the guise of intending to rent them and then, as the honourable member for Gellibrand indicated, suddenly change their minds a few days after they have held the property for more than 12 months to avoid section 26AAA, those people now have a very, very good chance of just pocketing a capital gain at the expense of taxpayers of this country. The result of this sort of practice is seen in the enormous increase in tax that has been paid by pay-as-you-earn income tax contributors in Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. In fact, the situation today in respect of section 26 (a) did not exist some years ago. We are fully aware that there are all sorts of difficulties in relation to the enforcement of section 26 (a) because of some past High Court decisions. But certainly there is an indication that that practice will not be as easy as it has been, and that is evident from recent decisions of the Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that a mentality has developed as indicated clearly by developers who say in public promotions that if one holds a property for more than one year one's capital gain will not be taxed. In fact, under the existing legislation that is not correct. This situation has quite justifiably caused many people a considerable amount of concern. It is one of the great areas of tax avoidance. Yet, as the honourable member for Hawker indicated, this Government extraordinarily has cut back in the Taxation Office. The Taxation Office should be given far more support by this Government in its efforts to get stuck into purchasers. There are plenty of examples in Victoria of purchasers of property, particularly in Queensland, who could not possibly show that there was not an intention to sell that property at a profit. These people would not necessarily be picked up on the basis that the income was earned as part of their business activities. However, if they were thoroughly investigated they would find it almost impossible to argue that they did not intend to purchase the property and then sell it at a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come back to where the honourable member for Gellibrand finished. Unless this Government bites the bullet on the question of retrospectivity it will be only playing with the question of tax avoidance. At the moment people are quite prepared, whether for one year, two years or three years, to take the advantage and pocket the tax saved at the expense of the rest of the community. They know that the benefit they have obtained from the initial stages of tax avoidance schemes will not be affected by subsequent legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for the absence of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) who at present is attending the Asian Development Bank meeting in Manila. I will, however, bring to his attention the comments that have been made in the Committee deliberation. I will also, of course, bring to the attention of the Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), the comments that have been made by the three speakers in this debate. In response to what has been said, particularly what has been said by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), I am surprised at the general tenor of the comments made by honourable members opposite in relation to the Government's general attitude to tax avoidance. It must be conceded by anyone who is knowledgeable in this area, or by anyone who has studied the statutes and the debates of this Parliament since Federation, that no government has moved more positively in this area than the present Government and no Treasurer has taken more initiatives to close loopholes in this area than the current Treasurer, John Howard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments that have been moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand to clause 4 of the Bill are to the effect that the remedial provisions to prevent avoidance of tax on short term property transactions would apply as from 1 July 1979 rather than from 10 September 1981 when the Treasurer foreshadowed them. I recognise, as has been pointed out this evening by honourable members opposite, that the Opposition is in favour of retrospective legislation against tax avoidance schemes. This of course is a policy question and a question on which the Government and the Opposition disagree. The general approach of the Government has been that as soon as evidence of a particular tax avoidance practice emerges, legislation to counter that practice is foreshadowed and it is proposed to Parliament that the legislation, when enacted, will have effect from the date of the announcement. That is what has been done on this occasion and honourable members opposite know full well that that is the position. Whatever the merits of retrospective approaches, this is not the kind of situation to which retrospective legislation would be appropriate. Is is by no means certain that the courts or other appellant tribunals would, in the absence of this legislation, uphold the validity of the kind of arrangements against which clause 4 is directed. There is recent support to be found in the dicta of Mason, J. in the High Court of Australia in the matter the Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd for the view that the courts may not find section 26AAA deficient in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have two quick points to make. Firstly, in regard to the statement of the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) that no government has taken more action against tax avoidance than this Government, we agree that no government has shut more stable doors after more tax avoidance horses have bolted than this one. That is certainly the case. Our whole approach has been one of saying: 'Yes, there has been an enormous amount of action taken. There has been more legislation than ever in respect of closing off tax avoidance schemes and more tax avoidance than ever'. In other words, all of this legislation has essentially not overcome the basic problem, that of rampant tax avoidance. If we are to overcome that problem, we have to face up to other actions. The key action involved is the one that is proposed in the amendment now before the House, that is, the application of retrospectivity. Without the application of retrospectivity there is no way in which the Government will not continue with the futile process of the past, of closing stable doors after tax avoidance horses have bolted. We cannot see any point in continuing that kind of approach when it has been proven to be such a failure in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not able to comment in detail on the case law quoted by the Minister in his remarks in respect of the merits of retrospective legislation in this particular case. But, from a layman's point of view, I can say that there is no doubt whatever in the minds of everyone in this Parliament that the schemes which are sought to be closed off by the amendments now before the House are absolutely and totally blatant tax avoidance schemes. There can be no question about that whatever. In that situation we have no compunction in saying that action should be taken against them on a retrospective basis. We do not think there is any need for us to feel reticent about proposing such action against what are clearly and undeniably blatant tax avoidance schemes. In that situation we stand by our amendment and ask the Parliament to support it. </PARA>

<PARA> (6) Clause 23, page 38, lines 16-18, omit 'calculated, in respect of the period commencing on the last day allowed for furnishing the return of income for the year of income and ending on the day on which the assessment is made, at the rate of 10 per cent per annum of', substitute 'equal to'. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) Clause 23, page 38, line 19, before 'the amount' insert 'double'. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) Clause 23, page 38, line 21, before 'the amount' insert 'double'. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 23 deals with penalties for breach of proposed new Division 13 relating to transfer pricing activities or for breach of a double taxation agreement in the same respect; that is, when it applies to transfer pricing. The clause before us provides for a penalty of 10 per cent per annum of the tax sought to be avoided. This seems to the Opposition to be an extremely low penalty. I make my point by comparing that 10 per cent penalty with other penalties applying under the Income Tax Assessment Act. Of course, there are penalties for persons who make false returns, who omit or understate their incomes or who in other ways attempt to avoid or evade tax. </PARA>
<PARA> These penalties vary in their impact, but in most cases they provide for a much more severe penalty than that envisaged under this Bill for transfer pricing- type tax avoidance. For instance, section 226 (1) provides a penalty of additional tax equal to the tax assessable-that is, a penalty of 100 per cent, not 10 per cent-for any taxpayer who fails to furnish any return or information required by the Act or the Commissioner of Taxation. Section 226 (2) provides a penalty of double the tax sought to be avoided for any person omitting assessable income or claiming a rebate or deduction in excess of expenditure actually incurred. A penalty of similar magnitude is provided under section 227 and section 230 for taxpayers who make false returns or understate their incomes . These penalties are double the tax sought to be avoided, compared with the 10 per cent penalty applying in clause 23 of the Bill now before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 226 (2A) also provides for a 200 per cent penalty for persons caught evading tax by the new general anti-avoidance section 177 which was enacted last year. This, of course, is an extremely relevant comparison because in framing this legislation for proposed new Division 13 regard was paid to Part IVA. I think an attempt was made to interrelate the two provisions, but the penalty side is staggeringly different. Under Part IVA the general anti-avoidance provision a 200 per cent penalty is imposed. Under new proposed Division 13 a miserable 10 per cent penalty will apply. Section 229 provides for four years imprisonment for taxpayers who knowingly make false declarations under the Act. Obviously this is a rather more drastic penalty than a penalty of 10 per cent of the tax sought to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> The penalty contained in proposed new Division 13 is almost insignificant. A penalty of 10 per cent is ludicrously low. It is hard to see how it could act as any deterrent at all to persons or companies contemplating the risks of undertaking such tax avoidance. When the amounts involved were substantial, for example, the amount of tax avoided could be re-invested easily by the taxpayer at an interest rate of, say, 20 per cent-it would not be hard to get that rate of interest these days on large amounts of money. When or if the person or company was brought to task by the operation of proposed new Division 13 and was required to repay the tax avoided, plus 10 per cent per annum penalty tax, the taxpayer or the company concerned would still be well ahead on the arrangement. This is a situation in which the penalty will not be big enough to dissuade people from undertaking that kind of activity. A person could make more money by lending the money he succeeded in withholding from the Commissioner of Taxation under these arrangements than he is likely to pay in a penalty if, in fact, he is eventually caught up with. </PARA>
<PARA> We regard this as a thoroughly unsatisfactory provision all round. Indeed, in some cases the penalty may not even be as high as 10 per cent. The penalty applies only for the period between the due date for providing an income tax return and the day on which the assessment is due. Thus if for example returns were due on 31 August and an amended assessment was finally made at the end of April, the penalty would apply only for nine months at an annual rate of 10 per cent, which in this case would be effectively a flat rate of 7.5 per cent. In many cases the penalty may not even be 10 per cent but may be something less than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the penalty contained in clause 23 is really no penalty at all. It is really little more than levying interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum on the amount of tax avoided, which the tax avoider retains the use of until he is caught by the Taxation Office. As such, it is similar to section 207 of the principal Act, which applies a penalty only for late payment of tax. It levies a 10 per cent rate of interest on outstanding tax due. However, this section dates such interest to the time when the tax return is due rather than to the date when tax becomes payable, as is the case with section 207. This, of course, is an area in which the misdemeanour is relatively minor. It is late payment of tax , not an attempt to avoid taxation and to defraud the Commissioner of Taxation in some way. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to the Opposition that the 10 per cent penalty is ludicrously low and is in need of substantial change. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his second reading speech gave no reason for the imposition of such a low penalty. In fact, the Treasurer seemed to say: 'What a great idea this penalty is because it will be so effective'. In his second reading speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA> An important feature of the new provisions is that, subject to powers of remission, a statutory penalty will be imposed, equal to 10 per cent per annum of the tax becoming payable by virtue of the revised provisions. Without that, taxpayers who engage in profit shifting to reduce their Australian tax liabilities, would have the odds to nothing when they engaged in such arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest the reality is that with the low 10 per cent penalty which is provided the taxpayers engaged in these sorts of operations will still have the odds to almost nothing. There will still be a real financial incentive for them to undertake tax avoidance activity of a transfer pricing nature. If they are caught the penalty will not be one which will make the activity unprofitable. They will still be in front because, as I said, they will have been able to use that money in a way which would get them a return well above the 10 per cent penalty. The Opposition thinks that this clause is quite deficient in providing only a 10 per cent penalty. The Treasurer has given no reason for picking such a low figure. He seems to the Opposition to have quite unwisely stated the belief that this will be a very effective penalty when in fact there is no reason to believe that will be so. Indeed, there is great reason to believe the opposite- that this will be a very ineffective penalty. That is why I have moved these amendments to clause 23 to increase the penalty from 10 per cent to 200 per cent . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a number of reasonable and constructive observations on transfer pricing and penalties. On the question of recovery, to get the proper level of tax in this area experts are basically and badly needed if we are to minimise the revenue loss. There are a number of excellent observations and recommendations are contained in the report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development dealing with transfer pricing by multinational corporations in 1978. One of the series of recommendations concerns the need for a task force. I should like to quote from paragraphs 17, 41 and 42. Paragraph 17 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear from what has been said that, up to the present, control efforts have been largely sporadic and also incomplete in that only certain aspects have been investigated. With the increased concern of governments generally about the possible adverse effects of the activities of transnational corporations on home and host countries, it is inevitable that the question of transfer pricing will receive increasing attention . . . it seems desirable that governments should take a new look at the issue, in particular from the point of view of restrictive business practices, tax and customs revenues. Some co-ordination of the efforts of these authorities may well be necessary if control is to be effective and complete. Moreover, special training of officials to handle these aspects may be required, in particular in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Will the Minister ask the bureaucrats behind him the number of people allocated in the Australian Taxation Office on this segment? Paragraph 41 states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . corporations must take into account the extent of governmental controls and, in particular, the extent to which manipulated transfer prices will be detected. A number of governmental authorities can be involved, such as those concerned with Customs, taxes, restrictive business practices and exchange control. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 42 states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Customs supervision has been essentially aimed at detecting the underpricing of imports . . . Tax supervision has been essentially directed at low levels of declared profits . . . overpricing of imports and/or underpricing of exports. Certain restrictive business practice authorities have looked at the question of the overpricing of imports and overpayment for research and administrative expenditures as an abuse of market power resulting in retail prices for the goods in question that are higher than can be justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Two in-depth inquiries have been undertaken in Papua New Guinea, because that country has suffered savagely from transfer pricing. I quote from the conclusions of the final report:</PARA>
<PARA> Transfer pricing manipulations do not usually excite political or popular reactions because they are generally not visible. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to set out the problem as it affects Papua New Guinea:</PARA>
<PARA> The individual action taken and proposed in the fisheries and forestry sectors is to be commended. However there remains the need for co-ordinated and practically orientated investigations into areas where transfer pricing manipulations are suspected and which are beyond an individual government agency 's resources and expertise. This need can be met by the establishment of a task force in the Office of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what is recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> During discussions held by the Law Reform Commission with relevant government agencies and individuals recently, considerable support was expressed for the idea of establishing a task force as one of the ways of tackling the transfer pricing problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It envisages the appointment of a small number of permanent ''core'' staff to a task force located in government, who with appropriate government officers and consultants would conduct specialised investigations into areas where transfer pricing manipulations are suspected. Nearly all the agencies consulted on the proposal immediately suggested specific areas on which they would welcome assistance. These ranged from the investigation of certain freight, fuel, capital equipment and bulk supply contracts to the validity of particular management services, consultancy fees, loan arrangements and licensing of technology. The opportunity for such a task force to provide an overall co- ordinating role was also stressed. It could provide government agencies with early warning of changes in the methods and areas of transfer pricing manipulation, particularly after the more obvious forms have been brought under control. Additionally, it could be the natural focus for liaison with international agencies and other governments concerned with transfer pricing manipulation by transnational corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Lack of information is the fundamental handicap of revenue authorities in trying to counter transfer pricing arrangements. Even such information as is held by government would be unco-ordinated. It is not brought together, analysed or compared, in my experience. Information would be held by the Reserve Bank, Customs, trade and companies officers and the Australian Taxation Office. As I have stated, the lack of co-operation and consequently co-ordination, seem to be in part a result of tax secrecy provisions and the insularity that they breed. Also, co-ordinating, regrettably, is what bureaucrats are worst at doing. The task force is one technique to help to overcome this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Transnational corporations hold all the cards in efforts to outwit taxation authorities. I think that we would all accept that. In reducing the taxable profit in Australia, any tactic can be adopted which reduces earnings or increases costs. It is a hopeless task to prevent padding of every item on the costs side and shavings on the earnings side. Costs which might be padded are as varied as shipping costs, sale of know-how and service costs. The intangible items are especially difficult to cost accurately. In practice, all the taxing authorities can do is to concentrate on the most blatant cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The task of getting information is made more difficult because much relevant information will be held outside Australia. Tax information arrangements between governments should be entered into as widely as the double taxation agreements are. The information holdings of the Government are inadequate. For example, it cannot say with certainty what companies are overseas owned and/or controlled-as section 136 assumes that it can. Nominee companies allow real shareholders anonymity. One thing for which I have fought in this House is adequate and proper disclosure. One cannot get the Government to move on that matter, and one is not likely to do so. Nominee companies allow real shareholders to hide behind a facade. Legislation could be introduced requiring declaration to governments of beneficial ownerships of the shares held by nominee companies. </PARA>
<PARA> One advantage, perhaps, of a resource rent in place of income tax is that it is not susceptible to the ravages of transfer pricing-although I could be wrong about that. Transfer pricing is engaged in by importers, particularly oil companies, as well as by exporters, including exporters of goods other than minerals. However, the Papua New Guinea paper suggests that it is most seriously a problem with resource products, particularly aluminium. All that I am suggesting is that in addition to the armoury that we have given to the Australian Taxation Office, the Papua New Guinea suggestion ought to commend itself and ought to be considered. We ought to set up a task force to strengthen the Office and the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer briefly to the amendments to clause 23 moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). Quite clearly, the issue of penalties ought to be addressed within the context of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which contains the general provisions on tax avoidance. It is quite extraordinary that here, when we are dealing specifically with the issue of transfer pricing and the Government's proposals to amend section 136 to deal with that reality, having updated and improved that section in a way that members on this side of the chamber regard, I think, as satisfactory, when the crunch comes and we look at the clauses that deal with penalties we find that the penalties being applied appear to be quite nominal when compared with penalties which apply in relation to breaches of Part IVA. I think that indicates something of the inconsistency which is quite apparent and which is quite marked with respect to this Government's attitude to tax avoidance in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst the Government claims to be very serious in its efforts to do something about tax avoidance, it is not prepared to move in terms of retrospectivity. That point was canvassed in relation to an earlier amendment. If it were prepared to take on the question of retrospectivity it could, as has been assured by many authorities, in one stroke, wipe out many of the paper schemes that have been devised and continue to be devised as the Government continues to amend the income tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with a situation in which we are confronted with problems associated with the very largest multinationals, the transnational corporations which operate on a highly sophisticated scale. It would take a great deal of investigation to establish that in fact transfer pricing was in fact occurring and that the practices were not in conformity with the amendments to the legislation in Division 13 that we have been discussing. Even at that point we find the Government is not prepared to take the next step. Quite clearly the next step is to make it clear to companies that where they are found to be in breach of this legislation they will be subject to quite severe penalties. I think this indicates a lack of will and a lack of determination on the part of this Government to get to the root of tax avoidance issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with these kinds of corporations I think it is necessary for governments to indicate that they are prepared to act very strongly. After all, these corporations are extremely powerful, perhaps as powerful as governments. I think it was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) who mentioned in passing a number of major Japanese conglomerates. Only the other night I met the director of a group of Japanese companies that have a turnover, I was informed, of $50 billion a year, which is a very much larger turnover than that of the Australian Government. So one is dealing with extremely powerful organisations with very great resources. What the Government is in fact saying is that even when we find that these very large organisations are in breach of this legislation the penalties will not be very significant. I think that indicates an unwillingness on the part of the Government to place itself in a position in which it in any sense appears to be either threatening to take or is taking a strong position in relation to very large corporations even when it is quite clear-and I think it has been demonstrated in several of the examples that have been mentioned tonight-that the cost to the Australian people of practices such as transfer pricing practices can be quite enormous. We are talking about cases in which millions of dollars, perhaps tens of millions of dollars, can be lost in terms of taxation. Yet we find that the Government is not prepared, even in those sorts of cases, to impose penalties which are commensurate with the situation which might well apply. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is very unfortunate, particularly in view of the very positive attitude that I think people generally in this place have taken to this legislation. One wonders, even at this stage whether the Government might have another look at the question of penalties to see whether it is possible to accept the amendments that have been suggested by the honourable member for Gellibrand, which simply try to introduce some consistency into the legislation. I think a number of members have made the point that the Act is now extremely complex and that the tendency is to make it more and more complex. One would have thought that one of the things that companies which may not be particularly enthusiastic about this legislation would at least like is general consistency. Even though they would not particularly like to have to face the sorts of penalties which are covered in Part IVA and which we are suggesting ought to be represented in this clause, at least it would suggest some level of consistency. So we are not dealing in this aspect of legislation with small business but we are really dealing with the very largest corporations which are involved in considerable risk-taking and which are investing in this country and in other countries in our regions tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in particular projects. As they are dealing with very large amounts of money indeed they have considerable power with governments. On the one hand the Government ought to be suggesting that where people are not prepared to conform to what we regard as good practice in terms of Australian interests, where they are attempting to get around our taxation laws-avoid our taxation laws-they ought to recognise and they ought to know that a very severe risk is involved. All these amendments try to do is to suggest those things and to impose a penalty which is commensurate with penalties in the other sections of the Act and commensurate with the scale of the kinds of activities that are involved when transfer pricing is the issue. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government is not prepared to accept the amendments that have been moved by the Opposition. The level of the proposed penalty under revised Division 13-10 per cent per annum of, in broad terms, the amount by which the tax would have been reduced by the profit shifting arrangements-is considered by the Government an appropriate deterrent to such arrangements. It is equal to the penalty that would have been payable if the profit shifting arrangements had not been entered into but the tax concerned had not been paid until the date the assessment was made under the revised Division. It is equal to the level of penalty above which a board of review may review penalties otherwise payable. The penalty that would be payable under the amendments to this clause moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis)-double the amount of the reduction in tax that would have resulted from the profit shifting arrangements-is equal to that payable under Part IVA in the blatant avoidance arrangements to which the Part is directed. The profit shifting arrangements to which the revised Division 13 will apply are not regarded as being in that category. The Government will, of course , be keeping the level of penalty of the revised Division 13 under review and if it appears that it is not acting as an adequate deterrent to profit shifting arrangements the Government will not hesitate to take the appropriate action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Loan Bill 1982 is a conventional subterfuge to allow the Commonwealth to avoid obtaining approval for its borrowing through the Australian Loan Council. The financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States covers all borrowing by the Commonwealth and the States except Commonwealth borrowing for defence. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) habitually uses this exemption each year to obtain parliamentary authorisation for government borrowing without first going to the Loan Council. The Loan Bill authorises the Commonwealth to borrow and expend money for defence purposes even though the borrowing approval is sought principally because of increases in other spending and a shortfall in expected taxation receipts. However, Treasurers of both parties have used this convoluted arrangement for many years so there is no point in making a big issue of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Loan Bill has been brought in very late in the financial year; it is normally introduced at Budget time to allow for the borrowing of funds required to cover part of any deficit. During 1981-82 expenditure increased significantly above the level appropriated as a result of the Budget and tax receipts have been below expectations. Therefore borrowing approval has been sought late in the financial year to make up part of the shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA> I use the opportunity of speaking on this Bill to make some more general observations, not only on the issue of government borrowings but also on the general fiscal and economic policy that has been pursued by the Government. In passing I refer to the need, as I understand it, for debate not only within the party room of the Government but also within other parties and indeed within the community about an alternative economic policy. Of course there has clearly been a difference between the Government's position and that of the Opposition with respect to fiscal policy. We argue at this point, as we have argued during the life of this Government, that a more stimulating fiscal policy is necessary and is what Australia needs at present. We believe that the preoccupation with a deficit of successive governments under the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is a pre-occupation which has not a great deal of meaning in economic terms. For example, I think it has argued for a number of years by the Prime Minister that there is a relationship between the size of the deficit and the level of inflation. If one looks at what has happened under the Government we see that no necessary relationship exists between the two; that is, that irrespective of the scale of deficit, relatively high inflation has continued. This year, in which the Government set out to achieve a balanced domestic budget -although, of course, it will not achieve that-we have significantly high inflation and certainly, I am sure, much higher than the Government desires. </PARA>
<PARA> But more seriously the Government is now confronted with a situation in which the economy is deeply recessed. We are talking about the situation in which many of the signs indicate the depth of the current recession which, quite rightly I think, ought to be understood as not simply a recession within this country but a recession in an international context. One could argue that in the circumstances-I think the Opposition has consistently argued this-we ought to be using a fiscal and monetary policy in a counter-cyclical way; that is, in the current circumstances we ought to be doing what the Japanese Government is seeking to do. At a time when Japan is finding it difficult to sell its products overseas because international trade is depressed the Government is seeking to boost its domestic expenditure, to get domestic construction programs underway and generally to ensure that at least domestically enough activity is generated in the economy to provide higher levels of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I go on to refer briefly to some of the differences that exist particularly within the Liberal Party, because that is where I understand some debate has taken place. In my view it is rather sad that it has taken a leadership challenge by a challenger without any specific ideas and proposals finally to persuade the Liberal Party that at least there may be serious questions to be asked about the Government's economic policy. Of course, one cannot believe that there will be any significant changes in the thrust of Government policy as a result of these discussions. If one relies on Press reports the debate seems to be largely between those who would pursue even more draconian and restrictive policies and those who want more of the same, perhaps spiced with a little more humanity in the form of tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> However, all the evidence would suggest to me that a much more dramatic reappraisal is necessary in terms of the Government's economic policy and perhaps a fundamental change of direction. Cosmetic changes will not be enough to free us from the malaise which is a legacy of past mistakes, compounded by a very difficult international economic situation. It is easy to point to the evidence of the Government's failure. After all, we were promised a great deal; lower inflation, lower interest rates, jobs for all who wanted to work, a revival of Australia's key industries, higher growth rates and ever expanding export markets for our resource wealth. Clearly the indicators are not good on any of these points and it is not difficult for the Opposition, given the litany of broken promises, which is the record of this Government, to raise these matters as debating points and to establish that the economy and indeed society are facing a number of serious and intractable problems. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Government's record, which in my view is on the whole a pretty sorry record, it would seem to me that a number of lessons should be learnt if we are to move to what is needed, that is, a new economic policy. Firstly, one can argue, on the basis of experience in this country and to some extent with reference to overseas developments, that monetarism is effectively dead as the basis of successful economic policy. For nearly seven years now we have had policies with restrictions on the money supplied as their essential tenet. The reality is that this experiment has failed in Australia, just as it has failed in Britain and as it is in the process of failing in the United States. Each of these countries faces not only higher levels of inflation but also extremely cruel levels of unemployment. It would seem to me that any development of a new or alternative economic policy in Australia would need to approach the question of the money supply much more flexibly, recognising that unemployment is as serious a scourge on society as inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second lesson that should have been learnt during the last few years is that what is required in Australia or in any economy is some balance between the needs of different sectors of the economy as well as between the domestic and export sectors. This is fairly relevant to the Bill before us and to the question of Loan Council borrowings. Less than two years ago the Government was promising a massive boom in resource industries. The sky was the limit. Prospects, listed with zillions of dollars, were going to lift the Australian economy to unprecedented levels. Now, in the context of the current international recession, many of the projects listed have been cancelled and the boom has largely dissipated, if it was ever really there. The point that I wish to stress is that a more internationally integrated economy, so strongly promoted by this Government, has risks associated with it as well as opportunities. In a period of recession, with the bottom falling out of international markets, too great a bias in the economy towards exports can lead to serious problems for the domestic economy made dependent on exports for income. A more integrated Australian economy would be, in my view, a much more dependent economy and one which will fluctuate much more seriously according to international circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia in the past few years particular store has been placed not so much on exports as a whole but on the development of mineral processing industries, capital and energy intensive in character and export orientated, which, it has been argued, will do much to lift growth rates and to produce higher levels of national income and which will succeed within a world which is hungry for energy and hungry for Australian minerals. Whilst in the longer term it may well be true that Australia has a great asset in terms of its mineral and energy resources, the reality is that inherently these resource industries have been cyclical in nature. For example, the aluminium industry-to which I referred before the suspension of the sitting in the context of another debate-has risen and fallen pretty much in line with international booms and recessions. That industry has been expanded very largely for export purposes. It was expanded on the basis of predicted levels of growth which would occur in the period between 1980 and 1985. We have dramatically increased capacity both in alumina refining and in smelting within this country and very large amounts of capital have been invested in both the private and public sectors. The success of that whole venture has depended on certain projections about growth rates in the demand for aluminium. Of course the reality has been that those growth rates simply have not occurred. The expected 4 per cent growth rate between 1980 and 1985 just has not materialised. In fact, we have had negative growth rates and now there are serious doubts as to whether the metal can be sold. In turn, that is resulting in agreements being made which perhaps raise some of the problems in regard to transfer pricing that were referred to in an earlier debate; that is that companies, rather than selling their metal on any sort of market, are entering into agreements. Such an agreement in the case of CRA Ltd involved the purchase of a Japanese company so that it could achieve entry into the Japanese market and secure long term prospects for selling its metal. </PARA>
<PARA> This reshaping of the economy around the so-called resource industries has occurred in a climate of certain expectations which quite clearly have not materialised, at least in the short term, in the way that either the Government or the corporate planners associated with these developments really expected. We put a lot of eggs in that particular basket. A lot of resources have been devoted in the case I mentioned. In the public sector, resources have been devoted to providing electricity very rapidly through accelerated electricity programs in various States. That, in itself, has created all sorts of problems. One can think back to the Premiers Conference in 1978. The Federal Government encouraged the States-it almost pleaded with them-to borrow much larger amounts of money under the special infrastructure loan programs so that they could get these power programs under way. The States responded to the offer of a more or less open cheque for loan funds from the Commonwealth and they got started on projects for a dramatic expansion of electricity generation, very largely for the aluminium and other energy intensive industries. Now we are in a situation where the markets are not materialising. Smelters are being slowed down and power stations have remained under construction. The whole capital priorities of the country were geared towards a program which was really based on expectations that perhaps were unreal right from the start. The problem to which I am referring is a product of believing that we can somehow move from one kind of economy and its particular structure to another in a very short time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think largely the initiative for this development did not come from the Government; it came from these large corporations that saw an opportunity to get a handle on Australian resources and to develop profitable businesses in relation to them. But-this brings me to the third major point that I want to make-the Government has inherent within it this very strong commitment to so- called private enterprise and to development occurring perhaps not in the interests of the Australian people as a whole but in the interests of the private sector on the understanding that somehow, if we encourage the private sector to do what it will, the benefits will filter down or will flow through to the Australian people. The experience of the last few years ought to be seen as a very salutary experience and, in terms of formulating an effective economic policy in the future, we ought to place much greater emphasis on the need for orderly and planned development of our human and physical resources as opposed to reliance on what I call the so-called market forces. It is at this point indeed that one can see most clearly the contradictions which are inherent in conservative economic philosophy and policy. There is no doubt that all sections of the Liberal Party eschew planning. We are told that this is not a matter in which governments should intervene in such a way as would restrict the freedom of choice of private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument ignores, of course, the fact that the commanding heights of the so -called private sector are themselves heavily into corporate planning and the minimisation of risk or, effectively, the elimination of free markets. If and when investments reach the scale of tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, corporations simply cannot afford to tolerate free competition which would place them too much at risk. The name of the game is risk minimisation in planning. As the choice is increasingly one between government planning and corporate planning, or between government planning and so-called free enterprise , it is not really a choice between government planning and free and open competition. </PARA>
<PARA> To examine any one of the major industries in this country is but to make that point crystal clear. If we consider such basic, nationally important industries as those which produce steel, chemicals or paper products, aluminium or motor vehicles we see that they do not represent a private enterprise free market situation. A small number of very powerful firms between them control the total market in Australia. In some cases, a single firm can meet the total demand for its product in Australia. For example, in my electorate Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd has a plant which would, as far as many classes of paper and paper board are concerned, produce the total output of the country. Any supposed competition with APM in the areas in which it specialised would be quite illusory; it would not be significant. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past few years, under this so-called free enterprise Government, we have seen changes that are inherent in allowing the corporate sector unfettered power to plan. It would appear that the corporate sector, with all the knowledge that is at its disposal, has failed to anticipate the depth of the current recession, even in cyclical industries such as the aluminium industry. The result has been that it has encouraged too rapid development, which is likely to mean idle or under-utilised capital in both the public and the private sectors. The combination of tight monetary policies and the immense demand on capital has meant a squeeze on capital spending across the board, so that the standard of living and access to services by people has been restricted while a few major projects have gone ahead, though even they may not be economic for a few years. </PARA>
<PARA> To cite an obvious example, under this Government interest rates have increased by some 4 per cent in two years and housing interest rates have gone through the roof. This means that, as a result of government policy, the funds available for housing, as one form of social purpose, have been tightly restricted in order to make money available for capital works in other areas of the economy. Thus corporate planners have determined not only private sector priorities but also public sector priorities, with what can only be regarded as disastrous results. Careful planning by government could have allowed development in capital energy- intensive industries, without distorting public sector priorities or producing, as a consequence, very high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the issue of employment. An alternative economic policy must seek to redefine objectives. Since 1975 there has been a central and overriding preoccupation with inflation. The promise that inflation would be kept to manageable levels has not been fulfilled. Yet, alongside very high levels of inflation, we have maintained a very large and still growing pool of unemployment. For 30 years prior to 1975 full employment had been the fundamental objective of economic policy. The suffering imposed on the unemployed in our society is extreme and unacceptable. We cannot hope to continue on the present course without fundamentally dividing the nation and doing extreme damage to tens of thousands of lives. Therefore, in my view we need to restore the historical emphasis on full employment and to regard the past few years as an aberration. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue that in the short term this involves reorienting public sector expenditure to ensure that it does not, in fact, encourage further unemployment. More positively, the contribution to employment ought to be an important criterion for public sector expenditure. In other words, I believe that the emphasis on employment ought not to be a matter which is of concern to only one ministry called, say, the ministry of employment, but rather, should enjoy a fundamental priority which will cut across all public sector spending. Therefore , one ought to be budgeting for full employment and ensuring that all programs are examined in terms of their implications for employment. The present Government, while cutting back on capital works in the area of social infrastructure, has been prepared to encourage capital works in areas which suit the corporate planning sector. It has not sought to direct capital spending to those areas of the economy which will provide employment and also assist in the creation of a more efficient economy overall. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, we need to work towards an alternative model of economic development which recognises the key role of the public sector in determining overall investment priorities. This was, after all, the thrust of the policies pursued by Chifley in the post-war reconstruction period. The Government sought to spell out its priorities for economic and social development on the basis of what was believed to be a consensus in the community as to what those priorities were. Clearly, in the present situation people are seeking social and economic security which implies both full employment and reduced inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting for a moment that a government ought to be seeking to restore full employment without at the same time seeking to deal with problems of inflation. I accept, as a number of my colleagues have argued, that a prices and incomes policy is quite crucial with respect to inflation. Indeed, one wonders about a government that has placed so much emphasis on fighting inflation-with fighting inflation first as its highest priority-yet has failed to develop a coherent wages policy and, indeed, is now in a position in which it is unable significantly to influence wages policy in this country. That is to take one side of an incomes and prices policy and to overlook for a moment the fact that this is the Government that not only emasculated the Prices Justification Tribunal but finally, last year, decided as a part of the razor gang exercise to eliminate it altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government was concerned with achieving some kind of fairness in terms of the distribution of shares within this community, with getting some kind of agreement about social priorities, if it was convinced that a large section of the community believed that inflation had to be fought with all the weapons that could be mustered one would have thought that it not only would have retained something like the Prices Justification Tribunal, but would have sought to beef it up. But, of course, this Government is not a government that is about fairness, not a government that is about trying to develop the economy in the interests of all Australians, if I may use that hackneyed phrase. What this Government has been about is essentially restructuring the Australian economy to suit the interests of those people who are prepared to put most money into the party coffers and who are prepared to provide the most muscle in terms of defending the Government and keeping it in office. The Government has essentially been a government for the corporate sector in a way which is quite divorced from social priorities and social realities. </PARA>
<PARA> I would argue that if we were concerned, which this Government clearly is not, about achieving security for people we would require more and not less public intervention. We would require planning and not pseudo-market forces. We would not talk about market forces when we really mean allowing very large corporations to have a free hand without our putting any restrictions on them, regulating their activities or whatever. We would require priorities for public sector spending which emphasise full employment and which set the appropriate climate for the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, under Mr Fraser, in my view is the first government in the post-war period-one can exclude other Liberal governments in the post-war period -to have seen the interests of the public sector and the private sector as antithetical. The Government believes that there can be a healthy private sector only if it destroys, emasculates or attacks the public sector. In many respects this Government is at war with society. It seeks to confront, browbeat and bully . Meanwhile its ideology is in tatters because it is the victim of its own propaganda. All the indicators-inflation, unemployment, interest rates and growth rates-are there to prove the Government's failure. However, the most tragic aspect is not the statistics. It is the people who suffer when governments are not only insensitive but also, more seriously, wrong. This Government, in terms of the thrust of its economic policy, has been both insensitive and wrong. It is the latter aspect which I think is the most serious . That is why there ought to be genuine debate in the Parliament about future directions of economic policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this legislation the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) is drawing the curtain on a fundamental aspect of the funding of government schools in this country. This will be the last time that this Government maintains the value of the grants it promised to the States in terms of supporting the costs in government schools. It has been the practice for some time-ever since the Schools Commission programs were commenced-to decide on the level of grants and to supplement them in the following year to take account of cost increases which, in fact, reduce the value of those grants for the earlier year. The legislation before us tonight is designed to supplement the grants for 1981 to take account of cost increases which occurred during that year. Most, if not all, of those cost increases were the result of wage and salary increases. Those costs could not have been avoided by State governments and State systems. The levels of salaries and wages are set almost universally by special tribunals or the normal arbitral processes and, therefore, the State systems have no way of avoiding the consequences of wage and salary increases. Therefore, it has been the practice until now that the State governments have been compensated for the increases that occur in any year. That is a way in which the Commonwealth can retain the purchasing power of its promised grants to the States in support of government systems. So what this change represents is an abandonment of that practice-a practice which has been going ever since the Schools Commission programs started. It represents yet another of the many body blows that this Minister has dealt to education throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has said that as from this year, 1982, it will be building into its grants to the States a component for anticipated price movements. We already know that the Government's intended practice is defective. We know that the Government's estimates of anticipated price movements were already out of date before the legislation making available those grants passed through this House late last year. We know that because the Government decided on the level of grants in about June of last year. That was well before its official estimate of the inflation rate for 1981-82 was available in the Budget Papers. Therefore, I had a table prepared by the Parliamentary Library to indicate the difference between the actual grants based on the inflation rate which was probably used at the time of determining those grants in June and what those grants would have been had the proper estimate of inflation incorporated in the Budget Papers been used. I now seek leave to have that table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. This table indicates that as a result of that defect in the system schools throughout Australia will be shortchanged to the extent of about $14.3m in 1982. We are not absolutely sure that this is correct because the Government never came clean and informed us on what basis it made the calculations for anticipated price increases. I pursued the Minister on this matter during an Estimates committee hearing last year but he declined to indicate the basis on which those calculations were made. All we can assume is that the inflation rate which was operating at the time the level of those grants was set formed the basis of the build-in prospective allowance for cost increases and should that have not been the actual inflation rate for 1982 schools would be shortchanged to that extent. I suggest that schools will be shortchanged in the order of at least $14.3m in this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we are really debating tonight is the end-the abandonment-of a very important procedure in relation to the funding of schools which did guarantee that State governments received the purchasing power of the grants which were promised to them by the Commonwealth at the time those grants were announced. The Government has said that it is in the interest of improving the administrative efficiency of the procedure to make this change. It says that it is cumbersome and awkward to have to adjust the level of the grants in Parliament once the cost increases are known, after the event. It says that involves more legislation, more time of the House and so forth, so it has designed this streamlined mechanism whereby it can build in what it reckons is an amount adequate to cover forthcoming cost increases. But what we now know, as a result of the defects which have been exposed in this system, is that in fact what this change really means is that there will be an additional reduction in the amount of funds available, particularly to government schools, but also in a roundabout way to non-government schools. That is the serious problem which is being confronted by State government schools throughout Australia. It is occurring at a time when State governments are already experiencing problems in relation to the funding of their schools. I will quote from the document which we are also debating tonight, the Schools Commission Recommendations for 1983. Page 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA> All State Governments are experiencing difficulties in providing the recurrent resources required to maintain standards in and services to government schools. Between the 1980/81 and 1981/82 financial years, all States at least maintained the real value of their own recurrent expenditure on government schools. The Australia-wide average real increase was approximately 3.0 per cent. Despite, this, and a slight decline in government school enrolments between 1980 and 1981 . . . there has been a slippage in student-teacher ratios in some States and reductions in the provisions for ancilliary and specialist staff. </PARA>
<PARA>What this means is that not only are the funds made available from the Commonwealth slipping back but also State governments are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain from their own resources the level of funding necessary to maintain standards within their schools. That is why it makes it doubly important that the Government abandon this particular process, and return to the procedures for cost supplementation to ensure that this does not become another gradual encroachment on or another gradual reduction in the resources available to government schools. I quote another paragraph from the Schools Commission report. Paragraph 1.3 states:</PARA>
<PARA> For those State systems, with static or declining enrolments, there appear to be relatively few short-termed savings if standards are to be maintained. The major enrolment downturns that will occur by the middle of the 1980's, particularly at the secondary level, may enable some resources to be freed for redeployment if governments decide simply to maintain present standards. However , the dislocatory effects and diseconomies of enrolment decline should not be underestimated. The evidence before the Commission is that present enrolment declines which are mainly at the primary level do not produce swift or automatic savings and may indeed, in the absence of actual school closures, produce higher costs associated with the need to maintain uneconomic class sizes and to phase in the application of staffing formulae which dictate redeployment. They also result in higher per student maintenance costs and more expensive support services. The diseconomies associated with maintaining the standard of educational services to rural areas in the face of a shrinking rural population are long-standing examples of this problem. Diseconomies in large areas of urban schooling-for example, Sydney's eastern suburbs-are a more recent phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA>What that paragraph does is to blow apart the Government's argument in support of reductions of funds for government systems. What the Minister has been telling us for more than a year is that the declining enrolments in the government systems, which have been rather marginal and maybe illusory, are a justification for reducing the level of funding for government systems. Now, in fact, the Government is being told by the Schools Commission that the Schools Commission can foresee no savings and, indeed, it suspects that there will be actual increases in costs as a result of enrolment declines because of the patchy, lumpy way in which those enrolment declines have occurred. They do not occur in a way which allows schools simply to reduce all school costs by a standard percentage. They occur in a way which may prevent any economies and, indeed, in some circumstances, may force higher per pupil costs on State government systems. That is a very serious revelation on the part of the Schools Commission, because, as I say, it really gives the lie to what the Government's chief argument has been in terms of reductions in the real level of resources to government schools which have occurred in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> According to page 30 of the report, in the years from 1976 until 1983-that is, if the Schools Commission's recommendations for 1983 are adopted-there will have been a 10 per cent reduction in real terms in funds for government schools at a time when, if these recommendations are accepted, there will have been an increase of nearly 78 per cent in real terms in funds available for non- government schools. That represents an extraordinarily serious shift, in terms of resources, away from the government system towards the non-government system. The Government has really failed to address the very serious consequences of that policy. It has failed to heed the advice of the Commission on numerous occasions in relation to the locked-in nature of the transfers from government to non-government schools which are inherent in this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first instance, subsidies for non-government schools are based on a percentage of standard government school costs; that is, once the standard government school cost has been determined, a certain percentage is applied and a dollar figure ascertained and becomes the level of per capita dollar subsidy for students in the different levels in non-government schools. As the costs have been increasing in government schools, obviously the subsidies to non- government schools have also been increasing as a result of the calculation of the subsidies on that basis. Of course, this has been exacerbated by the slight but nevertheless real decline in government school enrolments which has forced up, as the Schools Commission reveals in its report, the cost in government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> There we have two factors which have been pushing up the subsidies to non- government schools. In adition to those increases, the Government has been adjusting the percentage level of the subsidy. Briefly, what I am saying is that the Government's policy has within it locked-in transfers from the government to the non-government system unless the Government has been prepared to maintain a growing level of funding for schools as a whole. But the Government has not done that; there has been an automatic accelerator in the overall funds going to non- government systems. In circumstances where the overall budget for schools has not been increasing, the consequence has been a quite savage decline, of the order of 10 per cent in real terms, in the amount of funds going to the government system. What this has meant in terms of the shares of Commonwealth funds going to schools is that, whereas in the last Labor Budget 64 per cent of Federal funds went to government schools, this year the proportion has fallen to 49 per cent. Even if the Schools Commission's recommendations for 1983 are adopted, it will fall a further percentage point to 48 per cent next year. That is a very substantial decline in the share of funds going from the Commonwealth to Government schools in which-this is still the case, and I suspect it has always been the case-75 per cent of this country's school age children are enrolled. So the Government's policies have resulted in a very substantial neglect in relation to government schools at a time, as has been revealed by the Schools Commission, when State governments themselves are finding it increasingly difficult to find the necessary funds from their own resources to make up the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government always said, or has been saying in recent times, that its justification for reducing funds to government schools has been because of the achievement of the so-called Karmel targets. It is true that the targets recommended by the Karmel report in 1973 have been reached. Therefore, the Fraser Government appears to believe that its obligation to be concerned about education resources for government schools has now ended. We have to remember and be clear in our minds that the Karmel targets were specifically designed towards 'overcoming within a reasonable period the worst schooling deficiences'. There was not a statement about the desirable level of resources which would guarantee Australian children an adequate educational opportunity. The achievement of the Karmel targets by government schools has occurred in an era of contracting Commonwealth support only because the State governments have been able to find within their own resources the ability to provide extra resources to their own schools. The reason for that has been the very generous funding arrangements which the Whitlam Government instituted in relation to general tax reimbursements for the states. With the disappearance of the Whitlam guarantee the Fraser Government has now been able to exert a sort of fiscal pressure on State governments to ensure that they no longer have the ability to provide the resources necessary to maintain the level of resources within their schools, and that has the exacerbating effect of reducing Commonwealth funding in this area as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is true that conditions in government schools have improved greatly since the disastrous conditions which prevailed prior to the election of the Labor Government in 1972. The efforts that have been made by the Commonwealth, both in terms of direct grants and in terms of providing additional general funds for the States, have been very important in overcoming those problems. But that is not to say that the improvements have been sufficient or that we can rest on the achievements that have been made to date. We have to make certain that there is a reassessment of the necessary resource levels in government schools to ensure that there is adequate educational opportunity, indeed an equal opportunity, for all Australian children. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the failure of this Government to accept the sorts of resource standards which the Schools Commission has been urging on it which has really led us to the problem we are now in. Unless the Commonwealth government is prepared to accept a level of resources necessary for the maintenance and, indeed, achievement of educational opportunity within Australia we will simply have a continuation of the process which has been occurring in recent years of a continuing drift of Commonwealth funds in particular away from the government school system. Therefore 75 per cent of the kids enrolled in schools in this country will be disadvantaged to that extent. </PARA>
<PARA> The very least the Government can do is accept the recommendations for 1983 set out in the Schools Commission report. The report reveals the very expensive nature of the Government's pre-election undertakings in terms of funding of non- government schools. The adjustments to the subsidy levels for non-government schools will cost an additional $19m for 1983 and the overall continuing commitment to non-government schools is estimated to be an additional $31m. The Schools Commission says, as a sort of sop to the government sector, that there ought to be a $5m increase to support government schools at a time of dislocations which have been caused by declining enrolments in some States and rapidly escalating enrolments in some others. </PARA>
<PARA> The Schools Commission report really is a very depressing document in terms of trying to achieve improved standards within Australian schools. Let me give you just one example. Earlier last year the Schools Commission suggested that there should be a school improvement program which it said would involve $15m in 1982, $20m in 1983 and $30m in 1984. That program was designed to respond to the needs of particular communities to improve schools in ways which were appropriate to the needs of those schools and the needs of the communities which they serve. The Government refused to implement or to embrace that program. Now the Schools Commission, in an almost pathetic way, has suggested to the Government that in 1983 it provide $2.4m instead of the $20m that should have been spent in that year for a pilot school improvement program. That is the level to which education in this country has been reduced. That is the measure of this Government's lack of concern for standards, particularly within government schools, and the Government stands condemned on that basis. </PARA>

In the first place he claimed that a paragraph from the Commonwealth Schools Commission recommendations for 1983 totally destroyed the Government's case, which, of course, is utter nonsense.

<PARA>in the absence of actual school closures, produce higher costs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words 'may indeed' because there is no assurance that in all instances what the honourable member for Fremantle was saying as a universal truth is in effect accurate. I nonetheless take the point that there may well be some instances where there are diseconomies. That is why I certainly hope that the Government will very sympathetically regard the recommendations by the Schools Commission to provide a 2 per cent increase in State school recurrent funding as an offset to the prospect of these diseconomies which may indeed, but do not necessarily, take place. So let us be very clear in establishing how effective the honourable member for Fremantle has been in claiming that the Government's strategy and argument have been totally destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal also with the question of slippage which is once again mentioned on page 1 of the Schools Commission report. To hear the honourable member for Fremantle talk one would think there has been some disastrous slippage in teacher-student ratios. That is in fact not so if one depends on the School Commission's recommendations as the authority on which one would base such an allegation. All the Commission says on page 1 of its report is that there has been a slippage in student-teacher ratios in some States. I stress the significance of the words 'in some States'. The inference from the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) was that because of this Government's policies there has been a slippage in teaching standards. Let us examine exactly what has happened. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which indicates the recurrent expenditure per student in Government school systems, States and Territories 1975-76 and 1979-80, which of course is the period of the present Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. This table demonstrates a couple of very significant things. It demonstrates, for example, that under the present Government, far from there being a general slippage, there has been a substantial increase in the recurrent expenditure per student in government schools. On average there is in fact a 19.6 per cent increase throughout Australia in recurrent expenditure per student in government schools in total. That is the total of all spending in government schools, Federal and State put together. But it is very significant. Not only has there been no overall and general slippage; there has also been a significant increase in the amount of government money spent on students in government schools. It is very significant to notice the difference between the States. It is convenient to note that in New South Wales, for example, in a period roughly covered by a State Labor Government, there has been the worst performance of any State Government in increasing the recurrent expenditure per student in government schools. It has risen by 12.9 per cent, for example, compared with Victoria's 23.5 per cent. In Victoria, which had a Liberal Government over that period, the Liberal Government took the view that there should be almost twice as fast an increase in recurrent expenditure per student as the State Labor Government in New South Wales determined. That seems to me to indicate fairly clearly the bunkum that we hear from the Labor Party about its strong commitment to recurrent funding of State schools and education. What arrant nonsense in view of what the figures clearly indicate. What I said related to primary schools. Let us have a look at the secondary schools system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) asked whether I have had a look at Victoria. Let us have a look at the difference in actual amounts being spent, if the honourable member for Burke wants to pursue that matter. In New South Wales in 1979-80 the recurrent expenditure per student was $1,290 in 1981 prices compared with the Victorian total of $1,472. That is about $180 per head more expenditure in Victoria than in New South Wales. That is a significant improvement over the New South Wales situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we turn to Western Australia we find a similar figure to that of Victoria-a 24.8 per cent increase in the recurrent expenditure per student in government primary schools compared with 12.9 per cent in New South Wales. Remembering that the States have control over their education systems, in some States there may well have been some slippage in recent times because of the deliberate and determined policies of those individual States, or should I refer just to that particular State of New South Wales which has a Labor government. Let us look at the secondary school situation. We will see that in New South Wales there has certainly been an increase in the amount of recurrent expenditure per person in secondary schools. But New South Wales still remains the second lowest State in the Commonwealth in terms of the per capita recurrent expenditure in the States schools secondary system. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me incredible that any member of the Opposition would get up and attack the Federal Government on alleged slippage when these statistics dramatise the fact that throughout the system the funds available to governments throughout Australia have enabled most State governments to have a significant increase. In the time that this Government has been in power even the State government in New South Wales has managed to increase overall the resources available to primary and secondary school children in the State system, even if it is not as much as that which is available throughout the whole of the State system. Nonetheless it is incredible to hear this kind of attack. I note that a similar attack is to be mounted by the Teachers Federation. I understand it is levying teachers $10 a head in order to spend half a million dollars on a propaganda campaign to disprove the fact that governmental funding of the State school system has been increasing significantly in the period which this Federal Government has been in power, as a combination of both direct and indirect funding through bulk grants to the States. This half a million dollars of teachers' money is to be spent trying to propagandise a situation in which the teachers themselves have been seeking to direct the great bulk of this increased money for education into the pockets of teachers rather than into the provision of facilities for schools. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see what has happened. Let us see how the State governments have responded to this increase in the volume of money available for education. We see that while there has been a total increase of 19.2 per cent in recurrent expenditure by government schools between 1975-76 and 1979-80, in fact there has been a 35 per cent fall in capital spending. Who has led that fall in capital spending? The State authorities, who have the major responsibility for the State school system, have reduced their capital spending by 36.2 per cent over that period. There is a reason for that. The reason is that the massive increases in enrolments which took place in previous times have now ceased to take place. There has not only been stagnation but also there has been a fall in new enrolments. So it can be argued that there is a reduction in the need for new capital spending. What intrigues me is that the State governments, having led this reduction in capital spending, are now suggesting that this is all the fault of the Federal Government in some remarkable way while at the same time they have been diverting, particularly in New South Wales, more and more money into the recurrent expenditure area, even to the extent of taking money that had been allocated by the Federal Government for capital spending and transferring it into the recurrent area in order to satisfy the insatiable demands of the Teachers Federation. It seems to me very important indeed that we recognise that the State school system has access to, and has been receiving, a massive increase in the total amount of government funds available, both directly from the Federal Government and through the system under which the Federal Government provides funding to the States. There has been a significant increase, even though in recent times there has been a decline in the number of students at State schools. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me quite reasonable that people in Australia should have the freedom of choice to decide whether their children should be educated at a State school or a non-State school. It seems to me eminently reasonable that every child in Australia should be entitled to a degree of assistance-not the school but the child. This is the system that the Schools Commission is recommending should be continued. I would suggest that it is ludicrous for honourable members opposite or anyone else in this community to say that what is happening is that money is being diverted away from the State school system into the non-State system when they look only at the direct Federal funding rather than the total of government funding which goes both directly from the Federal Government and indirectly from the Federal Government through the States into the state school system. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts clearly show that there has been a significant increase in the non- State system. The facts clearly demonstrate also that the non-State system has been massively disadvantaged in terms of resources compared with the State system. No one opposite can deny that. The non-State system operates at only something like 70 per cent of the resources available to the State system. To hear the continual attack that somehow the Federal Government is cheating by diverting money from the State system into the non-State system is incredible when the total amount available is never recognised, never accepted, never admitted by honourable members opposite. What is happening by sustaining the non -State system, what is happening by making certain that that system does not collapse, what is happening as a result of the Federal Government's assistance to that non-State system is that we have a non-State system under which, in effect, to educate a child costs the taxpayer roughtly half as much as it costs under the State system because the private sector-the parents and the churches- provides the other half of that education expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> By maintaining the non-State system, by keeping it alive, this Government is, in effect, saving the taxpayers many millions of dollars. If the non-State system did not exist the State system would have to pick up the whole bill, not only half the bill, for the education of about 20 per cent of young Australians. We have a system whereby 21 per cent of Australians are receiving in fact only about 11 per cent of the education money available to schools. For honourable members opposite to object to that and to say that 11 per cent is too much, that the non-State system should be allowed to fall apart, that it should not be entitled to receive its fair share and be allowed to survive, is a negative and disgraceful approach. I hope that the House will join with me in supporting the recommendations of the Commonwealth Schools Commission. I recommend them to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the great tragedies of six years of conservative government is the way in which the Commonwealth Schools Commission has moved away from the 1974 charter under which it was set up. Under this charter, the Schools Commission was responsible for reporting to the Federal Government on the overall standards and needs of both public and private schools and for making recommendations on government spending in both school systems. The Commission had the right to research independently the needs of both systems and then to submit its findings to the Government. The Government then had the responsibility to accept or reject all or part of the Commission's report. In 1978 the Government changed this by advising the Commission to allocate extra funds to non-government schools following, I might add, extravagant election promises. Since those guidelines also satisfied zero real growth requirements, it meant a transfer of about $14m from government to non-government schools. On that occasion however, as distinct from this year, the Commission recommended against this type of internal transfer and criticised the Government for its decision. The Commission stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Prescriptive guidelines not only pre-empt the nature of the Commission's advice but threaten the consultation and the decision making process by which competing needs and priorities within and between Government and non-Government sectors can be reconciled. </PARA>
<PARA>They were strong words from a commission which was determined at that time to fulfil its independent purpose. But the following year the Commission again was told how its funds were to be spent. In 1979 the then Chairman of the Schools Commission, Dr Ken McKinnon, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our role is to advise the Government-we assess the needs of schools and the Government makes its decisions in the light of that assessment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is perfectly proper, perfectly fair. This year we have again seen massive interference by the Government into the affairs of the Schools Commission. Again this is related to election promises. The credibility of the claim that the Commission is independent is at its lowest ebb. The report, once again, recommends a shift of funds away from government schools to non-government schools. For instance, it proposes a 7.7 per cent increase in non-government school recurrent funding. It also proposes a 2 per cent increase in government school recurrent funding, although the Commission itself acknowledges that costs will rise by 3 per cent. There is no recommended increase in the allocation to government school capital works. The Commission states that its funding recommendations are 'consistent with the needs of Australian schools'. I certainly challenge that statement. I point out strongly to the House that in 1979 the poorer non-government schools lagged behind both government and wealthier non-government schools in their funding, as they do now. Roman Catholic schools were functioning at a level of funding well below that of all other schools and the situation is deteriorating. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole basis of the idea of an independent schools commission was to ensure that the needs of the schools and the students were met in all systems. Honourable members on this side of the House welcomed the aid in case of need philosophy as fair and equitable. We saw no need to move away from that principle. The Commission in its recent report admits that government schools face very significant resource problems with serious cost pressures-salaries, superannuation and more secondary students relative to primary students at higher costs-and estimates that the cost of educating a student in a government school will rise by 3 per cent in real terms next year. The Commission also notes substantial deficiencies in existing government school buildings and notes that many students are being educated in sub-standard facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I, with other members of this House, am familiar with the needs of the schools in my electorate. I am aware of how desperate some of those needs are. However, the Commission did not recommend an increase in capital works grants. The recommended level is $6.3m below the 1981 level and an amazing $69.7m below the 1976 level, in constant price terms. The Commission makes this recommended level -no doubt at the instigation of this Government-conditional on the States maintaining their capital works allocations to schools at a level to be negotiated with the Commonwealth. This Government is aware, as the report admits , that the States have been handed a 10 per cent reduction in capital works moneys by the Government through the Australian Loan Council. The States' money is reduced by this Government, then the Government blames the States for their inability to finance capital works. As well, pupil-teacher ratios in half the government and catholic school systems in Australia have risen. Extra teachers are desperately needed in schools in my electorate. With a teacher shortage and rising class numbers we have also seen reductions in ancillary and specialist staff. The quality of service to students in government schools in all States has declined rapidly under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission specifically, and education in Australia generally, lost a great friend when this Government did not renew the appointment of Dr Ken McKinnon as Chairman of the Schools Commission. He believed that the Commission should be independent and he took a forthright stand on this. He gained and held the confidence of all parties involved in education. He was an educator who thought through issues and encouraged public debate on them. The following basic commitments have now been almost abandoned: Equality of opportunity as the fundamental principle governing school funding; concern to ensure minimum acceptable standards for all children in all schools; and the funding of schools on a needs basis. It is a disappointing report and one which obviously has been framed under pressure. The Commission should have adhered to its charter and then let the Government accept, reject or alter its recommendations. The Schools Commission should exercise its powers and fulfil the responsibilities given it under the Schools Commission Act. The Government should desist from the practice of issuing to the Schools Commission guidelines which are incompatible with the Schools Commission's independent function and reponsibilities under the Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want first to make a brief comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). He tried to use some shonky figures to prove that there has not been a reduction in real terms in education spending. But, at the same time, he admitted that there had been a substantial reduction in real terms in capital spending on education. He cannot have it both ways. The fact remains that in real terms education spending has been reduced. I will come back to this point a little later. Unfortunately, the Government seems to view the whole debate about funding education entirely in terms of a debate on statistics rather than in terms of a debate on what it is trying to achieve through funding education. If one looks at the education situation one can see that the Liberal-National Country Party Government has no coherent education philosophy. It has never formulated a philosophy about what it is trying to achieve in the area of education. When problems are brought before the Federal Minister for Education (Mr Fife) by teachers, parents and interested groups in the community he says: 'This is a problem for the States. We do not determine these things. It is entirely a matter for the States to determine. We just hand over the funds'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is just not good enough. The fact is that people who have spent a lifetime studying the problems of education are now saying that we face very serious problems in that sphere. They are not all problems of funding. That is part of the problem but there are others, such as structural problems, problems about standards and problems concerning special education, such as education for ethnic communities, and there are problems concerning remedial teaching. It is all these sorts of problems that the Federal Government seems to think are none of its business or responsibility because it just hands over the money to the States and leaves it at that. </PARA>
<PARA> That may be consistent with the so-called new federalism policy of the Government, but it is totally opposite to the Labor Party's approach. We believe that the Federal Government has a responsibility to lead, and that means that the Federal Minister for Education has a responsibility to lead in relation to State educational priorities. Let me comment on what a coherent educational philosophy should look like. The only statements that we have heard from this Government about educational philosophy have been made when it has tried to strong-arm schools and tertiary institutions into trying to make education almost exclusively vocation oriented. That is about the only attempt that the Government has made at a very narrow approach to educational philosophy. It has never articulated a coherent educational philosophy that takes account of what education should be about. </PARA>
<PARA> What should education be about? It should be about growth, growth in the individual so that he can become a citizen and develop his full potentialities. I should not have to say that to honourable members on the other side of the House. After all, they claim to be Liberals. These sorts of comments were made by the great liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill when he talked about the importance of education and the overall growth of the individual in the educational process. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this kind of growth involve? It involves things such as sustaining educational standards and ensuring that children can read and write, rather than having a situation in some schools, especially in disadvantaged areas, in which we find that kids can reach level 10 without being able to read a newspaper. Of course, the Federal Minister says: 'That is not my responsibility. That is the responsibility of the States'. The fact is that it is his responsibility, and he ought to adopt a better approach than that which he has taken. The consequences of the educational standards that we are achieving, especially among working class children, mean that those children do not have the same opportunities as many of the children of the upper class.</PARA>

I bet that the Minister has not even looked at the statistics. They have not changed in 20 years. The kids from working class backgrounds in, for example, the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne do not have their fair share of opportunities of getting through high school in such a way that they can enter universities, colleges of advanced education, technical and further education courses, and so forth. If the Minister thinks that he can confound that fact, let him produce the evidence from his advisers to confound it. It is a fact that has been supported by independent analysts time and again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other problems which show up in terms of regions. In the Broadmeadows area we have a large ethnic community. What has the Federal Government provided in terms of special grants for the teaching of migrant kids, teaching them English or assisting them to learn more of their native languages? The Minister has not provided any such programs, even though I know that representations have been made to him time and again. He simply wipes his hands of the matter and says: 'It is State schools. Therefore, it is not our responsibility'. But it is the Minister's responsibility, and it is time that he started recognising that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> What about remedial programs? How many kids reach form 4 or year 10 without being able to read? If they cannot, why does the Schools Commission not give more direct grants to schools in the State sector to assist in this matter? It is said that recurrent grants are being given to the States, so what is the problem. We are given averages. We are told about certain averages for New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and so forth, but the Government is not looking at the specificity of the problems. The fact is that in some areas perhaps certain government schools are doing very well. In other areas they are doing very badly. That is the situation that the Minister has not faced up to. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us now consider another aspect of this matter, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Macarthur; namely, capital expenditure. We are told that there is some reduction in the number of kids going into the State school sector , and therefore that this justifies a 36 per cent reduction in real terms in capital expenditure. What the honourable member presupposed was that somehow, when we began to get this reduction in school numbers, by that stage we would have achieved all the capital spending and capital works required in education and, therefore, we could expect some kind of reduction. The fact is that we were very much behind in our requirements in terms of capital spending. It took us 20 years to try to provide even the very basics in terms of capital spending. Then, as soon as there is some reduction in the numbers, we are told that there has to be a 36 per cent reduction in real terms. That is an absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Broadmeadows High School, for example, does not have a building for a library. Why was such a building not provided? It was not provided in the growth period, and now we have all these cutbacks so, again, it will not be provided. The Minister has not bothered to study the specifics of the situation and to look at the areas that are advantaged and those that are disadvantaged. There is another factor as well; namely, although some areas have had reductions in population growth, other areas have seen a substantial increase in their population growth and, therefore, in their need for schools. What does the Minister propose? Let us suppose that in one area there is a reduction in enrolment and in another area a growth in enrolment. Does the Minister propose to move the school, brick by brick, from one area to another? What does he propose? Surely there is a need to build a new school in the growth area. This is another example of the Government not looking at the specifics of the problem but talking in generalities and assuming that everything is okay. But in that kind of situation we must build a school in the growth area, and that does not mean that we should tear down the other school. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another factor. In Victoria most schools were built as temporary buildings. The Minister should look at them. They were supposed to have a life span of 25 years. Most of them have existed for longer than that. They have not been replaced and the Government has no funds to provide for those schools to be replaced with decent buildings which will last longer. The reductions in capital expenditure are outrageous. The Victorian Labor Government that has just been elected has promised to increase spending on capital works for education- contrary to what the honourable member for Macarthur said-and therefore to help the situation, which has become drastic. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member made the usual attack of the Liberals on the teachers. The fact is that the Victorian teachers were most concerned not so much about increases in their salaries and so on, rather to ensure that the new Labor Government's first priority would be spending on capital works and on the supply of facilities, such as libraries, science blocks and so on, in the education area. So let us not have any more of this--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I remind honourable members that the purpose of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill 1982 is to provide for the retrospective adjustment of programs administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission in 1981 for increases in the salary and wage components of recurrent grants. This provides a further appropriation to schools in the States and in the Northern Territory, in respect of the 1981 programs, of $3.7m. From 1982 the Government's policy is that cost adjustment procedures will be based on a prospective arrangement rather than the retrospective arrangements that have operated previously. Under the prospective arrangements an allowance is built into the grants which takes account of cost increases in all programs up to the beginning of the program year and also includes an allowance in respect of projected increases in the wage and salary components of recurrent grants during the program year. The prospective allowance for price level change is derived from estimates of movements in national economic indicators and in the light of factors affecting costs in education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate this evening has raised a number of more general issues in relation to Commonwealth funding of schools in anticipation of the Government's guidelines for schools programs in 1983. Attention has also been drawn to the report of the Commonwealth Schools Commission on recommendations for 1983 which I tabled in this house on 11 March. That report demonstrates that the Commission continues to be the Government's principal source of independent advice on the needs of schools. I emphasise that the Commission is the Government's principal source of independent advice on the needs of schools. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) reflected upon the Schools Commission. She indicated that in her view it was no longer independent and that the charter had been changed. I want to emphasise that the Commission works under the same charter as it operated under when it was first established. Reference was also made to the fact that this Government issues financial guidelines to the Commission. I want to say that we follow in the footsteps of the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), who, when he was Treasurer of this country in 1975, provided the first financial guidelines to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is the Government which has final responsibility for policy. The Commission makes the recommendations but it is the Government which has the final responsibility for policy on the development and funding of programs of assistance for schools. Accordingly, the Government reserves the right to initiate policies and lay down financial guidelines in the context of its overall priorities and the need for tight budgetary controls. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government reiterates that the central objective of its schools funding policies is the provision of the highest standard of schooling for all students, whether enrolled in government or non-government schools. State governments provide the bulk of total expenditure on government schools-some 89 per cent- whereas the States provide about only 34 per cent of total public funds for non- government schools. The Commonwealth's role in these circumstances is to provide topping-up funds to government schools which are equivalent to about 11 per cent of total public expenditure on government schools. The remaining 89 per cent is obtained from Commonwealth revenue sharing grants and Loan Council allocations to the States which, along with funds from State sources, are spent by the States according to their priorities, not according to our priorities. In that context I draw attention to the fact that the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Dawkins), in responding on behalf of the Opposition, made reference to what he described as a fact-that the Commonwealth had applied financial pressure to the States. Let me remind him and the House that Commonwealth general purpose revenue funds to the States have generally been maintained in real terms in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to emphasise a point that has already been made by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), that is, that as a result of Commonwealth and State efforts-I emphasise, as a result of Commonwealth and State efforts-the Schools Commission has reported that recurrent expenditures per student in Government school systems increased in real terms by about 20 per cent between 1975-76 and 1979-80. I want to say that again because I want it to be placed not only solidly in the record but also solidly in the minds of the Opposition. During the period that this Government has been in office in the Commonwealth recurrent expenditure per student in government school systems has increased in real terms by almost 20 per cent. That is a massive increase. Despite these achievements and the continuing decline in government school enrolments, the Commonwealth Government has maintained the real level of general recurrent funding for government schools in recent years. Because of the enrolment decline in Government schools since 1978, Commonwealth general recurrent funds on a per student basis have increased in real terms. On the other hand the Commission states in its report that the great majority of non-government schools have on average recurrent expenditure levels well below the standard cost of educating a student in a government school. The report also shows that overall pupil-teacher ratios in government schools are more favourable than those in non-government shools. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr FIFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member listens he will learn something about education funding in Australian schools. When the contributions of both the Commonwealth and State governments are considered, public expenditure on a student attending a government school is more than double that which is spent on a non-government school student. At the same time the number and proportion of enrolments in non-government schools are increasing as more parents are exercising their right of choice of schooling for their children. The Commonwealth recognises this right in the form of a basic grant for all parents of children attending non-government schools equivalent to 20 per cent of average government school costs-I reiterate; 20 per cent of average government school costs. In addition, the Commonwealth provides supplementary assistance, which, by 1983, will be up to a total of a further 20 per cent of average government school costs, to those non-government schools in greater need because of their low resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Almost 90 per cent of Commonwealth general recurrent funds for non-government schools is directed to schools in receipt of supplementary needs grants; that is , the schools with the greatest need. The Commission has also referred in its report to the financial and enrolment pressures currently being faced by many non-government schools throughout Australia. Continued public and private financial support for these schools will be necessary if a deterioration in standards is to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech delivered by the honourable member for Fremantle this evening, and indeed other speeches delivered by members of the Opposition, indicate the opposition to the level of funding provided by the Commonwealth to non- government schools. The honourable member for Fremantle described the Government 's policy in this area as being 'very expensive'. I have no doubt that given the opportunity he would reduce the level of funds flowing to non-government schools . Because the States have the primary responsibility for schools, the Commonwealth's particular role in this area is to bring resources to bear on matters of national concern. The honourable member for Burke this evening said that the Commonwealth ought to identify areas where special initiatives should be taken. I refer him to the Migrant and Multicultural Education Program, our Special Education Program, the Disadvantaged Schools Program, the Country Areas Program and the Professional Development Program. I invite his attention to those because obviously he is not aware of their existence. The Government recognises that there is a need to monitor and to review policy priorities in the light of changing economic and educational circumstances. I say on behalf of the Government that this will continue to be done in the determination of funding guidelines for Schools Commission programs in 1983. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening this House has been debating a group of measures dealing with education funding. Earlier tonight we considered funds for schools and now we are considering funds for tertiary education and the Government's proposal to reintroduce tertiary tuition fees. This will be the final legislative act of this Minister for Education (Mr Fife). By the time this House resumes for the Budget session W. C. Fife-or Wal as he likes to be known- will no longer be the Minister for Education; he will have moved to new pastures . Clearly he is destined for new duties. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) seems to like him and apparently admires either his dedication for the tasks he has been given to pursue by the Prime Minister or his unquestioning loyalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently the Minister for Education has been given a quite amazingly diverse set of duties. He has acted as the Minister for Industrial Relations and as Leader of the House. He has acted in the House on behalf of the Acting Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle). He now represents the Minister for Health (Senator Peter Baume) in this House and recently acted for the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and represented the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). Of course, before he became Minister for Education he was Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. He seems to have an unending array of talents, at least in the eyes of his mentor, the Prime Minister. What we do know about the forthcoming reshuffle is that Wal Fife is off from the education portfolio. We do not know whether it will be to the ministries of health, industrial relations, social security or even finance- who knows? We cannot make any confident prediction about where he is going. All we know is that he will not be here as Minister for Education when we come back for the Budget session. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be said that this Minister has an absolute genius for getting out just in time. He left the failing, dying New South Wales Liberal Government just before it commenced its dramatic slide out of office and before the Liberal Party in that State slid into total oblivion. He left the ministry of Business and Consumer Affairs just before the worst of the revelation about that department's problems. In fact, he was the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs who strenuously defended Harvey Bates and the Narcotics Bureau just before Harvey Bates got the sack and just before the Narcotics Bureau was abolished. This is the Minister with the genius for getting out of troubled waters just in time. Now he is going to leave the field of education, following the carnage of the cuts and the ravages of the razor gang. He has presided over a period of growing despair and growing disenchantment throughout the education sector in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the tertiary area this Minister has presided over a decline in total enrolments. He seems to be very satisfied with that statistic because that is the justification for reducing the funds for the tertiary sector, of course ignoring entirely the fact that with declining enrolments in the tertiary sector we are failing to make an investment in the future of this country-an investment not only in educational resources but also in the future industrial and economic resources of the country. He notes with apparent pleasure that now fewer and fewer students are receiving any support at all under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and those who are receiving it are receiving less than they have ever received in the past. Career opportunities in universities and colleges have simply evaporated as a result of the policies he has had the responsibility of implementing. Research funding has declined to a level less than it was in 1966 when the Australian Research Grants Committee was established. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen this Minister eliminate 30 colleges of advanced education already and he has his eyes on a further six colleges. We have seen his attempt to reintroduce tertiary tuition fees and his long-winded attempts-they may be successful or they may be unsuccessful-to introduce a student loans scheme. We have seen the abolition of the Curriculum Development Centre and the Education Research and Development Committee, just at the time when everyone else in Australia is saying that we ought to be expecting more and newer things from the education system. The CDC, responsible for designing new curricula to respond to the changing circumstances of our children and our economy, has now been abolished. He has presided over a disastrous reallocation of funds which, as we indicated in an earlier debate, has left the state government school system impoverished. Now we have the final act of Wal Fife, Minister for Education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable Minister. This package, his final legislative axe is a further attempt to reintroduce tertiary tuition fees. It is the legislation finally to wrap up cost supplementation for universities and colleges, and it includes the legislation finally to put into effect the closure of 30 colleges of advanced education around Australia. This is an appropriate legacy for a disastrous Minister for Education. At least under his predecessor, Senator Carrick, we saw continue the general thrust, intent and direction-albeit at a decreased rate and at an decreased level of effectiveness-of the policies of the former Labor Government. It has been only under this Minister that we have seen a true reversal of educational activity and thrust in this country as far as the overall objectives of the education process are concerned. That is because this Minister is the first Minister for Education actually to be prepared to do the Prime Minister's bidding. The Prime Minister has always been anti-intellectual, he has always been anti-university and he has always been anti the fundamental importance of school-based education, particularly in the government system. He has had a compliant Minister who has been prepared to take the knife to it and do irreparable damage to this country's system of education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I deal first in regard to this matter with the question of the end of cost supplementation. I indicated earlier in the debate on schools that it had been the practice of the Labor Government and of Liberal governments prior to this Government to ensure that the value of the promised grants to universities and colleges would be restored by a retrospective adjustment after cost increases could be calculated. Now we see in one of the Bills before us tonight the end of cost supplementation. The year 1981 will be the last year for which cost supplementation exists. For 1982 and beyond we will have this theoretical anticipatory adjustment to funds which is supposed to take into account the cost increases which are mainly as a result of the wages and salaries costs incurred by universities and colleges. Earlier this year the Academic Salaries Tribunal recommended what might be described as modest increases for academics in universities and colleges throughout Australia. The 1982 full cost of the implementation of those increased salaries will be $75m. So, if the Government does not provide that $75m, or if it has not been adequately provided for in the prospective allowance, that will cost something like 300 jobs in universities and colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has said nothing about this except that he will review the consequences of the AST decision and perhaps make some adjustment accordingly. There is no guarantee that the real value of the grants-their purchasing power- such as they are, promised to universities and colleges in 1982 will be maintained. All that this legislation does is to adjust retrospectively the consequences of that decision as they affected 1981 in particular. Nothing has been said tonight about the consequences for 1982. Every university and every college of advanced education is now faced with the dilemma of how to budget for the rest of the year, knowing that somewhere, somehow, it will have to meet the cost, collectively, of the $75m extra as a result of the Academic Salaries Tribunal decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be perfectly happy to accept from the Minister an undertaking that at an appropriate time he will provide compensation for universities and colleges for the effect of this increase. I realise that currently a national wage case is under way. The decision of that national wage case is not yet known. It will have implications for universities and colleges and I accept the fact that the Minister ought to take that decision into account before finalising his review of this matter. But if he could only say now that he would fully compensate for the consequences of the decision of the Academic Salaries Tribunal, I am sure universities and colleges around Australia would be extraordinarily relieved and those people who will be threatened with the sack if that compensation is not provided also would be greatly relieved. I do say to the Minister that tonight, as perhaps his final gesture of goodwill-if he can find such a gesture in his heart-he ought to give that undertaking to universities and colleges to provide compensation in respect of those salary and wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though the universities and colleges could in any way escape the consequences of that decision. Those salaries and wages are set by the Academic Salaries Tribunal as a result of very long-winded consideration of submissions from staff associations, from governments and from the institutions themselves. It is not a matter of sweetheart deals being made. It is not a matter of the universities and colleges being able to avoid paying the amounts. Therefore, as this Government is responsible for the full funding of the universities and colleges, it ought to provide the necessary compensation to account for such increases. It is not enough for the Minister to say that allowance for these increases has already been built into the grants for 1982 and beyond. In the absence of his indicating the basis of that calculation no one can possibly be expected to believe that adequate provision has been made for the increases which have just been announced. </PARA>
<PARA> The other and particularly substantive matter which is included in this group of Bills is the further attempt by the Government to reintroduce tertiary fees. This subject has been debated endlessly in this House and pursued in another place. I do not intend to do anything more than to go over the very fundamental reasons for the Opposition's continued rejection of this proposal. In the first place, it represents a quite clear breach of a pre-election undertaking by the Minister that the Government had before it no proposal to reintroduce tertiary tuition fees. Any fair-minded Australian was entitled to take that as an undertaking that the Government would not reintroduce tertiary tuition fees. It was only a matter of months before that promise was breached with the report of the razor gang and the Government's intention to proceed in this way was revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, what is clear from this proposal is that the Government is not simply interested in reintroducing tertiary tuition fees in the limited way indicated. I note that the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) is here. We heard earlier from the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume). Also, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) has been very outspoken on these matters. They all believe that there should be a general application of tertiary tuition fees. Another 20 or 25 members of the Government also believe that should happen . This legislation is really about re-establishing the principle of tertiary tuition fees so that the fee collecting apparatus can be set up and at some time in the future rapidly extended to cater for the collection of fees from all undergraduate students as well as post-graduate students. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the imposition of fees for post-graduate students will undermine the already inadequate research effort and will reduce the supply of trained research workers for business, government and higher education itself. We already know that post-graduate students are an integral part of the research effort, in universities particularly. If the Government begins to select them for special penalties it will have a savage effect on the research effort of those universities-at a time when we ought to be encouraging research. Indeed, this debate provides an opportunity to discuss the report of the Commonwealth Research Centres of Excellence Committee. Thus, on the one hand the government is attempting to promote research in universities and, on the other, is trying to penalise the very students who are an integral part of that research effort. </PARA>
<PARA> My fourth point is that these fees really do represent the imposition of a thoroughly unfair penalty on post-graduate students who have already been hard hit by an inadequacy of financial assistance. I realise that under this proposal those who hold post-graduate awards would not have to pay a fee. But a lot of other post-graduate students are not lucky enough, if that is the term, to get a post-graduate award-miniscule and inadequate as it is. Why should they, who enjoy no public support, be singled out for the extra penalty of having to pay fees? What we really need is not a fee to penalise post-graduate students, to compromise our research effort, but rather policies to regenerate that effort and provide the sort of encouragement that might lead to some form of economic regeneration in this country-regeneration of a kind that can only originate with some fairly imaginative research, amongst other things. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter with which this package of Bills proposes to deal is the closure of colleges of advanced education. The Government, in the form of the razor gang's report, decided to single out 30 colleges of advanced education for elimination. It wanted to reduce the number of colleges by that figure. There was no justification for that course being followed. The colleges concerned were on a list that happened to turn up in the report of the Tertiary Education Commission. There was no reason for singling out those colleges as opposed to any others. The TEC had not singled them out for closure, although I am perfectly happy to acknowledge that it suggested that over a three-year period there should be a rationalisation of single purpose institutions. The Government ought to be well pleased with the result that it has been able to achieve in the last 12 months. The number of colleges in Australia has been reduced from 69 to 45 by the elimination of 30 separate institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have thought that the Government would have called it a day at that point and would have left alone the six colleges for which very serious problems continue to exist. The colleges in Armidale, Newcastle and Milperra in New South Wales all have very serious problems. All have very strong arguments for retaining their separate identities. In Victoria, the college at Hawthorn, the Melbourne State College and the Institute of Early Childhood Development similarly have seemingly intractable problems, which will mean that if they are forced to amalgamate or to close, very serious damage will be done to the education offering in Victoria in the special areas which these colleges now serve. The Minister has already been able to achieve the elimination of 30 colleges of advanced education-at very substantial cost not only to the range of educational opportunities offered throughout the country but also to academic careers and the integrity of institutions. One would have thought that, having achieved the stated objective of the razor gang by closing 30 colleges, he would have decided to call it a day and leave alone the six colleges for which continuing and intractable problems remained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not. I ask the Minister to do the calculations again. Of the colleges which have been eliminated six were not on the original list of 30. They were included as a result of arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States. The group of 30 might just as well be this 30 as any other, because no justification was provided for naming the precise 30 which the razor gang singled out. There was no reason why it should have been that 30 as opposed to any other or, if there was, the Government did not tell us what it was, and TEC threw very little light on the matter. One would have thought that the Government, having in the last 12 months reduced the number of colleges from 69 to 45-not including these six-would have been well satisfied with its day's work even though, as I have said, it was achieved at a very great cost to education in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So with this debate we come to the end of the Fife era of education. The Minister will not be here as Minister for Education when we return for the Budget session.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member admits that it was not one of his good speeches. I have yet to hear one of his good speeches. I would be delighted to receive a copy of a good speech from the honourable member for Fremantle. It is astonishing that in the debate on a series of Bills relating to tertiary education in Australia the shadow Minister for Education should produce arguments at such a low level that we cannot even discern from his remarks what the principal issues are. In the few minutes available to me I wish to address myself to the real issue concerning tertiary education assistance; that is, just how it is that tertiary education institutions, particularly the universities, can adapt to the economic circumstances of any particular time. I have had the opportunity in recent months to have discussions with a number of educators at the tertiary level in Australia. There is great concern about how those institutions can adapt to economic circumstances as they change because it is not always possible to provide continuously increases in funds to institutions of that kind or, indeed, to any sector of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a time when there are budgetary constraints and economic difficulty, all sections of the Australian community have been asked to adapt and to restrict their activities in certain respects to meet those changed economic situations. That has proved to be very difficult within the universities. We are told by the vice-chancellors and those who face the problem of running universities on a day to day basis that they cannot adapt to changed circumstances without cutting activities in some of the most promising areas within their institutions. In other words, over the last 100 years we have developed in Australia university institutions which are very rigid. They are rigid in the sense that the administrators find it difficult to cut back on any activity in order to give greater reign to another activity. They find it very difficult to cut out activities which are less than fruitful in order to put their funds and resources into the most promising activities. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of research is done at a level which is less than satisfactory. Many opportunities for very bright people to be given the funds and resources to do wonderful work might not be available because the funds are locked up in situations that are less than favourable. Very important issues are involved in this structural problem. Basically, what the universities tend to say to us in the Government is: 'We cannot adapt. Ninety-five per cent of what we do is already pre-ordained. Only about 5 per cent of what we do can be changed. The 5 per cent represents the best and the brightest. If you try to cut us back or adjust what we get by 5 per cent, because of the rigidity of our structure'- which is, in fact, a nineteenth century structure-'the only way we can adapt ourselves to these changed requirements is by reducing and cutting back on the most important and the most promising of our activities'. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue which the honourable member for Fremantle seems never to have addressed and which all of us need to address is: How can we reconcile the need for these institutions to change, to become more adaptable and flexible and to be capable of putting their money into the most promising activities and at the same time maintain the academic independence which we would all want for them? None of us wants governments to tell them what they should do in any direct sense because that would strike at the very heart of academic independence and freedom. Yet it is impossible to continue in a democratic society where very important and major institutions can say to us: 'You cannot touch us in any way financially, except that we will cut back on our most important and most promising activities and you will bear the responsibility as a government as that'. </PARA>

Discussions with academics do not always get to the heart of the problem. Most of what is coming out of the universities-at least on the organised level; not necessarily at the more thoughtful and discussed level-is the almost trade union attitude as put forward by the honourable member for Fremantle, that there is no possibility of change. Of course, there is a possibility for change provided it is measured and occurs over a period. But that was not represented by the honourable member for Fremantle in this debate. I do not have time to go on to discuss the report on the Commonwealth Research Centres of Excellence Committee on which I was engaged. But I did want to make the point I mentioned. I invite those in university audiences to address themselves to this quite fundamental problem and to overlook the speech by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fremantle, which I must confess has debased the currency of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I express my disappointment that a debate on tertiary education is to last for an hour. The debate on the States Grants ( Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill and the Commonwealth Schools Commission lasted for little more than an hour. This indicates the tone of education debates in this House in the last five years. There has never been a decent opportunity provided to look at the issues and principles which are involved- even the sorts of matters which the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) started to talk about. This is the fault of the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) . In recent years he has not allowed a wide-ranging debate to take place in which we could look at these principles. This rests fairly and squarely with the Government because, as I will show in a few moments, there is no excuse for the Federal Government withdrawing from the Tertiary education field. The Government has been in that field for over 40 years and has accepted greater responsibilities than it accepts now. That its funding is inadequate can be easily shown from an article which appeared in the Age on Tuesday, 27 April. The article stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Melbourne's three universities would face a combined deficit of about $7 million . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What does this mean in practical terms? It means that research projects are cut- research projects which will already be affected by the fees to be charged to post-graduate students. Not only will post-graduate students be unable to take part in research; there will be fewer research projects for them to take part in . What happens to development and to the other programs that are innovative? The professor of computer science in South Australia said recently that there is such a drain on tutorial staff in that area that-I think this is the term he used-we are swallowing the seed core. Institutions cannot train adequately those people who are needed in the outside world because the very people who can train them have been taken out to work in those areas. Staff levels are cut. Do not tell me that staff levels do not affect the training of the students. </PARA>
<PARA> What is tertiary education about? What are we looking for in this country? I quote a statement by my colleague Senator Button some time ago. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> So much of the future of Australia is dependent upon this nation developing a skilled workforce and a well educated population that there must be a commitment to a continual widening of access to tertiary and post-secondary education. Ultimately, the debate about education expenditure is one about freedom and equality-about choice and options for the majority of Australians. We can narrow the range of options and choice to a limited and fortunate few-options in terms of job opportunities, self-fulfilment and leisure, or we can constantly strive to make these options available to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this Government is about the first option of restricting it to a fortunate few. The Federal Government historically has been involved in tertiary education for 40 years. In 1942 the Universities Commision was set up. In 1945 the Commonwealth Office of Education, to agree on grants with the States, was set up. In 1943 students in reserve faculties at universities had their fees paid and had a means tested living allowance and an incidentals allowance. This was extended to students in other faculties at the end of the war. The Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme originated in 1944 and allowed many other people to enter university. These initiatives were supposed to produce some equality of opportunity and to change the types of people who were able to enter university. Admittedly, in 1951, the Commonwealth Scholarships Scheme replaced the other scheme and led to basic inequality. Then, under the Whitlam Government, we had the abolition of university fees and the introduction of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance. It was hoped that these steps would give a wider spread of students entering universities from across the socio-economic groups. Unfortunately, this did not happen. I quote from Anderson and others in Students in Australian Higher Education, produced in 1980. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> We have seen that the social composition of students in higher education has been relatively stable over several decades despite the changes which have taken place during that time: changes which have seen a great expansion of universities and colleges, a rise in retention rate to 12th year in secondary school, a growth in general affluence of the population and the introduction of many egalitarian measures. There is still much social inequality and economic hardship in society but its roots are deep in the social fabric; and it would be unlikely that a simple change at one particular point in the system, such as the abolition of fees, would have any great effects on the social composition of students in higher education. Most of the socially handicapping circumstances have had their effect well before students even get to the point of seeking a place in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>That very matter was discussed in the debate which preceded the discussion of this legislation. The main cause goes back to social and economic circumstances, back to primary and secondary schooling. But this Government continues this disadvantage into the tertiary years. Vice-Chancellor Low, in his final report to the Australian National University, when speaking about the cuts, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> To revert to a term I employed late in 1980: the wolf has now eaten a very large meal inside the door, and the gore from his gnashings is splashed all about us. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to point out that the maximum level of allowance under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme for those who are living away from home dropped between 1974 and 1981 by $160. While in 1973-4 that allowance was 21 per cent of the average weekly earnings, now it is more than 10 per cent less that the maximum weekly rate of unemployment benefit. He pointed out that the disadvantage was not only to students but also to the ANU, which in the previous year had lost 67 staff positions-a reduction of 8.5 per cent of academic positions and 8.85 per cent of general staff. This is reflected in other tertiary institutions. One knows the sad effect this has on services to students . Reverting to the TEAS allowance, we find that in 1980 only 35.3 per cent of students were receiving any sort of allowance. Yet in 1968, under the old schemes, well over 50 per cent of students received assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a decline in the number of people who are entering tertiary education. According to the Tertiary Education Commission, there is a decline of about one- fifth. What is worse is the elitism which is being introduced in this way. A recent analysis suggests that the offspring of parents in professional and managerial occupations outnumber by three to one children of skilled and manual workers. Disadvantage is piled on disadvantage. Children of skilled and manual workers are disadvantaged by social and economic circumstances. They are disadvantaged by the provision of the type of primary and secondary education. If they eventually aspire to tertiary education, they are the ones who cannot use it because of the restrictions that this Government is placing on the assistance and, indeed, on the services available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told by this Government that an obvious way to help students is by a loan scheme. Apart from Government members, I have not heard anyone support the concept of a student loan scheme. The universities know that it will be too costly to administer and that the strain on the university graduates in the way of repayments will be too much. After all, not all of those completing tertiary education receive massive incomes as a result of that education. It gives them the opportunity to go into jobs which are interesting to them in certain disciplines. It does not necessarily provide them with large rewards. Those people in the group for whom we are trying to produce equality will be the ones least able, then they finally start working, to repay heavy loans. It would be less expensive for the Government to review that allowance and bring it up to a value that would enable youngsters from the poorer socio-economic areas to go through the tertiary process without disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that there are more adult and part time students now because young people simply cannot afford to undertake full time tertiary education. We know that the numbers of applications are declining. The cutoff marks for admission to faculties are getting lower. I would like to know what the dropout rate is this year between the commencement of terms. I was talking to a university student who was supposed to do a group project last week with three other students in sociology. When they came to get together for the team project she found that the other members of her team had dropped out from the university at this early stage. From my experience this would be due to economic circumstances . Not only is the allowance too low but also there is a lack of part time work for these youngsters that used to be available in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is restricted in this debate. I said earlier that I was disappointed that the time available for education debates is persistently restricted. I think that is a shame. I believe that a number of members have a contribution to make.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say I was most disappointed with the contribution from the honourable member of Mackellar (Mr Carlton). I did not think in the short time he had available that he did himself any credit by attacking the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins). The States Grants ( Tertiary Education Assistance) Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 provides additional funding for salary and wage increases related to the recurrent programs of universities, colleges of advanced education and tertiary and further education institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is not opposing this Bill because it is providing much needed funding, but I would like to take the opportunity to describe the serious deficiencies which are occurring in the colleges of advanced education in Victoria. These deficiencies are, of course, reflected in colleges of advanced education all over Australia. But I will restrict my comments in this speech to the disastrous effects of educational policies of both the previous Liberal State Government of Victoria and the present Liberal-National Country Party Federal Government on the needs of Victoria. Fortunately, with a State Labor Government in Victoria committed to revitalising and expanding tertiary education in that State we can confidently expect some alleviation of the present deplorable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, too much cannot be expected of the State Labor Government as it will be hamstrung by the continuing deleterious effect of the Federal Government's razor gang recommendations. These recommendations, which were a supposed attempt to achieve some rationalisation and diversification of resources among the colleges, have in fact been a device to restrict further the funding available to the colleges. The consolidation of the colleges has, as was intended by the Federal Government, resulted in a reduction in the total number of college places and thus in student access to college education. Staff-student ratios, the total funding per student, the availability of places for female school leavers, migrants and low income earners have all been drastically reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria the approved intakes for pre-service teacher training in 1984 will be 50 per cent less than in 1975 and 17 per cent less than in 1981. This planned reduction represents a reduction from 6,581 commencing students in 1975 to 3,880 commencing students in 1981 to a mere 3,220 in 1984. Such a reduction and the method of implementation-a forced marriage between relatively desparate institutions-is disastrous for the future of Victorian education. The United Kingdom is at present suffering the results of similar ill-advised cutbacks in teacher education which occurred in the early 1970s and which has resulted in an acute shortage of mathematics, science, English, foreign language and industrial arts teachers. In fact, in Victoria, we are already suffering teacher shortages in mathematics, sciences, English, languages, music, geography and craft subject areas. There is no denying that there was an over-supply of teachers in the late 1970s but this should not have been used as an excuse to cut back teacher education at a time when the Australian population requires educating to cope with periods of ever increasing leisure. The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission projections of teacher supply and demand have been seriously questioned by a number of professional educationalists. The TEC's assumptions about teacher training completion rates, population statistics, teacher wastage rates and pupil-teacher ratios have been criticised and a number of errors and uncertainties indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the vital importance of the TEC's forecasts of future teacher needs, it is important to draw attention to the five major areas where there are uncertain, if not faulty, assumptions. Firstly, the TEC has estimated that teacher loss rates will rise by 0.2 per cent per year from a level of 5 per cent in 1979. But the teacher loss rate in Victorian government schools was frequently double this figure; it ranged from 8.2 per cent to 9.6 per cent over the period 1970-77. Only in 1978-79 was there a sudden drop to 5 per cent, but in 1980 the figure rose again to 5.7 per cent. Even higher loss rates were registered with 22.5 per cent amongst temporary government teachers and 17.5 per cent amongst Catholic school teachers. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the TEC has assumed that there will be an annual migration rate of 50 ,000 persons. But during 1980 the figure was 93,000 and is estimated to reach 120,000 in 1981. There is no reason to believe that this doubling of the migration rate will not continue into the future. Therefore, the TEC has underestimated school enrolments in relation to migration rates by 1.5 per cent. Thirdly, in relation to birth and fertility rates, the TEC has based its projections on Australian Bureau of Statistics series A fertility projections despite the fact that these projections were exceeded in both 1978 and 1979. Primary enrolments may be dropping in the early 1980s but they will increase dramatically from 1987 onwards as the children who formed the post-war baby boom begin to have children of their own. The increase in the fertility rate obviously will result in an eventual increase in primary school enrolments leading to an increase in the demand for teachers. Fourthly, the increases in real recurrent funding for non-government schools is likely to lead to improved staff-student ratios but the TEC has not taken account of the possibility of an increasing demand for teachers as a result of this factor. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is the availability of new graduates for teaching. Not all teaching college graduates choose to teach and the TEC has assumed that 10 per cent will go into non-teaching fields. However, surveys by the Graduate Careers Council of Australia have shown that 20 per cent of new teacher college graduates do not enter the teaching field. Thus the TEC has overestimated the supply of new teacher graduates by 10 per cent. Of course, it is argued that the criticisms of the TEC forecast of future teacher needs which are based on a research paper by Dr Gerald Burke of the Faculty of Education at Monash University are not valid in Victoria because the research paper is related to national trends. I find this argument completely specious as it is impossible to argue that the criticisms bear no relation to Victoria and the total effect of the faulty assumptions is a gross underestimate of the number of teachers required in Victoria from the middle 1980s onwards. It is impossible not to conclude that the cuts to teacher education and the so-called rationalisation of colleges of advanced education were done solely for political expediency rather than to meet the actual educational needs of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn now to another aspect of the cutbacks in funding for colleges of advanced education which I have not had the opportunity to discuss in previous debates but which is becoming a matter for great concern at present. During the past 20 years the participation of women in tertiary education has increased dramatically. But with the increasing implementation of the razor gang cuts-I suppose I should use that body's proper name; the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions-the participation of women in the advanced education sector has been seriously curtailed. The ad hoc policies of the razor gang have placed in jeopardy the chances of women obtaining a college education, their opportunities of gaining college academic or administrative employment and their career prospects if they are already employed as a member of the academic staff. Female CAE enrolments increased from 45.3 per cent in 1975 to 48.8 per cent of all enrolments in 1980 in Australia as a whole. The TEC, in its 1982-84 triennium report, argued that the decline in teacher education places over the 1979-80 period did not entail a loss of opportunities for female students as there were compensating increases of female enrolments in other fields of study. The studies listed were applied science, business studies, paramedical and liberal studies. The report implied that cuts in teacher education would not disadvantage women students unable to gain entry into teacher education courses. But 70 per cent of teacher education enrolments are female and as the cuts amounted to 10,500 places over the 1979-84 period this means that the number of female students expected to transfer to other courses during that period was in the order of 7,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence is that a limit has already been reached in the number of female school leavers, many of whom lack the mathematics-science prerequisites, who can be absorbed in other fields of study. At the same time, they would find it difficult to enter liberal studies courses because the TEC has expressly refused to increase enrolments in those courses. In fact, the enrolments will be cut by 13 per cent over the triennium. Similarly, art and design, another area of study preferred by female students, will also be cut over the triennium by 8 per cent. So, combined with the 15 per cent cut in teacher education places, for every four places being abolished in traditional female areas of study, only one new place is being created in other female areas of study favoured by female students, namely, paramedical studies. The cuts in teacher education, liberal studies, art and design means that thousands of female school leavers and mature age women seeking retraining have nowhere to go in their search for higher education and the retrograde policies of the present Federal Government entail enormous hidden costs to the community in terms of wasted female abilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to continue to detail how the razor gang cuts are threatening the future careers of the women college staff but time is against me. The four aspects of discrimination against women in staffing appointments should be noted as follows: Firstly, women are greatly under-represented in college academic staffs; secondly, disproportionately large number of women staff do not have permanently-tenured positions as compared with male staff; thirdly, male staff continue to occupy most of the senior academic and administrative positions in colleges; and, finally, women staff are disproportionately concentrated in traditional areas of study, such as teacher education, liberal studies and paramedical studies. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote now from the comments of the Council of Academic Staff Associations in Victorian Colleges of Advanced Education on this matter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The first three findings-</PARA>
<PARA>I have just quoted them-</PARA>
<PARA>point to possible discrimination at the point of entry into colleges or in granting of promotion, tenure and study leave, as well as to historical circumstances that have made it difficult for women to gain the qualifications sought for many academic positions. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth finding, coupled with their insecurity of tenure, means that women college staff will be especially threatened by Razor Gang cuts to teacher education and liberal studies. All the gains that women have made in gaining access to academic careers may soon be vitiated if planned cutbacks go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the Opposition is not opposing this Bill, I take this opportunity to condemn the Federal Government for its retrograde education policies which are causing a dramatic decline in the quality of tertiary education in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I propose to ignore completely the personalities entered into by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) when he should have been addressing this Bill and to concentrate my address in reply on the very important issues concerning tertiary education in Australia that are before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This cognate debate, which I hasten to add is one of the many wide ranging education debates which have taken place in this House over the past 2 1/2 years , covers Bills to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981 and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1978 in order to provide adjustments to grants for cost increases. It also concerns aspects of the Government's decisions on the consolidation of colleges of advanced education as well as the limited re-introduction of tuition fees for second and higher qualifications. The debate has covered proposed amendments to the Australian National University Act 1945 and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Act 1967 so as to enable the limited re-introduction of tuition fees at those two institutions. In addition, the report of the Commonwealth Research Centres of Excellence Committee has also been brought to the attention of honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> It continues to be the Government's view that those who wish to further their studies beyond a reasonable range of basic qualifications should make a contribution towards the cost of tuition. There are substantial benefits which flow to individuals from higher education and the Government believes that the community as a whole should not be expected to meet all of the costs. The Government is clearly opposed to the restoration of tuition fees for first degree or first diploma qualifications. In fact, the legislation continues the provision which has existed for some time preventing tertiary institutions from charging tuition fees to students undertaking first degrees and diplomas.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the further implementation of the Government's policy of rationalisation in higher education. Arising from the Government's Review of Commonwealth Functions, it was decided that 30 colleges of advanced education should be consolidated into larger institutions or should amalgamate with nearby institutions. At this stage, only six of the original 30 have not yet entered into acceptable consolidation arrangements. The Wollongong Institute of Education is now to become part of the new consolidated institution in that city . It is not true, as stated by the honourable member for Fremantle, that the Government has closed down 30 colleges of advanced education. They have been or will be consolidated. I emphasise that the colleges have not been closed down. </PARA>
<PARA> The amending legislation before the House provides funds this year for the six institutions not yet consolidated. However, these funds are being provided on the clear understanding that negotiations aimed at achieving consolidation will be actively pursued with a view to acceptable arrangements being reached before the end of 1982. Should such consolidation arrangements not be achieved, the Government will not be prepared to continue to provide recurrent funds for the institutions concerned. It is the Government's intention that the consolidation of resources should enable advanced education to be more responsive to changes in demand for various types of courses and to enable the resources available for advanced education to be used as effectively as possible. I take this opportunity to remind honourable members that although the Government is committed to a policy of economic restraint, total funds provided for tertiary education for 1982 have been increased marginally, in real terms. This of course is contrary to what the honourable member for Fremantle would have the House believe. </PARA>
<PARA> As I explained in my statement of 4 June 1981 on guidelines for the programs administered by the Commission, the Government is maintaining its overall commitment to education as a priority area of direct Commonwealth endeavour. It is continuing to give priority to technical and further education. With this object in mind, funds for TAFE were increased for 1982 by nearly 6 per cent in real terms, and at the same time there was a small reduction in the funds provided for higher education-a reduction of less than one half of one per cent. In respect of recurrent funds for higher education, the Government has re- iterated its commitment to fixed triennial funding arrangements. The House needs to recall that it was the previous Labor Government which did away with fixed triennial funding arrangements for universities and colleges of advanced education. The Government has undertaken to maintain the 1982 funds in real terms over the 1982-84 triennium. Since that decision, honourable members will be aware that I have announced the provision of up to a further $12m for higher education during 1983 and 1984 to assist with the rising costs of staff superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the legislation also makes provision for the further implementation of the Government's 1980 election undertakings. I refer, of course, to the introduction of community language courses and the establishment of research centres. Specifically, the legislation transfers certain of the funds set aside for these initiatives under the States grants legislation to enable funds to be provided for the Australian National University, whose funds are appropriated separately. In no way does this transfer reduce the total funds available; it is merely a machinery provision to enable funds to be allocated to the Australian National University for these particular purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I explained in my second reading speech, the amendments to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1978 will increase the 1980 and 1981 grants provided under that legislation in response to relevant cost movements that have occurred during those two years. It is anticipated that these increases, which will total $53.7m, will be the final adjustments to these grants. I remind honourable members that, as I announced last year, the Government's policy is that from 1982 cost adjustment procedures will be based on a prospective arrangement rather than the retrospective arrangements that have operated previously. As far as the 1982 prospective allowance for the tertiary sector is concerned, the Government has recognised the need created by the Academic Salaries Tribunal report to look again at the adequacy of the allowance. As that allowance is made up of a number of components, including provision for national wage case movements, the Government will review the situation in the light of the result of the present national wage case. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn briefly to the matter of research. During the debate this evening the Opposition claimed that provision for research in Australia had declined. This, of course, is not true. It is something that members of the Opposition continually say. I will state the correct position. Total funds available-these are given in average 1982 cost levels-in 1973 for research were as follows: Australian National University $56.4m, and State universities $75.6m making a total of $132m. In 1980-I emphasise again that these are in constant prices-the Australian National University received $65.7m and State universities received $ 105.4m, making a total of $171.1m. That, of course, in percentage terms represents an increase of 30 per cent. That is a very significant increase in the period from 1973 to 1980. The number of research staff and students have increased from 14,646 in 1973 to 18,346 in 1980, an increase of approximately 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In January 1982 the Government, following its consideration of the report of the Commonwealth Research Centres of Excellence Committee chaired by Mr S. B. Myer, announced that it would provide $16m in the triennium 1982-84 to enable 10 Commonwealth special research centres to be established in seven Australian universities. Funding for the Commonwealth special research centres is an addition to substantially increased special research grants already provided in the legislation and will total $31.5m for the triennium. The concept of research centres of excellence for Australia was first proposed by the former Universities Commission. It has since been supported by both the Universities Council and the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. There has also been support from the Australian Science and Technology Council and other expert bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education, Training and Employment commented on national research issues and the utilisation and retention of highly skilled research manpower, and recommended that support be provided through special research grants to enable centres to be built up in universities . The Myer Committee, in its approach to selection, decided that funding should go to 'creating new centres around existing individuals or nuclei of research activity', rather than its nominating particular areas of desirable research and trying to attract reseachers into these fields. In accordance with its terms of reference, it had concentrated on funding a relatively small number of highly promising centres, rather than spreading the available funds more widely to cover a greater number of subject or geographical areas. The $16m for the centres is for the 1982-84 triennium, although centres will be supported for up to six years in the first instance. The Government is confident that this initiative will significantly increase the strength and quality of the national research and development effort in the selected fields and that it will assist Australia's contribution to international scholarship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have mentioned on a number of occasions in this House the appalling penny-pinching attitude of the Federal Government towards Australian pensioners. I should like to draw attention to the case of a constituent of mine, Mrs Iris Andersen, which underlines the miserly attitude of the Government, which refuses to adopt effective legislation to prevent the blatant tax avoidance at present being practised by wealthy people in this country. Mrs Andersen has advised me that her mother, Mrs Hilda Unsunk, aged 86, was in Coogee Hospital on 9 September 1981 when she received her pension cheque, which was dated 10 September although it was received and cashed on 9 September. At 8 p.m. on 9 September, Mrs Unsunk died suddenly in hospital. Mrs Andersen immediately notified the Department of Social Security and her mother's pension cheques stopped coming.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister can do better than that. I am disappointed by his comment. I should have thought that he would have realised that a matter such as this is much too important to call for the flippant remarks that he has just made. On 12 January Mrs Andersen received a letter from Social Security saying that she owed $126.30, the amount of the cheque issued on 10 September 1981. I understand that pension cheques are issued fortnightly on a set date, irrespective of the pensioner's eligibility date, and no doubt 10 September was the set date for the issuance of Mrs Unsunk's cheque. At Mrs Andersen's request, I wrote to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) about the matter and indicated that I could understand why his Department mailed the cheques before the pension date-to enable pensioners to have their cheques on a set date in case of postal delays-but that what I could not understand was a department that splits hairs so closely, since Mrs Unsunk died four hours before the issuance of the cheque. Mrs Andersen intends to pay the $126.30. But I asked for the Minister's comments on this case. He replied as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Social Services Act provides for pensions to be paid in fortnightly instalments calculated by dividing the annual rate by 26. Entitlements fall due each payday; payments are made neither in advance nor in arrears. </PARA>
<PARA> When an eligible person lodges a claim for pension, payment commences from the first pension payday after the date of lodgment, or from the date of lodgment if that was a pension payday. Thus, when a pension is granted there is no reduction in the first payment proportionate to the number of days between the date of eligibility and the first payday; nor is there any payment due for the period between the last payday and the date on which pension eligibility ceases. Therefore, if a pensioner has received payment for the pension payday prior to the date of death there is no further pension due. </PARA>
<PARA> While I can understand Mrs Andersen seeing this as an anomaly I can only confirm that as Mrs Unsunk died on 9 September 1981, no pension entitlement existed after 27 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view the Minister's answer is most unsatisfactory because he has admitted in relation to this matter that there could be an anomaly in the administrative processes of his Department. I call on the Government to stop this inhumane practice and to refund the much needed amount of $126.30 to Mrs Andersen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the hour is late, so I will be brief. I wish to bring to the notice of the House a matter of concern to me and one which should be of concern to all members. It is an incident that happened during the Victorian State election in the electorate of Box Hill, which in part incorporates the Federal electorate of Deakin. An Independent candidate by the name of Peter J. Allan of Blackburn, Victoria, put out a how to vote card the same size and same colour-and with many similarities-as that of the card for the endorsed Liberal candidate. When I went to vote at 8 a.m. this card was handed to me and I took it, as did many other people, thinking it was the card of the endorsed Liberal candidate. The card used much the same wording, including the words 'Action for Box Hill'; the photograph was in the same position; there was a big 'vote', a very small 'independent' and a very large 'Liberal' printed in blue and white, the traditional Liberal colours. The card gave the effective second preference in both the Legislative Assembly seat and the Legislative Council seat to the Australian Labor Party. I do not believe that the Labor Party had any part in this subterfuge but in my view the card was deliberately set out by Mr Allan to mislead voters who wished to vote Liberal into voting Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I immediately rang the Liberal Party State Director, proceeded to the city and took out in the Supreme Court a writ to stop distribution of the card. This was done with the consent of the Victorian Attorney-General having been obtained. Mr Justice King gave a verdict in my favour. Costs were awarded against the offending candidate, Mr Peter Allan, and he was ordered to withdraw his card from distribution. However, all this took time, and by the time Mr Allan was prevented by Mr Justice King's decision from handing out these cards it was 1.30 p.m. and many, if not most, of the people would have voted by that time and no doubt would have been misled into voting in a way other than that of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the Commonwealth Electoral Act should be altered so that every candidate must lodge his how to vote card with the returning oficer at least three days in advance and that these cards should be open to inspection by the public, including other candidates. This would mean that it would be possible in situations such as this one for action to be taken in time to stop the distribution of misleading cards at any time on polling day. No other cards should be allowed to be distributed outside polling booths. I believe that the Electoral Act should be changed, and certainly it is in our power in the Federal sphere to do so. I am writing to the Minister concerned to see what can be done to stop this mischievous misleading of well-intentioned voters on polling day. The alternative of course is showing endorsed candidates' party affiliations on the ballot paper. Mr Peter Allan is to be condemned as a mischievous, misleading candidate. I ask leave to incorporate in Hansard the two cards concerned and the relevant legal document. I have already shown them to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise on the adjournment the continuing attitude of this Government in its foreign policy relations with the United States as a government which sees itself as a partner of the United States in being prepared so readily to acquiesce in the continuing human rights atrocities which are being committed in El Salvador by the armed forces of that country, forces which are being trained and armed by the Government of the United States. I refer the House to the most recent report of Amnesty International, which spent some considerable time examining the evidence on human rights abuses in El Salvador. As a result of that examination it reached the following conclusions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Amnesty International is aware that these human rights violations are occurring at a time of civil conflict between guerilla groups and the Salvadorean authorities. It is also aware of reports of abuses having been committed by non- governmental forces. After careful study of all available information, Amnesty International has concluded that the great majority of the reported violations, including torture, disappearances and cold-blooded murder, have been carried out by the security forces and have been directed against non-combatant civilians not involved in guerrilla activities. </PARA>
<PARA>The accompanying document to the report is really horrific in its contents. I do not propose to take up the time of the House by reading out gruesome extracts. It is sufficient to say that almost every kind of human rights abuse which can be named and documented has been named and documented. These abuses are not committed in the heat of battle by competing military forces, be they guerrilla or army forces. The importance of this report is that it highlights a continuing abuse against a non-combatant civilian population which is unable to protect itself. I will quote from sections of a report made by United States Congressman , Patricia Schroeder, who testified to a congressional committee, having visited El Salvador as part of a congressional group. She said she had collected evidence suggesting that the pattern of atrocities carried out by the official security and armed forces continued as before. She told the congressional committee that the Salvadorean Government soldiers would routinely round up, shoot, bayonet, dismember and disembowel their own civilian population. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As a member of our delegation I asked Salvadorean military officials who was responsible for these grotesque mutilations. He casually told us that his men were responsible and that it was simply a way of terrifying the Salvadorean people so they would not have contact with anyone other than the army. These are civilians whose bodies are dragged into the middle of town as a warning to others. </PARA>
<PARA>Before the United States Senate hearings in testimony in 1981-this is also referred to by the Amnesty International report-Richard Millett, Professor of History at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, Illinois, who was called to testify as an expert witness, stated that in 1980 President Duarte had said:</PARA>
<PARA> For fifty years the army has been trained to act as a repressive instrument, a force of terror. The army has been taught to understand that anyone opposed to their way of thinking is a communist. They have been naturally taught to do what comes naturally to them-get rid of communists. </PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned that these gross and wilful abuses of human rights continue, although this issue has been raised in the Parliament, with the connivance and permission of this Government. They have been brought to the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Foreign Minister (Mr Street). It seems to me that if Australia sees itself as having a relationship with the United States-and we do; we see ourselves as part of the military alliance- surely it behoves an Australian government that says it has a commitment to human rights to say to the United States Government: 'You must cease the provision of military arms and training to the El Salvadorean military establishment which is involved in these gross violations or else you have to accept the moral opprobrium of Australia and nations of the Western world who are committed to the establishment of human rights wherever they may be. This Government has a very selective view of human rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to take up the time of the House at this very late hour but I suppose it is never too late to once again bring to the attention of the House and the people of the country the cynical actions taken by this Government. One of the most cynical actions, in the wake of the Review of Commonwealth Functions last year, was the decision to axe the collection and publication of the Commonwealth Employment Service statistics of the number of persons registered as unemployed and the number of unfilled job vacancies. This action, demonstrating the Government's callous lack of concern for the unemployed, can be construed only as an attempt to lose the victims of its economic policies, to hide them from view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only information available to us on the extent of the problem of unemployment comes from the Bureau of Statistics monthly estimates. This ABS monthly estimate is based on a sample survey in each State, and as such can be used to look only at broad trends. Without the CES statistics no measure is available to us of local and regional employment patterns. That this is so is causing concern to many people in my electorate, where a number of worthwhile initiatives are being undertaken by organisations to deal with the current high level of unemployment. These include looking at ways of developing new job opportunities though community action and the provision of support services to those unfortunate citizens who face the prospect of long-term unemployment. We recognise that these fall into all age groups and that each age group has its own particular problems.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Government's penny-pinching razor gang the necessary planning for these activities is being hindered by the lack of current local statistical information. What use is it to Ballarat people to know the ABS estimate of unemployment in Victoria. Until the CES figures were abolished the unemployment rate in the cities and towns of my electorate had been indicated to be far above the overall Victorian rate. There has been no evidence to suggest that the situation has improved in this last year. There can be no doubt that this has been a source of great embarrassment to the Fraser Government. So rather than introduce policies which would have the effect of creating new job opportunities, it was much easier for the Government to abandon, in very cynical fashion the collection and publication of regional unemployment statistics; in other words sweep the problem under the carpet. Under the guise of a cost-saving measure this action exposes the moral bankruptcy of a government which is doing nothing to assist those in my community who are making valiant attempts to ease the plight of the victims of the Government's savage economic policies. If the Government has even a modicum of concern for these people, I implore it to reverse its decision. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr Street</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) This Government is committed to assisting developing countries in their support for the role of women in their countries' development both generally and through support for specifically targetted programs. The critical importance of the contribution made by women is now generally recognised by both developing countries and aid donors. Development assistance programs must consider the needs of women, ensure that they receive appropriate assistance to increase their capacity to contribute more effectively to development, and seek to ensure that they share equally in the benefits of that development. In many developing countries women comprise more than half the rural labour force. In addition they are responsible for caring for the upbringing and welfare of their families. Women's needs and the facilities for them to make their full contribution must therefore be integrated into all aspects of the aid projects. In consultation with aid recipients the Government is seeking to achieve this for our aid program.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In order to assist in carrying out the Government's policy on women in development the Australian Development Assistance Bureau has one staff member assigned to develop policy and to appraise and evaluate appropriate programs of assistance in this area. This position has been filled by a person having qualifications and experience particularly relevant to the issues, institutions and regions involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) There have been no changes in the staffing of this area to date. The Review of Commonwealth Functions directed that the functions performed by women's units in departments other than Home Affairs and Environment and Employment and Youth Affairs should be integrated with other departmental functions, rather than performed in separate units. On the basis of this decision staff ceiling cover for the women in development position has been withdrawn. This is a matter, amongst others of a similar nature, which I have taken up with appropriate Ministerial colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) All proposed Australian bilateral aid projects are reviewed for their effect on women. This is particularly important for large complex rural development projects. Australia also contributes to a number of projects specifically to benefit women. These include, for example, assistance under the ASEAN Australian Economic Co-operation Program for the establishment of training and service centres for women. These will provide training in income-generating skills and in nutrition and primary health care. We are also supporting women in the Pacific through the South Pacific Commission's Women's program, especially through the Community Education Training Centre in Fiji. At present 20 per cent of the Australian Government financed foreign students and trainees are women and it is hoped that the number of women will increase in the next few years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1633) Dr Theophanous asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for National Development and Energy, a question without notice concerning the accuracy of crude oil excise payments. I undertook to obtain an answer to the honourable member's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for National Development and Energy has now provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The 190th report of the Public Accounts Committee did not state that 'up to $ 100 million was lost in revenue not collected from Bass Strait companies'. Paragraph 6.22 of the report includes the sentence:</PARA>
<PARA> 'While the Committee believes that well-stream flows are accurately metered, evidence was received that the probable error in collection of excise in 1978- 79 due to the inaccuracy of the back allocation procedures would exceed plus or minus $10 million.'</PARA>
<PARA> This is the only reference in that report to the potential for a loss in excise revenue. It should be noted that the inaccuracies referred to can lead to either losses or gains in revenue.</PARA>
<PARA> The comment by the Public Accounts Committee, and conclusions drawn by Dr Theophanous is speculative: there is no evidence to suggest that the procedures followed by the licensees have resulted in significant over or under payments of excise or royalty.</PARA>
<PARA> The difficulties surrounding the measurement of stabilised crude oil production on a field by field basis are outlined in paragraphs 6.2 to 6.6 of the report.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth engaged an international firm of consultants to examine the sampling procedures, to report on the controls within the system, and to recommend any changes considered necessary to ensure the accuracy of the results obtained. The consultants concluded that the procedures and standards used by Esso Australia Limited for petroleum accounting purposes in regard to the calculation of royalty and excise are carried out in accordance with accepted international standards and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government relies on the effectiveness of the measurement and sampling procedures maintained by Esso Australia Limited, over which Victorian Government officials exercise a surveillance role. The Victorian Minister for Minerals and Energy is the Designated Authority under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The allocation of production to producing fields is verified by the Department of National Development and Energy.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the report of the Public Accounts Committee was released last year, a number of developments have occurred:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the report by the international firm of consultants (Gaffney Cline and Associates) referred to earlier has been received.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the metering, the measurement standards and procedures used by the producers have been documented and submitted to the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) with a view to registration by that organisation. NATA is currently reviewing the procedures to see what changes, if any, may be required to meet registration requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A complete review of the producers' procedures and their documentation is being carried out by a working group comprising Commonwealth, State and company representatives.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The present maximum penalty under existing legislation is $50 000 but the Government considered this insufficient and the Protection of the Sea (Discharge of Oil from Ships) Act 1981 raises this penalty to $100 000. The Act will be introduced as soon as practicable, but does not, however, apply to areas within State or Northern Territory control. Responsibility for land-sourced oil pollution or ship-sourced spills within the three mile territorial sea and inland waters rests with the States and Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Fines have not been collected by the Commonwealth Government as to date all major spills from a known source have occurred in areas under State or Northern Territory control and legal proceedings have been instituted by the State concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A total of $372,490.44 has been paid by the Government over the past three years for oil containment and dispersal action. Of this amount $173,182.30 has been recovered from known polluters. $149,266.47 is in the process of being recovered and $50,041.67 is not recoverable as the source of the marine pollution was not known.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) My Department has received no information that any ships involved were considered to be unseaworthy, derelict, or in need of repair.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Methods available in Australia to handle any envisaged oil spill include containment by booms, recovery of oil by the use of oil recovery vessels and skimmers, use of various types of absorbents to mop up oil from affected areas and break-up of oil by the use of dispersants. The dispersant is applied from vessels using approved spraying equipment. The use of aircraft to apply dispersant is under investigation. Barges and other temporary storage vessels for the removal of oily wastes from the oil recovery units are obtained from local sources as necessary. Internationally, specialists are agreed that no known equipment can adequately handle a huge spill such as that which occurred from the Amoco Cadiz.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) These methods are similiar to those in use in other parts of the world. Australian marine pollution specialists have attended the leading international training courses and seminars on oil pollution control and are constantly monitoring and evaluating overseas practices.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Not to my knowledge. My information is that all known spills are reported to the appropriate authority.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Does sub-paragraph 25 (2) (b) (i) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act provide that a redistribution may be made whenever in one-fourth of the Divisions of the State the number of electors differs from a quota ascertained in accordance with that part of the Act to a greater extent than one-tenth more or one-tenth less.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In how many Divisions in the State of Queensland do the number of electors differ from the quota to a greater extent than one-tenth more or one-tenth less.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Do they together comprise in excess of one-fourth of the Divisions of the State.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Enrolments in seven Queensland Divisions differ from the State average enrolment to a greater extent than one-tenth more or one-tenth less.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am informed that the latest population projections which are available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics are based on data initially derived from the 1976 Census. I have further been informed that the Australian Bureau of Statistics hopes to publish in July of this year population Projections based on data from the 1981 Census. These latter projections would provide an up to date basis on which projections as to the future representation entitlements of the States could be made. In the absence of these new population projections I would not wish now to comment on future representation entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) In respect of a non-mandatory redistribution as a consequence of the conditions as set in sub-paragraph 25 (2) (b) (i) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the wording of the Act is perfectly clear in that it indicates that given the existence of those particular circumstances a redistribution may be undertaken. There is no requirement to do so and the law does not envisage that a redistribution in those circumstances is mandatory or necessarily warranted. The question is one for Government consideration and is not one on which I would wish to comment.</PARA>
