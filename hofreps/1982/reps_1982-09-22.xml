<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Prime Minister. I preface it by reminding him of the appalling slaughter which took place in Lebanon on 16, 17 and 18 September, a slaughter which has all the appearance of a premeditated attempt at human extermination. I particularly refer to the role of the Christian Militia and the alleged complicity of the Israeli forces which has led not only to universal, global condemnation but also to public outrage within Israel. In view of the enormity of these events I ask the Prime Minister: Will he agree to make a statement on this matter to the House this week and allow a debate to proceed in response to that statement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition will know that both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I-indeed I am sure we were doing it on behalf not only of the Government but of all Australians-have indicated how appalled we were at what had happened. We have indicated general support for the initiatives that President Reagan has taken and I believe that they deserve support. We had indicated earlier support for the somewhat radical and far-reaching proposals that the President had initiated-support in broad terms-but much needs to be done before those proposals, or proposals of a similar kind, can in fact be put into place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will consult with the Foreign Minister to see whether we do have enough firm knowledge on which a statement could be based. I think the honourable gentleman will appreciate that we do not have our own mission in Beirut. It has been difficult to get hard evidence of what in fact happened or how it happened. There is no doubt that many thousands of non-combatants have been killed in the Beirut fighting and not just in this particular slaughter. Many non-combatants have been killed throughout the whole Beirut episode. I will consult with the Foreign Minister and see whether something can be usefully said which will enable a factual basis to be established on which a debate could occur in this Parliament. I do not think any of us would want, in any sense, to be seen as condoning the killing of many thousands of people-of many innocent people, of many non-combatants. There can be no contesting, no doubting that that has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> There is one general thing I want to say. I hope it will be understood in this Parliament and in the broader Australian community. I say it as a person who has been and is, in a real sense, a friend of Israel. I say it on behalf of a government that has done a great deal to support the integrity of Israel behind secure and safe borders. It needs to be read in conjunction with and in addition to the statement that was issued in discussion with the Foreign Minister concerning the Lebanon some time ago. That was, of course, before these events occurred. Israel has earned the right, I believe, to the support of governments of countries such as Australia because of the long history of the Jewish people, because of their courage and determination, because of their absolute right to a homeland behind secure and stable boundaries and because there have been many who have sought to drive them into the sea and to destroy that right.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government and, I hope, Australia will never withdraw from that general proposition and position. But, at the same time, the strength of support that has been given to Israel over the years has depended very much on the capacity to offer support for a stance which was a moral and high-minded one. That has been the position of Israel and of successive Israeli governments over the years . If, by accident, by design, by misfortune, by error or by misjudgment, events occur which weaken or diminish Israel's right to command the support of countries such as Australia, because it breaks down the moral position on which it stands by any of those means-I am not saying deliberately; inadvertently or in any other way-the capacity of nations to support Israel is obviously diminished because we need to have a credible position from which we can argue our support. I hope very much that, in seeking to determine what has happened in this slaughter, the Government of Israel will take the words that I have just uttered very closely to mind because what has happened appals all of us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Prime Minister indicated in his answer to the Leader of the Opposition a moment ago, a great deal-virtually all-of the information which we have about the horrifying events referred to by the honourable member and by the Leader of the Opposition is second hand. We have had to depend on published Press reports and media reports of one kind or another, just as most other people have done. That is at the heart of what the Prime Minister said a moment ago in referring to the lack of hard evidence in relation to these events. But some facts-I think they can be fairly described as facts-have emerged over the last few days. I shall take the honourable member's questions in order. He asked : 'For how long did the killing go on?' We do not know exactly, but it was certainly many hours. The precise time is not possible to determine, but it was not-</PARA></TALK.START>

The preliminary indications are that over 1,000 were killed. How many there were we do not know. He asked: 'How close were the Israeli forces to the camp?' Again, we do not know precisely. We do know that Israeli forces took up positions in the immediate vicinity of Palestinian refugee camps in West Beirut. What precisely that means by way of distance is not clear, but Israeli forces were in the immediate vicinity. The final part of the question was: 'How did the Lebanese militia elements enter the camp?' As I understand it, they entered the camp with the knowledge of the Israeli forces for the purposes so it is said, of eliminating any remaining Palestine Liberation Organisation elements which were inside the camps. That is as far as I am able to go.</PARA></TALK.START>

Secondly, is the Government meeting the removal costs of such persons to come from the United States for such employment in Australia? Thirdly, if this is happening, what are the costs involved?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two parts to the answer to the question raised by the honourable member for Wills. The first is that there is a significant shortage of air traffic controllers in Australia.

There are opportunities for young Australians, as suggested by the honourable member for Wills, to enter the service of the Department of Aviation as trainees. But the problem that confronted my predecessor and the Department was one of an immediate nature. I will make inquiries regarding the trainee element insofar as the United States is concerned and advise the honourable member later. I repeat: There was an urgent need for skilled air traffic controllers. To the best of my knowledge, that recruitment program has been under way for some time. I am not aware of people being recruited in the United States for traineeships in Australia but I will make inquiries and let the honourable member know. The honourable member asked me also for some details of costs of moving, presumably, the trained air traffic controllers to Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. The Treasurer no doubt has seen suggestions that have been made in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly that a State income tax-or a double tax, as the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wran, characterised it-may be or should be introduced. Would such a selective tax, applicable to a group of citizens as foreshadowed, be within the ambit of the Commonwealth legislation for a State surcharge or rebate? Is there any justification for New South Wales introducing such a special tax at present?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I could further help the Leader of the Opposition by pointing out that there is special tax sharing legislation on the statute books of this Parliament, which has been passed by this Government and which provides for a State government to have the capacity either to give taxation rebates within its own State or to impose a tax surcharge. If in fact my understanding of what the New South Wales Treasurer has canvassed comes about, it is my understanding that it would be within the arrangements that now exist. That is the formal legal position. Of course, the political position is a separate matter altogether. I make it quite clear that, if in fact the New South Wales Government does invoke the provisions of the Commonwealth legislation, it will be a decision of the New South Wales Government to increase tax on the citizens of New South Wales as a result of the cumulative decisions of the New South Wales Government over the last six years.</PARA></TALK.START>

Removal costs will be reimbursed to Mr Rodda by this Department on presentation of the appropriate documents, these being a summary of estimates from three moving companies which quote cost and size of shipment of goods, and original receipts from the company effecting the removal. The maximum amount to be reimbursed to Mr Rodda is the cost of the lowest quote obtained.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it would be well known to the House that the problem of unemployment is experienced by the entire industrialised world. Levels of unemployment are as high as 13 per cent or more in the United Kingdom, 9.8 per cent in the United States, 7.7 per cent in West Germany and 9.1 per cent in France. I think it is relevant to reach some understanding of the reasons for the high levels of unemployment in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. They can be traced back to the exceptionally high levels of inflation experienced by the countries of the OECD area through the 1970s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In case some honourable members on the other side of the House seek to put the point of view that high levels of unemployment are a direct consequence of the application of firm monetary and fiscal policies, I invite them to look at the dismal experience of France over the last 12 months. I invite them to look at what happened when the Mitterrand Government came into power about 12 months ago . It made it perfectly clear that it would solve these problems by expanding the money supply, by letting the Budget deficit go out, and by generally expanding the public sector of the economy. After a period of 12 months even the socialist Government of President Mitterrand recognised that those policies were not the answer. I say to those opposite who believe in those sorts of policies, which are after all very close to the policies espoused and adopted by the Australian Labor Party, that they are not the solution to the unemployment and inflationary problems of the Western world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that Mr Justice Woodward in a distinguished career either is or has been a judge of the Australian Industrial Court, of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court, and of the Federal Court, President of the Trade Practices Tribunal and Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation? Has he conducted at least 10 inquiries for various Federal and State governments, including the seminal inquiry into the waterfront for the Menzies Government and the Aboriginal land rights inquiry for the Whitlam Government? Did Mr Justice Woodward spend 12 months scrutinising evidence in the meat substitution scandal before presenting his opinion in the report tabled yesterday? Is it a fact that by contrast the Prime Minister has no forensic, legal, judicial or quasi-judicial qualifications or experience and had the Woodward report for three days before rejecting its findings in relation to the Minister for Primary Industry? Can the Prime Minister inform honourable members of any reason why they should accept his credibility over that of such a distinguished jurist as Mr Justice Woodward?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1704" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Justice Woodward has a very distinguished record in many avenues. For a major part of his findings in the recent meat inquiry he did a very good job indeed. We endorse the recommendations that he made in the overwhelming number of cases. For example, when the meat substitution scandal arose, he endorsed the action that the Minister for Primary Industry took. He endorsed the security measures that the Minister for Primary Industry introduced and he indicated very plainly that as a result of measures that were undertaken the level of malpractice in the industry was at an historical all-time low. That is something which I am very thankful for and I am very glad that Mr Justice Woodward came to those findings. I think it is also worth noting that with 37 detectives and seven months after he had been constituted as a royal commissioner he failed to find any significant level of malpractice in the industry. That was in fact 26 months after the time in which Mr Kelly made his report available to the Minister for Primary Industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The one point of criticism of the Minister for Primary Industry related to whether he had acted with sufficient vigor in response to one finding of the Kelly report in relation to alleged malpractice at the time. I know that there are some people who might well argue that in the environment of that time-that is, January-February of 1980-that particular recommendation of the Kelly inquiry was in a sense a trivial one and that therefore the finding of Mr Justice Woodward in itself was a trivial one because it related to a trivial matter. It is perfectly plain in the evidence that no firm examples of malpractice were given to the Minister. It is perfectly plain in the evidence that Mr Kelly was not able to put into his report any examples of malpractice that could be acted upon. It is perfectly plain in the evidence before Mr Justice Woodward that the Minister for Primary Industry followed up with Mr Gee, who followed up with the secretary to the Kelly inquiry itself, Mr Landos, the question of whether there were matters that should be pursued either by the Department or by the police. In Mr Gee's evidence before the Royal Commission the answer was: 'No, it is vague, it is general, it is rumour, it is second-hand and nothing of that kind'. Against that background I have no hesitation at all in coming to the views that I related to the House yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also the other very interesting factor. How did certain elements of a very critical paragraph on page 66 of Mr Kelly's report get left out of Mr Kelly 's primary evidence before the Woodward Royal Commission? How was that error repeated in the findings and final document of the Royal Commission itself? Quite plainly, the Kelly report was saying that malpractice such as it was-he referred to it as 'minor skulduggery' at one point in evidence later-should be put right as and when a new Australian meat inspection service was introduced. That was made perfectly plain in a paragraph on page 66 of the Kelly report. The sections that were left out of that paragraph changed the meaning, affected its balance and led to the conclusion that Mr Kelly was saying that those matters should be put right now. That is not what he was saying. He was saying that they should be put right and that the turning over of a new page to a single meat inspection system would provide the opportunity for doing so. I believe the fact that those matters were left out of the findings of the Royal Commissioner's report, the final document presented to the Government and to the Parliament, and the fact that they were also left out of Mr Kelly's primary evidence which was read out to the Royal Commission indicate how easy it may have been for a miscarriage of justice to have occurred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations will be keeping very closely under review the process of the metal trades case. It would clearly be very important to achieve a minimum result, as low as possible, in relation to that. I think the honourable gentleman will be gratified to know that in relation to parliamentary, academic and a number of Public Service salaries around the Commonwealth, I think in three or four States there have been determinations of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent. That is obviously much better from the point of view of the health of this economy than the circumstances that occurred during last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of tariffs is obviously important. If an industry becomes uncompetitive because wages have gone up or hours have been shortened there is no case, on those grounds, for higher tariffs and greater protection. I think most honourable gentlemen in the House would also agree with that. I regret that one of the wage determinations in recent times in regard to which I expected strong support-I say it because of a need to be impartial in my comments and criticisms in relation to this matter-has come from the Government of Queensland and the Queensland Parliament. I believe there are no grounds whatever for a determination close to 12 per cent for Queensland parliamentarians, especially against the statement of only two or three months ago from the Premier that there would be a freeze on Queensland parliamentarians' salaries. I call upon the Premier of Queensland to establish the circumstances in which the salary levels of Queensland politicians do not rise more than those for the members of Federal Parliament and also to make sure that salary determinations for Queensland public servants, many of whom on a comparative basis are much more highly paid than those of the Commonwealth, do not increase by greater levels than those of Commonwealth employees.</PARA>

The Minister sought from Mr Gee of his Department, as a result of that meeting of 11 February 1980, advice as to whether they were matters that could be followed up. It is very clear from the debates yesterday, from the record of evidence, from Mr Kelly's evidence, which I will not repeat again in this House today, and from the report of Mr Kelly that there was no specific evidence of the sorts of matters which were alleged in the broadest and vaguest terms. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. Mr Landos, the secretary of the Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems, was not able to indicate to Mr Gee that there were specific matters that should be followed up either by the Department or by reference to the police. I think that puts the matter at rest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister sought to follow up the matters. Imagine somebody going along to the Australian Federal Police and saying: 'There is an allegation of bribery in the meat industry'. The police would ask: 'Which meatworks is it in? Which State is it in? Who is it against? Who are the people we are to go to?' With all the work in front of the police, that is quite an impossible situation in which to be. It is not something that can be pursued under those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is well worth noting that the Royal Commissioner said in the clearest terms that if he had been writing his own report with the evidence he had available to him in April 1982 it would have been a very different kind of report. Up to that time, with 37 detectives, he had uncovered no significant evidence of widespread malpractice in the industry. He went on to say that if he had written the report at that time it would have been a false and misleading report because he later uncovered those things. But that was after seven months of examination by the Royal Commissioner and 26 months after the time in which Mr Kelly handed in his report in entirely different circumstances. The matters could have been--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member has been one of a number of Western Australian members from this side of the House who have approached me to see whether there is any possibility of accelerating the base porting of Australian ships at HMAS Stirling. The facilities there are no doubt excellent. The maintenance and general berthing facilities are such that they have been used not only by ships of the Royal Australian Navy but also fairly extensively by ships of the United States Navy, whose presence we welcome in Australia. Representing as it does a very significant part of our obligations within ANZUS, we see that co-operation with United States naval vessels as being very much in this nation's interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have taken up with the Department of Defence and the Royal Australian Navy the possibility of ships being based at HMAS Stirling somewhat earlier than had originally been the intention. Of course, there is an added cost in base porting ships in Western Australia in the short term because there needs to be available accommodation for the wives of the personnel who will be stationed in Western Australia. The adequacy of housing is one of my prime concerns when looking at this question. At the moment I am in discussion with the Department. If there is any news that I can give of a somewhat earlier base porting than the 1984 date earlier announced I shall pass the information on to the honourable gentleman.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Tangney for a very timely question. I say to the honourable gentleman that a number of the significant recommendations of the Campbell report have already been implemented. I say to those who criticise the quality of that report that those recommendations which have been implemented have proved to be singularly successful. I refer, in particular, to the introduction of a tender system for the sale of Commonwealth bonds which, in my judgment and on the experience of the past few weeks, has proved to be an infinitely superior method of selling government paper to the system it replaced. There are some who would argue that the greater flexibility of a tender system for the sale of Commonwealth bonds in part contributed to the very welcome fall in interest rates which has occurred over the past week. It is a fall which now, in terms of secondary market trading, represents a fall of almost 2 per cent in the Commonwealth bond rate. So, in terms of that example, the implementation of a Campbell recommendation has proved to be very beneficial .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other recommendations in the banking area were implemented in concert with the Government's housing package which was announced on 18 March. I have already indicated publicly that the Government has had before it the matter of bank entry of both a foreign and a domestic nature. As the House will know, that is a complicated matter. The Government's consideration of it is continuing. There have been one or two other matters in my portfolio area in recent times but they will not preclude my giving full and early attention to further processing of what I continue to regard as a first class report.</PARA>

If the honourable member had read the Bill, he would have seen that the function of the special prosecutor is to have responsibility for criminal prosecutions and also to co- ordinate civil proceedings that might be brought on behalf of the Commonwealth. His responsibility is not only to make reports but to do work of a very important nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is very fortunate that we have been able to secure the services of Mr Gyles for this purpose. He is a very distinguished Queen's Counsel and a member of the New South Wales Bar. He has had experience as counsel in the Moffitt Royal Commission into Allegations of Organised Crime in Clubs in New South Wales and also in the second Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking. He will have supporting him a full and adequate task force consisting of lawyers, accountants and police officers. Indeed, he has already, in the short time since he was appointed, started to devote himself to his responsibilities. I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Gyles will be applying himself with vigour and enthusiasm to the task. I have no doubt whatsoever that an extremely good appointment has been made. I also add that the Government has acted very promptly indeed in the appointment of Mr Gyles, because the Bill received the royal assent last night and Mr Gyles was appointed this morning.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of halal slaughter and certification was a very difficult one for Mr Justice Woodward to handle. I believe that he is to be congratulated for the very frank and constructive recommendations he came forward with. The question is a very sensitive one because it involves religious and commercial practices. When proposals are being brought forward there must be an endeavour by overseas governments, along with Moslem bodies in this country which have been involved and are involved in the inspection, as well as the industry, to see that something is workable. Mr Justice Woodward has put forward proposals which the Government will be acting upon to see that they follow the work that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation has already put into place this year. It is important that these be pursued so that we have satisfactory arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I value very highly our markets for sheep meat, particularly in the Middle East ; but if that market is to be maintained there has to be credibility as to the way in which certification is undertaken. The Woodward report expressed some concern at practices which have been carried on in the past. I am also concerned about the reports that have emanated. I have already sent messages to trade officers in the Middle East and Kuala Lumpur so that they actually have the findings of the Royal Commission and can respond to queries or concerns that people there might have. I think it is fair to point out-everyone should remember this-that Mr Justice Woodward has stated that there is no reason to believe that there has been any malpractice in relation to halal slaughter and certification in recent months or that there is likely to be any in the future if arrangements along the lines recommended by him are able to be put into place . We will certainly be doing our best-as I said, it is a difficult issue to handle-to see that all parties come together and there is one single system for issuing certification.</PARA>

Let me only say that I believe that pursuit of the course that is implicit in the honourable member's suggestion is totally consistent with the thrust of my own remarks on this matter. I have indicated that the support that countries around the world have been able to give to Israel depends upon the moral claim that Israel has to their support.

Without making any final commitment on the basis of making an actual and formal request, let me only say that that kind of examination to let the facts be known and to show that Israel is determined to see that the right thing is done is surely very important in helping to maintain the moral strength of the state of Israel.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to add to an answer that I gave to the honourable member for Port Adelaide on 16 September last week. On that day the honourable member for Port Adelaide asked me a question regarding a company called Hotchkiss Pty Ltd. He also asked me whether certain criminal proceedings relating to that company were withheld because I had personally intervened. In answering that question I dealt with the second part and denied any intervention by me, a denial which I now repeat. I subsequently referred the entire question to the Commissioner of Taxation. Naturally, the Commissioner is precluded by the provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act from disclosing information regarding the affairs of Hotchkiss or, indeed, the affairs of Mr McDonald, the person referred to in my answer to the honourable member for Port Adelaide. However, the Commissioner has informed me that he feels no inhibition at all in saying that he knows of no case in which a former leader of the Liberal Party anywhere or a company with which such a person was associated was saved from any proceedings, criminal or otherwise, by the intervention of me or any other political figure. That is the advice of the Commissioner. It confirms, so far as my own actions are concerned , the substance of the reply I gave last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one other matter I should mention. In 1979 the same Mr McDonald wrote to me requesting that I investigate the possibility that information regarding his taxation affairs could have been improperly disclosed by the Australian Taxation Office. I had this matter investigated and I was satisfied by the Commissioner of Taxation that no improper disclosure had occurred. I communicated the result of that investigation to Mr McDonald. To the best of my recollection-I have not yet been able to check my diaries in terms of dates of appointments-Mr McDonald wrote to me at about the same time that the conversation to which I referred on 16 September took place. In fact, he may well have handed me his letter at that discussion. It is probable that the subject matter of Mr McDonald's letter was mentioned during the conversation to which I referred in the House last week. Let me simply repeat that any suggestion, either in the honourable member's question or elsewhere, that I intervened to stop a prosecution against Mr McDonald or anyone else is untrue. I have felt it desirable and appropriate to provide this additional information to the House to put beyond doubt any suggestions of impropriety on the part of me or any member of the Government on the matter.</PARA>

The recommendation was for prosecution. The Treasurer replied that he had seen Mr McDonald.

The Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances ( 1982) was tabled in this House on 18 August this year. With the Waste Management Code, these codes provide a basic framework upon which appropriate regulatory machinery can be established to control and regulate uranium mining and milling operations in Australia. I turn now to a discussion of the tabled code, the Waste Management Code.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In accordance with the object of the Nuclear Codes Act, the Waste Management Code provides, both in the short term and in the long term, for the protection of people and the environment from the possible harmful effects associated with radioactive waste arising from all stages of the mining and milling of radioactive ores. To meet this objective, the Code provides for prior development and approval-and subsequent up-dating-of a waste management program for each mining and milling operation to which it applies. In practical terms, an overall waste management program should be approved and implemented from the inception of each operation, and the details of the program updated throughout the operational and post-operational phases. This approach should ensure that waste management is conducted in the manner best suited to the particular circumstances of each operation. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with current international radiation protection philosophy, the Code specifies that exposure of employees and members of the public derived from radioactive mining and milling wastes will be as low as reasonably achievable. Furthermore, exposure of individuals must be below the relevant limits prescribed by the Code of Practice on Radiation Protection in the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores (1980). The Code also gives recognition to the long term requirements for the minimisation of radiation exposure associated with radioactive wastes from mining and milling operations. Honourable members will note the requirement for the use of the 'best practicable technology' to ensure that the release of radioactive materials is minimised during all stages of the operations and after completion of such operations. This requirement is a significant element of the Code. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that the Code is a succinct document and is presented in a regulatory format. This format has been adopted so as to enable the appropriate State and Territory authorities to readily incorporate the Code into their respective regulatory processes. To assist the mining industry in meeting its responsibilities under the Code, advisory material in the form of guidelines to the Code is also being prepared and will be published separately from time to time. I note also that the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act provides for revision of codes approved under the Act, and accordingly the Waste Management Code will be revised and updated from time to time to ensure that it continues to embody the highest standards of protection for the people of Australia and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier, the three codes covering radiation protection, transport and waste management provide the basic framework for the effective control and regulation of uranium mining and milling in Australia. The development of these codes highlights the effective consultative mechanism which has developed between the Commonwealth and State and Northern Territory governments. The Government does not believe that the imposition of the codes by the Commonwealth upon the States is the appropriate mechanism for their successful implementation. In view of the States and the Northern Territory legislative competence in the areas of environmental, health, and safety protection the Government has closely involved them in the formulation of codes and guidelines. The codes have in fact been drafted by a Commonwealth-State Consultative Committee chaired by my Department. Involvement of all relevant governments in this exercise leads to a consistent approach towards code development and the achievement of adequate health, safety and environmental protection associated with uranium mining and milling operations. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of the consultative approach which has been followed we expect that codes approved under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act will be adopted by the appropriate State or Territory government as the uranium industry is developed. Indeed the Radiation Protection Code and the Transport Code have already been adopted in one form or another by those States or Territories where uranium mining and milling is underway. I commend the Waste Management Code to honourable members' attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-We are the only uranium producing nation in the world that is pushing into uranium development under a government that has no tight national regulatory framework under which to operate with regard to such very important industrial and environmental matters as mining safety, the monitoring of tailing dams, water discharge, waste management, environment protection programs and so forth. What we do have is a very complex mishmash of Federal and State interlocking legislation such as the Federal Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act under which the Code has been presented. It allows for the development and approval of codes of practices on the management of radioactive wastes for mining and milling of radioactive ores. Having done that, we must then depend upon the Northern Territory Uranium Mining ( Environment Control) Act under which the Territory Minister may or may not permit that Code to operate and may permit mining to proceed under certain conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Behind that, there is another Federal Act called the Environment Protection ( Alligator Rivers Region) Act which set up the Office of the Supervising Scientist and then starved it of funds and staff, making it a toothless tiger, a watchdog without teeth, because under the legislation, even if the Supervising Scientist finds that breaches of any mining code have in fact occurred, no penalties are provided for. Under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act , States and Territories should enact legislation to implement these codes of practice which the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) has introduced into the House today. But they are not compelled to do so. That is the important thing. There is no obligation on them to do so under that Act. Certainly, the nuclear codes Act provides emergency powers which authorise a Federal Minister to impose emergency regulations, but only in the Northern Territory and then for a period not exceeding three months. So, in effect, the States can do what they like. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister acknowledged this in his speech today. Just a few seconds ago, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The development of these codes highlights the effective consultative mechanism which has developed between the Commonwealth and State and Northern Territory governments. The Government does not believe that the imposition of the codes by the Commonwealth upon the States is the appropriate mechanism for their successful implementation. In view of the States and the Northern Territory legislative competence-</PARA>
<PARA>I dwell on those words:</PARA>
<PARA> in the areas of environmental, health, and safety protection the Government has closely involved them in the formulation of codes and guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Territory Government may have legislative competence but it has not illustrated that it has practical competence on the ground. In the concluding minutes of my address I shall prove that. To do so, I return to the Code itself because this Code which has been put on the table of the House today sets out in Part II the duties and responsibilities of the State governments but, more particularly, of the owner, the operator and the manager. It talks about a proposed waste management program, together with the assessment of potential radiological impacts of the radioactive wastes arising from all stages of the mining and milling operation, being prepared and submitted to the appropriate authority for approval. It then goes on to talk about monitoring programs being policed by appropriate authority and the need for sufficient staff with qualifications and experience acceptable to the appropriate authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Who determines what is the appropriate authority? Not the Federal Government, because there is no overall tight regulatory framework under which the industry should operate. That is left in this case to the Northern Territory Government to determine. Whom does it consider to be the appropriate authority? In most cases, with regard to Ranger and Nabarlek, it has turned out to be the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy-not the Department of Home Affairs and Environment, I might add. It is like asking a rabbit not to eat lettuce to ask the Department of Mines and Energy not to promote a situation which would be conducive to the continuation of mining and milling at all times. Of course, as far as water controls are concerned, the Controller of Water Resources in the Northern Territory ends up with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to give three examples of what has resulted. I see that the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) is going to give a lengthy diatribe on uranium when I have finished. I will put something to him before I finish which I hope he will digress to answer. It will be a heaven-sent opportunity for him to do so . I conclude with three examples. The first concerns Nabarlek. On 7 March 1981- all this is occurring under the tight regulatory framework whereby the Northern Territory Government is doing this Government's job, and doing so in a competent manner, so the Government says-Queensland Mines Ltd at Nabarlek covered up a major unauthorised discharge for four months before the Supervising Scientist in the Department of Mines and Energy and the Controller of Water Resources finally got on to it. I said then in this House:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Northern Territory authorities are unable to control the small Nabarlek operation, how can they stop a disaster occurring at the much larger mines of Jabiluka and Ranger?</PARA>
<PARA>That was borne out just a few months later. In November 1981 at Ranger tailings in the dam were exposed for approximately two weeks-here is the ludicrous point- up to and during the actual opening ceremony of Ranger. The Minister for Trade and Resources was there at the very time the tailings were exposed. Apparently he did not know about it, nor did these Northern Territory officials tell him about it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No? It could. It looks as if it has. The Minister is looking pretty seedy these days. I conclude on this note: A more serious problem than the Nabarlek and Ranger incidents has arisen. I have been informed today by the staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service that a major fault exists within the tailings dam at Ranger. The dam was not built down to bedrock and now the ground water is rising from underneath the tailings dam. It appears that the hydrostatic pressure of the water in the tailings dam is forcing radioactive contaminated water underneath the dam. I am told that the Government, through this Minister, was informed of this situation two months ago. It has not acted nor informed this Parliament of what can or should be done to protect the environment of Kakadu National Park. The tailings dam has operated for only a year and already it has failed. Measures must be carried out to repair the design fault and the mine closed immediately if necessary. This episode is further evidence of the lack of adequate controls over the uranium industry in the Northern Territory under this complex mishmash of legislation that the Minister has just said is effective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the incident that I have just disclosed, I ask both the Minister for Trade and Resources and the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, who by a fortuitous set of circumstances now sit opposite me: Why has the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment not divulged this information? Does he actually know about it? Is my information correct? Does the Minister for Trade and Resources, besides the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, know? Do they have reports prepared by either the Supervising Scientist or the Northern Territory Government? If they do have reports, how long have they been sitting on them? I think this chain of events illustrates the fact that I have put to the Minister, that what he is doing in the uranium industry is pushing ahead in a declining market and in a situation which he absolutely refused, because of some misguided concept about State rights, to impose the regulatory safety network under which it is essential for this industry to proceed, if indeed it does. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I enter this debate simply to raise a matter of concern to me. The tenor of the statement of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) suggests that great protection will be provided to those involved in the uranium industry by this Waste Management Code . The point has already been made by my colleague the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), that the real weakness in the Government's position is that whether the code is adopted in part or in whole, or indeed whether it is rejected, is a matter that is entirely up to a particular State or the Government of a Territory. If the Minister had brought this Code into the Parliament and if the Government had been honest in its dealings with the Parliament on this matter, he should have introduced this statement and indicated that, as a result of negotiations with all relevant States and Territories, the Government had already obtained a clear and forthright undertaking that the code would be adopted. On that basis the House could treat the statement of the Minister with some seriousness. But if one looks at the Minister's statement, the doubts which I am expressing, and which I think honourable members must share, can be highlighted. The Minister stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the Code specified that exposure of employees and members of the public derived from radioactive mining and milling wastes will be as low as reasonably achievable. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to state-this is the heart of it:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we expect that codes approved under the Nuclear Codes Act will be adopted by the appropriate State or Territory Government as the uranium industry is developed. </PARA>
<PARA>When is the uranium industry developed? Is it developed to the satisfaction of the Government of the Northern Territory or any other government at a time when there are two or three yellowcake mines in full production? Is the uranium industry developed, as is the case with Nabarlek, when in fact all the mining has been completed and the yellowcake is being processed? It is not good enough when we talk about the problems involved-the safety and other hazards-in uranium production for the Minister to come into the House and say: 'Look, we have really been very responsible. We have this great code, but do not ask us to tell you when it is to be implemented or whether it will be implemented. We hope it will be. We are going to leave it to the relevant governments of States or Territories to implement this code as, when and how they deem it desirable'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One only has to look at the track record of certain State administrations in this area. Rum Jungle-what occurred there and what was left to be cleaned up-stands as an indictment of the capacity to enforce proper environmental safeguards in respect of uranium mining. In the case of the leak that took place at Nabarlek, despite all the legislation which was passed by this Parliament-we were told of the safety factors involved by the Supervising Scientist-the company got round to notifying the Supervising Scientist when it suited it. In fairness to the Government of the Northern Territory, at the moment it is highly doubtful whether it has sufficient officers with the technical capacity required to carry out the procedures seriously to enforce these codes. If the Commonwealth wants to pass over its obligations in these matters to a State it should at least be satisfied that the infrastructure and the financial resources of the State are sufficient to enable it to carry out its duties. Frankly, I think it is highly doubtful constitutionally whether the Commonwealth of Australia can continue to say that we are parties to international treaties and we accept our prime responsibilities as parties to international treaties in respect of uranium production when in fact the Commonwealth, wherever it can, is now shedding its responsibility in these matters and is saying that the problems of mining and the problems of safety essentially are a State responsibility. I believe, as has already been pointed out by the honourable member for Cunningham, shadow Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, that those standards are not good enough. It is not good enough for the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, who is at the table, simply to expect this Parliament to be satisfied about the hazards that are involved and the capacity of governments to deal with those hazards, particularly in areas which are so environmentally and ecologically fragile as the Alligator Rivers Region and the Kakadu National Park. One ought to be satisfied, when the Minister talks in such glib terms about how good this code is, that there have been undertakings clearly given, that exist now, that this code will become part of the law and practice of the State and, more importantly, that the State has an infrastructure and a capacity to administer and enforce that code. If it does not have the resources to do that the Commonwealth ought to be prepared to provide those resources. I would like the Minister's comments on those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is a good opportunity for them to update their thinking. They must realise also and admit that the present Budget is a superb one. If they had seen fit to read the Budget Papers, they would realise that some of the matters that are concerning them are dealt with in those Budget Papers.

<PARA> The Government has agreed to the construction of a laboratory for the Office of the Supervising Scientist which is estimated by the Australian Science and Technology Council to cost $5.4m. The significant part of that laboratory will be situated at Jabiru, on the spot, so that the necessary monitoring activities can take place as soon as possible. At Darwin there will be the necessary computer facilities and certain other laboratory facilities which it is more appropriate to situate in that city. I also advise Opposition members that at present the Supervising Scientist, Mr R. Fry, has permission from me to increase his staff in the vicinity of five to seven officers. At present he is recruiting those officers. Some uncomplimentary remarks were passed about the Northern Territory. </PARA>

In addition, the Territory has other sources of funds, including the payment by the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory in lieu of royalty on uranium sales. The initiative in establishing a top class facility costing $5.4m on the site at Jabiru, with associated computer facilities at Darwin, plus a generous financial commitment and an increase in staff for the OSS, indicates that we do not repeat words meaninglessly. We act, we are concerned and we keep up with modern technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), seemed to get a little mixed up in his speech. If he reads his 'greens' he will find this out. At one stage he said that he did not know about a leak in the tailings dam from Ranger. In the next breath he more or less asked: Does the Minister know? I am just a simple soul, but I find some difficulty in equating the honourable member saying on the one hand that he did not know-obviously he is a little concerned that the document which fell off the back of a truck was a fake- because his following question was: Does the Minister know?</PARA>

If he believes it is appropriate to report more often he does so. The Supervising Scientist did report to me on the Ranger tailings dam. So the officer of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service who wrote to the honourable member did write the truth. The honourable member for Cunningham can be assured that it was not a fake. He was not pulling the honourable member's leg. The Supervising Scientist has reported this matter to me. Unlike the honourable member, he is a technical man who does know what it is all about. He advised me that there is no adverse environmental effect at present and that appropriate action is being taken to ensure that no adverse effects will arise in the future. I hope the honourable member is listening. Further, he said that no contaminated water has been detected and that there is no threat to the present stability of the dam wall. He also informed me-the honourable member does not know, does not understand and is not keen to find out-that the problem is not unusual in constructions of this nature. He also advised me that the extensive monitoring system in place has enabled early detection so that corrective action can be taken. I will leave the matter at that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In 1977, the Government presented to the Parliament policies designed to allow the further mining and export of Australian uranium. I report today, five years later, that we have a vigorous, profitable and expanding industry. Production, exports and employment in the industry are at record levels. A high rate of expenditure on exploration is unfolding ever increasing reserves of uranium ore. The Aboriginal peoples in the Northern Territory uranium province have new, secure and independent sources of income. These achievements have not come about by accident. They are the direct result of the Government's determination to address the complex issues involved in a painstaking and responsible manner. We have, patiently but persistently, evaluated all aspects of uranium development for peaceful purposes. In doing so we have been acutely aware of the need for effective safeguards against any possibility of Australian uranium being used for military or explosive purposes. Our concern to protect the health and safety of people involved in the extraction and handling of uranium has been reflected in regulatory standards without equal in any other work environments. The industry's environmental protection measures have set new standards. Above all, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have succeeded in developing a major and secure source of energy for a world which has in so many ways paid heavily for over-dependence on insecure sources of oil. Our nation of 15 million people has a large share of the world's endowment of natural resources. Our policy is to develop these resources, so that all Australians and the other 4,500 million members of mankind may, directly and indirectly, benefit from them. The plain fact is, that nuclear electricity is indispensable to the world's economy. Installed nuclear electricity capacity will at least double by 1990. So, too, will uranium consumed by civil nuclear reactors. Few, if any, other commodities have demand growth prospects as assured as uranium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, seven years ago, when the Liberal-National Country Party coalition was returned to office, we inherited a uranium industry that lacked direction and purpose and had virtually wasted away. Within weeks of being returned to office in December 1975, we announced that mining companies would be permitted to resume exploration for uranium in the Northern Territory. We also established new guidelines for private investment in uranium projects and maintenance of Australian control. The final report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry was completed in 1977. The course which we then charted was based on the findings and recommendations of the most extensive public enquiry undertaken anywhere in the world on the uranium industry. Today, five years later, the measure of the Government's achievement can be documented in facts. </PARA>
<PARA> First, Australia's known reserves of uranium are at record levels. Australia now has the largest low cost uranium reserves of any country in the Western world, some 294,000 tonnes U equivalent to some 19 per cent of the Western world 's reasonably assured resources capable of being mined at a cost below $US80 per kilogram U. These figures do not include the Olympic Dam deposit at Roxby Downs in South Australia, where firm ore reserves cannot be established until further intensive drilling is completed. Preliminary indications, however, are that the Olympic Dam deposit could contain more than one million tonnes of uranium. That would be equivalent to almost half the Western world's present reasonably assured resources of uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, Australian uranium production is now at record levels: 3,300 tonnes U3O8 in 1981 and estimated to exceed 5,000 tonnes U3O8 in 1982. Third, uranium exports are at record levels valued at $164m in 1981 and an estimated $290m in 1982. Last month alone, some 1,000 tonnes of uranium concentrates valued in excess of $80m were shipped from Darwin and Brisbane. Fourth, tonnages contracted to overseas buyers under long term sales contracts are at record levels. Since August 1977, I have approved contracts for more than 44,000 tonnes U3O8 valued at more than $3,500m in current terms. More contracts are being negotiated. The Government's uranium policies have meant that this marketing success has been achieved without disrupting the world market. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifth, investment in uranium production is at record levels: More than $400m in mines already operating and more than $1,000m additional when new projects which have already received development approval are commissioned. There are prospects for even larger investments associated with the development of the Koongarra deposit in the Northern Territory, the Ben Lomond deposit in Queensland and the Beverley and Olympic Dam deposits in South Australia, when these projects meet the Government's requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixth, consistent with our belief that mineral exploration and development are a pursuit for private enterprise, the Government in 1980 satisfactorily divested its interest in the Ranger project at a price of $229m, including a premium of $ 125m. This divestment led directly to the formation of a consortium of uranium producers and consumers, enabling valuable long term contracts to be written for the sale of uranium from Ranger. These contracts, in fact, represented the largest export sale ever recorded by an Australian company. Seventh, employment in the industry is at record levels. As with most capital intensive industries, there are also very substantial employment generating effects in the other industries supplying goods and other services to the Australian uranium industry . Moreover, the industry enjoys high productivity, with attractive rewards and first-rate facilities for its work force. At the new uranium town of Jabiru in the Northern Territory, for example, some $92m has already been spent in providing housing and community facilities which set new standards for mining townships. </PARA>
<PARA> Eighth, the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers uranium province of the Northern Territory have negotiated with mining companies secure and independent sources of income with which to fund their own social and economic development projects. No longer will they be totally dependent on the discretion of the Government of the day. Payments to the Aboriginal community from uranium projects in the Northern Territory are expected to exceed $12m in the current financial year, with prospects of substantially higher payments in later years. Ninth, strict regulations and controls have been implemented to protect the environment. The Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act of 1978 established the statutory office of Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region and two associated bodies, the Co-ordinating Committee for the Alligator Rivers Region and the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute. The Northern Territory has also enacted complementary environmental protection legislation. Mining operations are authorised and closely monitored by the Northern Territory supervising authorities under the provisions of the Uranium Mining (Environmental Control) Act. Tenth, the Government has developed uniform codes of practice under the legislative framework of the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act of 1978. These codes, developed in consultation with the State and Northern Territory governments, cover health and safety, waste management and transport in relation to radioactive materials. </PARA>
<PARA> Eleventh, the Government has negotiated and entered into nuclear safeguards agreements with the European Atomic Energy Community-Euratom-Canada, Finland, France, Japan, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. These agreements have set new standards. They include provisions for fall-back safeguards, sanctions for non- compliance, Australian consent before uranium can be retransferred, reprocessed or enriched above 20 per cent, physical security, and use only for peaceful purposes in addition, provide for detailed administrative arrangements setting out how the obligations of each party are to be met. </PARA>
<PARA> Twelfth, our preparedness to make available uranium for purposes of electricity generation to energy needy countries has enhanced Australia's prestige and influence in international bodies dealing with disarmament, nuclear non- proliferation and energy policies. In a wider strategic sense also, Australia's preparedness to share its uranium resources, subject to foreign policy and safeguards requirements, is a positive contribution to peaceful nuclear co- operation. It will have important implications in a world seeking to reduce its dependence on oil and to diversify its energy sources. It will benefit, directly and indirectly, non-oil-producing developing countries which would otherwise be forced to spend even more of their scarce foreign exchange on what would, in the absence of nuclear power, be even higher priced sources of conventional energy. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the measure of our achievement over the last five years. Everyone associated with it is proud to have contributed to an outstanding development effort: I and my colleagues in the Federal Government, our counterparts in the Northern Territory Government, the Aboriginal membership of the Northern Land Council and, very importantly, the management and pioneering work force of the uranium projects. I pay a special tribute today to the companies which have unlocked this vast resource for Australia and to all who have been associated with them. In many ways they were taking a great step into the unknown. They never lost confidence, however, in their ventures, or in this nation, and that confidence is now being justifiably rewarded. Major new enterprises have been built, sparsely populated regions of Australia are being opened up, and thousands of jobs have been created. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, I think it is appropriate for me to note the attitude of the Opposition to this great industry. I think it is important for this House , and for all Australians, to realise clearly what the effects of the policies currently endorsed by the Labor Party will mean. The Labor Party's recent Federal Conference endorsed a policy which was widely represented as a compromise. I think it should be understood that in real terms it was nothing of the sort. The truth is that the Labor Party's current policy on uranium, if it can be even dignified with that term, is simply an attempt to draw a veil over what was increasingly obviously a policy as naked of political reality as it was of commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party remains committed to opposing new uranium development. It is now committed to the slow strangulation of existing mines, instead of instant beheading. Under the mumbo-jumbo of its conference decision, Labor remains committed to destroying a multi-billion dollar export industry, destroying thousands of jobs and shattering relations with Australia's major trading partners by destroying the basis of their energy programs. This policy is as lacking in substance as the veil I compared it to earlier, except in its determination to halt uranium mining. It is bound up inextricably, however, with the internal politics of the Labor Party, as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) will be only too aware. His support for a sensible policy on uranium cost him the leadership of his party and he can truthfully claim to be the first Australian politician injured in a nuclear incident. </PARA>
<PARA> The incident that temporarily halted his ambitions and maintained those of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has, however, not ended. The heartland of the left wing of the Labor Party in Victoria has voted to re-open the uranium debate in the party on 3 October. I believe that conference will expose the total hypocrisy of the ALP on this issue. The fact that it has occurred at all is witness to the power of the left wing and the inability of honourable members opposite to make any commitment without the full support of that party within a party. It is a further demonstration of the bankruptcy of the ALP on this vital issue. Let there be no misunderstanding. If a future Labor government were ever to put this policy into action and so destroy our international trading reputation, the ramifications would be felt throughout Australia because of the importance of exports to our overall economy. Labor's uranium policies would condemn all Australians because the Labor Party resolutely refuses to acknowledge what the effects of those policies would be in the real world. Our trading relations would be severely jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the prospects of the industry. A great deal of publicity has been given in recent times to cancellations and deferments of construction of nuclear power plants. Declining world-wide rates of growth in electricity demand have indeed affected nuclear and other electricity construction programs. So too have high interest rates and delays in the United States in instituting a better co- ordinated regulatory system. Some anti-nuclear extremists have asserted that this marks the beginning of the end for the nuclear power industry. They claim that there will be no market for Australian uranium. Nothing could be further from the truth. Those who condemn and wish to close the Australian uranium industry conveniently ignore the facts. Despite cancellations and deferments, the rate of growth of nuclear power has been, and will continue to be, higher than that of any other significant form of electricity generation. Australian uranium production is competitive in world terms, and long term export contracts continue to be negotiated at prices at least double the present low prices for spot sales. Spot sales account for less than 10 per cent of the world uranium market, and it is totally misleading to regard them as indicators of prices at which the overwhelming bulk of market transactions take place. </PARA>
<PARA> When in August 1977 the Government announced its decision to permit the further mining and export of uranium, I said that there were then 184 nuclear power plants in operation, with a capacity of 88,000 megawatts of electricity, plus another 214 plants under construction. Now, five years later there are 265 plants in operation, with a capacity of 158,000 megawatts, plus 221 plants under construction. In other words, during the last five years nuclear power generating capacity in the world has increased by 80 per cent. Some 81 new units have been completed during that period, an average of more than one a month. Moreover, it is important to recognise that the capital cost of each 1,000- megawatt nuclear electricity plant exceeds one billion dollars. The level of total investment by electricity authorities around the world represented by these figures is, therefore, a sign of real confidence and growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The average rate of increase in the availability of nuclear electricity has been 12 per cent per year since 1977, far above the general rate of increase in demand for electricity in the world during that period. It occurred despite the setbacks of low economic activity, declining rates of demand for electricity and problems of financing and licensing. The present installed nuclear capacity represents seven per cent of the world's total electricity generating capacity, producing approximately nine per cent of the world's electricity. In some countries the nuclear contribution to actual electricity production is much higher. In 1981 it was 38 per cent for France, 36 per cent for Sweden, 15 per cent for Japan, 14 per cent for the Federal Republic of Germany, 13 per cent for the United Kingdom and 12 per cent for the United States. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency estimates that by 1985 individual countries' dependence on nuclear power as a source of electricity production will be of the order of 55 per cent in France and Belgium , 40 per cent in Sweden, 30 per cent in Finland and Spain, 25 per cent in the Federal Republic of Germany and 20 per cent in Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. It has been estimated that the share of electricity produced by nuclear power world wide will be 17 per cent in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence is clear and incontestable. Given the enormous capital investment involved, the continuing and increasing commitment to nuclear electricity in countries all over the world would not be occurring if, as some claim, nuclear electricity was not an economic alternative. Cost comparisons do, of course, have to be treated with some care, as actual generation costs in the various plant types are subject to particular conditions regarding capital investment, lead time, interest rates, fuel prices, environmental controls, waste disposal and so on. On the basis of detailed economic studies, however, the International Energy Agency and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency concluded in April this year that nuclear power is invariably much less costly than oil and in many situations considerably cheaper than coal as a means of producing electricity. Their report noted, for example, that the cost of nuclear power generation in the European Economic Community is some 50 to 70 per cent less than that of electricity generation from oil-fired plants. Although the competitive advantage of nuclear over coal-fired generation does vary from country to country, in the EEC that advantage is of the order of 20 to 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also necessary to set in a proper perspective some immediate difficulties facing the world uranium industry. On a world basis there is, at present, excess production capacity and a large uranium inventory overhang. Additionally, uncommitted demand is, in the short term, relatively small. Within the United States, the world's major producer, a long-overdue shakeout of relatively high- cost producers is taking place, with numerous mine closures and heavy cutbacks in production. That situation is entirely a product of United States' domestic economic, regulatory and industry policies, combined with a decline in some United States ore grades. It has, however, given rise to renewed pressures to protect the United States' industry from foreign competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last week a joint House conference of the United States Congress decided to recommend a series of legislative provisions which, if enacted, would intensify the level of restrictions applicable to United States' imports of uranium. They would result in a prohibition of further sales to United States electric power utilities by Australian and other foreign uranium producers if and when actual or projected uranium imports reached a level of 37.5 per cent of actual or projected United States uranium requirements. Those recommendations may be legislated by Congress this week by way of amendments to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Authorisation Bill. They are currently the subject of high -level representations to the United States Government, and I do not propose to deal with them in detail in this statement. I can say, however, that the proposed restrictions, if enacted, would in time have detrimental effects on the world uranium market. They would exacerbate the growing imbalance of trading opportunities between Australia and the United States. They would, moreover, impair the United States Government's efforts to restore international confidence in its role as a predictably reliable partner in the development of a world-wide civil nuclear power industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, because we do have the largest low-cost uranium reserves in the Western World and because we are a relative newcomer to the world uranium market it will, given continuing good management, be inevitable that the Australian share of the market will increase. Long term uranium supply contracts have already been entered into with major electricity generating authorities in Belgium, Finland, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Sweden and the United States. Notwithstanding a short term oversupply those electricity authorities have moved promptly and decisively to protect the security of their future uranium supplies by entering into long term contractual relationships with Australian producers. The Government is determined that these supply commitments will be honoured. There can be no question of breaking solemn undertakings to foreign partners. </PARA>
<PARA> There are risks associated with mankind's use of uranium, as with everything else. They include risks of diversion for military purposes and health and safety risks in the peaceful uses of radioactive materials. But we cannot put the clock back. Nuclear science is here and widely disseminated. As far as the first category of risks is concerned, the whole thrust of the Government's policies has been to ensure that Australian uranium is used only for peaceful purposes. Nuclear weapons are a perversion of the use of uranium, which is a valuable energy material for today and a crucial fuel for the future. Australia' s stringent safeguards policies and controls have been explicitly designed to pre-empt the possibility of Australian uranium, or any nuclear material derived from it, ever being used in a military application. The second category of risks , related to the health and safety issues, is associated mainly with the use of uranium as a source of energy in electricity generation. In this respect, risk probability analysis in the world-wide nuclear electricity industry has probably been applied more exhaustively than to any other industry. The fact is that man is, and always has been, subject to radiation. The real question is whether radiation associated with the use of uranium for peaceful purposes can be contained to acceptably safe levels. The overwhelming evidence is that it can. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern has been whether highly radioactive waste can be safely managed and disposed of. Again, the advice of the Government's scientific advisers, their counterparts in other countries, and the International Atomic Energy Agency is a categoric yes. The main question for the future is which of the several available waste disposal methods would be the most appropriate to adopt on a commercial basis. The Synroc method has been developed by the Australian National University and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. It provides for the incorporation of radioactive waste elements within the crystalline structure of synthetic minerals which are closely related to those which occur in nature and have trapped and retained radioactive substances for many millions of years. The Synroc material is designed for disposal by deep burial in stable geologic environments where it would remain stable for many thousands of years. The Government has recently announced a further grant of $1m in support of the continued development of this process on a commercial scale. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to read a major report entitled 'Shaping Tomorrow' based on the work of a group of 60 scientists, technologists and engineers and published as a discussion paper by the Methodist Church in the United Kingdom. I have placed a copy in the Parliamentary Library. Chapter III of the report is based on a two-year study of nuclear power, and essentially concludes that nuclear energy offers mankind an energy source which we cannot afford to set aside as it is very large and cost-effective. It concluded also that the risks associated with nuclear power are not disproportionate to those of other energy sources and other ordinary hazards. Indeed, in assessing the acceptability of any technology , one needs to consider also the situation which would exist without that technology. If nuclear power plants were to be replaced by other forms of electricity generation, one would need to consider such aspects as the additional industrial and environmental hazards arising from the generation of that electricity by substitute means. If uranium were to be left in the ground one would need to consider the effects of limiting national wealth on such things as social services, education and defence. In any event, if Australian uranium were to be left in the ground, other more expensive supplies would be forthcoming from other sources around the globe. In those circumstances, however , Australia might be unable to influence or control the end-use of such uranium or nuclear materials derived from it. We would, moreover, be regarded by the world community as latter-day Luddites-muddled thinkers, selfishly denying our resources to less fortunate and energy-deficient countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues involved in the uranium debate are complex and make it difficult for an individual observer to assess all the relevant issues. In that respect the Ranger inquiry performed a signal service for all Australians with its scrupulous regard for analytical objectivity. On the Government's part, that objectivity has been matched with a high sense of responsibility in the way our uranium development and associated policies have been implemented. It is true that these painstaking efforts have at times meant, as with the Ranger inquiry itself, that progress has been slower than some would have wished. The Government has, however, been determined that its responsibilities to all Australians for uranium development are discharged, and seen to be discharged, in a completely trustworthy manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The care and probity exercised by the Ranger inquiry and by the Government itself has been a major factor in the steady development of a national consensus in favour of uranium mining and export. That growing consensus is borne out by the latest public opinion poll published in the Bulletin on 10 August 1982. In response to an Australia-wide survey on whether Australia should, or should not, develop and export uranium for peaceful purposes, 66 per cent of respondents answered yes. Nine per cent were undecided and 25 per cent said no, the lowest negative response recorded since our uranium policies were announced in 1977. The Australian industry had, by 1975, been reduced to a shambles. Not one tonne of uranium had been produced during the years of the previous Government from the vast reserves discovered while earlier Liberal-National Country Party governments had been in office. Exploration and development had virtually ceased , despite the situation overseas where the industry was enjoying buoyant conditions in the wake of the first oil shock. Our potential customers were, in disgust, turning to our overseas competitors.</PARA>
<PARA> We now have a healthy, growing industry, generating much-needed export income at a time of severe international difficulty. It is providing significant and growing employment directly and indirectly. It already generates more than one- third of the Northern Territory's total export earnings. Preparations are proceeding on further promising uranium projects in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The world-wide nuclear electricity industry is now enormous, representing hundreds of billions of dollars invested by electricity authorities and utilities. It is growing fast, countries are depending on it to a rapidly increasing degree, and the industry will generate an assured increased demand for uranium in the future. Overall, that industry is providing electricity as safely, economically and cleanly as other forms of electricity generation, if not more so. The Government should be commended for its policies and the Australian uranium producing industry should be applauded for its achievements during the last five years. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-We have just heard a bit of breast-beating and a few self-advertisements by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). I suppose every now and again Ministers feel compelled, particularly with their government under attack, to come in here to give themselves a few free ads, using the Parliament to do that. This Minister, in the administration of the resources portfolio, has seen more projects deferred and cancelled in the last year or so than perhaps had been seen previously in Australia. I remember the same honourable gentleman in 1974-75 standing where I am now standing berating the Labor Government on how it could not get iron ore projects started in Western Australia. The same projects are still not started because the market demand was not there then and it is not there now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Through the years we heard this talk of how uranium was being left in the ground. The truth of the matter was that projections for electricity generation from nuclear power were always more buoyant than expectations ever realised. Indeed, in 1976 the expected installed capacity of nuclear generating plants in Japan by the year 1985 was 66 gigawatts. The figure is down to 21 gigawatts or 19 gigawatts, or something like that. The situation is pretty typical of that in many other countries. We are now seeing a position of massive oversupply in the industry. We have seen the Government water down safeguard standards to get contracts. Yet the Deputy Prime Minister still talks about how bullish and gung- ho the uranium industry is and how we are going ahead-just as he did a couple of years ago when he talked about 500,000 people being employed. Does the Minister remember that? He said of the industry that it:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . could support directly and indirectly 500,000 persons starting with a mining workforce of about 5,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If that is so, then he was wrong and the Minister was wrong too. Let us face the fact; there are 1,000 people employed in the industry, which although not inconsiderable is not like the figure that the Minister mentioned. The Minister said that when the Australian Labor Party came to power the industry died. The government of the day took the view-the environmentalist concerns had not arisen at that time-that contracts involving a price of $6 a pound for uranium were not only throwing the stuff away at bargain basement prices but also committing us to long term supply arrangements at stupid prices in a market which had not developed. If the Minister were honest with everybody he would have to say that that is the reason that policy was pursued at that time. Because of the concerns which emerged in the mid-1970s-the establishment of the Fox Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry was a result of the Labor Government's concern-problems of the nuclear industry and problems of mining uranium were revealed to us. That puts the Deputy Prime Minister's remarks in context. While on this point there are a few other things that are worth looking at. For example I have a paper with estimates of power from nuclear power plants in the Western world. I will show the Deputy Prime Minister this paper-though I will not bother incorporating it in Hansard, I will table it. The paper shows power estimates for three periods-1985, 1990 and 2000. There is a group of agencies: The European Nuclear Energy Agency, the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, the American Atomic Energy Commission, the United States Energy, Research and Development Administration, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the Uranium Institute. The estimates for 1985 range from 505 gigawatts of power down to 232, for 1990 a high of 1,265 down to 361; and for the year 2000 from 2,800 to 585. So the retailing of estimates really does not mean very much. It depends which available estimates we want to use. I seek leave to table that document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me talk about the state of the industry-nuclear power station orders and deferrals. I have here a table which has been prepared, I think, from answers to questions. It shows that the cancellations are substantial. In 1981 in the United States new orders were zero and cancellations five; in 1980 new orders zero, cancellations 16; in 1979 new orders zero, cancellations eight; and in 1978 new orders two, cancellations five. There are as many deferrals. It is quite obviously the case that the nuclear industry has been in deep trouble. At Three Mile Island there is still an enormous clean-up operation costing hundreds of millions of dollars to try to return that station to its operating position, and the power utilities do not have the capacity to meet the bill. The problem with nuclear power now is that if a nuclear station has a major breakdown or something approaching a catastrophic failure the costs of repairs and the restoration of facilities, let alone any damage to the environment and to the community, are such that power utilities are simply bankrupted. Of course, this weighs very heavily. While the problems of shifting coal about are substantial, these things weigh very heavily upon the executives of power utilities when they make decisions about installing nuclear capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Deputy Prime Minister in this breast-beating operation could not resist having a crack at the Labor Party. He talks about the Labor Party's policy being naked of political reality and common sense. He talked about a slow strangulation of existing mines and about destroying a multibillion dollar industry. He said that it was destroying our international trading reputation. Then on page 8 he said that to protect the security of future contracts:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined that these supply commitments will be honoured. There can be no question of breaking solemn undertakings to our foreign partners . </PARA>
<PARA>The only government in Australia which has ever unilaterally broken off an export arrangement has been the Fraser Government in respect of Fraser Island. This needs to be clearly understood. The furore which has ensued ever since with the Dillingham company and the interest of the United States Senate and other agencies of the United States Government, of course, has borne very heavily against Australia. Had it been a Labor government which did that, the capital strike question would have arisen again. All the same, the present Government has been beaten about as a result of that. If there is any question about honouring contracts and preserving our trading integrity, the present Government has a very poor batting average in that respect contrasted with the decisions of the last Labor Government in respect of that project. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Supply arrangements were in place and the mine was closed down, virtually without compensation. It was a disgraceful execution of the policy. While one might have found environmental justification in the policy, its execution was shocking. The point is that there was a well-publicised change of the Labor Party's policy at its last national conference which gives a Labor government the option of keeping existing mines in production. I would have thought that the Deputy Prime Minister, trying to be a responsible rather than an irresponsible Minister, would have applauded that change. Instead, he cannot resist the cheap political remark. Let me just get the honourable gentleman's record in clear perspective. When Labor was in government he went to Tokyo to belt hell out of the Labor Party, saying it was unreliable, and he ran to New York badmouthing the government of the day to American banks. That sort of behaviour has never been undertaken by the Opposition. In fact we have almost exclusively taken what one might term the appropriate and responsible view. We rarely get that from this Government. This speech today is another example of the cheap political remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister should ask the executives of Ranger and of Nabarlek whether they approve of his remarks in this context to see whether his sort of rhetoric is applauded outside. He thinks it is. I doubt very much that it is. The conference decision of the Labor Party which I referred to will place a Labor government in a position in which international supply commitments can be honoured. I think that is important to Australia as a trading entity, as did a majority of delegates at the national conference. That has been made clear. The Minister may smart under that decision, but at least he should have the decency to recognise the strength of it. Instead of that he comes in here with this operation. There is in his speech no more than one could find in an annual report of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. It is just a round-up of statistics and very dubious arguments, and contains some statistical record of the state of the Australian uranium industry at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Deputy Prime Minister talks about spot sales not being an indication of what is happening. In fact at the moment there is a massive excess of supply ahead of demand. Utilities are liquidating inventories hand over fist because of the holding charges associated with those inventories, and the spot market is important in the fixing of prices. The Deputy Prime Minister yet again holds out this prospect of Eldorado as if the coalition parties have not learnt. The boom rhetoric of the 1980 election campaign was the most single important factor in costing Australia its international competitiveness. As if the coalition parties did not learn in that election campaign, they are at it again, saying that we will have another gung-ho round of sales of uranium; whereas we know that the Deputy Prime Minister has been hawking the stuff around the world wherever he has gone over the last few years, watering down safeguard agreements to get sales wherever he can. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact in most parts of the world nuclear power, like all power generation, has taken a knock as growth has disappeared. This applies particularly to nuclear power in the one place in the world where research and development goes into the industry-the United States. In the United States reactor siting and safety is a big issue, particularly after the Three Mile Island incident; and there are no rosy pictures in respect of nuclear power at this point. The Labor Party takes the view that it is important that Australia is heard with respect to non-proliferation and that we try to contain the spread of nuclear weapons. In the light of the changes which took place at the national conference of my party, the Labor Party in government would be far more rigorous in insisting that Australia's influences impact themselves in the area of nuclear non- proliferation. We see this as a very important contribution which Australia can make to the safety of the world to make sure that civil nuclear programs do not lead, inadvertently or otherwise, to a growth in international weapons proliferation. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this point: There is no news in the speech. The Deputy Prime Minister has been the Minister responsible for this industry in the last six or seven years. He has presided over a Government policy at a time when a couple of these mines have been developed. He thinks that is something worth commendation, in his terms. So be it, in his terms. Apart from that, there is no news at all in the speech. It contains a few cheap shots at the Australian Labor Party which will not be respected outside this place in commerce or by our international trading partners. Even if he does not recognise that fact, I think many people will. There is a bit of sanity in the world and these debating points will not be taken aboard by others. The Opposition does not see any news in the document, which holds out for the fifteenth time in the history of this Government the prospect of El Dorado. It does not impress the Opposition. Frankly, one has to wonder why the Minister made the statement at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I propose to report on the Government's nuclear safeguards policy and the importance of safeguard measures in the conduct of the Government's policy on the export of uranium. Five years have passed since the Government decided in 1977 that uranium should be mined and exported from Australia. It can now be clearly demonstrated that that decision was accompanied by a high degree of responsibility. To appreciate the importance of that decision, it is necessary to understand the dual but distinctly different uses of nuclear materials. Both depend on the capacity of nuclear materials to generate power, one for the purpose of destructive weapons, and the other as a vital source for one of mankinds greatest and most constant needs-energy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government accepts that, as an exporter of uranium, it has a special duty to ensure that the peaceful use of nuclear energy does not contribute to the spread of nuclear weapons. The Government's recognition of this task has been fundamental in the development of its nuclear safeguards policy and in the conduct of the international relations aspects of the export of uranium. There are some people who argue strongly that the very fact that nuclear materials can be used for the production of nuclear weapons is sufficient in itself for halting any consideration or debate of this issue. Further, when combined with questions about the spread of nuclear weapons and waste disposal these concerns are presented as arguments for adopting a 'leave it in the ground' approach. Such extreme arguments all too often divert attention away from the very real contribution peaceful uses of the atom are making in meeting current global energy needs. This contribution could be even more significant in the post- petroleum period. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that nuclear electricity generation is here to stay. Nuclear energy is being widely used and its use is growing. This is a reality which cannot be ignored. The central task facing any responsible government, therefore, is to ensure that the peaceful uses of nuclear energy remain peaceful. We are already doing this through the application of detailed controls and safeguards over the nuclear material we supply. To walk away from that responsibility, to say that Australia's uranium should be left in the ground, would bring about no reduction in the use of nuclear materials in the world for either peaceful or military purposes. It would, however, make it certain that nuclear materials were obtained from sources where no controls or supervision were insisted upon. This could only contribute to the very thing we want to stop-the spread of nuclear weapons. Regulation of the nuclear industry is effective only where there is international co-operation in the application of controls. Co-operation contributes to a climate of confidence and helps to remove the incentive to divert peaceful nuclear activities to military purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a period of 25 years the international community has developed, through the International Atomic Energy Agency-IAEA-a system of safeguards covering co- operation in the control of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Australia has played a leading role in this work as a member of the IAEA Board of Governors, the Agency's principal policy-making body. Australia's stringent nuclear safeguards policy announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the House on 24 May 1977 has also made a significant contribution to existing international measures covering the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. This policy is not in conflict with existing international arrangements. On the contrary it complements and reinforces them. There are four cornerstones of our nuclear safeguards policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, there is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT. This Treaty is one of the most significant multilateral treaties ever brought into force. Its purpose is to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. One hundred and eighteen countries are parties to the Treaty and have thus accepted a formal legal commitment to non-proliferation. Australia's policy offers a tangible incentive to countries to uphold that Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is the IAEA safeguards system. The IAEA has been charged with the task of ensuring that the peaceful uses of atomic energy contribute to development and human well-being without in any way advancing any military purpose. The NPT requires all parties which are not nuclear weapons states to enter into an agreement with the IAEA to apply safeguards to all their civil nuclear installations. Australia's own nuclear activities are monitored under such an agreement. IAEA safeguards verify the commitment of countries under the NPT and provide an assurance that any uranium we supply for peaceful purposes is not diverted to nuclear weapons. A country accepting IAEA safeguards is required to open its industry to international inspection and hence to the prospect of detection of any attempt to develop an illegal nuclear weapons program. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, Australia is committed to support international and multilateral improvements in safeguards and to the non-proliferation regime.</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, there is a network of strict controls and obligations imposed under Australia's bilateral safeguards agreements governing the use of Australian supplied uranium. Agreement to adhere to our safeguards measures is required before any Australian uranium export arrangements can be entered into. Our bilateral safeguards agreements are recognised internationally as being as stringent as those of any country. Our treaty partners are carefully selected. In the case of countries which are not nuclear weapons states, we are prepared to enter into agreement only with those which are parties to the NPT. In the case of nuclear weapons states, we are prepared to enter into agreements only with those which have voluntarily placed civil nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. All of our agreements ensure that Australian-origin nuclear material exported for peaceful purposes will not be used for any military or explosive purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the structure of control which governs the export of Australian uranium . It is strong and effective. By its commitment to support improvements in international safeguards, and through the application of its own safeguards policy, Australia has made a major contribution to the development of a pattern of international co-operation for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy based on legally binding agreements. The greatest risks of the spread of nuclear weapons arise mainly because there are a few countries with nuclear programs which do not accept the NPT full-scope IAEA safeguards. This risk will not be reduced by withdrawing Australia's important contribution to responsible international safeguard arrangements. The greatest risks of diversion of nuclear material, technology and equipment do not occur when these items are safeguarded, but when they are unsafeguarded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has achieved a major objective of its safeguards policy with the negotiation of ten agreements covering seventeen countries. These agreements, in the order of their signing, are with Finland, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Sweden, the European Atomic Energy Community-Euratom-and Japan. These agreements form an important part of our bilateral relations with the countries concerned, and confirm the broad measure of agreement between Australia and those countries on the need to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and on how this can be done. The agreements are also clear evidence of the international acceptability of the Government's policy. The countries with which we have reached agreements have a heavy commitment to the use of nuclear reactors for the generation of electricity. All depend significantly on international co-operation for the effective functioning of their fuel cycle programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1981 annual report of the IAEA notes that during 1981 the total installed nuclear power capacity in the world increased by 13 per cent. There are currently 265 nuclear power reactors with a total capacity of 158 gigawatts operating in 23 countries, generating 9 per cent of the world's total electricity. These reactors have accumulated 2,600 reactor years of operating experience. There are 221 nuclear power reactors under construction. When completed they will bring the total installed nuclear capacity in the world to 357 gigawatts. The IAEA has stated that present indications are that by 1985 nuclear power reactors will be generating 17 per cent of the world's electricity . </PARA>
<PARA> Our agreements comply completely with all of the Government's nuclear safeguards policy requirements announced by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1977. These include the prohibition of explosive and military uses of Australia- supplied uranium; the application of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards to verify compliance with these basic undertakings; consent rights over reprocessing, retransfers to third parties and high enrichment; fallback safeguards in the event of failure of the NPT safeguards regime; adequate measures of physical protection; consultations and detailed procedures to ensure implementation of the obligations of the agreements; arbitration procedures; and provision of sanctions in the event of non-observance of stipulated obligations of the agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> Suggestions have been made that the Government watered down its policy in the negotiation of these agreements. These charges are totally false. It has been further alleged that there has been a trade-off between safeguards and commercial considerations. These charges are equally without foundation. The Government has not concluded safeguards negotiations with any country until all of its policy requirements have been fulfilled. No deliveries of Australian uranium under contracts concluded since 1977 have been made to any customer country until the relevant nuclear safeguards agreement has entered into force. There have also been attempts to misrepresent the Government's approach to reprocessing. I announced the Government's policy on the exercise of consent rights over reprocessing in a statement in the House on 27 November 1980. The statement did not weaken any of Australia's existing policy requirements. All continue to apply. What the Government decided on reprocessing was to define what had previously not been defined in 1977-the conditions under which consent to reprocessing would be exercised and the controls that would apply in the exercise of the consent. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's agreements with Euratom, France, Sweden and Japan incorporate what has come to be known as the Australian program approach to reprocessing. These agreements provide that nuclear material of Australian origin shall be reprocessed, and the resultant separated plutonium stored and used, only under IAEA safeguards in the delineated fuel cycle program of the customer party. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been asserted that Australian uranium supplied to nuclear weapon states is fuelling the arms race. This is not so. Our agreements with the United States, France and the United Kingdom incorporate the basic undertaking common to all of our nuclear safeguards agreements; that is, Australian uranium supplied for peaceful purposes will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes. Australia's efforts to reduce the risks of nuclear proliferation are not confined to the negotiation of bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to strive for this objective in international disarmament forums. Australia participated actively in the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation, INFCE, and in the drafting of an international treaty to cover the physical protection of nuclear material in international transport. We will also be represented by a strong delegation at the forthcoming conference convened by the International Atomic Energy Agency on the nuclear power experience of member states. Further, we will be an active participant in next year's United Nations Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy. Australia continues to work for improvements in international safeguards through the IAEA. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that energy is and will continue to be generated through nuclear means. The Government, through its insistence on strict safeguards, has ensured that where Australia participates in a nuclear industry that industry will be open to international scrutiny and control. To evade this responsibility by withdrawing our contribution to stringent international safeguards would increase the risks of uncontrolled and secretive nuclear activity. The plain fact is that leaving Australian uranium in the ground, and therefore our ceasing to be a responsible exporter of uranium for peaceful purposes, will not contribute in the slightest to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. A responsible nuclear policy must ensure that the civil uses of nuclear energy do not contribute to the spread of nuclear weapons. Australia's comprehensive nuclear policies have been developed with great care to meet this requirement. Our policies have served us well. Because of our contribution in this field, the world is a safer place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I know, but I am answering interjections. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to refer to what was said here today. I do not think there is any problem with recognising the fact that there are different views within the Labor Party, but at least the Labor Party has a policy. Let us look at what the Government is about. The policy which was announced here today was formulated by the National Country Party. I do not know where the Liberal Party's policy is, but certainly the National Country Party's policy has always been to flog everything in Australia at the cheapest possible price and not to worry about Australian ownership, control or technology. Let us forget any worries about divisions in the Labor Party. What about the nuclear proliferation problems of the world?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why is it that the Government thinks it is helping the world by exporting natural uranium? Is it not a fact that some of the countries with which the Government has entered into contracts are very suspect indeed. Let us pick one country-Finland. We sell uranium to Finland. The Minister, who did not have enough time to give me a copy of his speech, said that we have adequate safeguards in regard to reprocessing. Let me make it very clear that the uranium we sell to Finland is enriched and reprocessed in the Soviet Union. I do not think the Government has been anxious in the past to oblige any industrial activity in the Soviet Union, least of all the enrichment and reprocessing of uranium because during the reprocessing of uranium one has an opportunity to extract plutonium and one also has the problems of high level waste. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why is the Government unable to say what the articles state? It gave its consent in advance. We debated this issue in March 1982 and the Government gave consent. Once our uranium is sold arguments are settled by way of arbitration-we will take on the Government with respect to the law-and the Government is bound by the arbiter's decision. Where does the government have any control of the uranium throughout the cycle? We sell to France which is not a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. France sold uranium to Iraq which was using it in a reactor enriched to weapons grade. Perhaps that is an excuse for Begin to destroy it, although I do not agree with that. But the fact is that France now uses our uranium as a buffer stop to do what it likes, whether it is to explode uranium in the Pacific or anywhere else. Why does the Minister take such pride in making a statement in the House today of the advantages of selling uranium to France? Does the Government think when it sells uranium to the Philippines it is selling to a country that has political stability? I venture to say that by the time a reactor is built in the Philippines it could well be that the regimes there will have changed three or four times because they are not that stable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider South Korea where this Government is also proposing to sell uranium. How many coups, assassinations and changes of regimes take place there? Is this Government really thinking that it is helping world stability? It is well known that the South Koreans wanted to go to nuclear technology for weapon grade purposes. This government is also anxious to sell to West Germany which has been very keen to develop a nuclear technology particularly in the Latin American countries. One of the great risks of the Treaty of Tlatelolco is the fact that Argentina has not fully subscribed to it and, therefore, it might be prone to develop a weapons capacity. All these things are true. We do not see any mention of them in these statements today. There was an idiotic exercise concerning what happened to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) in a ballot for leadership. The Government has not even got right who supported him and for what reason. But why are we about this nonsense? China is about to get a nuclear weapon capacity or delivery and all the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) can do is praise China for it, particularly when it has already fired one rocket in the Pacific. The Prime Minister said that that was understandable. The Government is probably helping Pakistan to go to nuclear technology for weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we about in this country? What advantage is there to the world for us to be flogging off uranium at this stage when, as the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) has said, there is an oversupply and the market price is low anyway? If this Government really is going to have a commercial interest in this fuel-personally I think it has a future for peaceful purposes-it will be of extreme value about the year 2000 providing the Government can satisfy all the other aspects of non-proliferation and it has an ability to have high level disposal on a safe basis. I welcome the support for Synroc. This is the first occasion that I have ever heard of any real interest in Australian technology. Our party policy is to talk about the development of technology for the satisfactory disposal of high level waste for the world. The Ministers who have trundled into this chamber today would die of fright if it were suggested that high level waste might be buried back in their electorates, whether it be the electorates of Corangamite or Richmond. They would be run out of office. Yet they are prepared to allow the stuff to be taken across the world and buried somewhere else-out of sight, out of mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it very clear that I have taken a keen interest in this matter. I have been to the International Energy Agency twice. It is very concerned about governments being able to control fuel through the whole cycle. The great danger will be in the plutonium cycle which is coming. The biggest danger is: Who will have the international safeguards on plutonium? Do we see any mention of it in these statements? It was not mentioned once yet the reprocessing of plutonium is the greatest danger in the world. We have already given away our consent in advance. </PARA>
<PARA> Japan is rearming. Does the Minister think that is a satisfactory situation? I do not. But if we are selling uranium to Japan and it decides, because of a change of government or a change of view, that it wants to go to a nuclear capacity, it would use our uranium which it has bought legitimately. We might ask the Government: 'What are you going to do about it?' This Government will not do a thing. Is there a solution? In the political terms of the Australian Labor Party there is. We will honour existing arrangements but we make it very clear that we want it to stop there. As Australians we want to be able to say: ' We will contribute to world peace'. Admittedly after that there can be arguments within our party as to how we contribute to world peace. If we were obliged to help the peaceful uses of nuclear energy for electricity generation, which we may well have to do across the world, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere and in those countries which are under ice and snow for six months of the year, where the coal is finite and so is oil, what would be the effective way to do that? If we adopted that view what would be the sensible thing to do to guarantee that there would be no diversion to weapons? The sensible thing to do would be to guarantee that we owned the fuel. This is the only government in the world that is selling the fuel not knowing what will happen to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister: This would be the only government in the world that would not care what happened to the fuel after it went through the nuclear cycle . I make it very clear that every process, basically for enrichment and certainly for reprocessing, is government-owned and controlled. There is no room for the private sector at all, nor can there be. How can we possibly leave the private sector in control of the fuel that can destroy the whole of the world? We could not do it. The foolishness, the stupidity and the ineptitude of these statements sticks out like a neonlight. This sort of nonsense today is a kindergarten approach by these Ministers who have not even bothered to look at the problems of the world. No private sector will ever be able to control plutonium. It has to be government-controlled. No private sector will ever be able to get hold of high level waste. It has to be government-controlled. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the Ministers rewrite their speeches. They should have a good look at what the world is about. If the world is short of energy and we have to give it this fuel what do we do? We own and control the fuel throughout the cycle. By so doing we can guarantee, because we have solemnly counted it, that there has been no diversion to weapons. Unfortunately, of the 40,000 or more weapons now in the world, many of them have come from the wrongful diversion of uranium thoughout the cycle. France would be as guilty as anybody else in this issue. The Soviet Union would be up to its ears in it also. Why would this government think that, by selling it to Finland and France, it is helping? The Government has lost control. If it had any legitimacy about its policy or any understanding of what it was about it would not be anxious to sell uranium at the present time. It will honour contracts but it could get a much better price for uranium as it gets more scarce in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government starts to talk abut non-proliferation of weapons it is also duty bound to own and control that fuel. That means that the Government gets it back, organises the question of reprocessing, plutonium storage and high level safe disposal whether it be Synroc or anything else. What a laughable situation we have in the statement made today by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) who was worrying about the United States of America now getting so protective about its industries and not allowing any import of uranium. Good luck to the United States. It is teaching this Government a lesson. This Government is subservient to everything the United States does particularly in relation to foreign policy. When it comes to uranium the United States is now saying: 'We will look after our industry first. You can make your own arrangements.' All we get is a bleat about that issue. It shows us where we stand in the world and what little leverage this Government has with the United States on any issue where the United States regards its priority as being one of looking after its own people. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States has been quite outrageous in the way in which it has been anxious to look after its own policies and not world safety. The selling of weapons is the biggest business for the United States and also the Soviet Union. Those countries run first and second in the world. The wars in the Middle East unfortunately are the result of that sort of stupid policy. We are now saying to this Government: If you want to make intelligent statements please bring them in and explain how you will own and control the fuel; how you will honestly be able to win an arbitration proceeding; how you honestly will be able to give consent or not give consent. The Government cannot do it. It is fallacious and false to be bringing in these sorts of arguments today with the only line: 'These are the internal worries of the Australian Labor Party'. We have no worries. We have had a full scale debate and we have talked about matters that really concern the world. </PARA>

Why does the Government not have it? What is the Government's policy about the plutonium storage from Australian uranium? It does not have any idea. What is the Government's policy about the safe disposal of the high level radioactive waste of Australian uranium? The Government has lost control.

The question is very clear. Where is the Government's policy?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did not in this debate. I wish to support the comments made by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). I would like to point out the importance of the matter to the industry and to the Northern Territory in particular. The Northern Territory has the world's largest reserves of quality uranium in the Alligator Rivers province. Since the election of the Fraser Government in 1975 the industry has emerged from the nothingness of the Whitlam Labor days. The industry now takes a most important position in the Northern Territory economy and it will continue to grow in importance. At the moment the Nabarlek and Ranger mines are in production. Jabiluka is in the planning and construction stage. The Koongarra deposit has been identified and the project is ready to start as soon as the negotiations with the Aboriginals can be finalised and the foreign ownership equity can be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From an employment point of view, the uranium industry is vital to the Territory. By 1986 the extractive side of the uranium industry could be providing direct employment for up to 3,000 Territorians. Add to this new jobs created in service and associated industries in the Territory and we are talking about even more jobs. The importance of this industry in the Northern Territory should not be underestimated. There is more energy potential in the Alligator Rivers Region than there is in the entire Middle East oil fields. There is also potential for further discoveries in the region. To gain an idea of the economic importance of the region, estimated capital expenditure on the four deposits will exceed $1,000m. Apart from direct benefits in terms of employment and investment, the industry will yield hundreds of millions of dollars annually in corporate taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Three years ago uranium exports from the Territory did not exist. Now uranium is set to be the Northern Territory's biggest mineral export. This is at a time when mining production is declining in other areas. I should point out that as a trading nation our balance of payments position is enhanced with every shipment of yellowcake. The town of Jabiru has been established as an urban centre adjacent to the wonderful Kakadu National Park in the uranium province and over $92m has been spent on construction of facilities in that town. This is a challenge successfully met and it provides a unique lifestyle for thousands of miners and their families. This development grew from nothing in the space of a couple of years. Jabiru is set to be the third largest town in the Northern Territory. It is the envy of most outback centres. It is a modern town with excellent communications, health, education and recreational facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The relationship between uranium and Aborigines is too often set in negative terms. That is because of the view of the Labor Party and many of its fellow travellers who want to promote that view. Uranium mining has brought real benefits to Aboriginals. It has promoted their development and self- determination. It is important to note that mining royalties are expected to yield about $28m annually for Aboriginals in the future. Of course, this will be in addition to the generous pre-production payments. At last the Aboriginals can make their own decisions and lessen their dependence on government. One aspect we cannot get away from is Australia's international responsibility to mine uranium for export. The Chancellor of West Germany, Helmut Schmidt, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Whoever fails to take advantage of nuclear energy condemns himself to social backwardness. The future belongs to those countries that push ahead with nuclear energy. </PARA>
<PARA>Many countries are energy importers that are reliant totally or to a large extent on nuclear power. As the Deputy Prime Minister highlighted in his speech, very many countries are embarking on expansion of their nuclear programs. We should consider what the ALP's uranium policy would do to this industry. I must point out that its so-called uranium policy is not a policy at all; it is an anti-uranium policy and it does not seek to develop the industry. Rather, the ALP wants only to destroy the industry. To say that the end result of the ALP's conference with regard to uranium is a uranium policy is like saying that Jack the Ripper was supporting the women's movement. The Labor Party's policy says that it will phase out the industry. This is just a euphemism for saying that it will close down the industry over time rather than overnight. For the record and for the information of honourable members, it is worth quoting that new Labor policy. I noticed that neither the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) nor any other Labor speaker did that because they are obviously embarrassed to do so. Section 9B of that policy states:</PARA>
<PARA> An incoming ALP Government is already committed to repudiate all existing commitments. </PARA>
<PARA>The next section-a most insidious position to take-put horrors through the industry. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our minimum position will be a total unequivocal commitment to phase out Australia's involvement in the uranium industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The policy goes on to make it clear that there is no future for the uranium industry in Australia. The policy has been put clearly by one of the ALP spokesmen in the Northern Territory, John Reeves, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will not allow any more mines to open up while we are in government and will renegotiate with customer countries relating to their nuclear practices. </PARA>
<PARA>No matter what ALP spokesmen say, under Labor there will be no uranium industry. I do not need to point out the Federal policy. It causes immense embarrassment to the ALP locally and in the Northern Territory. Quite frankly, in the Northern Territory the community approval rating for the industry is, as one would expect , a massive 83 per cent. The ALP spokesmen in the Territory do not know how to act. On the one hand they support their Federal policy and on the other the next time one sees them they are apologising for it, trying to talk it down and explain it away. The recent ALP federal conference certainly brought the worms out of the woodwork. Bob Collins MLA, the Northern Territory Leader of the Opposition, does not know how to handle the issue of the industry because it is too hot for him. On returning from the conference in Canberra he claimed the ALP policy to be a 'great victory' for the Territory and implied that the ALP now supported mining. But, judging from his conference comments, he can only mean ' victory' in terms of shutting up the industry. What he told the conference in Canberra was entirely different. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I have led the fight against uranium in the Northern Territory now for five years. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to brag to his Canberra conferees. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . my credentials in respect of an anti-uranium position are impeccable. </PARA>
<PARA>To leave no doubts about his thoughts on the new policy and to reassure his colleagues that the new policy was better, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I can argue this policy because it has got specific prohibitions in it and in many respects it is far tougher than the one that is currently on the books. </PARA>
<PARA>These sorts of comments have been reiterated by other ALP spokesmen in the Territory. Neil Bell, the MLA member for Macdonnell, spoke of sacrificing 600 jobs almost as though they did not matter. He should try telling that to the 600 people he wants to put out of work. Mr Bell was gagged by his own parliamentary party in the Northern Territory Assembly when the Assembly had a debate similar to this debate. Bob Collins did not want anyone putting the real ALP position in the Northern Territory because he is two-faced on the issue. He says one thing in the Territory and another when he is away. I noticed that at the ALP conference the honourable member for Cunningham, who is not speaking in this debate today-he spoke in an earlier debate-described the new policy as 'an irresponsible document'. I have to agree with him, but for entirely different reasons. It is irresponsible. It would cripple the Northern Territory if it were ever put into effect. It is more interesting to hear what the honourable member for Cunningham had to say about the impact of Labor's decision on jobs. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>We can pay compensation to the permanent workers and to the Aboriginals. It would not cost more than $20m. Even if all the projects go ahead there is only 1 ,000 workers involved. </PARA>
<PARA>No sooner was the Australian Labor Party conference over than the honourable member for Cunningham raced into print, got himself onto page 1 of the Australian and told the Australian that a Labor Government would veto Jabiluka. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>If Labor wins the next election, under the current policy there will not even be a question of compensating the workforce. </PARA>

It has become increasingly evident that the ALP has not thought out the implications of its policies. the policies will not just affect the uranium industry and employment, they will affect associated and service industries and Australia's international trading reputation, not to mention the Aboriginal interests. What will happen to Aboriginals receiving royalties? Where will the money come from for Aboriginal advancement? Has the ALP forgotten about Aborigines as usual, or does it prefer to have them tied to and dependent on the bureaucracy? I strongly suggest that the ALP does not have a policy on uranium; it has an anti-uranium policy aimed at terrorising the industry and those who work in it. Let us compare the past statements of the ALP and what we have heard in debate today with two Northern Territory politicians. Ian Tuxworth, who is the Minister for Mines, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the future holds great promise for the uranium province . . . promise for customer countries who will need our uranium to solve their energy needs and promise for Austraians from all walks of life as they share in the development of this resource. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise, first of all, to defend my colleagues. It was made clear by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) that the Australian Labor Party and the Leader of the House believed that there was an arrangement with the Government in which there was to be one speaker a side. No courtesy was shown for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). It is disappointing that if the Government wanted to debate uranium-there are many Australians of all political complexities who are worried and concerned about the future of that industry and its role within Australia-then we could have had a proper and an appropriate debate. Again, this Government, harassed as it is and under great pressure in terms of its internal problems and the difficulties the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has in trying to decide whether he ought to be sacking Ministers or keeping them on, chose to have the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony) come in here with a gung-ho statement about uranium peddled to the Parliament with the same kind of morality that an itinerant vendor of meat pies pushes his product at a league football match.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the statements that were made by the Deputy Prime Minister. As far as he was concerned it was the old boom gung-ho mentality. The future of the uranium industry was assured. There was a boom situation and we should all be grateful for it. Anybody who has looked into the history of the industry will know that that is not the case. Forecasts for the uranium market for the rest of this century are generally and increasingly pessimistic. The Australian Atomic Energy Commission revised its estimate of 1990 world demand for uranium from 106 ,000 tonnes per year in its 1976-77 annual report to 79,000 tonnes per year in its 1977-78 annual report. It got down to 59,000 tonnes per year in its 1978-79 report and only 48,000 tonnes per year in its 1980-81 annual report. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's nuclear energy agency's most recent projections of nuclear generating capacity for the year 1990 are only one third of projections made ten years ago for the year 1990. A study by the international energy studies group of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-I regard it as an authority in this area-has found that uranium production, as currently planned, would exceed world reactor requirements in 1985 by more than 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The depressed state of the uranium market over the coming decade arises from a number of factors. First, there is the slow-down of nuclear development in Europe, North America and Japan. There have been reductions both in expectations of total future demand for energy and in nuclear powers' share in supplying that energy. Secondly, the excessive optimism which was generated in the uranium industry in the mid-1970s by high prices which were, in fact, the consequence of the price fixing policies of a uranium exporters cartel has since dissolved. The third factor is the bringing on stream of new mines which will add to the glut. Finally, the excessive stockpiling of uranium by users, particularly during the late 1970s, has led to huge inventories. Non-United States stockpiles in 1980 were sufficient to supply all existing reactors for three years. That is one of the reasons that the United States Government is considering taking action to prevent the closure of high cost uranium mines in the United States by applying import restrictions to imported uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment in United States uranium mines shrank from 22,000 to 14,000 in two years. That is why the United States is thinking about import restrictions. It will take more than the glib whining of the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia to reverse what is currently going on in the United States. Australian contract sales of uranium to the year 1996, despite all the forecasts of the Deputy Prime Minister and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Tambling), are only 58,600 tonnes, compared with the Ranger Uranium environmental Inquiry which projected that by that time we would have had contracts for 178,500 tonnes. The spot price of uranium which reached $US43 per pound in 1978 has fallen to barely $US22 per pound in 1982. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology study suggested that world uranium prices are likely to decline further and probably significantly over the decade. The total number of nuclear power plants in operation, under construction or on order in OECD countries actually declined by 13 between 1979 and 1981. Since 1978 cancellations of nuclear power plants have exceeded new orders. The Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency stated:</PARA>
<PARA>If orders for more new plants are not forthcoming now, the general slowdown of nuclear power programs beyond the year 1990 is inevitable, with serious consequences for the nuclear industries in many countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The same Deputy Prime Minister in September 1981, again with that optimism for which he has become famous, said that an OECD report had predicted that by year 2000, 29 per cent of the world electricity would come from nuclear power. Less than a week later it was revealed that the revised IAEA estimate was that only 22 per cent would come from nuclear energy by the year 2000. Leaders of the uranium industry throughout the world are at the moment increasingly pessimistic , both about the state of the industry and about the state of the market. Pancontinental Mining Ltd, one of the Jabiluka partners, has warned that uranium prices are too low to cover even a direct operating cost for a major part of the industry. The Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy concluded that prospects for large sales of uranium from Jabiluka remain gloomy unless the Commonwealth drastically lowers its minimum export price or abandons the minimum pricing policy altogether. Why did the honourable member for the Northern Territory not have that piece of information? Why was that attitude not mentioned at all by the Deputy Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA> In the time available to me in which to speak, I will deal very quickly with some of the responsible concerns that are felt by members of my own party-by members of all parties-on this matter. I listened to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when I could see him, tell the House how confident he was about international atomic energy safeguards. His belief in the Government's safeguards policy is almost touching but it is certainly naive. The threat of nuclear confrontation to the world is greater now than it was 10 years ago. More countries, some of which are parties to the safeguards agreements and some which are not, have become atomic and nuclear powers in that time. Canada, which was desperate to sell its uranium, has recently entered into contracts to sell uranium to establish a nuclear power industry in Indonesia. That ought to be a matter of concern for Australia. It was the Canadians who provided the basis for the nuclear power industry for India-it was known as atoms for peace-which gave India nuclear weapons. Pakistan is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. Israel recently showed the world precisely how much confidence it had in international safeguards when it took out the Osirak reactor. Whether people agree with the way the Israelis did it or not, does anybody seriously believe that Iraq, one of the oil-rich countries of the Middle East, was going into nuclear power in order to acquire some technology? Of course it was not. </PARA>
<PARA> There are nations around the world which are anxious to become nuclear weapons powers. To ignore them and to come out with the kind of glib nonsense that the Minister for Foreign Affairs went on with today have to be matters of deep concern. It is a matter of deep concern to my friend the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child). Recently, when she was in Finland, she asked the responsible Minister of the Government of Finland about the problems of nuclear waste disposal in Finland. The Finns are buying uranium from Australia. We were told that today by the Minister. Who is processing it for Finland? It is the Soviet Union. Of course, the Minister told my friend the honourable member for Henty that Finland did not have any problem with waste disposal because any waste that might come from Australian uranium would be taken by the Soviet Union. That country would look after the waste. How much confidence can we have, having regard to the statements that have emanated from the Government about its attitude towards the Soviet Union? Does the Government think that the Soviet Union takes back nuclear waste? What does it think it does with it? Does the Deputy Prime Minister not know that nuclear waste can be used for producing weapons grade uranium? These are serious matters which have to be of concern to any citizen with a conscience. There are too many nuclear weapons powers now. For this Government to say that we are putting our faith in international agreements belies what is occurring in the international situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it touching that the honourable member for the Northern Territory has suddenly become an advocate, not merely for uranium but for the benefits that it confers upon Aboriginal communities. Why does he not look at the statement of the Deputy Prime Minister who talks with great enthusiasm about what will occur when the Koongarra deposit comes on stream? Does the honourable member for the Northern Territory not know that the tribal owners of that deposit did not want a mine and took a decision against mining? When Aborigines reach such a decision themselves, the Government says that they are being manipulated. There have to be more negotiations and more pressure is put on them until they agree to the proposition to which Deputy Prime Minister in his heart has already agreed. As far as he is concerned, Koongarra is already an accomplishment, irrespective of what undertakings have been given to the Aboriginal community in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it fascinating that members of the National Country Party who have affiliations with farmer organisations never stop berating Australian manufacturing industry about subsidies which it receives as a result of government policy. The most heavily subsidised industry in Australia at present is the uranium industry. Commonwealth expenditure on the uranium industry has risen from $30.1m in 1977-78 to $83.6m in 1981-82, a real increase of over 110 per cent. If one compares the level of Commonwealth funds which are allocated to sustaining industry, there is not one manufacturing industry in Australia-people talk about industries like the clothing industry-which, on a per capita basis, meets the level of subsidy that is going to the uranium industry. </PARA>
<PARA> These are just some of the problems. Many people in my party are concerned, and continue to be concerned-properly so-about the problems that confront Australia not merely in the development of the uranium industry but also in the role that we play in marketing. The reality is that with the gung-ho attitude of the Deputy Prime Minister he would sell uranium to anybody. He leaves mention of the safeguards to the Foreign Minister. Clearly, from the statement of the Foreign Minister today, he does not understand what is happening in the real world. He honestly believes that if some of the people who run some of the nation states around the world sign a piece of paper, they will say: 'Isn't that nice, all that lovely Australian uranium? We have signed this agreement so we won't really make a bomb from it'. Who believes that? As I said, it is not good enough for the Deputy Prime Minister to walk in here and to talk about selling uranium as if he were selling some of his daggy sheep at the market. The situation is more complicated than that and this Parliament is entitled to have the matter debated with far more integrity and real analysis of the facts and the problems of the industry than has been shown in the House by this Government today. </PARA>

However, I am also a realist and, until there is another form of energy to replace uranium, it would be irresponsible of us not to supply it, subject, however, to stringent safeguard arrangements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To help the honourable member, I point out that it is quite clear that the Australian uranium industry and the Australian people are concerned about the prospects for uranium exports. (Quorum formed). I really am concerned that the Opposition cannot understand why the Australian uranium industry and the people reliant on that industry and employed in that industry do not support the Opposition's policy. That policy states a commitment to the phasing out of Australia's involvement in the industry. All I am asking is: When will that phasing out take place? The point I am making is that I got a distinct impression that the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the honourable member for Batman, the honourable member for La Trobe and others have a different view from the view of those honourable members from South Australia to whom I have already referred-the honourable member for Grey and the honourable member for Port Adelaide. Let me go on with the quotation from an article in the Adelaide News. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Federal MHR, Mr Mick Young, said the party's opposition to uranium mining was an argument a lot of people could not understand. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Our opposition to uranium does not give us the right to forget about the rest of the people of the world,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'There are going to be another two billion people in the world in 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We are talking about lifting their standard of living'. </PARA>
<PARA> He had attended overseas conferences on nuclear energy and had not found any other country which opposed nuclear energy. This included representatives of Communist governments. </PARA>
<PARA> 'But we have taken on a very big argument a lot of people cannot understand'.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder why the two honourable members from South Australia-the honourable member for Grey and the honourable member for Port Adelaide-to whom I have just referred are concerned about the ALP's policy on uranium mining, about the phasing out of Australia's involvement in that industry. I shall give the House just a few details about one of the major projects in Australia and, in particular, in South Australia to which the Minister for Trade and Resources referred in his statement. The project to which I refer is the Roxby Downs project. The mineralisation in that project is estimated to be worth in excess of $140 billion. It is very large by world standards. There is every expectation that the zone of mineralisation extends further to the north-west and the south- east than has yet been established. The copper contained in the deposit is about 30 million tonnes-that is, around six times as much copper as Mount Isa has and about 2 1/2 times Australia's total identified resources on other ore deposits. The uranium content is about 1.2 million tonnes of uranium oxide This is equivalent to about 20 per cent of identified uranium world resources. There is in excess of 1,000 tonnes of gold. This is roughly equivalent to the total quantity of gold which has been produced from the Golden Mile at Kalgoorlie. Clearly, the significance for South Australia of this project is enormous. Mr Goldsworthy, the Minister of Mines and Energy in South Australia, said on 4 March in the South Australian House of Assembly:</PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated by the Joint Venturers that commitment to such a project could involve expenditures well in excess of $1 billion, employment of 2,000 to 3,000 at the mine site and the establishment of a town of up to 9,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> The total prefeasibility expenditure will amount to $100m . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that that project if not proceeded with under the ALP's policy on uranium will cause severe damage to the economy of South Australia and to the people of South Australia. I refer to an independent report on the Roxby Downs project. The report was written by Dr Larry Cook and Mr Chris Trengrove of the Monash University's centre of policy studies. A newspaper report of the study stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If there are no supply constraints, the report estimates that an annual investment outlay of $350m during construction of Roxby Downs would generate roughly 18,600 jobs and $638m in gross State production output. </PARA>
<PARA> During the operational stage, the report says, the project would create 8,000 extra jobs, directly or indirectly, while gross State output associated with the mining venture would increase by $213m a year. </PARA>
<PARA>The report states that that is the optimistic projection. An alternative projection is that the project will create 9,300 jobs. In this more pessimistic projection, it is estimated the project will create 6,200 jobs. Clearly the project is of enormous importance to South Australia. It has been put at risk by the Australian Labor party as quoted by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) who stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The ALP policy seems to rule out all mines with the exception of Ranger and Nabarlek if Labor comes to power. </PARA>
<PARA>To me that makes it clear that the Australian Labor Party will not allow the Roxby Downs mining venture to continue. Under an Australian Labor Party government, if one ever comes to power, uranium at that project will not be mined. To South Australia and to Australia that would mean an enormous loss of jobs and a lowering in the standard of living. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly to draw attention to how ineffectual our safeguard agreements are so far as uranium is concerned. I refer to the fact that a parliamentary delegation visited the Nordic countries in June of this year. The delegation consisted of honourable members from both sides of the Parliament, including me. I made some brief notes on the visit of the delegation. When we were at the Oskarsham nuclear reactor in Sweden the director of the plant said that Australian uranium was used at the plant and that, together with other uranium used there, it would be reprocessed. He said there was no way of ensuring that Australian uranium was not reprocessed while uranium for Sweden was. We were also told that no final disposal method had been discovered and that this was still a few years off. When the delegation was in Finland the matter was raised with the Finnish Trade Minister in Helsinki on 9 June 1982. We raised the question of Australian uranium and its role in the Finnish energy supply system. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>

This person told the member that it was very much more convenient for our uranium to be reprocessed in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics since it has the facility and is not too far away. He went on to say that the material would be in the USSR for 'a few months or even a few years'. Under the Fraser Government this means that uranium exported by the agreement of this Government and under the so-called safeguard arrangements of this Government is going to Finland and finding its way to the Soviet Union where it can be reprocessed and enriched. Quite clearly this means that the Soviet Union is in a position to obtain such uranium to make atomic weapons to be used against our 'great and friendly allies' and ourselves. When such a situation can exist it amounts to a person completely ignoring the interests of this country. These so-called safeguard arrangements of this Government are utterly and completely useless. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. I table with this statement certain documents referred to in the Senate resolution of 9 September dealing with tax evasion schemes together with other documents relevant to the subject matter of that resolution. The documents I am tabling can broadly be broken into three groups. First, there is a fairly detailed chronology of the Government's handling of straw companies and the development of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act in the period 1978-1980 together with a detailed listing of other tax issues taken to Cabinet, legislation introduced and Press releases on tax initiatives. Second, there is a batch of documents consisting of memoranda from the Commissioner, diary notes and correspondence between departments and Ministers, et cetera that relate to the Government's handling of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act over the same period. Documents in this group that I personally did not see at the time have been identified by an asterisk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third batch consists of three legal opinions. The Solicitor-General has considered that counsels' opinions and other legal advice referred to in items 2 , 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Senate resolution should not be tabled on the ground that public disclosure of the contents would be harmful to the administration of justice. He personally examined each of the documents in question. He has stated that, in his view, harm would be caused both to those who may be prosecuted and to those who may be proceeded against civilly, or to the cause of the prosecutor or civil complainant. In many instances both sides would be injured. That injury would not, in his view, be avoided by excising names. The Solicitor-General has reached a similar conclusion in relation to the police investigation report referred to in item 15. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that it should accept the advice of the Solicitor- General on this matter. I believe that there is no other proper course that the Government could follow, even though the opinions, if they were able to be tabled, would show that counsels' opinions were not all 'one way' on the availability of adequate and effective legal remedies in the cases that they related to. Thus, the opinion of counsel referred to in item 2 of the Evans motion advised that there was insufficient evidence to warrant criminal proceedings on a charge under section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. The Lockhart opinion referred to in item 7 of the motion, while it advised of reasonable prospects of success, recognised the difficulties inherent in establishing a charge of conspiracy to defraud or similar charges. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General pointed out to the Senate on 7 September 1982 that this opinion did not relate to a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. He also referred to the question of further action being taken on this case and made the obvious point, now confirmed by the Solicitor-General, that the opinion should not be tabled. The documents show a number of things. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Apart from the reference in the minute of 24 May 1978 which I have already referred to in the House, no reference directly or indirectly was made in any document coming to me from the Commissioner of Taxation or anyone else regarding the circumstances surrounding what has ultimately become known as the Perth case reported upon by Mr Costigan. As I have already said, I do not believe it can fairly be said that the reference in the minute of 24 May should of itself have placed me on further inquiry regarding the circumstances of that case. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. As I said in my reply to the McCabe-Lafranchi report, the Australian Taxation Office regularly passed on information to me regarding straw company activity and strongly pressed for introduction of proposals which, with important changes, became embodied in the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. From very early in the piece, both the concept and scope of the proposals put to me by the Australian Taxation Office and which were ultimately incorporated in the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act because of their unprecedented character so far as the tax law was concerned, required careful consideration by me and the Government. There was concern about not only what represented a new approach in this area of the tax law, but also any reversal of the onus of proof in criminal matters. That concern was shared by the relevant Government members' committee and most strongly by the Taxation Advisory Committee. Concern about the nature of and opposition to the legislation continued until and beyond the time of its passage in December 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The period covered by the documents saw an unprecedented volume of political , administrative and legislative action against tax avoidance of which the area covered by the straw company issue was but one part. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has brought on this matter at this time during the unfolding drama of the Government's failure to act in relation to tax avoidance in this country. We have just had tabled for us 500 pages of documents which in many senses, I suspect, will reveal and confirm the lack of action taken by this Government and particularly by this Treasurer (Mr Howard). At the same time as the Government pretends that it has been acting, the Opposition is keen to reveal its infinite capacity for deception and duplicity. While pretending to strengthen its resolve to deal with tax dodgers and while presenting, with unprecedented fanfare, its plans to recover unpaid tax, we are now discovering that its resolve is transparent and the fanfare will herald not a search and recovery crusade but merely a timid peek into the thriving and enriched world of corporate and personal greed-a greed which has been fed by the stolen treasure of unpaid tax, the theft of which has been involuntarily indemnified by every decent taxpaying Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has foreshadowed legislation which will attempt to recover at least some of the tax that has been evaded through bottom-of-the-harbour schemes . The Treasurer admits to having lost $600m almost entirely as a result of his inaction and the inaction of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) going as far back as 1976 when the prosecutions recommended by Queen's Counsel and officers in the Australian Taxation Office were not launched. Had that action been taken, whether or not it succeeded, the trickle that subsequently swelled into a flood could have been choked off. As a result of the disclosures in the McCabe- Lafranchi report and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the immense discomfort that they caused, the Government has been stung into reluctant and very limited action. The Government, which was earlier content to close off the loophole which allowed this scheme to flourish for years, is now to retrieve some of the dishonestly withheld tax. Belated these moves certainly are, but we have to be impressed, if not surprised, by the wrath and the passion which has accompanied them. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), participants in bottom-of- the-harbour schemes are anti-social and un-Australian. Their actions destroy and undermine the social fabric of this country. They are guilty of a crime against society and, most importantly, they are participating in an unmitigated evil. The Prime Minister, during a speech in the Kingston electorate, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In a real sense, the recipients of those funds have in their hands stolen funds , whether you want to say stolen from the Commonwealth or stolen from other taxpayers it doesn't matter very much. </PARA>
<PARA>One might add that it does not seem to matter whether the Minister for Defence ( Mr Sinclair) has stolen money so long as certain taxpayers do not have stolen money. The admittedly dreadful and outrageous activities have been going on for years-the Treasurer admits to knowing about bottom-of-the-harbour schemes since at least 1978-yet it took the Treasurer over 18 months to take this action which was apparently so necessary to protect the very social fabric of this country. That occured in 1980. But there was not then a hint of any action to recover the money which the Prime Minister now says these cheats have stolen. It was only when further inaction would have been politically untenable that the excited and colourful language flowed from the duplicitous lips of the Prime Minister. At the prospect of losing votes, the Prime Minister changed colours with a speed which would make a chameleon envious. But his commitment to this new stance, like the capricious chameleon, is cosmetic and ephemeral. </PARA>
<PARA> What neither the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer will face up to is that the bottom-of-the-harbour losses which they have now belatedly been shamed into recovering represent but a tiny part of what has been lost. The Government has, since 1977, acted to outlaw some 42 schemes. While this may have prevented further losses under those schemes, it has not recovered one single cent of the money withheld as a result of these schemes. The Government, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were simply content during the whole of that period to stop the practice in the future and ignore the savage assault that had occurred on the Treasury coffers. The result was that participants in one scheme, which was, as a result of the closing off of such schemes, explicitly illegal, turned to other schemes. As fast as old schemes were stopped new ones started. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perfectly clear that even in this relative frenzy of activity the Government was able to outlaw only a small portion of the schemes which were so popular among so many tax cheats. Of these 42 schemes, 22 can be described as blatantly artificial, of a kind which the Prime Minister might now describe as ' fraudulent and immoral'. I have prepared a table which identifies these 22 schemes. It indicates the action which the Government took against those schemes and, further, the estimated amounts of revenue which has been lost under them. Having received the consent of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Wilson) I seek leave to have the table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Notes: (1) Since 1977 the Government has acted against 42 tax avoidance schemes or variants of schemes but has recovered none of the revenue lost under these schemes prior to this action. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Half of these are unambiguous, blatant schemes with no commercial or family justification. Such schemes should be the subject of retrospective legislation to recover tax avoided before the government acted. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Such schemes have huge revenue implications. It is likely that retrospective legislation could recover at least $2-3 billion of taxes owing due to these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) The schemes against which the Government has acted represent merely the tip of the tax avoidance and evasion iceberg and are merely small tributaries of the tax evasion and avoidance torrent. Total revenue losses are enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Russell Mathews estimated in 1980 that the cost to revenue was close to $3 billion per year. ''If taxes paid by other personal incomer recipients had maintained the same proposition to taxes paid by wage and salary earners as in 1965-66, the former would have been higher by $2,715m.''</PARA>
<PARA> Other estimates include-</PARA>
<PARA> David Connolly, MP: ''. . . tax avoidance which is currently estimated to cost the Government approximately five billion in lost revenue.''</PARA>
<PARA> National Times, March 7-13, 1982: ''. . . at the very least an overall total of some $5,000 million a year is lost, and that the true figure could be very much higher.''</PARA>
<PARA> Andrew Peacock, MP: ''. . . the cost to revenue is estimated to be around $7, 000m.''</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The estimates of revenue losses contained in this document are necessarily imprecise. They are based on official information available from the Treasurer but it might be said that the Treasurer has been more than a little coy in the past in owning up to the extent of the revenue losses. The contributions that the schemes have made to the losses also vary enormously-from $2 billion under one scheme to about $2m under another scheme. However, as I indicated, the basis of the information in relation to these losses has been provided by the Treasurer himself. It is now clear that under these 22 schemes alone there has been a loss of at least $2 billion to $3 billion. This is the amount which could have been recovered if the Government had developed some enthusiasm for retrospective legislation a little earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But even this is only a small fraction of the total amount that has been lost through tax avoidance and evasion. Professor Mathews, who I am sure is respected in this area on both sides of the House, has estimated that the loss has been running at nearly $3 billion every year. Other estimates put the figure even higher. Even the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) says that the Government has lost $5 billion. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) says that tax avoidance has cost the revenue around $7 billion. So honourable members do not have to take the Opposition's word for it; they can take the word of anyone from Professor Mathews to the honourable member for Bradfield. Either way, the estimate of $2 billion to $3 billion in relation to those 22 schemes which the Government has already outlawed must be considered to be cautious. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government now proposes to recover only about 20 per cent of this amount by proceeding to recover tax avoided by just one of those 22 schemes. We have no idea how effective the Government's legislation will be. We have no idea what that legislation will look like, but even if it is as effective as its proponents claim, it will still recover only 20 per cent of the tax which has been lost as a result of the operation of blatantly artificial tax avoidance schemes which the Government has already outlawed. The Opposition calls on the Government now, and will continue to call on the Government, to introduce legislation to recover all of the tax evaded under all of these schemes. If this Government does not act the next Labor Government will. Presumably, while the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been frothing at the mouth about bottom-of -the-harbour participants they have condoned participation in other schemes. It is rather like objecting to the thief who robs a bank at gunpoint but congratulating the other thief who blows apart the vault. It is also rather like saying that Ronald Biggs can keep the payroll that he snatched so long as he pays for the train ticket. </PARA>
<PARA> This convenient double standard simply will not do. On the Prime Minister's own assessment all the tax avoided through these schemes is stolen money. It has all had to be made up by the extra contributions of other, decent law abiding taxpayers. We will not be satisfied with just getting back some of the money; we want the lot because not only will it be in this way that the ordinary wage and salary earners begin to be repaid for the crippling rates of tax which have been extracted from them in recent times, but also the people themselves want the whole of the ransom returned and not just one down payment. This is not an unreasonable demand. The people who should have paid the tax still have it. They still have the money, whether it be in cash or stashed away in some assets. The money is not theirs; it belongs to the people of Australia and it ought to be returned to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not proposing and we never have proposed that the criminality of these actions should be retrospective. We just want those involved to repay the money which today they would have to pay and which at the time they knew they should have paid. It is not as if this is a novel idea, even though the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are recent and fair weather converts to it. My colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has been proposing this action for years. In November 1978 he called for retrospective legislation to protect the revenue. He repeated the call in March 1979, in December 1980 and again in April of this year, just to name a few occasions. When the Government moved to outlaw the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes the honourable member for Gellibrand said:</PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing to recover the losses? Obviously the losses have been enormous, but in the legislation currently before us there is nothing which will enable the Government to get back any of the revenue that has been lost up to this point. Why has not the Government sought to take some action to get back that revenue?</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is a question which has continued to be asked of the Government until belatedly, reluctantly and only in the face of mounting public hostility and accidental disclosures on the part of Mr Costigan, the Government is now to be dragged, we hope tomorrow, kicking and screaming into the Parliament with a piece of legislation which will take some action in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's view is not limited to the obvious objective of retrieving the stolen money. It believes that without some element of retrospectivity the tax avoidance industry cannot be defeated. Whilst it is possible it wipe out schemes on a case by case basis, unless the risks of eventually having to pay the tax are made so great we will never prevent people from participating in these schemes in the hope of picking up the benefits from them. That is why, because the Government will not embrace the notion of retrospectivity with enthusiasm, it will never destroy the tax avoidance industry. Yet it is an action which we on the Opposition side have been urging on the Government for six years. The Treasurer seems to think that the tax avoidance industry is already dead despite the amazing amount of evidence to the contrary everywhere in the country. Advertisements still abound offering people the opportunity to participate in these schemes. In the past the Treasurer has taken very much notice of what tax avoiders are up to. When he was considering whether he had the power legally to act against bottom-of-the-harbour schemes back in 1978 and before 1980 he quoted , as one of the justifications for not acting the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Persons known to be operating the schemes do so quite openly and must be taken to share this view. </PARA>
<PARA>That the existing law is inadequate, that is. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It can be safely assumed that their apparent confidence is founded on the basis of legal opinions. </PARA>
<PARA>Whenever the Treasurer wants advice, he goes to a tax avoider or to a former tax avoider. We are concerned about trying to restore the public's confidence in the fairness of the Australian taxation system. Most Australians, whilst not happy- not doing hand springs-about the prospect of paying their taxes, are prepared to do so without protest only if they are convinced that everyone else is compelled to do likewise. That is why it is important that this action should be taken to reassure ordinary decent Australians that it is worth paying their taxes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party is very much a Johnny- come-lately party as far as its will to tackle tax avoidance and evasion is concerned. The very reason for this is that in 1973, when the matter was first identified, there was no action; that is, there was no action until December 1974. On 1 December 1974, the then Treasurer made a Press statement. I shall read part of that statement. It does not misrepresent the point of view of the Australian Labor Party, the government at that time. Mr Crean said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Court decisions on these schemes have so far upheld assessments made by the Commissioner. In doing so, however, they have provided a blueprint which, if followed by family companies, may result in the companies being legally, but quite artificially, within an income tax definition of 'non-profit' company designed to confer public company status for tax purposes on social clubs and the like. </PARA>
<PARA>On 1 December 1974, the then Treasurer said that a blueprint was available for tax avoidance. What happened? There were three successive Labor Treasurers-Mr Crean, Mr Cairns and Mr Hayden, the present Leader of the Opposition. Not one of them took a step on the matter. Yet, on 1 December 1974, the Treasurer gave a Christmas box to the tax avoiders in Australia. He started, by those comments, much of the activities within the tax exasion industry. Mr Crean identified at that time the very schemes of which the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) has complained. Mr Crean, in that Press statement of 1 December, identified the Curran scheme and other schemes that have since been proved to be tax avoidance schemes and in regard to which the current Government has taken action. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall point out to honourable members the time factors in regard to this matter. The Australian Labor Party came to office at the end of 1972. In 12 months, it found that some tax evasion was going on. It was really a blueprint. That blueprint was identified and publicised to the tax avoidance industry. By the time the Australian Labor Party went out of office at the end of 1975, not one action had taken place. A period of almost two years expired during which there was no action. During that period, the Australian Labor Party, the Government, knew that there was tax avoidance. The Treasurer said that there was avoidance and evasion. He identified the schemes and said 'there is a blueprint' , and the Government did nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the current Government. Within a period of 12 months, the Treasurer of the day, Sir Phillip Lynch, as he now is, made the following statement in his Budget Speech:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is well aware of the activities in recent years of tax planners who, increasingly, are promoting tax avoidance schemes and arrangements throughout the business and professional community. </PARA>
<PARA> We propose to crack down hard on such practices. </PARA>
<PARA>Within months there was legislation to cover general anti-avoidance provisions, trading stock schemes, gifts, trusts, dividends, trafficking in current year loss companies, sales tax avoidance, pre-payment schemes, schemes to postpone tax liability, Curran schemes, expenditure recoupment schemes, carry-forward of loss schemes, depreciation schemes, straw companies, trust schemes, deceased estates, definitions of public companies related to tax avoidance, royalties received by non-residents, payments to employees, diverting income through tax exempt bodies, transfer pricing, short term property transactions, and other schemes. The next schemes in regard to which the Government will legislate are bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind that record of action, compared with Labor's inaction-and the identification of a blueprint and nothing more-I think that the comments made by the honourable member for Fremantle stand as the shallow statements that they are. Some time after the current Treasurer took up the cause against tax avoidance and evasion-he has in fact been a crusader in this field-the Australian Labor Party suddenly found that it is an area in which it would like to be interested. I am fascinated by the bids of various amounts of money that the Australian Labor Party claims have been avoided. The bids started off, as I remember them, at $800m to $900m. They quickly went to $1,500m, $2,000m, $5,000m and to $7,000m. I have even seen comments made by the Leader of the Opposition to the effect that the amounts are $10,000m or $15,000m. That bidding seems to increase at a rapid rate, in exactly the same way as inflation took off under the administration of the Treasurer of the day, Mr Hayden, the present Leader of the Opposition. These bids have been so extravagant and arrived at so quickly that nobody can even guess whether they are right. Members of the Opposition are plucking figures out of the air. They seem to want to out-bid each other. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the House to the action taken by the Government and the way in which decision-making takes place. I refer the House to the Leary decision of 1980. On 25 June, the Commissioner of Taxation took a Mr Leary to court concerning his tax claims. The scheme was that the taxpayer, for gift purposes, effectively outlaid an amount of money and sought a deduction. In this case the deduction sought was $10,000 and was disallowed by the Taxation Office. An appeal was made in the Western Australian Supreme Court. This was a case identified and acted upon in Western Australia. The case was dismissed by the Western Australian Supreme Court and it then went to the Federal Court of Australia where the appeal was dismissed. Leary was then refused leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia. A final decision came through in 1980. But, within weeks of that case being undertaken by the Commissioner of Taxation, legislation was introduced into this Parliament. The fact is that, in June 1977, Leary was brought before the court. Before that case was concluded in October of the same year, this Government acted to block that tax scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the House to another case, the case of Ilbery-another Western Australian scheme, interestingly enough. The case, concerning pre-paid interest, commenced in June 1977 and it concluded in the High Court in 1981. In April 1978 , within 12 months of the scheme being identified, this Government acted. In those two cases, as in every other case, the Government acted against tax evasion as the schemes were identified, properly brought people before the courts and collected the outstanding tax. There has been a total collection of over $3,000m over that period. That is not a program in which people have dragged their feet and said: 'There is a blueprint; go out and copy it'. That is not a program in which there is no real commitment to tax avoidance legislation. That is not a program in which sitting around are people including a Treasurer who must have known about it. He became the Leader of the Opposition. In those earlier days he did nothing and said nothing on the matter. Then five years later he and his colleagues discover that tax evasion schemes have been going on . It seems to me that, under those circumstances, this Government's record is a good record and one which will be continued as schemes are identified and the need to move against schemes becomes apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say a few words concerning the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and the prospects for the introduction into this House of the legislation contemplated by the Government following its examination by the Government parties. The scheme is an interesting scheme because it was promoted by individuals who took some part of the results of the proceedings for their own benefit. I would have to say that anybody entering into such a scheme would almost certainly be aware of what he was about to do. In the first instance, such a person would have to accumulate his assets in such a way that the only creditor was the Commissioner of Taxation. That would involve the forming of a new company, probably one with a name similar to the name of the company under which he was trading. He would have to accumulate all his assets under the one company with the only creditor being the Commissioner of Taxation. He would then have to sell that company. Generally such sales were under the conditions outlined by the promoter. Frequently the promoter would insert a clause which said that if one was selling a profitable company it would be the purchaser's responsibility to attend to income tax payments in respect of the year of sale. If any company director or officer was unaware that there were problems he did not deserve to hold the office of director or officer of a company. By accumulating the profits and the assets under a single organisation with only one creditor-the Taxation Office-and then selling that company to somebody who said that he would fix up the tax, I believe that the people making the sale must have been aware of some of the consequences of the sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to move against those companies and people who made those decisions. I believe that the guilty party in this instance must be the person who has promoted the scheme and who has artificially devised the process. He is the guilty party. He is the person who is identified in the McCabe- Lafranchi report. That is the sort of person that State governments, through their corporate affairs commissions, should have been pursuing long ago. That is the sort of person that corporate affairs commissions all round Australia were striking off their books when the companies were dumped. Not one State in Australia bothered to pursue this false arrangement. Not one individual identified this process in State administrations. We have the Attorney-General of New South Wales and the Premier of Victoria saying that it is a tax matter and the Taxation Commissioner should fix it up or that it is a Federal matter and the Federal authorities are the ones to blame, but right under their noses all this time a process has been going on of which their officers should have been aware and for which their officers have been criticised in the McCabe- Lafranchi report. I will read one extract from that report in this regard. The McCabe-Lafranchi report states:</PARA>
<PARA> That the disclosed abuse of the provisions of the Companies Act in the course of implementation of a tax avoidance or evasion scheme must be deplored. </PARA>
<PARA>Those strong words were used in the report of the examination conducted by those inspectors. The report criticised at the same time some of the banking procedures in Australia. I am saying to the House that outlawing tax evasion is not a function of just one government. I believe that, despite enacted legislation, if the Commonwealth Government stands alone and does not have the support and assistance of the State authorities and the banking system the same sort of thing could happen again. It is all very well for Mr Cain and Mr Walker to wash their hands of this matter and walk away from it but if they walk away from it they are assisting the ressurection of similar schemes. If we are to stop the illegitimate use by companies of the tax system and if we are to stop the illegitimate use of the various possibilities that are put by promoters to company owners we must have a total commitment by all governments in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is any justice in this country, I believe that those people who devised the scheme, broke the law, defrauded the revenue and defrauded the processes of company law in Australia, are the ones who should be pursued. The Government is determined to make sure that those people who should have paid tax will pay tax. It is a commitment to recoup tax. Those people who are involved in such schemes should be aware that that is the Government's intention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner we were discussing the matter of public importance which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The urgent need for retrospective legislation to recover tax revenue totalling over $2 billion lost through over 20 tax avoidance schemes already outlawed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner we were treated to a discourse by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). He referred to the Australian Labor Party as being a Johnny-come-lately on the matter of tax avoidance and dealt with the Labor Party's failure to act on the Curran scheme in 1974. The relevance of those matters of course escaped everybody except the honourable member for Mitchell. Tonight we are dealing with the performance of the Fraser Government in the area of tax avoidance. In view of the matters raised by the honourable member for Mitchell I think the record ought to be put straight very early this evening. I propose to do that by looking at the taxation statistics of the Commissioner of Taxation which were tabled in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Those statistics reveal that the following numbers of taxpayers were involved in tax avoidance schemes during recent years under the Fraser Government. In 1979, 9,655 individuals were identified, involving an amount of $317m. The number of companies involved was 1,603, involving an amount of $107m. By 1980 the number of individuals had increased to 14,313, the amount involved being $ 489m. The number of companies had increased to 2,920, the amount involved being $222m. By 1981 the individuals numbered 17,957 and the amount involved was $620m . The number of companies involved was 4,409 and the amount involved was $353m. That is, in two years under this Government the number of individuals involved and identified as being involved in tax avoidance schemes increased by a scandalous 8,307 and the amount involved increased by $303m. The number of companies involved over the same period increased by 2,806 and the amount of money involved by $246m. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the answer to the allegations of the honourable member for Mitchell in relation to the performance of this Government in the area of tax avoidance. The honourable member also talked at some length about the fact that there had been a lot of legislation. He referred to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) as a crusader in the field of tax avoidance. We agree that the Treasurer has attempted, in fact, to establish an image as a great crusader against tax avoidance. He almost plays the role of the Lone Ranger of modern times. But it was not until the revelations of the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union that the appalling record of the Treasurer and this Government was disclosed. The Treasurer was left like a shag on a rock as a result of the revelations which came out in those two reports. It is a matter of record that he has filled this place with legislation and plenty of hot air. He has adopted a posture for the people of Australia by legislating for the sake of it, but with no real result. The Treasurer admits that bottom-of-the-harbour company stripping was first alluded to in early 1978. In fact, Mr Costigan, on page 27 of his report states:</PARA>
<PARA> This scheme was first detected in a widespread manner by the Australian Taxation Office in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a long while earlier than early 1978, which was alluded to by the Treasurer. In fact, in November 1975 authority was given to launch prosecutions but that was put into the too hard basket by a government which was not prepared to act then and has continued to do nothing. The Treasurer has always attempted to excuse his inactivity and the inactivity of the Government on the basis that the laws prior to December 1980 were inadequate. As late as 14 September this year he has continued to repeat this pathetic plea. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It had always been my belief until the McCabe-Lafranchi report came out, which caused the Government to have another look at the situation, and it was a bona fide belief on my part, that the existing law was not adequate to the task and that the 1980 legislation was in fact necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer, of course, was referring to his cure-all legislation of December 1980-the much-vaunted Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act-which was passed by this House almost two years ago. The claim that existing laws were inadequate is a contradiction of numerous legal opinions which were given prior to December 1980 . These opinions have been cited over and over again in debates during this sitting and I do not propose to go through them all again. But plenty of opinions were available to contradict the view which is so often put forward by the Treasurer as an excuse for his inactivity. We and the people of Australia are expected to believe that all these people were wrong and the Treasurer is the only one who is in fact correct. It is a most unlikely conclusion, particularly having regard to the fact that the main thrust of the legal advice given was subsequently supported by the McCabe-Lafranchi report and by Mr Costigan. In addition there was a detailed report by a Mr Todman, a senior investigator of the Taxation Office, which report it appears was also ignored by the Treasurer when reaching his conclusion, in good faith, that the existing law was inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the Government in delaying for seven years before seeking advice from the Solicitor-General is incredible. It is noted tonight that prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, when the Treasurer tabled statements and documents which were called for as a result of a resolution of the Senate, the Treasurer indicated that he had taken the advice of the Solicitor-General not to table some legal opinions which he listed. He went on to say that he believed there was no other proper course the Government could follow. It is a rather extraordinary turn-round because now, when it suits the Treasurer and the Government, the Solicitor-General's advice is accepted without question. Yet the Treasurer admits that it was not until May 1982-that is, after the release of the McCabe-Lafranchi report-that he sought the advice of the Solicitor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> It came as no surprise that the Solicitor- General, in reviewing earlier advice given to the Government, indicated that in relation to a particular case action was available under both Commonwealth and State laws. It would be interesting to know what matters the Solicitor-General was asked to advise on and for us to be fully aware of the advice given by the Solicitor-General. The Parliament has not been given the opportunity of seeing what the Solicitor-General actually said in relation to the position regarding prosecutions prior to December 1980, but obviously his opinion gave further support to the view that prosecutions could have been launched under existing law. No action was taken because the Treasurer and the Government are not and have never been fair dinkum about prosecuting tax cheats. It has been a matter of all rhetoric and no substance. In this House on 16 September the Treasurer stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Until such time as a court of this country demonstrates that a person involved in that-</PARA>
<PARA>I assume that the Treasurer was referring to the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes-</PARA>
<PARA>could have been effectively prosecuted under the previous law, the opinions given by the Solicitor-General, whom I respect enormously as a lawyer, and the opinion given by Mr Costigan represent not declaration of the law, but opinions by them about the law. </PARA>
<PARA>We all understand that, but the fact is that this Government failed to take any action. It sent nobody for trial. It did nothing about the matter. On 13 September in a hearing before Estimates Committee A the Crown Solicitor, Mr O' Donovan, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say categorically that, before Mr Costigan's report was published, there was no instruction or request to my knowledge given in my office for a prosecution under the 1980 Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that it was not until after the Costigan report and the McCabe-Lafranchi report that we heard all the talk about what was going to be done and what prosecutions would take place. As a further smokescreen we have --</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Government in this discussion of a matter of public importance. I do so in a very serious vein because this is a particularly serious debate on a serious subject, one in which none of us can claim to be experts. Neither the Government nor the Opposition can afford to be making allegations which cannot be substantiated. Too frequently the argument of avoidance has been caught up with the argument of evasion. They are two entirely different subjects. In fact, the law courts have indicated by judgments that tax minimisation is a fair thing. Any taxpayer can arrange his affairs to attract the minimum amount of tax. As far as I can see, tax avoidance promoters go on from there to suggest that people are allowed to take advantage of an Act that perhaps provides loopholes where the intention was not so declared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tax evasion is something that has been with us since the Romans tried to collect taxes from their citizens, probably with about the same result. There are three different categories. If we are going to confine our debate to tax avoidance, let us do so on the basis of principle. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) has adopted the principle of bringing up anti-avoidance legislation piece by piece. The final legislation of 1980 that brought forward section 177 of the Income Tax Assessment Act to strengthen or replace section 260 was from a Treasurer who has , at various times, brought in legislation to prevent avoidance through particular loopholes. In the main, section 177 closes off the loopholes. That is why I think he says quite seriously and honestly that schemes since 1980 are not avoidance measures. The bottom-of-the-harbour schemes could be described as tax evasion. We have had a very serious attempt to come to grips with a very difficult subject. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem does not lie only with the present Government. At the risk of boring the Opposition, I say that during its three years in government it attempted to do nothing in this respect. The Treasurer of the day might have been faced with the same insurmountable problems and he might have done something about them. I think it is fair that we should make that comparison for the record. We have had a Treasurer who has been genuine in his attempts but he would not use this final act of retrospectivity. The Labor record is that it did nothing to strengthen the anti-avoidance measures in section 260. It certainly did not act against Curran schemes, which were the major avoidance practice at that time. It did fiddle with capital gains tax, it did take things away from the rural sector and it did restructure tax rates in such a way that there was a dramatic increase in tax collections in that time.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get back to the principle of trying to separate tax evasion. I suggest that the honourable member who is interjecting is probably evading his proper responsibilities to this House by not sitting and listening to what is a fair attempt to try to come to grips with a very difficult subject. I suggest that the argument tonight revolves around retrospectivity. The Opposition fairly puts the onus on this matter of public importance as the basic focus. As I see it, retrospective legislation against any practice, legislation which tries to make illegal today something that was legal yesterday, is just not on. Yet, as I recall, on every Bill that the Treasurer has introduced against avoidance practices, the Opposition would have had that legislation operate retrospectively to the beginning of the year. It is a basic difference in philosophies. The measure that we are yet to see in this House, which will probably be debated tomorrow, I regard as not being retrospective. If it acts against a practice of evasion of taxation or an abuse of taxation there are already powers within the law for us to go back to deal with such offences. The legislation that is to be brought into this House tomorrow will strengthen the anti-evasion clauses of the legislation. We cannot tolerate, and business cannot tolerate, laws being retrospectively applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we accept the Opposition's argument we might expect that those avoidance practices which were lawful and legal according to the Act which the Opposition operated under from 1972 to 1975 would suddenly become illegal. That is not the way that one tries to get to the bottom of the problem. We are not making a better law; we are making a law worse by making legislation retrospective. That is something I demonstrated my feeling on in 1978 by crossing the floor to stand with five others in connection with the Curran scheme. I considered that to be retrospective legislation, but that involved a difference of opinion. We cannot tolerate laws being retrospectively applied. Let us see what might happen if the Australian Labor Party took this matter to a conclusion. Would any capital gains tax that might be imposed be retrospective to a year, two years or three years ago? Would it make unlawful in retrospect any of those practices and avoidances that are now legal under the legislation? We have to be careful of this point within this debate. Labor knows what it is doing. The Opposition knows what it is doing and what it is talking about. In the argument so far honourable members have certainly skimmed the surface but have not plumbed the depths of the real tax evasion-tax avoidance issue. If there is a serious suggestion by members of the Opposition that they wish to come to grips with this problem, for goodness sake, let them use proper figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who spoke for the Government before dinner, mentioned various figures. I have heard quoted figures from $400m to $1 billion, $2 billion and $10 billion-$15 billion was the limit. This seemed to be increasing depending on the degree of publicity that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) could get, or his audience. I suggest that he is not talking about tax avoidance. It is not the wealthy people of this country or the companies who are practising tax avoidance; it is the people who, from time immemorial, have practised tax evasion and abused the privileges of being in a society by not paying their fair share. What members of the Opposition are saying is basically geared not to the wealthy, not to the conservatives but to the people in their own party, their own unions. This is happening at every level. In fact, I would suggest that--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member who interjects is prepared to put his tax return to an independent tribunal and arbitrator I will submit mine to the same and we will see whether he can stand on the basis that he is not a tax evader. Tax evasion is so prevalent that there are very few people within the community who can say with any justification that they do not now and never will evade a portion of their tax. This is the problem we should be addressing ourselves to. We should not address ourselves to the problem by applying legislation retropectively one year, two years, five years or seven years. What did the Opposition do with Curran schemes? It did nothing. The crux of the matter is that while the Treasurer has made a very deliberate attempt to overcome the problem of tax avoidance, the whole Income Tax Assessment Act needs to be restructured, it needs to be rewritten and it needs to be looked at so that these particular matters are made certain in the light of the legislation that was passed in 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is a message from this discussion of a matter of public importance, it is for both the Opposition and the Government to realise that we are dealing in an antiquated Act and very modern sharp practices. The only way we can really relieve ourselves of the burden of having to bear tax avoidance or tax evasion is by restructuring the Act to bring it up to date with modern practices. I think that has been debated from time to time, but very little seems to be done about it. If I have a complaint it is possibly that not enough focus is being placed on the restructuring of the legislation. All we are trying to do, like the boy at the dyke, is put our fingers in the holes as they appear. I had hoped that section 170 would overcome that. Let it not be felt within the Parliament that the Opposition which brings this matter of public importance forward is not as guilty as any other party. Its track record has been dismal. Its performance as the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) said, has been one of little interest. The Labor Party was certainly not interested in 1972 to 1975. In fact it was not interested until just recently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Further to my answer to a question on air traffic controller recruitment asked by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) this afternoon, I would like to make a brief amplifying statement addressing in particular his question as to whether any overseas persons are recruited for the three-year training course. First, I should point out that my Department recruits only overseas persons who have some aviation experience and, in the case of the United States of America, only trained and experienced air traffic controllers. Such overseas recruitment had been necessitated by ATC staff shortages such as that which recently occasioned partial closure of Brisbane airport, largely due to an unexpectedly high invalidity rate in Queensland. Overseas recruits, being experienced, are selected for the 12-month training course designed for that purpose. No person has ever been recruited overseas for the three-year course, nor has this ever been contemplated. The success of recent recruitment activity in Australia and overseas makes it unlikely that any further overseas recruitment will be required in the foreseeable future. No Australian applicant has failed to gain selection as a result of the overseas recruitment campaigns. The Department has always had difficulty in recruiting sufficient suitable applicants in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From the information provided by my Department which I have just conveyed to this House it will be clear that the assertion made by the honourable member for Wills in his question-he said that my Department had a program for bringing people from the United States to this country to train as air traffic controllers for the three-year course-is without foundation. It would appear that the honourable member for Wills misread the telex from which he quoted this afternoon.

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia shows:</PARA>
<PARA> It has come to our attention that Government funding for Pre-School education is not being maintained at a level consistent with increasing recurrent costs.</PARA>
<PARA> Kindergartens provide community involvement for both parents and children. Approximately 21 per cent of the funding for Kindergartens comes from within the community: this is obviously a happy balance which, if destroyed, would deny equal opportunity to the less privileged children.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All my best jokes are not recognised. The Opposition does not oppose the Cotton Levy Bill 1982 and the Cotton Research Bill 1982. I hope that members of the National Country Party do not run around the bush saying that we do oppose the Bills because we do not. I do not know whether I have to say three times that we do not oppose these Bills. The Bills basically implement a cotton research scheme along the same lines as other rural industry research schemes, and that is that the Commonwealth Government matches levies on a dollar for dollar basis. A committee is to be appointed by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) to formulate a program of research and levels of expenditure from the research account. The Cotton Levy Bill provides for the collection of levies from growers. The initial levy will be $1 per bale but it can be increased by regulation to $3 per bale. The contribution in 1982-83 will be approximately $200,000 or $600,000 in a full year at current production levels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only comment that the Opposition can make about these Bills is that they formalise the voluntary payment of levies by cotton producers over the past nine years and make the industry research eligible for Commonwealth funding. The only question one could ask is why it has taken nine years to place cotton industry research on the same footing as other rural industry research. It appears that the industry was reluctant to become involved with government. It has enjoyed a fair level of Commonwealth Government support in the past, but it seems to have gone on its own in terms of research. There is a formal requirement in the Bills for the Cotton Research Committee to be accountable for its activities but only to itself. The Opposition questions whether this is an adequate safeguard for the producers and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a facility in the Bills to increase the levy from $1 per bale to $3 per bale without the need to amend the Cotton Levy Bill. The other night we were talking about the Dried Vine Fruits Levy Bill. That was also a feature of the way the Government is moving on these matters, and I address some general comments to that. There has been an increase in the dried vine fruits levy from about $4 a tonne to $7.50 a tonne this year. The Dried Vine Fruits Levy Bill increases it to $15 a tonne. It seems that there is an element of open-endedness in these levy Bills to enable the Government to move by way of regulation. These provisions do not allow any scrutiny of very important industries by the Parliament or give honourable members who have the industries in their electorates the chance to speak on behalf of the industries to raise problems. It is always a problem for honourable members trying to represent their electorates that there are so few opportunities for them to set, in any way, the agenda for the debates that go on here. Honourable members want to raise rather important questions that affect their electorates, particularly rural electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> We simply ask: Is it the Government's intention to introduce gradually and without comment an open-ended levy system? We put it to the Parliament that producers' interests may be better served if the Government made a clear statement of its policy towards grower funding of research and promotional activities and, in turn, the rights that producers have in relation to overseeing the use of their contributions. I do not think that we need to open this debate up very much. This is not a minor piece of legislation for the industry but it is one whereby the parameters are set. It falls into line with other industry funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I was recently in Biloela in Queensland with the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham). We saw a few cotton farms and the Cotton Marketing Board in that State. One of the key industry issues is the availability of water for irrigation. The cost of water is an issue, particularly in New South Wales where it is drawn from the Darling River, which as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, is a tributary of the Murray River. South Australia has objected to New South Wales issuing more irrigation licences to cotton growers on the Darling because this reduces flow on the Murray River. This is a very contentious point. It is felt that the potential for expansion in the cotton industry resides in the north west flood plains of New South Wales. This is an issue that the industry will have to give more attention to. </PARA>
<PARA> The growth of the Australian cotton industry has been most marked in north-west New South Wales and south central Queensland where the availability of irrigation water from dam storages has lifted production from 122,000 bales in 1969 to an estimated 430,000 bales in 1981. Factors in the expansion of Australia's cotton industry have included good irrigation techniques-which can more than double the crop-mechanical harvesting, sustained world demand attributable to a trend towards natural fibres, and the sensitivity of man-made fibres to petroleum prices during the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Agricultural Economics 1982 assessment of the outlook for cotton expects Australian cotton production to increase by at least a third between 1980-81 and 1985-86 but is more pessimistic in estimating the real, as opposed to money, prices to be obtained. Since a major component in that assessment was a continuing appreciation of the Australian dollar, which has manifestly not been fulfilled in recent times, the position of Australian cotton on the world market may be more competitive than estimated-even where the potentially increased competition from man-made fibres eventuates. The slower rate of increase in prices of petro-chemical feed stocks and the continuing research and development towards 'natural' qualities such as flame resistance enhances the potential competitiveness of man-made fibres. </PARA>
<PARA> The scope for research in Australian cotton production in various aspects of irrigation management, pesticide application-this is one aspect which is the subject of a lot of contention-mechanical harvesting and handling during processing indicates that substantial efficiency gains are possible. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's development of new cotton varieties resistant to heliothis, to be available to growers in 1983, further illustrates the potential for research since cotton crops require up to six months of chemical spraying; the heliothis caterpillar is cotton's worst enemy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has been notable for the relative absence of government and research institutions although substantial research has been carried out by such government organisations as the CSIRO and the New South Wales Department of Primary Industry. The Australian Cotton Foundation comprises the three operators of cotton gins in Australia-the Cotton Marketing Board of Queensland and, from New South Wales, the Namoi Cotton Co-operative Ltd and Auscott Pty Ltd. The Cotton Research Bill, as I have already said, aims to put on a statutory basis a voluntary research levy which has been paid to and distributed by the Australian Cotton Growers Research Association for the past nine years reaching a maximum rate of $1 a bale in 1980. The Bill establishes two separate accounts: One, into which the statutory levy is paid, will be matched by the Commonwealth on a dollar for dollar basis; and the second account will hold other sundry income not so matched. For ease of collection, payments will be made by the three processors which will be entitled to deduct the amounts from their payments to growers. Funding of research from the Cotton Research Trust Account is to be directed by the Minister for Primary Industry on the recommendation of the Cotton Research Committee which will be established by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think there is much else that the Opposition would like to say about this legislation. But I refer to the availability of new cotton growing areas in Queensland and in the Macquarie and Gwydir valleys of New South Wales. The favourable position of cotton vis-a-vis other competitive crops may see some expansion in cotton production in the near future. It is an industry that required a fair amount of government assistance at the outset but, by and large, it has gone its own way. It has gone its own way very well since that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other comment I have to make is that, in his second reading speech, the Minister for Primary Industry said:</PARA>
<PARA> Cotton has become Australia's fifth largest agricultural export crop, shipments in 1981-82 being valued at $117m. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister said that this levy arrangement will help in the production and export potential of the crop. The Opposition agrees with that. I raise this matter because I recently went through the statistics trying to work out the rating of the fishing industry as an export earner. Either the fishing industry is regarded as a primary industry or it is not; but the fishing industry accounts for some $250m of export earnings. When one looks at the other major earners of wheat, wool, beef, barley and sugar, I suggest that perhaps cotton comes in sixth rather than fifth. But this is a problem of definition. I hope that the statistics will be good enough soon so that we can say quite definitely where the primary industries' rankings are-whether barley should be included with wheat, with grains or whatever is always a bit of a definitional problem. Cotton is a large agricultural export earner. It is a viable industry. The Opposition welcomes this move by the Government to put the research funding of this very important industry-a very important regional industry-on the same footing as other agricultural industries. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also support the Cotton Levy Bill 1982 and the Cotton Research Bill 1982. Before going into my argument, I point out to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) that it is important to remember that the cotton industry has not come to government to seek help. I think that it is important that people in the industry have been able to stand on their own two feet for the last seven or eight years. Also, it is important to remember that the levy is not open-ended, that there is a limit of $3 a bale on the levy rate. The growers themselves will be well represented on the Cotton Research Committee as the Cotton Research Bill allows for five representatives from the industry to be appointed to that body. Those points that I took from the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa needed in my view rebuffing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cotton industry, of course, is very much a pioneer industry in Australia. It has attracted many practical farmers and others who have been prepared as pioneers to go out to establish themselves. They are very aggressive and regarded as some of the best and most innovative farmers in Australia. That is why the industry has been so successful. It must be remembered also that the American contribution to this industry has been very great. Auscott Pty Ltd is a very big private company associated with the cotton industry. It was really the American cotton growers who came to Australia and established themselves in places like St George in my electorate who got the industry going. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills, of course, have been welcomed by the industry. As the honourable member for Werriwa pointed out, there will be a levy of $1 per unit of 225 kilograms which, in industry terms, is $1 a bale. The levy rate may be changed by regulation up to a maximum of $3 per 225 kilograms. This levy is to be applied after 1 March 1983. The levy will be collected by the cotton processors, or gins as they are called. Gins have been established by the Cotton Marketing Board in Queensland. There are gins at St George, Cecil Plans and Emerald in Queensland. In New South Wales the Namoi Cotton Co-operative Ltd has a gin and Auscott, a company I mentioned previously, is big enough to have its own gin. Presently there are proposals afoot to estabish a gin at Bourke on the Darling River. The commencement of cotton growing at Bourke is something that we should encourage as it would do a lot for the people in that remote area. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been mentioned, the Commonwealth's contribution is on a dollar for dollar basis. I think that the Government should be congratulated for being prepared to contribute half the funds raised by the industry. Research is very expensive. Of course, most of the funds raised will be spent. The Cotton Research Committee will consist of 10 members who will be appointed for three years. As I mentioned, there will be five cotton grower representatives. The Queensland Department of Primary Industry and the New South Wales Department of Agriculture will each have a representative. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Australian universities will have representatives. The representative of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry will be the Chairman of that Committee. The Committee will be required to submit an annual report to this Parliament, as all statutory bodies are required to do. It is hoped to increase the quality and quantity of production by the expenditure of this money. There is a variety of cotton called Namkalla which is of very high quality and yet is capable of yielding only a bale to the acre, whereas the normal varieties are yielding up to two or three bales an acre . It is important that research continue with this variety of cotton to see whether its production can be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> A facet of the research is spraying. It is well known that up to 25 sprays are required each season for heliosis and the grubs that eat into the cotton crop. An enormous amount of spraying is going on and research is continuing into better types of sprays for use in the environment. Such work is well worth encouraging. It is interesting to note that the latest spraying techniques is the use of an electrostatic spray. The spray itself has an electric charge and when sprayed sticks to the plant. Therefore a lot less spray is needed. Also research is needed into more efficient methods of spraying by aeroplane, which is a continuing facet of spraying. All sorts of large capacity spray planes are coming on to the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Research is also needed into the better use of water. As honourable members will know, huge rain lines are now very much the thing. These huge walking irrigators cover 100 to 200 acres at a time and apply water much more efficiently than the old flood type of irrigation. The trickle irrigation system which was developed in Israel has tremendous potential for cotton crops. In America there are now machines that can lay polythene pipes for trickle irrigation in broad acre cultivation. This is the way of the future in irrigation. Pipes will be laid under the ground rather than on top. Evaporation of water is very high. In surface irrigation I would imagine that up to 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the water applied is lost into the air without being used . </PARA>
<PARA> The cotton industry is a very high input and high return industry. The net return is not necessarily high but there are many risks involved. The people in the industry have been encouraged by this Government. We reintroduced a 100 per cent write off for water and all its ancillary equipment. I believe that is an excellent thing for the industry. Without that assistance the industry would not be as productive as it is. It must be remembered that the Australian Labor Party saw fit to withdraw most of these means of assistance when it spent its short period in government. No doubt Labor will do it again if it ever returns to power. Of course, that is a big if. The cost of production per acre is $600. The gross return is 2 1/2 bales an acre. The return is roughly $300 a bale. That gives a gross return of $750 an acre or $150 a bale. Therefore, as honourable members can see, it is a high input and high output industry with a lot of risks involved. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated, gins have been established at Cecil Plains, at St George, which is in my electorate, at Emerald in central Queensland, on the Darling Downs and at Goondiwindi, which is an expanding area. In New South Wales gins have been established at Narrabri, Wee Waa, Moree and Boggabilla. The production in 1982 in the Namoi area was 269,000 bales. The Auscott company produced 212,000 bales. Honourable members can see that that free enterprise company makes an enormous contribution to this vital Australian industry. Queensland produced 114,000 bales of a total production of 596,000 bales. </PARA>
<PARA> The projected crop for 1983 is down due to the drought. It is unfortunate that we have this phenomenon upon us once again. It is very much a recurring part of our weather scene. Of course, irrigation is the only way we can handle drought. This year it is expected that production will be down to roughly 110,000 bales. Our main markets are Japan, China and South East Asia. We use 90,000 bales on the domestic market. The total value of cotton production last year was $178m, so honourable members can see that the industry made quite a contribution to the gross national product of Australia. The production for last year was up 16 per cent on that for the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> There are by-products from cotton. We do not use cotton just for the spinning of shirts. The poultry, pig and dairy industries make use of the by-products of cotton. The cotton seed is crushed for oil and used in all sorts of products, including paints. The overall real value of cotton is falling, which makes it more difficult for farmers to compete on the world market. Experts tell us that there is a very good future for cotton production. They estimate that production will increase by up to 33 per cent in the next 10 years or so. Of course, water must be available at a reasonable price if this expansion is to take place. Unfortunately, the New South Wales Labor Government has indicated that it may have to increase water charges by up to 2,000 per cent. I ask honourable members to imagine what that would do. The New South Wales Government is not only talking about imposing its own State taxes but also setting about the irrigation industry in that State. That industry has done a lot for New South Wales, particularly the north-west area. </PARA>

I expect the average to be 300 per cent to 400 per cent. The water situation in that part of Australia is very critical. Growers around the Keepit Dam will be able to use only 10 per cent of their water allocation in the coming season. Growers around the Copeton Dam will be able to use only 15 per cent of their water allocation. Honourable members can see from those figures that there will not be too much cotton grown on some of those farms. I think that is a tragedy for those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Federal Government and the State governments should be spending more money on dam construction for irrigation purposes. We have now one of the worst droughts on the east coast of Australia in living memory. I think it is very important for us to be spending more money. Nothing in Australia beats water when it comes to production. There has been a downturn of up to 40 per cent in the Macintyre area of Queensland but there is continuing expansion there. We are hoping for another dam in the St George area. I believe the industry welcomes the legislation. I was talking today to one of the executives of Auscott, Ralph Schultz, and he told me that the industry is very happy with the legislation and is looking forward to paying the levy and to increasing production as research continues. </PARA>

That is, Commonwealth funds available to the States for welfare housing in 1982-83 aggregate to $312.2m plus whatever extra amounts the States choose to nominate from their Loan Council programs. </PARA>
<PARA>A further $20m was made available to the Northern Territory, so in total the amount made available by the Commonwealth to the States under the Commonwealth- State Housing Agreement this year was approximately $332m. Basically most of my remarks tonight will be confined to the housing aspect of this legislation, but I will relate that to the fall in loan funds from the Commonwealth to the States , particularly in the period from 1975-76 to the present day, and also to the fall in funds for capital works programs during that same period. In each case honourable members will find that the Commonwealth has been starving the States of both Loan Council funds and capital grants. I want to show the effect of this starving of funds on what we call public housing and what charitable members of the Government call welfare housing. We would prefer to look at it as public sector housing. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard three tables setting out Commonwealth net advances for housing in States and Territories for 1982-83 under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. If one examines the first table, it will be noted that in constant terms-in other words, in 1982-83 figures-the amount of money made available for public sector housing in 1974, the last full year of the Federal Labor Government, was $975m. This year the amount was $332m, but after the capital advances had been paid from the Commonwealth to the States the net amount was $290m. One can see that something like $685m less in real terms was made available this year than in 1974-75. If one goes still further and examines those amounts of money that have been stolen from the States by the Commonwealth , one can see that the accumulated amount of money is $3,740m. At present something like 100,000 families are waiting on the housing commission lists throughout the States of this country. Yet had that $3,740m been paid to the States, they would have been able to build another 75,000 dwellings. Therefore, they would have been able to overcome to a great degree the enormous shortage of public sector housing. Those figures seem bad enough, but the situation is that there has been a cut in the funds of about 70 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second table sets out the amounts of money made available and then shows the net amount that is involved after the capital repayment and the interest repayment. Frankly, even after all the repayments out of that $290m have been made, after the principal and interest have been repaid to the Commonwealth, only about $103m was made available. So this year the States are really sharing not $290m but approximately $103m. Table 3 sets out how the same amounts of money were made in 1974-75. It deals with each respective State. In 1974-75, after the principle and interest repayments were made, the net amount available to the States was $652m. As I said, this year it is $103m. So today the States are getting approximately one-sixth of what they received in the past. Let us examine the respective States. In 1974-75, when the Australian Labor Party was in office it made available to the then Lewis Government in New South Wales-a conservative government-$201m in this year's terms. That figure is now down to $ 32m. We provided Victoria with $159m and that figure is now down to $18m. That shows clearly the seriousness of the situation, how the Commonwealth has starved the States of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I have before me a table relating to the amounts of money that the Commonwealth provided to the States in the form of general purpose capital grants in the years 1974-75 to 1982-83, and a table showing the States' government Loan Council program from 1974-75 to 1982-83.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. In examining these tables it will be noted that between 1974-75 and 1982-83 there has been a cut of 43 per cent in real terms in the States' government Loan Council program. General purpose capital grants for the States have been cut by 45.6 per cent. One can see that through the years this Government has consistently transferred money away from the States, thereby starving them. The interesting aspect is that the Treasurer in his second reading speech, proposed that we divert money from the capital works programs to the public housing area. More and more pressure has been placed on the States. How difficult it is for them to transfer funds from the capital works area to the public housing area. We know that the States have been starved of funds. That is a serious and difficult problem. Frankly, I do not believe that we can solve the problem of housing in any single, isolated way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party has been discussing a broad and comprehensive package relating to housing policy. We have considered first of all the broad objectives. We have also had regard to housing policy co-ordination. For the first time in the history of this Government there is no department of housing. The Government has completely fragmented the Department of Housing and Construction. Part of the responsibility for housing now lies in another place with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). The other part of the Housing and Construction portfolio is now the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce ( Sir Phillip Lynch). The Labor Party is developing a clear and organised housing policy. We have also looked at the stabilisation of housing finance. We need not only to look at the supply of money but also to ensure that the money is made available to people who need houses at an affordable price. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also looking at programs for first home buyers. One of the great problems for first home buyers today lies in overcoming the deposit gap. I will give the House an example. In metropolitan Sydney over the last three quarters the median price paid by a first home buyer was $64,000. The maximum loan available to a person on average weekly earnings, a person earning something like $328 a week, is about $30,500. It is a matter of simple arithmetic to calculate that such a person would need a deposit of about $30,000 to overcome the deposit gap. Yet under this Government's housing program, even if a person has two or more children to bring up the maximum grant available to him to bridge the deposit gap is $3,500. So under this Government a person living in Sydney who is on average weekly earnings-after all, 70 per cent of wage earners earn less than average weekly earnings-can get a loan of $30,500 plus a grant of $3,500, totalling $34,000. That person has to find the other $30,000. The position for them is impossible. More and more people are placing their names on the housing commission lists. Increasingly, more public sector housing will be needed to fill the gap. But the whole policy of this Government has been to drain money from public sector housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party is also considering a further program to help existing home buyers. Under this Government rising interest rates have placed an enormous burden on people who are trying to pay off their homes. Since February 1980 interest rates have risen by 4 per cent. Since that time the repayments on a $30 ,000 loan over 25 years have risen by $88 a month. That, again, is a serious problem. Many people are finding it difficult to meet their monthly repayments. There has been no real program for renters. We have looked at such a program, which will be the subject of a public policy statement by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in the near future. One needs to compare the allocation for private renters and the across the board allocation for housing under this Government. Something like 38 per cent of people in this country own their own home. Another 33 per cent are paying off mortgages, and another 25 per cent are renting privately. The remainder-just over 4 per cent-are renting homes through the public sector. Something like $600m is paid in subsidies to the 30 per cent of people who are paying off their homes, yet the maximum this Government has made available to private housing renters is approximately $20m a year. The Labor Party will put forward a program to assist private renters, particularly those on lower incomes, those who are unemployed and those who are sick and really need some assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> An emergency housing program is badly needed in this country at present. Lastly , there is the question of a public sector housing program. Unless we attack the housing problem on a broad front we will not be able to solve the serious social problem of housing. Therefore I think the Australian people will find that our housing program when revealed-today it was authorised by the Caucus-is humane, progressive and compassionate. </PARA>
<PARA> I now raise another problem which I mentioned earlier-the seriousness of the rent market. I have here a table compiled by the Real Estate Institute of Australia and contained in its annual review of the residential property market for 1981-82 which shows the moving annual rental vacancies in our capital cities . It sets out the vacancies in 1980-81 as against 1981-82. I seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one examines the table one will find that in Sydney in 1980-81 the vacancy level was 2.5 per cent, and it fell to 1.9 per cent in 1981-82. In Melbourne it was 1.5 per cent and in 1981-82 it fell to 1.1 per cent. In Perth it was 4.8 per cent in 1980-81 and in 1981-82 it fell to 2.7 per cent. The Real Estate Institute of Australia argues that a vacancy rate of 3 per cent or 4 per cent is required to ensure a reasonable balance between supply and demand. With high demand and low supply weekly rentals have increased in most capital cities and are under pressure to rise further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indicative weekly median house rentals, as surveyed by the Real Estate Institute, in 1981-82 were as follows: Melbourne $100 to $110 per week; Brisbane $90 to $100 per week; Adelaide $70 to $80 per week; Perth $80 to $90 per week; and Sydney $130 to $140 per week. Welfare agencies report that many low income households are paying in excess of 50 per cent of their weekly income in rent. A growing number of people cannot afford to remain in rental housing. Many live under the threat of eviction. Countless thousands of people live in substandard accommodation-in caravans or in mobile or makeshift dwellings. Reports continually appear in every State of people-especially young unemployed people- being forced to sleep in unsafe and unhealthy locations-in parks, in toilet blocks, under bridges, in drainpipes, in cars and in condemned buildings. Emergency agencies report that the demand for crisis accommodation exceeds their capacity. They are having to turn away homeless people. Yet the Fraser Government has made no effort to work in co-operation with State and local governments and voluntary agencies even to identify the dimensions of the problem of inadequate housing, let alone to address the backlog of neglected needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation that confronts us is a tragedy. It does not matter whether we look at public sector housing where 100,000 families are on housing commission lists, at private rentals or at anyone wanting to buy a home. Above all, the industry is now in chaos. There is no stability in the building industry. There is no real encouragement or leadership because as I said earlier, the Government no longer has a department of housing. No single department is responsible for housing the Australian people. As I said earlier, we have to look at housing administration with a fine tooth comb. I cannot even identify the Minister responsible for housing. In fact if one wanted to ask a question about housing one would not know to whom to address it. </PARA>
<PARA> But the sad thing about this is that in this country, which should build 150, 000 to 160,000 dwellings a year, this year's commencements will be fewer than 118,000. That is approximately 40,000 fewer commencements than there should be. One could not accept that a government could blunder so badly. What is the situation? The situation is that even the Borrie National Population Inquiry which brought forward its report in late 1974 or early 1975 estimated that the population of this country would be approximately 17.5 million by the turn of the century. It was estimated that within that population those young people who reach an eligible age to form their own households would need at least 150,000 dwellings a year by the end of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last year the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs came into this House and tabled a report on the findings of an inquiry by his own Department. </PARA>
<PARA> In that report it is now estimated that instead of a population of 17.5 million by the turn of the century there will be a population of between 19.5 million and 20 million. Most of the increase in the estimate is due to an increase in immigration, although there will be a slight upturn in natural population growth . That immigration level will aggravate the housing situation. The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry as far back as three years ago thought we would need at least 160,000 dwellings. It is my advisors' belief that we will need at least 160,000 dwellings by the end of this decade and probably early into the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently a report of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry was tabled. That Council advises the Government on building industry matters. In that report it was revealed that the capacity estimate for 1982-83 would be 150, 000 yet the activity forecast was 118,000. Therefore, again to enlighten the House I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard figures taken from the 1982 report of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry setting out the capacity estimates for the industry and the activity forecast for the industry in 1982-83. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That means that there will be a 38 per cent drop. The honourable member said that the figure is too high. I have already told him that people need homes . This is the Indicative Planning Council's own figure and it is the adviser of the Government. The capacity estimate for building commencements in New South Wales is 52,000. It looks as though there will be 34,000 building commencements which is 33 per cent below the capacity existing in that State. One could go through each State and set out the under-utilisation of building capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we really need in Australia is job creation. We have people out of work. Next to unemployment, housing is the most serious social problem in this country . In order to create more jobs we really should be building housing. For every $ 100m invested in housing, another 5,000 job opportunities are created. The Australian Labor Party believes that there are two things that can be done to alleviate the problems in the housing industry. If we stimulate the housing industry, firstly, we create homes for people and this lessens the social evil of people being without shelter. As I said earlier, many people in Australia are living in deplorable conditions at present. Secondly, we create employment. There is nothing more labour intensive than the building industry. It would be the commitment of a Federal Labor government, in its first year of office, to create up to 135,000 building commencements. If we look back over the last three years of this Government, we see that this year there will be 118,000 building commencements. Last year there were 126,000. The year before that, there were 149,000. We can probably increase the figure to 135,000 commencements in the first year, 145,000 in the second year and 160,000 in the third year. We would hope to maintain that level throughout the rest of the decade. Unless we do this we will not be able to overcome the housing problems. We will not be able to catch up with not only the present backlog but also future requirements. I will leave my comments at that. I am deeply concerned with the policies of this Government. It lacks the will and the spirit which are needed to produce a comprehensive housing policy. Certainly the direction of the whole of the housing policy is leaderless because there is not even a department of housing. There is no one who is really responsible for the housing in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment briefly on one or two of the points made by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren). I was impressed by his reference to the multiplier factor that is associated with the building industry and its potential to create jobs. It has been estimated that something like five jobs can be created outside the building sector as such for every job that exists within it. I am not sure that that is absolutely correct. But there certainly is a multiplier effect and it can be impressive. The honourable member for Reid instanced the predictions of the Indicative Planning Council, its idea of what could be the level of building commencements in Western Australia and the capacity of either the market or the building industry. He mentioned a figure of 20,000 commencements. Nothing like that figure has ever been achieved in that State. To some extent-I think it is true of many of the Indicative Planning Council's findings-that sort of assessment is pie in the sky.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Howard) indicated the purpose of this legislation in his second reading speech. In short, it is to authorise and to enable payment of general purpose capital grants to the States totalling $457.6m. The States and the Northern Territory may nominate those proportions of Loan Council borrowings to supplement their welfare housing programs. Those funds will be available at concessional rates and conditions. The measure is significant amongst a whole range of measures which are designed to ensure that the States are able to oversee the works and housing programs appropriate to their needs. While expressly encouraging a maximum effort around Australia in the provision of welfare housing, the States and the Northern Territory retain the choice as to what proportion of loan funds may be employed for that purpose. The incentive is there for the States and the Northern Territory. They have the option of securing concessional loan funds for welfare housing as part of their share of total Loan Council borrowings. These concessional items include an interest rate of 4.5 per cent per annum. The States and the Northern Territory are required to repay these borrowings over 53 years. By increasing the housing component of general purpose grants by 27 per cent to $333m, in addition to the borrowing rights I have just mentioned, the Commonwealth has clearly demonstrated its commitment to housing those who are less well off in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will enable twofold assistance: Firstly, assistance to those who want to purchase a house and who are not able to qualify for loan finance from conventional sources; and, secondly, to those who cannot afford rental accommodation available in the private market and who must rely on shelter provided out of taxpayers' funds. In particular, the States and the Northern Territory will be greatly assisted in meeting the cost of providing rental rebates to eligible, low income families. This type of assistance, targeted as it is to individuals, is high on this Government's list of priorities. This Government, in its welfare housing policies, is encouraging what the experts have been saying for years and what common sense should have made obvious, that is, that housing assistance for low income groups should be targeted on the individual and not the dwelling. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditional welfare housing programs have concentrated on building dwellings and then letting them at low rates to low income tenants. I suggest that this procedure has two fundamental flaws which work to the disadvantage of the very people whom it is designed to help. Firstly, the tenant is trapped in the subsidised dwelling. If he moves he will probably have to pay much more rent. This factor can greatly increase the difficulty of finding a job by increasing the cost of moving home. It is an impediment to a mobile work force which, I suggest, is sorely needed in this country. The other flaw is that tenants' incomes have usually been assessed only when they take up residence. If their incomes happen to rise, they can usually stay in the subsidised accommodation which, in effect, forces others in genuine need into private sector accommodation which is being let at market rentals. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that all honourable members have heard the story of the council house in England with a Mercedes car parked outside. Only the one Mercedes is parked outside because the council tenant has gone out in the other Mercedes to collect the rent on the terrace houses that he owns and rents to others. No doubt similar things could happen in State housing commission estates in Australia. Ideally, perhaps, there could be a requirement that tenants whose incomes have risen either purchase or vacate their units. Of course, in practice it is very hard to say to a chap who has just found a job after a year on the unemployment benefit: 'Congratulations, mate. Here is your eviction notice.' Such an approach is out of the question, but therein lies one of the real problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing authorities that have encouraged their tenants to purchase their dwelling have, as a consequence, often found that they cannot afford to build replacements because the repayments take time to come in and the cash that would be available immediately if it were a cash sale is not forthcoming to plough back into the building of new houses for those less well off. For these and other reasons traditional welfare housing programs have not totally succeeded in their principal task of housing the poor. In the early 1970s only about one in seven of the State housing commission rental units was let to tenants whose income was below the then poverty level. Of the people below the poverty line in rental accommodation, less than one-third were in State housing commission units . Just over one unit in four was occupied by low income tenants whose income was less than 20 per cent above the poverty line. This represented just over a quarter of all such people living in rented accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason to believe that these proportions have changed significantly in recent years. The failure of traditional welfare housing policies adopted by the States can be summed up in two figures. At the time of the investigations of the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty there were enough State housing commission rental dwellings to accommodate something like 90 per cent of all low income people then living in rented accommodation. There were enough but, in fact, only 26 per cent of them were living in State housing commission units. I supose the one good thing that can be said for having a wide range of income levels among State housing commission tenants is that there should be less chance of getting slums. There should be less chance of the poor being treated like second class citizens living on the outskirts of cities and urban areas. However, I do not think it has worked out that way in practice. There is not a single large city in Australia that does not have large, dismal, public housing estates filled with low income families, single mothers, invalid pensioners and so on who live there because they simply cannot afford to go anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if having a larger proportion of the non-poor State housing commission tenants actually prevents slums, as I have suggested it might have in some cases , it would be an inefficient way to go about it. It would be tantamount to subsidising three people to improve the quality of life of one poor person. I earnestly suggest to the State governments that it surely would be better just to give the money to the poor in the first place. That is what has been recommended by any number of academic papers and government reports presented here and overseas, including the reports on housing and poverty commissioned by the last Labor Government. In my opinion welfare functions should be separated from the property development and building functions of State housing authorities. Public housing should be made available at market rents and with no income test for tenants. Rental subsidies or income supplements could then be available to people on low incomes who rent their accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA> In this area the Government is giving a lead by creating the circumstances which enable those in the States with prime responsibility to take the necessary initiatives. All this will give low income earners greater freedom to decide where and how they live. It will reduce the tendency for public housing authorities to spend the minimum on development and building and, as a consequence, to impose costs on their tenants in the form of poor access to services and jobs. Other advantages of subsidising the individual and not the dwelling are that the cost of the subsidies is less readily concealed so that the State government authorities are more easily kept accountable to their respective parliaments. The advances made in the 1978 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and strengthened in the 1981 Agreement provide the incentive for the States to move towards the kind of flexible and equitable system I have outlined . </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's total housing budget this year is almost $571m, an increase- despite what the honourable member for Reid had to say-of nearly 12 per cent in real terms. Of this amount nearly $333m-a 15 per cent real increase-is to go directly to the States and the Northern Territory for welfare housing. The States have the opportunity. It is up to them to take advantage of it. The States have a chance to be both generous and innovative in their approaches to the provision of welfare housing. They may, if they wish, explore the possibility of leasing accommodation from the private sector. They may want to think about joint ventures with the private sector or they may want to go into interest subsidy schemes. It may be that innovation can and should be married with the States' more traditionl welfare housing initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when the private rental market is tight and housing costs are high in some areas, when the numbers of single parent families and aging people are growing and when there are signs of a slow-down in the turnover of rental stocks , the Commonwealth is showing commendable concern. Of course, it should not be forgotten that, in addition to taxpayers' funds which are to be distributed by the Commonwealth for these purposes, the States and the Northern Territory have access to housing authority internal funds as well as to home purchase assistance funds. Thereby the States may augment these funds with money they collect which is part of their normal revenue raisings. All-up funding of welfare housing in 1981-82 was $761.7m. That may be expected-with confidence, I suggest-to grow over the current financial year, particularly if the States and the Northern Territory follow the lead of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> It may now be useful to identify the breakup of general purpose grants specifically tied to expenditure by the States on welfare housing. I start with New South Wales, which recieves $104.1m; Victoria is next with $75m; Queensland, $40.7m; South Australia, $42m; Western Australia, $33.4m; Tasmania, $17.4m; and the Northern Territory, $20.2m. That is a grand total of $332.9m. I will conclude by summarising. Under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement direct Commonwealth funding to the States for welfare housing now forms part of the Loan Council works and housing program and is paid to the States and the Northern Territory accordingly. The current Agreement is to operate for five years to 30 June 1986. The major features of it are, firstly, the direction of assistance to persons most in need and, secondly, that rents charged to public tenants are to move to market levels by 1985 with rental rebates for those in need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill. The Bill makes a number of amendments and its major function is to establish clearly Commonwealth rights in respect of minerals over lands which were re-acquired by the Commonwealth after the declaration of independence of the Northern Territory. A number of other clauses in the Bill deal with a diverse number of matters, such as the length of time prior to a general election at which a vacancy in the Legislative Assembly must be filled and the need to indemnify the Treasurer on guarantees for loans on which the Treasurer gives a guarantee. The Opposition is not altogether sure why there is a need to remove that particular sub-section. It is a discretionary sub -section and it allows, in its present form, the Commonwealth Treasurer to ask for indemnity in exchange for a guarantee, should the Treasurer require that. Another amendment will, in fact, move some of the sections of the Act more towards self-government provisions. The Bill will increase the number of people who can have dormant warrants but, basically, it has been introduced in this House in order to protect Commonwealth rights over Commonwealth lands in the Territory against the issue of mining leases or the use of that land for that type of purpose. It is a provision which may well be necessary in other forms of legislation in respect of Commonwealth land, but this provides what we see as adequate protection for the land in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would only briefly say that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) in his second reading speech made very strong reference to the success of self-government in the Northern Territory. I suggest that the Minister-he has now left the chamber-might convey to his colleague the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) that the transfer of significant powers to the Legislative Assembly in this area would be welcomed. The purpose of this Parliament is surely not to administer the municipal and local affairs of the people of Canberra as opposed to the affairs of the national capital. They are quite different. This Parliament is not equipped, and certainly does not devote nor have the time, to give consideration to those purposes. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. We will be raising other matters at various times unless the Government does make some--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not surprised at the comments of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) with regard to self-government for the Australian Capital Territory. If one can measure the success of self- government in the Northern Territory after four years it is successful, it is working well, and I am staggered and surprised that the Australian Capital Territory has not moved down the same line as the Northern Territory much sooner . Self-government has been accepted by the Northern Territory community. It is respected by Australians and certainly by people overseas. In a number of cases it has been accepted by many people who were formerly cynical. The Northern Territory Government is making an impact in the region geographically closer to Asia. The Northern Territory Government has taken a lot of initiatives, particularly in trade and cultural links with South-East Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would highlight those links, particularly with Sabah, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia. These moves have enhanced the understanding of Australia as a whole. The practical indication to our neighbours that we are interested in the region, of course, benefits the Northern Territory and Australia as a whole as new markets are tapped and suppliers are found. The history of Northern Territory self-government came to a crucial point on 1 July 1978. The financial agreement in the Memorandum of Understanding was an excellent agreement. It set out arrangements similar to those involving the States with tax sharing entitlements and initially special assistance grants. The Northern Territory also receives general and specific purpose capital assistance grants similar to those that apply in relation to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to stress that self-government was not thrust on the Northern Territory. It took place only after very careful consultation and a sound financial agreement had been negotiated. I was a party to many of those discussions from the other place-the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly-and I know that they were taken in positive and sensitive steps. There are still a few more functions to be transferred. I will highlight them a bit later, particularly when I talk about national parks and the function relating to uranium. In July 1978 responsibility for urban and rural land, roads, transport, mining, petroleum, conservation, planning and development co-ordination were all transferred. Subsequently the functions of health, education and the courts were also transferred. If we look at the role the governments must take in an economy , the public expenditure certainly dominates the Northern Territory economy. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate this, let me highlight that this Government did make available to the Northern Territory Government $731m from this year's Budget. That figure is certainly in excess of the four major sectors of the economy, namely mining, pastoral, tourism and fishing. This will change as the economy diversifies and more uranium mines open, but for the present the economy is locked into government funding and it underlines the importance of maintaining the level of funding. It is necessary for the development of the economy to provide stability and confidence for planning, to encourage investment and growth of industry. So far I can only speak positively about the role of the Everingham Government and the remarkable results that have been achieved in this area. It is no accident that the Northern Territory economy has grown since self-government. The growth is a direct result of government policies which certainly would not be there without self-government. </PARA>
<PARA> By handling our own finances in the Territory our prospects have improved remarkably. The Northern Territory has performed solidly over the last four years. It is worth noting that its population has grown by 4.5 per cent, which is over three times the national average. We have committed and planned investment projects of $4,500m. Mining turnover rose from $124m in 1977-78 to $ 300m in 1980-81. Job creation defies the national trends. As I said before, there are four important sectors in the economy. It is worth mentioning the most recent statistics on those sectors. Mining is worth $466m; tourism is worth $ 120m; the pastoral industry is worth $80m; and the fishing industry is worth $ 20m. Whilst the manufacturing industry employs only 5 per cent of the work force these sectors are, of course, vulnerable to world conditions. Any slump in world prices on the commodity market has a marked effect on the Northern Territory's economy. We are no longer getting prices for our minerals at previous levels and the world recession is making an impact. Prices have fallen for traditional mineral exports such as bauxite and alumina, manganese, gold and copper. Primary industry is the traditional base of the economy with two-thirds of that sector coming from the cattle industry. In 1980-81 the turnover was $68m. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, tourism has recently emerged as an industry. It is now worth $120m annually. Last year 350,000 visitors were attracted to the Northern Territory, an increase of 50 per cent over the number of visitors at the time of self-government. Of course, this number will continue to grow. Confidence has been instilled in the new Yulara village, which is now under way. It is worth contractually about $110m. It will be completed in 1984 with accommodation for 6 ,000 people. However, the recession has also hit the tourist industry and the growth of the industry has been revised downwards by 6 per cent this year. The strength of our economy is shown by the job creation rate, which is the highest in the nation. In percentage terms it is more than 28 times the national average . The number in the Territory work force went up from 53,700 to 58,300 over 12 months to April 1982, an increase of 8.56 per cent. This compares with the national increase of only 0.3 per cent. Recent Bureau of Statistics figures show that our work force now stands at 61,100. That is a new high figure for the Northern Territory with extra jobs being created largely in private enterprise. Of course, we also have the lowest unemployment rate. </PARA>
<PARA> I will talk for a few minutes about the 1982 Northern Territory Budget. It is the fifth Budget since self-government. This year spending will exceed $1,000m for the first time. Local revenue will be $127m, a rise of 5 1/2 per cent on last year. The Territory Budget maintains vigorous development through capital works and help for the private sector. Capital works will total $204m. They include many new schools, the upgrading of highways, money for the performing arts centre and $11m for essential services in Aboriginal communities. To meet housing problems the Housing Commission in the Territory gets $118m, a rise of 12 per cent which will enable work to commence on 894 new dwellings. Industry is given priority by the Territory Government. This will be reflected in loans to industry totalling more than $8m. However, the Territory Treasury is always faced with two major problems when it frames the Northern Territory Budget. The first is the high cost of providing government services to isolated areas because of distances and dispersed population especially in the areas of police services, education, health, transport and community welfare. Secondly, Aborigines represent 20 per cent of the population. A substantial proportion are underprivileged and the Budgets must meet their needs as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House basically tidies up the Northern Territory ( Self-Government) Act. It, like all legislation, needs to be altered slightly from time to time because of deficiencies or problems that arise. The amendments in this Bill were subject to discussion by the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth and are to be implemented now after agreement from both parties. Clause 11 is the most contentious clause in the Bill. It confirms that minerals in any land acquired by the Commonwealth are vested in the Commonwealth. It protects the Commonwealth's interests where mining and exploration would not be desirable, such as in defence facilities and airports. Other amendments refer to procedures in the Territory's legislative process and confer flexibility on the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. In respect of money votes it is proposed that the Administrator's message need recommend only the purpose of the appropriation rather than the law itself. It is also proposed that a casual vacancy in the Legislative Assembly should be filled only if it occurs more than six months before the last date for a general election. That is a sensible amendment. It does not force the whole Assembly to the polls and it avoids many unnecessary by-elections. The Bill also allows for the appointment of more than one acting Administrator. The amendments will improve the workings of the Act and they have, of course, the agreement of the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Any proper consideration of self-government needs reference to the constitutional aspirations of the Northern Territory. Constitutional development is an ongoing project. There is still considerable discussion in the Territory about statehood. I feel that the expectation is that statehood is inevitable and is just a matter of timing. However, a number of outstanding matters need to be resolved. There are a number of obligations on the Commonwealth to be fulfilled before statehood is granted, in particular the need to provide surface transport links with the Territory, to hasten the completion of the railway and to upgrade roads, especially the approach roads in other States. The recently announced Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program will go a long way to achieving this. We need decent airports. The Darwin and Alice Springs terminals are totally inadequate. It often takes three hours for Customs clearances when arriving on an overseas flight. Congestion at Alice Springs airport is there daily for anyone to see. The need to develop port authorities to attract exporters certainly needs to be addressed. Thankfully, we have a good industrial relations record in the Northern Territory which complements these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I make relates to land rights, which must be carefully examined. We must admit that there are problems with the land rights legislation and we must admit to friction in the community. Anyone who refuses to face up to this is foolish. He only exacerbates the problem and makes it more difficult to resolve. Land rights were foisted on the Territory before self-government. The Commonwealth has a lot to answer for in this regard. It foisted major land reform in regard to Aboriginals at a time when it did not deal consistently with land reform and administration in other areas of the Northern Territory. It did not take the whole planned development of the Territory into account. I admit that a lot of the friction has been resolved and I acknowledge the efforts of the Northern Territory Government in bringing blacks and whites together at a time when vested interests seek to divide the community. It is in this area that I think we must give more control over Aboriginal affairs to the Northern Territory Government to reduce tension. The Northern Territory Government is better placed to deal with Aborigines than are officers 3,000 kilometres away. </PARA>
<PARA> Two other matters which I addressed earlier and which I would like to see resolved early are the control of national parks and uranium mining. I have spoken in this place before on these issues. I feel it is time we lessened the role of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service in the Northern Territory. The Territory has demonstrated through the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory that it has the expertise to handle these functions. The Review of Commonwealth Functions recommended that the responsibility of regulation of nuclear activities should be implemented by the States and the Territory as far as possible. The Northern Territory is not yet on an equal footing with the States with regard to the non-marine parks. Although the Review of Commonwealth Functions recommended that the control should be left to the Northern Territory Administration, with the Commonwealth retaining only essential interests in relation to Kakadu, current arrangements are out of date, inadequate and paternalistic and they certainly need to be addressed. If the Commonwealth is serious about self-government in the Northern Territory it should transfer these State-like powers forthwith and complete the whole package of making the Northern Territory truly self-governing. I reiterate my opening remarks and those of the honourable member for Corio. It would pay the Australian Capital Territory well to look at the model that is being provided by the Northern Territory. It has certainly been a success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to raise a matter concerning the Department of Defence's apparent lack of concern to save the Government's and taxpayers' money. I am referring to a cost saving scheme proposed by a constituent of mine in 1978, four years ago, which would result in savings of approximately $3m per year. The suggestion was based on introducing an optional altenative to Service personnel, allowing them to hire enough furniture to occupy their Service married quarters or civilian rented premises, rather than remain in motel accommodation for extended periods. By so doing, the following advantages for both the Service and the member would be realised: Costs for motels would be reduced-members and their families currently reside in motels for up to six weeks, and sometimes longer; meal allowance would be reduced-a reduction of around $20 per day per adult and $10 per day per child under 10 years; reimbursement of rental paid in advance for civilian houses would be reduced-full rental costs are reimbursed up to the time a member occupies his house; loss of rent on Service married quarters would be reduced-members do not pay rent for married quarters until occupation; the risk of damage by vandals to civilian and married quarters left empty would be reduced and therefore costs of repairs would be reduced; school children of members would be able to commence at their new school earlier thus reducing educational turbulance; and the difficulties associated with having to remain in cramped motel rooms for extended periods would be reduced. On 17 August 1979 the Department of Defence wrote accepting the suggestion. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The evaluating staff has acknowledged the worth of the suggestion to the service and members in terms of reduced TAA expenditure and lost rent on vacant married quarters and a less disruptive transitional period for members and their families on transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the above advantages an award of $250.00 has been approved.</PARA>
<PARA>A further letter of 27 August from the Navy stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The original submission by . . . has been accepted and I understand will be adopted on a tri-service basis, resulting in a significant saving to the Government. Considering the potential saving, the taxable award of $250.00 is insufficient to act as an incentive to RAN personnel who intend submitting cost- saving suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA>The award was subsequently upgraded to a class A award. A letter from the Department of Defence Navy Office dated 16 January 1980 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is agreed that the savings resulting from implementation of . . . suggestion may be measurable in monetary terms, and accordingly the suggestion could qualify for consideration of a class A award. However, as some uncertainties exist as to accuracy of the savings calculated by . . . it will not be possible to proceed in this manner until a period of at least 3 years has elapsed during which time the savings of the scheme can be accurately calculated. Calculations will be made in Navy Office when the scheme is adopted and implemented. </PARA>
<PARA>Over three years have now elapsed since advice of intended implementation was received. Had the Department of Defence implemented the suggestion in a timely fashion, millions of dollars savings might already have been achieved. It is hard to understand the delay-four years to date-in implementation of this scheme . Four years of savings at $3m a year is obviously a substantial amount. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also hard to understand why the Government is constantly talking about the need for cutbacks in standards of living for all Australians while at the same time it is spending millions more than is necessary by neglecting to implement more efficient administrative schemes such as this one. The merit of this proposal has been recognised by the Department of Defence. Its merit is not confined only to the three Services. In a wider sense the project is to be commended because it saves all taxpayers' money. I hope that the proposal will now be implemented on a final basis. </PARA>

I bring to the attention of the House the fact that yesterday I wrote two letters to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) seeking some information from him. In the first letter I said to the Treasurer:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 19 August in the Grievance Debate I raised a matter with regard to what I believed was a fraudulent attempt to obtain an investment allowance in regard to what I believe was a second-hand aircraft. </PARA>

<PARA> Would you please inform me of what action has been initiated in regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>To this time I have not had a reply. I am rather concerned to think that a month has gone by and nothing has taken place.

<PARA> I took the opportunity also to write another letter to the Treasurer to bring to his attention another matter of a similar nature. This also deals with an aircraft. It deals with a gentleman who was involved with the first case to which I referred-Mr Edward Sent. I wrote to the Treasurer in these words:</PARA>
<PARA> A matter has been brought to my attention which I would request you to investigate. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that sectors of the aviation industry are being used to transfer funds out of Australia in an illegal manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Could your Department investigate the following case. </PARA>
<PARA> An aircraft, a Mitsubishi Marquise 1518, was delivered to France as a demonstration aircraft in May or June 1981. The distributor was Air Affairs International (Paris). The aircraft was held by Mitsubishi Aircraft International, St Angelo, Houston, Texas, U.S.A. Due to economic conditions the aircraft was not sold in France. It was subsequently imported into Australia by a Mr Edward Sent, in June 1982, using the company name Parlingham Pty Ltd, of 1384 Dandenong Road, Oakleigh. </PARA>
<PARA> The alleged amount of funds transferred by the Reserve Bank to purchase the aircraft was $1.4 million. The price paid for the aircraft was $950,000. This payment was made through a Paris Bank, Veure Morin-Pons, D'Etoile, Paris. </PARA>

<PARA>The aircraft has been presented as new for the purposes of tax allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> Would you have your Department check out this matter both the transfer of funds to Paris and also the alleged claim for tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>The thing that really concerns me is the time lag that this Government seems to have when things are brought to its notice even through the Parliament. A month, I believe, is far too long to wait for anybody who brings a serious matter to the attention of the Government. It is too long to wait after a document has been tabled in this Parliament which clearly indicates that a fraud has been attempted. Still there is no action. Where are the officers of this Government, the officers of this country, who are expected to do their job?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. Where is their commitment to investigate these matters? One gentleman who was involved-he was an executive director of a former Minister of this Government-had three weeks in which to go to his company premises. He drove up on Sunday morning with his key, his Mercedes Benz and his horse float, and wheeled the filing cabinets directly into the horse float. He had permission, according to sources, to remove his personal files. I believe that much more than personal files were removed when those cabinets were taken. I believe that a lot of trouble will be experienced in tracking down the fraud when someone gets around to trying to do that. I hope that the Treasurer will take some action. I did not believe that I should have to write to him to ask about this. I hope I will hear soon that something will be done about this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I bring to the attention of the House the plight of a constituent of mine who in 1976 sponsored as permanent residents the aged parents of his Dutch born wife. As part of the procedure, he completed maintenance guarantees for his in-laws to provide food and lodging for them. They arrived in Australia in 1977. In October 1978, as the result of some disagreement in the family, the in-laws moved out of the home and in fact moved from New South Wales to Brisbane. They then had as their only source of income the Dutch pension. Early in 1980, as a result of action by the Dutch Government, their Dutch pension was cut to 25 per cent of its previous level. The in-laws, unable to carry on with that kind of income, in April of 1980 applied for and received the Department of Social Security special benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In October 1981, my constituent received a letter from the Department of Social Security which stated in part:</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with departmental procedure a review of your financial situation was undertaken and it is considered by the Director-General that you are in a position to honour the maintenance guarantee. In these circumstances it is necessary for you to refund to the Department an amount equal to the total Special Benefit paid . . . $5853.82. </PARA>
<PARA>That was as of October 1981. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime the debt will continue to accrue until you make alternative arrangements for their maintenance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The letter suggested that, if my constituent disagreed with this decision by the Department, he should appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. My constituent made an appeal and received from the Social Security Appeals Tribunal a letter dated 15 January 1982. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The decision that you are required to refund this money to the Commonwealth was made under the Migration Regulations, not the Social Services Act, and as such does not come under the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Five days later, he received a second letter which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal has recommended that the departmental decision be confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA>Further the Social Security Appeals Tribunal invited my constituent, if he wished, to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. My constituent followed that advice and on 27 January this year he appealed to the AAT. On 24 March, he heard from the AAT which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to review decisions made under the migrant regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>My constituent is in a situation where he has had no decision from one avenue of appeal. The AAT said that the matter did not come under its jurisdiction. He has had half a decision from another avenue of appeal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, in which first of all it said that it had no jurisdiction. But five days later it said that it had but there was no explanation in between. At the same time, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal offered him an invitation which led him up a false avenue of appeal to the AAT which said that it could not hear the appeal either. In the meantime, the debt apparently is continuing to accrue. My constituent is in no position to pay. He remains happy to look after his in- laws under the original conditions, that is, that they live in the family home. He is prepared to provide a roof over their heads and food. He is certainly in no position to support them in any other situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that last week he had a further and, I believe, final demand from the Department of Social Security for payment. He is faced with a debt that he cannot meet. He has certainly had poor treatment from his in-laws. He has certainly had poor treatment from two appeals tribunals and poor treatment from the Minister. On 26 January this year, I wrote to the former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. All I got back was an acknowledgement dated 11 February. I repeat that my constituent is ready to meet his obligations under the original maintenance guarantee but he is certainly in no position to meet the growing debt which is certainly one that he is unable to control. In the meantime, the debt continues to mount. He has had no assistance at all from the bureaucracy. This is a situation that really needs attention from a whole range of people including two appeals tribunals and two Ministers. At the very least, he is entitled to an answer and an answer is what he has not had. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter which concerns what I think is an excessive degree of tardiness by the Commonwealth in meeting its obligations as a result of a damages claim against one of my constituents. The gentleman concerned, whom I will not name in the House but who is known to the Attorney- General (Senator Durack), was injured in an accident with an aircraft at the Government Aircraft Factories in Avalon in 1974. He was hit by an aircraft propeller. After a series of cases for damages, he received a settlement on 10 August this year. The settlement was of a very large order. It was well in excess of the amount which the solicitors were prepared to settle for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the enormous amounts of costs accruing against the gentleman, the solicitors had in fact sought to discuss settlement with the Crown Solicitor, prior to the case going to the Supreme Court. It was pointed out that there would be at least $40,000 in costs. The Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Melbourne made what I suggest was a ludicrous offer of $8,000. The ultimate award was more in the order of $250,000, which seemed to me to show some degree of incompetence in assessment by that office. Since the award was made, the solicitors have had no satisfaction from the Commonwealth in obtaining any guarantees that payment will in fact be made at all. The solicitors are in the position where they cannot deal with the Commonwealth as they would with any other defaulter in respect of payment. The matter is currently in excess of a month old. It is very unlikely that the Commonwealth intends to appeal. My understanding is that the delays are being caused, firstly, because the Commonwealth does not have the money allocated to that Department to meet the claim at this stage and, secondly-and more importantly-because the Crown Solicitor's Office in Canberra is assessing the actions of the Melbourne office to find out why it ultimately arrived at that position. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, the person concerned who has been fighting the case for eight years-in fact it has not been as long as that because there were certain delays in the initial action-is without the funds and without any guarantees that those funds will be received. I believe that it is incumbent on the Commonwealth, as it is on any other employer or organisation as a result of the finding of a court against them, to meet as rapidly as possible the obligations involved. The gentleman concerned, as one would imagine, does have very severe disabilities. Being hit with an aeroplane propeller is not usually one of those things that results just in a headache. It is a serious matter. I ask that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Wilson), who is at the table, convey to the Attorney- General the fact that I am concerned at his failure to respond to my representations on this matter and also to give any guarantees as to when settlement can be expected. I believe that after those delays there should be a rapid finalisation of settlement; or, if the Commonwealth intends to go on to appeal, it should notify the solicitors of my constituent that that is its intention. I hope that that is not the case. The case has already been through three courts. </PARA>
<PARA> In the minute that I have left, I raise one other matter which I hope the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) will convey to the Minister for Defence ( Mr Sinclair). Yesterday I spoke to certain wives of personnel in the Army in Brisbane who are concerned at the results of the hearings and the determinations which took place in respect of pay and conditions earlier this year. The specific case concerns heavy truck drivers who were notified as a result of the 1978 reassessments that they could be downgraded from level 6 to level 5 in the gradings of Service pay. In fact, when the decisions were brought down, they were allocated and paid back pay on that basis. A month later, they were notified that the downgradings had in fact taken place. They were downgraded from level 6 to level 4 and had to pay back a significant proportion of their allocation. </PARA>
<PARA> The drivers concerned are skilled drivers of heavy Army equipment and would normally command a higher rate of pay than basic truck drivers. They consider that they are being treated unfairly. I do not intend to judge whether they are or not. But I believe it is necessary for them to have the opportunity to have their case tested by some form of appeal at which they are able to present argument on their own behalf. At the moment that does not exist. I ask that the Minister refer the matter back to the relevant tribunal and examine the means by which such matters can be satisfied. The Miniser will remember the problems of the survey unit at Bendigo and of others. I do not believe these things should occupy Ministers. At the moment there is no other means. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to those honourable members who have spoken this evening in the adjournment debate. I assure my friend the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) that I will draw to the attention of the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) the matter he raised regarding some members of the Regular Army. I will also draw the first matter to which my friend adverted to the attention of the relevant Minister. If he would give me a name, of course I would respect his confidentiality. I am sure he would appreciate that the Commonwealth, like any other party in litigation, is entitled to observe the time available for appeal. I share his sense of concern that the settlement of litigation is a matter of anxiety to those involved. Of course, the Commonwealth is in very real sense impersonal to the plaintiff in an action. I do appreciate what he has had to say , and if he lets me have a name I will see that the matter is considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) may rest assured that I will draw the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to the matter he raised. I hope in his charity he will appreciate that the Treasurer has been abroad at meetings of the International Monetary Fund for some two weeks. It is not some frolic at the Gold Coast; it is a very serious matter on behalf of this country. Beyond that, since his return he has had what I may euphemistically describe as one or two diversions or distractions. Nevertheless, the honourable gentleman raised a very important matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not catch all the facts as the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Free) presented them, but again if the honourable gentleman tomorrow morning would give me the name of the person concerned I will see that the relevant Minister is apprised of the allegations. </PARA>
