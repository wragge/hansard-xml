<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Treasurer. It refers to Government claims that ministerial power to dismiss members of various statutory boards for impropriety applies only to impropriety committed as a board member. I ask the Treasurer: Does section 19 (2) (e) of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act give him power to terminate an appointment 'on the ground that it is not in the best interests of the Corporation that the Director continue in office'? Did the Prime Minister say on 2 June that the dismissal of tax evaders from government positions was a matter for the relevant Minister? Finally, given that he has both the statutory power and prime ministerial sanction, why has he failed to sack Denis Horgan?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition is quite correct in quoting the relevant section from the AIDC Act. I think he misrepresents, in a significant way, what the Prime Minister said in June. My recollection was that the Prime Minister, when asked a question about the role in government bodies of individuals who had been named in the McCabe-Lafranchi report, said that that was a matter that ought to be taken up with the relevant Minister. I think the Leader of the Opposition has given it an interpretation. Having been asked this question, I repeat what I said in the House the other day and what other Ministers have said in this place, that the mere naming of people in reports is not, of itself, a reason why somebody should be removed from a particular body.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Construction. Whilst I recognise the benefits to our road improvement programs that the Minister's Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program will have, I believe that the best roads in the world will not stop the carnage caused by the drink-driver. Can the Minister tell me whether any portion of the funds from the ABRD Program will be spent on specific road safety measures, particularly those in an effort to reduce the personal tragedy and suffering caused by drink- drivers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The funds that will be made available for road construction over a six- year period through the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program will go some of the way towards making the road system in Australia safer than it is at present. The Government will be looking to projects that improve the alignment of roads, that provide better sign posting, better services on roads and better road marking, and that provide dual carriageways on the more heavily used roads and passing lanes on many of the arterial and national roads. I will be looking very closely, when approving projects over the six-year period, at the inclusion of projects that are designed to try to overcome some of the road surface deficiencies and road infrastructure facilities that undoubtedly have contributed in the past to road deaths.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true to say that one of the worst problems facing road safety in Australia is drink driving. Over 50 per cent of deaths and 30 per cent of injuries on the roads can be attributed to drink driving. The Prime Minister announced a few days ago that the Commonwealth will be making half a million dollars of Commonwealth funds available in the hope that State governments will match that amount on a dollar for dollar basis. The Government will seek also a contribution from the private sector towards a road safety publicity program with special reference to the question of drink driving.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope the States will give a favourable response to the offer that the Prime Minister has made. I have no doubt that the program, developed by the Commonwealth and involving Paul Cronin, has gone a long way towards proving that a well-prepared and well-constructed education program can do a lot to create an awareness of this problem. Undoubtedly, the pilot test that took place in Tasmania has proved beyond doubt that the Paul Cronin program on drink driving was a great success. I hope that the States and sections of the private sector will contribute towards this program that should help to reduce the carnage on Australian roads.</PARA>

A judgment was delivered as far back as 14 June 1979. I refer to the fact that in His Honor's judgment he said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Those documents were collected by officers of the Australian Taxation Office. They related to corporations engaged in tax evasion. Is it a fact that no investigations were undertaken into these companies and the promoters of tax evasion schemes, even after the Australian Taxation Office had come into possession of the documents? This occurred three years prior to the publication of the McCabe-Lafranchi report. Is it also a fact that no investigations have been carried out with respect to these companies and promoters since the publication of the McCabe-Lafranchi report?</PARA>

Does the Minister intend to take any steps to limit this comprehensive restriction?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was aware that there was such a proposal by the Victorian Government. I was not aware, however, that the legislation to which the honourable member refers was passed. It would appear that that in fact was the case. The Commonwealth has made its position clear and I reiterate it very briefly. We believe there should be the absolute and most extensive freedom in the dissemination of legal matters which are of importance to the profession by way of statutes and law reports. That has been the attitude that we have taken and we continue to take that attitude. In the particular circumstances of this case, which seem to be overlooked by some people, we say that the better legal view is that the Commonwealth has jurisdiction with respect to published judgments of State courts when the courts are exercising Federal jurisdiction. Our authority extends that far also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do intend, particularly as the honourable member has drawn my attention to the fact that the legislation has been passed in Victoria, to take this matter further. Whether the appropriate forum is the Standing Committee of Attorneys- General or some other avenue I am not at this moment entirely clear. But the matter certainly will be pursued. We certainly will be pursuing the Commonwealth 's position that it is in the interests of the profession and of the public at large that there should be the maximum possible dissemination, without restriction, in the printing and distribution of judgments and statutes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to the statement referred to by the honourable member. On 8 September Mrs Yelena Bonner, who is the wife of the very well-known Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov and who is a founding member of the Helsinki group set up in 1976 to monitor Soviet performance in relation to the Helsinki Accords, issued a statement advising that the group had been forced to disband as a result of harassment by the Soviet authorities. We view this development with grave concern, as did the United States body to which the honourable member referred. The Soviet Union freely undertook a series of obligations in respect of human rights when it signed the Helsinki Accords. For the Soviet authorities to bring pressure on an organisation which has carefully monitored their performance and to compel it to end its activities is yet another indictment of the Soviet Union's regrettable record on human rights. We made known to the Soviet authorities our concern about abuses of human rights in the Soviet Union and, in particular, about the fate of the dissidents. I repeat here an appeal to the Soviet authorities to abide by their international human rights obligations and allow the Helsinki group to continue its legitimate and respected activities.</PARA></TALK.START>

Why is it that those documents which appear to be missing from the taxation papers tabled yesterday are: Firstly, all those legal opinions obtained from Queen's Counsel and others which are described by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship and Painters and Dockers Union as establishing clearly that legal proceedings could have been taken against bottom-of-the-harbour schemes under existing law; and, secondly, all those memoranda and letters written by the officers of the Attorney-General's Department which the Costigan report described as giving totally inadequate explanations as to why such proceedings could not have been taken?</PARA></TALK.START>

He stated a plain and proper legal view about the publication of those particular opinions. I stress to the honourable gentleman that indeed these legal opinions are not all on the one side of the argument. I think that is an important thing that is lost sight of. Not all of the legal opinions would necessarily suggest the unambiguous conclusion. The fact of the matter is that the Solicitor-General who is behaving in a totally proper and impartial manner in this matter has advised that the tabling of those opinions would indeed be prejudicial for the reasons set out in my tabling statement yesterday. I do not believe that in the light of the very full disclosure on the large number of documents tabled relating to this matter the implied criticism in the honourable gentleman's question can be sustained.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Victorian Government's Budget last night was an interesting document because it was reminiscent of socialist and Labor policies in previous years. It is worth noting that if the Federal Government had increased taxation in its Budget at the same rate as Mr Cain did in his Budget, by over 23 per cent in one year, Australians would have had to pay $4.8 billion extra-about $17 a week extra from every Australian household. It should be remembered that under the Commonwealth Budget many families with two children and a dependent spouse will be $17 to $18 a week better off. If we had done what Mr Cain has done the family would have been $17 a week worse off. Quite plainly Mr Cain's big spending, big tax budget-that is what it is-is reminiscent of the policies of the Whitlam years. His increase in outlays was over 24 per cent-an increase of 13 per cent in real terms. If the Commonwealth had increased its expenditure by 24.1 per cent, as did Mr Cain, it would have been spending an extra $4.2 billion. When we tie that in with what the Leader of the Opposition said in his response to the Commonwealth Budget we come to figures around $4 billion to $5 billion. That shows quite plainly that the Australian Labor Party has learnt nothing in terms of financial responsibility and what is really in the interests of Australian families.</PARA></TALK.START>

I brought them to the notice of the Treasurer with a letter which asked for urgent action and the preparation of legislation. I think the papers will also show that the Australian Taxation Office did not have sufficient evidence in relation to some of those particular proposals to act forthwith.

Let me nail in the most categoric terms that any claim by any newspaper reporter, any newspaper, any radio station or any television station which indicates that those reports indicated that I had known of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes as a result of that list is totally and utterly false.

On behalf of the Government I have called for statements of interest from Australian shipowners for replacement services in the Bass Strait to take place as soon as possible without subsidy. The statements of interest are now to hand. They are being examined by the Department of Transport and Construction and, in the near future, we will be discussing with the Tasmanian and Victorian governments the applications that have come to hand.

I make the very clear distinction between an announcement procedure in respect of non-criminal matters and the desirability that criminal liability should always date from the time of royal assent. I make no apology at all for not adopting the process of legislation by announcement in respect of criminal matters.

He would be aware also that to form a proprietary company it is necessary to have $2, two directors and two shareholders. In view of the wide-ranging use of proprietary companies, would he and the Government give consideration to ensuring that the capitalisation of these companies is such as to bear their responsibilities and that to do that may require some gearing within the companies' structure? Also, having determined that, would he like to pursue that matter with the ministerial council, where I am sure he would find some welcoming ears?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Treasurer, follows a comment which he made today, namely, that he was not aware of the full extent of the operation of straw company tax evasion methods until about 1979-80. I ask whether he recalls a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation of 20 July 1978 about straw companies which, amongst other things, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . this practice is very wide spread indeed . . . the procedure adopted apparently includes falsification of documents and misappropriation of funds . . . a most pressing need for Submission No. 2290 to be dealt with by Ministers and for the examination that it recommends to be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA>I also ask whether he also recalls a letter to Mr Besley from the Commissioner of Taxation in which the Commissioner stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Submission has been before Ministers for some time does not, in my view, detract from the urgency of the matter. It is important that there be the speediest examination and resolution of the problem. Legislation to counter tax avoidance schemes and arrangements will be of limited effectiveness if 'straw company' evasion is not checked in some way.</PARA>
<PARA>Does he recall other correspondence included in this folio which expresses alarm about the extent of these practices in Adelaide, subsequent correspondence pointing out that these sorts of practices are rampant in Queensland, among other States, and particularly rampant in Victoria, and that very large sums of money which should go to public revenue are being syphoned off for the benefit of promoters? In these circumstances how much worse did the situation have to become and how much more alarm did the Taxation Commissioner have to display to the Government before the Treasurer was convinced that action should be taken? Why should there have been two years of this sort of distress and plaintive complaint on the part of the Taxation Commissioner before the Government finally acted?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that, of all the taxation measures of the Government introduced since 1978, according to the Treasurer's statement of 27 June about 42 could be described as anti-avoidance measures? Is it also a fact that about 22 of them were directed explicitly at deliberate, unambiguous avoidance schemes such as expenditure recoupment, trust stripping, trading stock and sales tax? Has the Treasurer any reason to dissent from the Government's estimates, made at the time when these measures were announced, that revenue lost in these blatant schemes was between $2 billion and $3 billion? If the Government is proposing retrospective legislation against bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, why is it not legislating retrospectively to recoup that $2 billion to $3 billion?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1775" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENNELONG" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be legislating retrospectively in respect of those other schemes. I think the question of retrospective legislation inevitably brings into conflict, as so many government decisions must do, not principle and expediency but different principles. No government of Liberal principles likes retrospective legislation. We have a lot of latter day converts to retrospective legislation, but four years ago the Leader of the Opposition put it around that he was opposed to retrospective legislation. Four years ago he was apparently misreported by four newspapers in this country which stated that he was personally worried about the amendments proposed by the Government regarding the Curran scheme. It was only because the Australian Council of Trade Unions put the heat on him that he changed his view. Now he parades in this House a view that retrospective legislation is and always has been the answer to this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Retrospective legislation puts into conflict two very important principles. One of them, of course, is the general disdain of Liberal governments towards retrospective legislation. The other, of course, is the overall fairness and equity of the taxation system. Because of the illegal behaviour of some people involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, because the benefits derived by people in those schemes have been very considerable and because of the public concern about the prevalence of those schemes, the Government has decided that special circumstances do exist whereby, on this occasion, in putting those principles into balance, the principle of paying service to the overall fairness and equity of the taxation system and the perception of people in the community regarding the fairness and equity of the taxation system ought to take precedence over the Government's general concern about and disdain for, on proper grounds, retrospective legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that in the shop window display by the Royal Australian Navy last Monday, attended by a number of members of this place and by about 200 other representative citizens of the Australian community, the Navy showed its undoubted technical capability and its professionalism. Similarly, I know that at HMAS Albatross there is concern about the degree to which those who are in the Fleet Air Arm are going to be given an opportunity to preserve their capabilities in fixed wing aviation. The honourable gentleman, as the local member-and a very assiduous and competent one at that-has, on repeated occasions , expressed his own interest to ensure that those who are in his electorate and who are serving aboard HMAS Albatross should be given that opportunity. I believe that there is certainly, in the analysis being undertaken by the Department of Defence at the moment, a very comprehensive scrutiny being made not only of alternative hulls but also of the equipment and armaments that should be put on whatever equipment might be decided by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope that it will be possible within the next couple of months to reach conclusions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) has presented in the House today a list of the Sports Development Program grants for 1982-83 which amount, I believe, to $3.2m. While feeling pleased for those sporting bodies who have received a share of the $3.2m , I would like to make a few remarks about the inequality of sports grants as I see them. The total amount of the sports Budget this year is something like $26. 7m, which is fairly generous. It seems to me to be an awful inequality when only $3.2m of that goes to average sporting bodies, that is, the average Joe who is interested in amateur sport. I make that point today because it was revealed this week that in very recent times the Government has had to pay about $2m in compensation to television stations for advertising funds lost because of its proposed boycott of the Moscow Olympic Games. Of course, that is only the tip of the iceberg. The full cost of that proposed and desperately ill-advised boycott is likely to be in the order of $10m. It seems to me quite strange, therefore, that the Government can find only $3.2m this year to provide some assistance to all the amateur sporting bodies in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To add to the confusion, the Government will be receiving about $80m in sales tax on sporting goods this financial year from people who are involved in amateur sporting bodies.

In mentioning this report, I register the disregard of the Opposition for the amount of money involved and also, on behalf of all those sporting bodies, say a very niggardly thank you to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make an explanation as a result of the statement made by the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) to this House yesterday afternoon. Following the two questions that I put to the Minister yesterday in Question Time he gave a supplementary answer at the end of Question Time and later came into the House and made a further statement. At the end of his statement he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From the information provided by my Department which I have just conveyed to this House it will be clear that the assertion made by the honourable member for Wills in his question-he said that my Department had a program for bringing people from the United States to this country to train as air traffic controllers for the three-year course-is without foundation. It would appear that the honourable member for Wills misread the telex from which he quoted this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA>In those circumstances, I refer again to the telex, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This cable is to certify that Mr W. A. Rodda will be departing the USA for Australia on 29 September 1982. He will be employed as an air traffic controller trainee and following training with this Department for a total period of three years. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply point out that those words in that telex are totally consistent with the proposition that there was a recruitment of people in the United States of America for the position of trainee and for training with the Department for a total of three years. I do not wish to debate the issue here. I simply point out that at an appropriate time this matter will be further pursued. I indicated that on the face of the telegram the proposition about training for three years is contained over the signature of Mr McDonald, Department of Aviation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the matter that has been referred to again by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) I just refer to the words that the honourable member used. The words clearly indicate to those who carefully read them that the person would be employed both in terms of training and of ordinary employment for a total of three years. In my first answer yesterday to the question without notice I said that I was unaware of any recruitment program for trainees for the three-year program. When I provided supplementary advice later I gave a clear and unequivocal assurance that my Department has not and has never contemplated recruiting people from overseas for the three-year program. Again, I remind the House that when I was responding to the question without notice I said that people recruited overseas-that is, trained people-would need to undertake some further training when they reached Australia. That training is in what is regarded as the one-year course. So, the telex that the honourable member quoted from is clearly designed to indicate to the recipient, who would be knowledgable of the situation, that he would be employed for a total of three years-up to one year as a trainee and for the remainder up to a total of three years in the employment of the Department of Aviation. I submit that had the honourable member made inquiries regarding the program that has been in place now for some time he would not have fallen into error.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to section 6 (2) of the Australian Science and Technology Act 1978, I present reports prepared by the Australian Science and Technology Council entitled 'New Telescopes for Australian Astronomy in the 1990s' and 'Australian Science and Technology in International Co-operation and Development Assistance'. I seek leave to make a short statement concerning the reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first is a report on 'New Telescopes for Australian Astronomy in the 1990's. Australia has established an enviable international reputation for its research in the field of astronomy. Many important discoveries and contributions to knowledge and understanding of the universe have been made in this country by Australian scientists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. ASTEC's report recognises that if this high standard of research is to be maintained, new telescopes and other instruments will be required from time to time. ASTEC has examined two projects: The construction of a radio telescope, the Australia telescope, and an Australian contribution to a multinational space telescope project, Starlab.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will have seen from the Budget announcements that the Government has decided to act on ASTECs recommendation and construct the Australia telescope. This is to be a bicentennial project to be completed by 1988. It is appropriate that it should be a bicentennial project because the telescope will enable Australian astronomers to maintain their high international reputation and build on their past achievements of which they have every right to be justly proud. The telescope is to be operated by CSIRO but as a national facility. The Australia telescope will be a large radio synthesis telescope and will be constructed at a cost of $25m over six years. The sensitivity and resolution of the new telescope will be equal to or better than corresponding instruments in the northern hemisphere. The time had come when this decision had to be made-the old radio telescope at Parkes was outdated and inadequate to enable Australian scientists and astronomers to maintain their leading position among world astronomers. It is the Government's advice and the Government's intention that the new Australia telescope will enable our astronomers to maintain their leading position in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The second project examined by ASTEC is Starlab. ASTEC has recommended some public funding for Starlab and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) recently announced that a $3.33m grant will be made available for the Starlab project over the next two years. This will enable industry to develop and acquire the relevant new technology. In two years time we will be in a position to decide on Australia's future participation in Starlab. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report of ASTEC to which I draw the attention of honourable members is a background report on Australian science and technology in international co- operation and development assistance. The report draws together information on bilateral and multilateral co-operation including specific science and technology agreements and on development assistance programs, where Australia has taken a significant lead. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a long overdue announcement. It is welcomed by the Opposition but the decision should have been made and announced some years ago. If the Government was not so dilatory in the collection of tax from its tax evading mates we would have been in a much better position to have funded with some certainty a long time ago. The Southern Hemisphere has always been more challenging to astronomers than the Northern Hemisphere simply because a greater range of astronomical phenomena is to be seen in the Southern Hemisphere. We had an excellent reputation in radio astronomy. The speech delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made it clear that he and his speech writers do not really have the foggiest idea of what the projects are about because he made no specific reference to radio astronomy, simply to astronomy. It also became quite clear that the Prime Minister was not fully briefed on the enormous international significance of the Starlab project. I will concentrate on that for a few moments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he has other things on his mind but this is something for the long term that can help ensure that Australia can be a major contributor in the world of scientific instrumentation. That was something that the Prime Minister never mentioned in his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will explain what the Starlab project is. An international consortium will send a telescope out into the heavens, 450 kilometres into space. The telescope itself will be built by Canada. It will be sent up into space by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration in its shuttle. Australia will provide the scientific instrumentation package. It is that scientifc instrumentation package which has enormous potential for Australia. The Starlab project will enable scientists to look back 10 billion years in time. Up in outer space it seems probable that the orginal Big Bang is still showing on the late late show and that Starlab will give us a far deeper insight into how the universe was created. For example, it will investigate the disposition of minerals, the nature of materials generally, the nature of energy systems and the nature of gravity and electromagnetism. It will be tremendous in its importance for what it can do on Earth in communications, resource development and management, defence communications and surveillance, coastal surveillance, weather monitoring and scientific research generally. </PARA>
<PARA> For $30m we buy ourselves a ticket in one of the most exciting scientific projects of this century. The project has enormous significance in scientific instrumentation. Internationally this is now a multibillion dollar industry in which Australia has a very good reputation with significant export income, particularly in medical instrumentation. Starlab will enable us to be world leaders in producing super-sophisticated scientific instrumentation of a sensitivity which hitherto has been unknown. That faces us with an enormous challenge. The problem is whether we will blow our chance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course he was. This Government has persistently wound down Australia's research and development base, and we are very lucky to have the opportunity to move into this area. But the Government very nearly blew it. I point out to the Prime Minister that in the last Budget the amount allocated to the Starlab project was precisely zero. In the initial stages $104,000 was asked for as seed money to get into this project, of which amount this miserable, skinflint Government gave nothing-not a cent.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Horgan could have paid for it himself. What happened was that Australia's place in the Starlab project was kept by a contribution from the French aerospace company, Matra SA. Matra said: 'We regard this project as so important that if Australia does not want to take up the opportunity, we will. We see its world-wide implication for scientific instrumentation'. Matra was perfectly happy to come in. The irony is that under the Mitterrand Government, the Matra company is a wholly-owned government entity located in Toulouse. It is very significant in the aerospace industry and is one of the great leaders in Europe. The result was that Matra in effect kept Australia's place for it and made a very significant contribution to the project. It is to be hoped that, if we adopt the recommendation and go ahead full speed with Starlab, we will carry on where Matra will leave off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, I point out that the Prime Minister says that in two years time we will be in a position to decide on Australia's future participation in Starlab. Mercifully that decision will not be left to him because by then the electors will have passed judgment on the miserable Fraser Government and, of course, because of our determination to launch Australia into a new period of industrial development where we have new and highly sophisticated technologically-based industries a Labor Government will be making the decision about the degree of funding and about the speed with which we will move into this industry. This Government under this Prime Minister has betrayed Australia's national interest by letting down Australia's contribution to this and other intellectually-based industrial activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The last few years have been a miserable period for science and technology and it will be a positive pleasure for us to take up the challenges involved in science and technology. When it is launched I promise that the present Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) will get a seat. We will try to put him in the front row. But it is essential that we fund Starlab otherwise we will simply lose our chance. There has been such a failure of imagination on the part of this Government; it took it so long to recognise the significance of Starlab. It seemed terribly remote and abstract; the Government did not see the enormous significance that it had for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the Government did it. It has not even made a firm commitment about what it will do after two years. It ought to be in a position to be much firmer than that. The second part of the Prime Minister's speech dealt with the Australian telescope project. It is very important that we make some observation about that. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has been a world leader in radio astromony ever since the Second World War. People who were working during the war in radar systems moved afterwards into the area of radio astronomy. We have had an enormous reputation in that area. We were among the world leaders in radio astronmony but, over succeeding years, we have seen the deterioration and aging of equipment which has not been replaced. The consensus in informed circles is that that leadership role we had in radio astronomy was diminishing and that other nations were going to overtake us. It is scandalous that we have had to wait so long for a firm commitment by the Government that we would go ahead with the Australian telescope project. That is, of course, a terrestrial project that will be set up in Culgoora. It is very strongly supported by the Australian Labor Party. In fact, we have specifically indicated support for Starlab and for the radio telescope in the Labor Party platform on science and technology. As I say, once this miserable Government is swept from office it will be a positive pleasure to us to put these two projects into operation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In my statement in Parliament on 21 September 1982, concerning the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry, I referred to breakdowns and administrative failures in a number of areas of government administration over the last decade or so. These matters are obviously of the gravest concern to all Australians. Efficient and effective public administration is vital for maintaining the kind of Australia that we want for our children. The people of Australia have a right to expect good, honest, efficient and effective administration, and the Government is determined to take every possible step to ensure that this occurs. In each instance where there has been a breakdown in Public Service administration over recent years, the Government has made an appropriate and prompt response to remedy the deficiencies that have come to notice. But the Government believes that it is vital not only to remedy deficiencies in administration as they become known but also to look more broadly at the Public Service and the demands upon it in order to do whatever can be done to prevent such breakdowns occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The general health of the Public Service, including its efficiency and management, must be a matter of the highest concern for government. The Public Service-broadly interpreted to include departments and authorities-must be equipped with the kinds of management structures and tools which will enable it to deliver government programs effectively to the people of Australia, and which will allow it to keep up with new technology and with changes in community and business requirements and attitudes. The Government believes there is a question whether the Public Service, as presently organised, has the management tools, the flexibility and the capacities to meet the challenges that presently exist and that lie ahead. Departments and authorities must be able not only to meet the demands of today but also to anticipate the demands of tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three evolutionary changes which present challenges to public administration at the present time. The first is changing technology and the so- called information explosion. The Public Service needs to be able to cope with the significant technological changes and the growth of information which have been and will be taking place, including the relevance of computer technology to public administration. Governments and their agencies must be able to be responsive to, and to take advantage of, new methods of gathering, processing and applying information. But it is not just a matter of applying new technology to growing information. It is also a matter of knowing what information is needed, and in what form it is needed, to enable departments, authorities and Ministers to carry out their functions efficiently and effectively, and also a matter of being able to take practical steps for satisfying these requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The second challenge is posed by the increasing demands on the public sector flowing from a greater involvement by government in areas such as social welfare , health, education and national development, plus many other areas of concern to the community. The increased scope and the wider activities of government obviously enlarge the responsibilities of public administration enormously and create difficulties in relation to adequate communications, accountability and control. </PARA>
<PARA> The third challenge, I regret to say, arises from a deterioration in what I might call the 'business ethics' of a minority. There was a time when the administration, in its relationships with business, could assume that a high degree of trust was appropriate. The Service did not have to be geared to handle cheating on a large scale. Of course, there have always been those in the community who have been prepared to get away with as much as they can without too much regard for what might be regarded as honour, let alone the law; but in the past this has not been an element which has put significant stress on the Service itself. As recent events relating to taxation, meat substitution and health schemes show only too clearly, there are those outside the administration -and I stress again that they are very much a minority-who are prepared to act ruthlessly in what they perceive as their own interests, without regard either to the interests of the community or to the observation of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that third challenge which has been particularly instrumental in leading the Government to the view that at this time there is a need to look closely at the management tools, the flexibility and the capacity of the Service as presently organised. There have been a number of administrative breakdowns which have flowed from the Service's inability to respond speedily and adequately to the challenges posed by those who seek to behave unethically or even illegally. Those in the community who cheat on their obligations to others or attempt dishonestly to evade the law, whether by evading taxation or meat inspection regulations or any other laws or regulations, not only bring dishonour on themselves but also impose real strains on the Public Service of this country, and on the social and economic fabric which is vital to our way of life. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a particular tragedy that small numbers of failures by individuals who have fallen to temptation to give favours or seek favours have brought the Public Service into a degree of disrepute. The Public Service itself wants to respond to the criticisms that have been made against it. They are not criticisms that are made against the Service as a whole, but the Service as a whole is touched by them. Many public servants feel that the reputation of the Service has been badly tarnished by recent happenings and that it needs to re- establish the high reputation that it feels it has earned in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not wish what I am saying to overshadow the very solid work that is being done in the greater part of the Public Service: It is unfortunate, but inevitable, that public attention tends to be focused on what is wrong, not on what is right. But I have said before and I say again now that I have enormous respect for the dedication and management skills of the Public Service, and for the people who staff it. By world standards we have a Public Service of high reputation. But the Public Service cannot live on its reputation and in particular it must meet changes with adequate administrative responses. It is clear that the Service needs to be a jump ahead of those who seek to frustrate it in carrying out its proper functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Both to assist in achieving this and to create the opportunity for the public to be reassured about the future of the Service, the Government proposes that there should be a report to the Government on aspects of the performance of the whole Commonwealth administration. Both through an examination of the underlying causes of major administrative deficiencies of the kind that have occurred in recent years, and through a wider examination of management skills and management structures throughout the Commonwealth Government departments and authorities, the review of Commonwealth Administration is to be asked to examine , report on and make recommendations in relation to the requirements for an efficient and effective Public Service in Australia and in particular to identify the demands and pressures placed upon the Public Service, and the mechanisms, procedures and management structures which are required to enable the Public Service to carry out its functions, implement Government policy and deliver programs effectively and efficiently to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Review in particular should take into account the need for the Public Service to have high standards and good morale; the need for the Public Service to provide the professional managerial component of public administration; the need for the Public Service to possess management skills and to develop management structures capable of meeting and responding to the challenges of an increasingly complex business, economic and social environment; the need for the Public Service to provide constructive and imaginative policy advice, and adequate mechanisms for ensuring the effective implementation of the Government' s policy decisions; and the need for accountability of the Public Service while maintaining the concept of a non-political career Public Service based on merit, capable of providing effective support for Ministers in relation to their administrative and policy-making responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the review involves a major examination of Commonwealth administration , it is not intended that it should be a protracted one. The Government accepts that, in the interests of a timely completion of the Review, in some areas of concern it may be possible only to provide indications of further work that will need to be done to achieve the ultimate objective. It is not proposed that this Review should repeat the work done by the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, which was the first comprehensive review of government administration in over 50 years and had the broadest possible terms of reference. Nor is it proposed to duplicate the particular work done by parliamentary committees, by the Auditor-General, by the Public Service Board and by management consultants and others who may have examined, or be examining, particular aspects of the Service. This Review is to focus specifically on the management framework, the constraints which face public sector managers, and the challenges that they will have to confront in the future. The Government is looking for a report, from people of high reputation in their own business field , which assess what they see as the deficiencies, the problems and the appropriate remedies. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr J. B. Reid, A.O., has accepted the role of Chairman of the Review. Mr Reid is Chairman of James Hardie Industries Ltd, Vice Chairman of Qantas Airways Ltd, and a Director of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Barclays International Australia Limited. He was a member of the Administrative Review Committee in 1975-76, chaired by Sir Henry Bland, and a member of the inquiry into the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in 1978. He has been also a member of various other government bodies and currently is chairman of the Australian Bicentennial Authority. Mr Reid will be assisted by Sir Ronald Elliott, and Professor John Rose. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Ronald Elliott is a Director of Brambles Industries Limited and International Commodities Clearing House Limited. He is the former Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. Sir Ronald has been a member of the Council of the Administrative Staff College and is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Management. Professor Rose is Sidney Myer Professor of Commerce and Business Administration at the University of Melbourne, and since 1976 has been a consultant in my private office. All three members of the Review are obviously well qualified for the task, and the Government is grateful to them for accepting this most important role. </PARA>
<PARA> The Review will have full access in all areas of government administration-to see and consult with whoever it determines, whether from inside or outside the Public Service and statutory authorities. The administration will have an opportunity to explain its task and its methods of carrying it out and, also, the nature of the constraints which distinguish government administration from the business world. People from outside the administration, with substantial and established reputations in the business world, will have an opportunity to say what they think the Public Service should be doing-and here the Review would be looking no doubt for positive and realistic guidance capable of being put into practical effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry will be assisted by a small secretariat, headed by Mr H. B. MacDonald, Deputy Secretary in the Department of Administrative Services. Mr Reid has indicated that he would expect to be able to report before the autumn sitting of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier and as no one in this House would deny, the people of Australia have a right to expect good, honest, efficient and effective administration in the public sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no quibble about a proposition that there should be a review of functions in public administration at any time provided the motivation is desirable. That is a matter I want to come back to. The next matter I want quickly to put on the record is that it is disappointing that there is no Public Service union representative among those people who will be members of this inquiry. To that extent-it is a very important extent-the capacity of the inquiry to discharge fully the obligations put before it will be defective. I compliment the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-I trust that the heavy irony is not missed by our good friends from Hansard-for the impeccable inconsistency worthy only of him in making the choice of Mr J. B. Reid, Director of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, as a person suitably qualified to make judgments and to report upon the administrative efficiency of the Public Service! Only a week ago the Prime Minister was heaping contumely on the shoulders of BHP as being an outstanding example of a failed private operation, of inefficient administration and of bad business decisions. He counselled it to get out in the market place and clean up its own operation before it came near government asking for assistance. Today we suddenly discover the other side of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in terms of administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are virtues in BHP. A director will now be chosen to go on this inquiry into the Public Service which is clearly a diversionary tactic undertaken by the Government. If BHP deserved the strictures of the Government a week ago as an appalling incompetent and glaringly inefficient private sector operation where do the virtues suddenly arise this week? Of course, it is all very clear what this is about. I repeat that the Prime Minister is undertaking a diversionary tactic. I will come to more of that later as they say in the newscasts. I want to put on the record one of the great quotes of our century from who else but our Prime Minister, who is noted for great quotes. </PARA>

It is like Brian Maher upholding the virtues and equity of our taxation system. Maher has punished, pummelled and plundered the taxation system and the Prime Minister has treated the quality of honour with the same regard. The Prime Minister says that the aim of this inquiry is to establish proper, non-political Public Service accountability. But what of the accountability of the political Ministers of his Government? That is never mentioned. The buck never gets there. That is where it should start and stop. The reason is quite simple. We have a Ministry of barnyard bunnies.

Morale in the Australian Public Service is at rock bottom. The Public Service has never been more demoralised than it is now. It is demoralised because of the unrelenting assaults and abuse to which it has been subjected in an orchestrated fashion organised by the Prime Minister and his colleagues. Look at this statement. The ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions was designed clearly to denigrate the self-respect of members of the Public Service who serve this great nation. Page 3 of the ministerial statement states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken the view that we would all be better off in a material as well as in a social and political sense by establishing a more limited, and more realistic, role for government. Smaller government means eliminating waste, duplication and unnecessary costs of government. It does not mean austerity. The benefits of our program are now visible for everyone to see. </PARA>
<PARA>I'll say they are! Standards have broken down in the Public Service because of the unreasonable strains which have been imposed upon it and because of the demoralisation which is a direct product of the Government's persistent abuse of it. That comment was a thinly veiled offensive observation about the Government' s lack of regard and respect for the Australian Public Service. The Public Service has been subjected to repeated attacks on the value and quality of what it has to offer the Australian community. Yet where does the fault rest? Look at the Public Service Board annual report of 1980-81. Under the chapter entitled ' Review of Major Developments' one reads:</PARA>
<PARA> 1980-81 was a difficult year for the Service. Increasing workload and accountability, and the impact on the administration of new and changed legislation, tested the resources of the Service. By and large, the Service coped very well . . . </PARA>
<PARA> A different view of the Service is, however, part of the daily fare of anyone who watches current events. Public servants, it is said, are incompetent, idle, arrogant, pampered, strike-prone, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Prime Minister for you! The Public Service Board went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Service, like many other employers, does have its share of people who may deserve such comment. That apart, public servants are used to being singled out for lampooning. But it becomes at best tedious, and at worst destructive of morale, for public servants to be incessantly the target of generalised and sweeping criticism, especially when it is only too rarely that contrary views from any quarters are expressed and given publicity. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Public Service Board repudiating the Prime Minister. How does a public servant feel when he hears the sort of comment we had in 1979 from the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch)? He is reported in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . 11,000 less bureaucrats with their snouts in the trough . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at where the snouts are in the trough. We find people such as Denis Byrne Horgan, Syd Corser, Ronald Warren Woss, Gallus, Bruce McDonald, His Excellency-I stand to attention and am suitably deferential-the Honourable Sir Ransley Victor Garland who, if not successful anywhere else, knows how to strip companies for tax evasion purposes, and a number of others. </PARA>

They are Liberal- Country Party stooges, affiliates and former members; 17 prime porkers snorting with joy at the public trough that the Government trotted out to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is wrong with the Public Service? I will tell honourable members one of the major problems. One of the major problems is that its capacity to function efficiently has been paralysed by quite injudicious, in fact, thoroughly ill- informed and malicious, staff ceilings. Let us look at the Auditor-General's report in the last couple of years and at the defects that he referred to as a result of staff ceilings imposed on the Public Service. These are limiting the efficiency of Public Service activities, preventing the properly scrutinised collection of revenues owing to the Commonwealth, preventing the proper scrutiny of payments made by the Commonwealth, interfering with law enforcement procedures and seriously curtailing safety procedures connected with both personal safety and property protection. For justification we go to the heart of the diversionary tactics. Things have gone bad for the Government. There is a smell of rottenness in the Liberal Party ranks which we have all identified for a long time-a sewage stench. The Government is trying to blame its deficiencies and failings on the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is a Minister never, ever responsible in this Government in spite of clear evidence, in spite of indictment and condemnation by a royal commission of inquiry? One of the motivations is to try to shelve the blame for recent scandals in relation to tax on the Public Service. Undoubtedly some of it applies, but after looking at the voluminous folio of documents released by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) I am very pleased, on personal grounds and on citizenry grounds, that the Australian Taxation Office comes out of it so well. I am pleased, firstly on personal grounds, because I already had a high personal regard for the officers of that Office-this was one of my first observations when the report of the Costigan Royal Commission into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union was debated in this Parliament-and, secondly on citizenry grounds, because if we cannot have confidence in the impeccable integrity and ability of the Taxation Office then we have not got too much we can hang our hat on in this community. We find that the Taxation Office, apart from taking the proper initiatives, is crippled by staff shortages. I have a letter of 11 April 1978 to the Treasurer. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>We are spread very thinly with officers who have the necessary background and aptitude to develop anti-avoidance and other tax legislation. Any attempt to take on too much at any one time can be counter-productive. </PARA>
<PARA>I have another letter, again from the Commissioner of Taxation, of 11 July 1978 to the Treasurer. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Needless to say, resources and other more urgent commitments allowing, I will continue to have my officers devote their capacities to unravelling, resisting and providing ways of countering these and any further schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>The facts are that if the Taxation Office had been provided with the proper personnel establishment level it could have worked more effectively and much more conclusively. This is the effect of false savings of the Fraser Government as a result of staff ceilings. According to the 1980-81 report of the Commissioner of Taxation the savings in salaries in the investigation section through staff ceilings amounted to about $1.5m. The lost revenue was $47m. It makes sense then for someone from Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd to carry out an efficiency review of the Public Service after it has been established that BHP in its public declaration is totally inefficient. </PARA>

Whenever it has been clearly and convincingly established that the Government has been culpably responsible for a gross dereliction of duty he looks around for a victim and then punches the nearest victim in the nose, bowls him over and then abuses him for standing in the way. He has used the following scapegoats: The world economy, the unions, the Public Service, the education system, dole bludgers, State Premiers, Russians in Afghanistan, people ripping off the system-like members of the Liberal Party but on that occasion he was talking about the unfortunate Greeks-employers, Bert Kelly, Justice Woodward, Commissioner Costigan and the Liberal Party, but never the National Country Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Monopoly Position of the Australian Postal Commission. My predecessor who is now the Minister for Defence, Mr Sinclair, in September 1981 announced the appointment of a committee of inquiry to review Australia Post's monopoly powers. The Government's decision to establish this inquiry was made in the context of its consideration of the review of Commonwealth Functions. Individuals and organisations were invited to make submissions to the inquiry. Eighty-one submissions were received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee of Inquiry has recommended in its report that the exclusive power of the Postal Commission to carry letters for reward should be continued with some changes. In particular, the Committee recommended that the Postal Services Act 1975 be amended to provide exemption from the statutory monopoly of the Australian Postal Commission for the carriage of letters for reward in the following cases: For letters for which a charge is levied at or above $2 for each letter carried; for letters, regardless of the amount charged, in circumstances where the Minister determines that suspension of the monopoly is warranted because the Australian Postal Commission is unable to provide a serivce; for letters between different branches of an organisation and between an organisation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries; and for letters which form inputs to, or outputs from, electronic transmission facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recommended that the scope of Australia Post activities be widened to include operation of a postal courier service, provision of agency services on behalf of public and private sector principals, operation of electronic mail services and the underwriting of postal insurance. With regard to the financial arrangements of the Commission, the Committee of Inquiry has recommended that the Government should determine eligibility for concessions provided for registered publications, with the Commission receiving Budget subsidies for the service. The Committee also recommended that the Commission should establish a separate superannuation scheme with a benefit structure more closely aligned to private sector schemes and that the Commission should be required to pay all taxes or make payments in lieu. In addition, the Committee has recommended the removal of certain government controls on the Commission in the areas of staff ceilings, procurement and capital expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will now examine the findings and recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry and will take into consideration any views on the report which the community may wish to express. It is intended that government decisions on the findings of the inquiry will be made at the earliest possible date. I wish to thank the inquiry Chairman, Mr Bradley, and the other members of the Committee, Mr Millar and Mr Garrett, and the inquiry staff for their work in producing the report. I present the following paper:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Postal Commission-Monopoly Position-Report of Committee of Inquiry- Ministerial Statement, 23 September 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond very briefly. The Opposition was handed the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Monopoly Position of the Australian Postal Commission only about an hour ago and, of course, we cannot make a detailed response to it. I think this is an occasion when we can again feel sorry for the Government. It keeps establishing inquiries to do its work and the reports of these inquiries continue to blow up in the Government's face. The report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union must be the most celebrated example of an inquiry which blew up in the Government's face. After all, it was an inquiry which was set up to pursue the Painters and Dockers Union and, apparently, to establish some association between that organisation and its activities and the Australian Labor Party. It has completely backfired. We now find that Mr Costigan is busily pursuing tax dodgers right into the inner sanctum of the Liberal Party all around Australia. Similarly, we have had the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. Although the Government on that occasion responded by disparaging the Royal Commissioner, what resulted from that inquiry was that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) was found to be seriously wanting in relation to the administration of his Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now we have another instance in which the Government established an inquiry, quite clearly with the object of establishing the circumstances whereby the Government could begin to flog off parts of the Australian Postal Commission and allow the private sector to take up an increasing part of the Postal Commission' s functions. The terms of reference of the Committee were:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Committee is requested to examine and report to the Minister for Communications on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the appropriateness of the present statutory functions and duties of the Australian Postal Commission; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether there is scope for reducing or eliminating the exclusive power of the Commission to carry letters for reward. </PARA>
<PARA>When one considers that the author of those terms of reference was none other than the present Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair), there is no question that we were bound to conclude and entitled to suspect that there was some motive other than a sense of curiosity about the functions of the Australian Postal Commission and possible ways in which its operation could be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we find? We find that this Committee, having done its work, has in fact repudiated the Government in respect of most of the important matters which it wanted the inquiry to pursue. For instance, the Committee's report recommends very strongly that the continuing monopoly position of the Australian Postal Commission should be maintained. It does so for the very good reason that the Opposition pointed out at the time when this inquiry was established. We argued that it is essential that the Postal Commission have a monopoly in order that a service be provided right around Australia with equal access by all people throughout the country rather than penalising those people who live in remote areas. Even more embarrasing for the Government is the fact that at the same time as this Committee of Inquiry was announced-that was at the time of the razor gang report-the Government in fact pre-empted the Committee by saying that the Australian Postal Commission would have to flog off its courier service. This service which had been established very successfully and which was running at a profit had to be flogged off by the Commission to private interests. What do we find as a result of this Committee's work? We find the recommendation that the Postal Commission should be provided with the capacity to run a postal courier service. The ideological view of the Government, symbolised in its action, that this profitable exercise of the Postal Commission should be flogged off, presumably to allow further opportunities for benevolent donors to the Liberal Party and National Country Party to have an opportunity to get the profits themselves rather than allow the profits to go to the Postal Commission and thereby help to subsidise the services which are provided to the rest of the community, has been completely repudiated by that finding from the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go through all the recommendations of the Committee. In total they amount to a repudiation in terms of what the Government was looking for. The important area in which the Committee recommends some diminution of controls over the Commission relates to removing from the Commission, to some extent, the restrictions which exist in relation to the Public Service. If that is what is necessary to ensure that this important and very successful public body operates more effectively, we have no objection to that being done. One matter ought to be referred to, however, and that is that the Committee has said that in relation to articles, the cost of carriage of which exceeds $2, there ought to be the opportunity for private competition. The Opposition makes the point that that limit seems to be too low. If one were to have that sort of premium explicitly provided for in the area in which there could be competition, one would want to express it in terms other than dollar terms. One possibility is that it should be expressed in terms of, say, ten times the normal postal rate. It is important that, if there is to be such a capacity, it ought to be set at a sufficiently high level so that the activities of the Postal Commission are not surreptitiously undermined. </PARA>
<PARA> There are important questions relating to electronic mail and the role of Australia Post in that area. I simply urge the Government that before acting on that matter it should consider it in the context of what Telecom Australia has to say and particularly, what was presented to the Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia. I think those are important matters that have to be considered. I would welcome the opportunity in the future to have this matter brought back for debate so that the Opposition can expand to some extent on its views on the future of the Australian Postal Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Yesterday during the discussion in this House on the tabling of the Code of Practice on the Management of Radioactive Wastes from the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores I made a number of claims regarding the situation at the Ranger tailings dam in the Northern Territory. They were to the effect that the ground water was rising, creating pressure in the dam and forcing water out underneath the dam wall, and that the dam was not, in fact, constructed down to bedrock. I said that if there was a very great problem now after only one year there would be a very large problem in perhaps 15 or 20 years. I also said that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) had been informed of this over two months ago, that the information had come to me through the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Office of the Supervising Scientist and that the Minister had had a report from at least one of the authorities concerned-the Department of Mines and Energy in the Northern Territory or the Office of the Supervising Scientist-and had not in fact informed the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After I finished my contribution the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment took the unusual step of seeking to make a reply. The Opposition gave him leave to do so and he made a further statement. Before the Minister did so, I showed him what in fact were my own memo notes. I did so out of courtesy, I would have thought, to save him perhaps from embarrassment if he were about to deny the claims. The Minister said in the reply which we had so courteously allowed him to make that I had in fact picked up a letter or a document which 'fell off the back of a truck'. In fact, I had no such letter. As I said, I referred merely to the memo notes that I showed the Minister regarding information received from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Office of the Supervising Scientist. I repeat: I have no such letter from either office-that is, the Parks and Wildlife Service or the Supervising Scientist-nor any document from the back of a truck. </PARA>
<PARA> It perturbed me greatly to learn this morning from sources within the Department of Home Affairs and Environment, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Office of the Supervising Scientist that the Minister has now in fact instigated a sort of witch hunt over a mythical letter which he claims was sent to me by someone in the National Parks and Wildlife Service or his Department. In the interests of the establishment of integrity of the Department , the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, I inform the House that the Minister is quite mistaken, that the material I showed him was not a letter or a document but was, in fact, my personal notes. I suggest, in conclusion, that the Minister table in the House immediately any report that he has on this very serious matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Earlier this morning the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) took the opportunity apparently to deny or correct something which I said about him yesterday. In the process he was rather scathing in his description of my conduct and, in fact, made allegations about associations which he said I might have. Because I might have been wrong and because the Minister might be right, I just want to indicate what happened yesterday in the debate. I quoted from a speech which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made in which he likened tax dodgers to people who had received stolen funds. He said that the recipients of the funds have in their hands stolen funds. He was very critical of people for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply went on to make the point that the Minister for Defence had on an earlier occasion admitted to having been the beneficiary and having received funds which were mis- appropriated by his father and passed on to him. Indeed, the Minister for Defence had given an undertaking, had entered into a contract, to pay back that stolen money. If, in fact, the Minister has paid that stolen money back, all I want to say is congratulations. But maybe he ought to come into the House and tell us. All we know is that he entered into a contract to pay back that stolen money. Until he indicates to us that he has paid back that stolen money we are entitled to assume that he still holds it and we are entitled to draw attention to the inconsistency between the Prime Minister's view of tax dodgers and stolen money and of Ministers and stolen money. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on to make the point that my views on this matter and my allegations in this regard had something to do with my association with the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia. I just say to the House that for the period during which the Painters and Dockers Union was affiliated with the Australian Labor Party-now, of course, it is not-it was affiliated on a State by State basis. Of course, members of the Labor Party belong to the Labor Party on a State by State basis. I am a member of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party. The Painters and Dockers Union does not exist as a union in Western Australia and has, therefore, never been affiliated with the Labor Party in Western Australia. Certainly it is not now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I desire to draw your attention to a set of circumstances which, I believe, require investigation. Some nine months ago I had occasion to make representations to the then Minister for Defence-the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen)-in respect of a visit paid to me by a constituent, a flight lieutenant in the Air Force. I had not met this young man before he came to see me. He had been subject to certain charges within the Air Force. He felt that these charges had been improperly laid and brought against him. I raised the matter with the former Minister for Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subsequent to the change in portfolios, I took up the matter with the new Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair). After he had an opportunity to view the files last week he made certain decisions in this matter. I conveyed those decisions to my constituent. This morning there arrived through the mail what could be described as a stick-up on some paper. I will not refer to the name of my constituent but the paper-with the name deleted-states:</PARA>
<PARA> Stop . . ., if you know what is good for you. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to make other suggestions which I will not repeat. Clearly it does involve a threat to a member of this Parliament in respect of representations being made on behalf of a constituent. Mr Speaker, I raise the matter for your attention and ask you to initiate the appropriate inquiries with the responsible authorities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve today for the many hundreds of families in my electorate and indeed for thousands in other electorates who settled in this country and are unable to be reunited with members of their families overseas. In particular I grieve for those who believed the former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs who said that more emphasis would be placed on family reunion when he announced in the House of Representatives on 29 October last year the new immigration policy to come into effect on 19 April 1982. In his statement the Minister said that the new system would:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Strongly favour skilled applicants and those with family in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued that most applicants have to say 'yes' to one of two questions: Have I close family ties with an Australian resident who can help me settle, or have I skills or personal qualities that will benefit Australia? Despite references elsewhere to the need for a job skill in demand the overwhelming emphasis in the Minister's announcement was on the substantial concessions given to family reunion. The Minister's statement was calculated to lead many thousands to believe that the Liberal Party had finally accepted the unanimous views of the ethnic communities that family reunion has to be given the highest priority in our immigration program. The fact that tens of thousands of applications were lodged soon after 19 April, the commencement date for the new immigration policy, shows clearly that the Minister's statement aroused high expectations amongst new settlers in Australia. Little did they know then what a cruel deceit the Minister's statement was. As with everything that this Government announces, people have yet to learn that there is a great difference between the Fraser Government's rhetoric and its actions. </PARA>
<PARA> I state quite clearly here, so it will not be open to misrepresentation, that I do not support unlimited or uncontrolled entry into Australia. I am also not in favour of a large influx of people especially when we have experienced, thanks to the Fraser Government, the worst economic slump since the Great Depression. As a matter of fact, it is the Liberal-National Country Party that set the migration target of 130,000 arrivals this year to enlarge the pool of unemployed to keep wages down. It is this conservative Government which accepts tens of thousands of refugees and brings in skilled workers while Australian tradesmen find it difficult to get a job. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges) then races around the country saying that unemployment is caused by migrants who take the jobs of Australians. How low can you get? The Minister is blaming immigration, which it is his job to administer, for the economic mismanagement of this Government. The Minister wants to have it both ways-he wants to bring in an excessive number of people from overseas to boost unemployment but then he turns around and blames the migrants, many of whom are the first victims of his Government's economic policies, for the depression. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that in a few months' time when we become the Government we will put a brake on the unprecedented high influx of people during the current economic depression and return to a regulated immigration policy by setting the number of immigrants to the capacity of our economy to absorb. But at the same time we will not continue the Fraser Government's deceit; we will give the highest priority to family reunion. I know that honourable members opposite are itching to ask me how on earth I can advocate more family reunion and a lesser annual intake of migrants at the same time. I can tell them that there is no contradiction here whatsoever. We can have a much higher content of family migration inside an even reduced immigration program just as easily as the Fraser Government can reduce the intake under the family migration category while enlarging the overall intake. The family migration under this Government has fallen from 26 per cent to a mere 17 per cent of total intake in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before the Australian Labor Party will give the highest priority to family reunion when it comes to office. It will also do a more positive thing. It will get the Australian economy moving so that a vigorous immigration policy can be pursued. Let us get back to the cruel hoax perpetrated on ethnic communities in Australia. Since the new family migration scheme commenced on 19 April approximately 30,000 applications have been lodged with only one regional centre, in Melbourne. At the same time the Minister did not ensure that his Department was equipped to deal with such numbers of applications. Not enough staff are employed to process the applications and I suspect that this is done on purpose so that relatives in Australia will have to wait two or three years or longer before they get an answer. By the time the few clerks sift through the applications many migrants will have abandoned any hope of seeing their brothers , sisters or parents again. </PARA>
<PARA> To make things worse the Department does not have enough sponsorship forms on hand. My office was inundated with requests for forms and I had great difficulty in obtaining them. On two occasions I had to send telegrams to the Minister with my request for sponsorship forms. Even then it took more than a fortnight to receive the forms. I can imagine how long it takes to get forms if one does not wire the Minister for them. While the many migrants who went to all the trouble to fill out the forms are awaiting hopefully the Department's yeas or nays to their request to bring out their relatives, little do they know in what a shambles the Minister's Department is. Some people were lucky enough to receive an acknowledgement of their application in which the Department advised them to wait patiently and not even to make inquiries as to what happened to their applications as the Department has no staff to answer their inquiries. What a department the Minister presides over!</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that one has to be a genius to perceive that the slowing down of the processing of applications is a deliberate tactic by the Minister to reduce family migration. I wish that the Minister-I am glad to see him in the House- would come clean on this and tell the truth to the thousands of hopeful migrant families that the new family migration system introduced by his predecessor was a hoax and that under the new system it will be even harder to bring a relative out than under the old discredited Numerical Multifactor Assessment System. Honourable members opposite can argue that we have to reduce our immigration intake because of the economic crisis Australia is in. I have no quarrel with that. I reiterate that I am not advocating a higher intake. I am saying that the highest priority should be given to those intending migrants who have close relatives in Australia. The Government is accepting up to 20,000 refugees a year . These are mainly Indo-Chinese refugees. I accept that we have some humanitarian obligations but I do not think that the Fraser Government can argue on this score, because although accepting refugees from Vietnam it refuses to accept relatives of people who live in South America under military dictatorships such as those in Chile, Argentina or Uruguay where they are threatened by the secret police and concentration camps. </PARA>
<PARA> Like many other members, I have received scores of complaints from Latin American migrants whose families are maltreated by the authorities in their own countries. Yet the Fraser Government's selective humanitarianism prevents them from joining their families here. Why does the Minister not allow relatives of Lebanese living in Australia to come here-Lebanese who are under threat of massacre and who are being killed in scores of hundreds every day? After all, charity starts at home. If we have any humanitarian obligations, our obligation is first to those people who have successfully settled here and whose relations are in distress in their respective countries. We should keep in mind that all the boat people we received here will also press-quite rightly-for the right to bring their close relations to Australia too. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is another category of migrants that the Government is so keen to recruit; namely, people who come here to take up jobs required by some industries. While the Government was quick to oblige the bosses, many tradesmen who were recruited came out here only to find that their jobs were no longer here by the time they arrived. Even if such people find jobs, let us not forget that they too leave families behind and they too have brothers and sisters who might not be boilermakers or electricians. What will the Minister say when they naturally ask the Government to allow their families to be reunited with them in this country? I have stated time and again that the best migrants for this country are those who have relatives who have settled here successfully before them. The family support provided to them will help their absorption into our community and will help to create a happier nation. I call on the Government for once to be humane and understanding and to accept the Labor Party's policy of high priority to family migration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This is the second time in the space of a fortnight that I have been listed to speak in a grievance debate so that I may have the opportunity to bring up something of interest to my electorate and to the nation. It is the second occasion on which the time I have to deliver my speech in the grievance debate has shrunk to two or three minutes. That brings me to the text of my grievance today. While the Standing Orders provide for honourable members to grieve, the time allowed to them has been shrinking. This morning is a typical example of Government Business displacing time allocated to private members. This happens not only on Grievance Day; it also happens at Question Time and in the adjournment debate in the evening. The encroachment of Government Business and of other matters such as personal explanations seems to grind down, to shrink, the time available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have just had a look at the Standing Order under which this House is operating; that is Standing Order 106. I was wondering whether in my grievance I could suggest to the powers that be that the time allowed for grievances be a set time and that, if necessary, the time allowed for Government Business be shrunk and not the time allowed to private members. As I understand Standing Order 106, it does not give the Parliament any leeway to extend that time to what might be an acceptable period. I notice that nine honourable members were on the list of speakers today. That would require a grievance debate lasting for an hour and a half. I had some good material to speak about. It is the second time in a fortnight that I have been unable to deliver my speech in the Grievance Debate. It seems that I cannot get back into the debate unless I talk about the Ord River or the Burdekin Dam!</PARA>
<PARA> In the last few moments available to me I suggest to the Leader of the House ( Sir James Killen) and to those who have responsibility for the Standing Orders that Standing Order 106 be reviewed and amended so that something is done about the time allocated for this debate. I believe one hour should be the minimum period. I turn to the adjournment debate when one half hour is allowed to private members to say what they wish. I notice that the tendency again has been for Government Business to encroach into that time. Again our time has been whittled away. Another inconsistency is that in time allocated to private members an Opposition member is allowed the first speech and is followed by a Government member. It appears to me that the rules and regulations weigh very heavily in favour of Opposition members and against Government members. I suggest to the House that all this needs very close scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is compelled to bring this matter before the House, given the present attitude of the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) to the medical fraud and overservicing problem. He made the following statement to the Parliament last week:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . I am absolutely not going to be stampeded into making stupid, fast decisions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That might have been an acceptable explanation and not the feeble excuse that it is if in the past seven years the Government had acted with speed and dispatch in recognising the problem and magnitude of doctor fraud and overservicing. But that is not so. One could describe the response to the problem of this Government over seven years as a crab-wise approach at the pace of a snail. There is overwhelming evidence for that statement. Indeed, when we look at the approach of Mr Hunt, Mr MacKellar and now Mr Carlton to this issue we see that there is not the slightest danger of being trampled on by a horde of stampeding Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the Minister's comment might have been an acceptable explanation and not the feeble excuse that it is if the Government had acted with any resolution once it had recognised the magnitude of the fraud and overservicing problem. But again this is not so. </PARA>
<PARA> The paucity of the Government's response is the most characteristic feature of its response to medical fraud and overservicing to date. The Minister said that he would not be stampeded into making stupid and fast decisions because he was waiting on the interim report from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts due, we hope, in November. Let us hope it comes before the Parliament rises or before we are sent off for an election. I will deal later with the insubstantial nature of that part of the excuse. One should notice that even the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), now notorious for his blindness to the corruption in the meat export industry, acted with vigour immediately the magnitude of the problem was brought to his rather blinkered vision. It can be said that in due course he acted promptly. At least he did not wait for a royal commission to report before he acted. As the estimates given both to the Public Accounts Committee and to others indicate that up to $12m in overpayments a month is occurring, a more vigorous response than we are getting from the Minister is demanded, particularly in light of the Government's past reactions. </PARA>
<PARA> First, let us look at its belated recognition of the problem simply by examining its response. In April 1977 it is true that there was legislative provision for medical services committees of inquiry to deal with overservicing but none of these committees met until June 1978 and in some States no references were made to these committees until five years after the legislation was introduced. Again, in April 1981 the Fraud and Overservicing Detection System-FODS-was established and for the first time an effective system for monitoring doctor fraud and overservicing was set up. But that was some six years after this Government came to power and several years after there was fairly massive evidence about the extent of doctor fraud and overservicing. In April 1982 the Health Legislation Amendment Bill imposed medical sanctions on doctors found guilty of two or more fraud charges. They were to be denied access to medical benefits for three years. It is interesting that the sanctions were presented but that nothing much was done about making more effective both the detection and the conviction of doctors for fraud cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The first question that we need to ask is: Why, apart from the medical services committees of inquiry, was nothing done until the 1980s? Why was no significant action taken until the 1980s apart from the setting up of the medical services committees of inquiry? Did the Government and the Department of Health have no inkling that funds and government were being milked by over $100m annually? The answer to that is unambiguous. They should have known. If the Department was doing its duty and the Minister for Health was acting responsibly they could not have avoided knowing. Medibank, by the end of 1976, recognised a problem of some magnitude. In 1978 the Department of Health learnt of a 1977 Medibank estimate of fraud and overservicing payments of approximately $100m. In 1979 the private funds constantly expressed to the Government disquiet over the extent of medical fraud and overservicing. But both the Department and Ministers had reason for knowing much earlier. The efficiency and scope of the original Medibank had clearly indicated the problem to them in 1976. Prior to Medibank there was no monitoring of doctor fraud and overservicing through the private funds. There was a naive manual monitoring of the pensioner medical scheme. Interestingly, in that period before Medibank, the vast majority of prosecutions in the medical field were of patients, not of doctors. Doctors, apparently, were not the problem although as there was no effective monitoring of doctors there is no way of verifying this. </PARA>
<PARA> Medibank Standard came in in July 1975. There is now a well built up Liberal mythology about that. Medibank Standard was introduced into a veritable medical Garden of Eden, into the best possible of medical worlds with the best possible levels of servicing. It was said that overnight a significant minority of doctors were bitten by the overservicing and fraud serpents and fell into evil ways. That is very much a fantasy as I will show in a moment, but it was trumpeted by former Ministers for Health. The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt), the present Minister for Transport and Construction, used always to talk about the Labor Party stuffing the doctors' mouths with gold. If he really believed that it is surprising that for four years he took no significant actions about this process of, in his own wards, stuffing doctors' mouths with gold. The next Minister for Health, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), believed that bulk billing was very much the source of the doctors' fall. Such views, even if the Ministers were mistaken, should have made them suspicious of the doctors. But of course, these views are nonsense. They assume that doctors were innocent and virginal until 30 June 1975 and were seduced and corrupted on 1 and 2 July 1975. The Director-General of Health, who I am afraid is not always particularly percipient in these matters, was quite percipient on this point. He noted, 'fraud is as old as Hippocrates himself'. In fact that oath was designed to deal with some early medical problems. More specifically, the Australian Medical Association submission to the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts points out:</PARA>
<PARA> Any system of medical care, in which a third party is responsible for paying the whole or part of the cost of a medical service, is potentially open to abuse . </PARA>
<PARA>It does not matter whether the third party is a private insurance body or a public fund. If one has a fee for service payment plus public or private insurance the system is open to abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us put the fantasy aside. Medibank in fact made two contributions to this problem. First of all, it undoubtedly expanded the possible scope of fraud by enabling fraudulent doctors to rip off the poor as well as the rich. The aim of Medibank was to extend health cover right across the board so obviously, whereas in the past doctors no doubt ripped off the rich they now had the opportunity of ripping off the poor as well. More importantly in relation to this argument Medibank provided the first computerised payment system and, with it, the widest possible population from which to extrapolate and therefore to detect fraud and overservicing. Medibank was therefore very soon aware of the problems of fraud and overservicing. Indeed, within six months an officer was sent to Canada to examine Canada's fraud and overservicing and monitoring provisions. By the end of 1976 Medibank recognised that there was 'a problem of some magnitude in fraud and overservicing.' The Department of Health sometimes uses as an excuse the fact that the Health Insurance Commission which ran Medibank was separate from the Department of Health. That is a kind of bureaucratic response. It is formally true but there were constant links between the Health Insurance Commission and the Department of Health. Indeed, for much of the period about which we are talking the Director-General of Health was also the Chairman of the Health Insurance Commission. There was no doubt in the evidence that there were constant contacts back and forth about these problems. The destruction of Medibank in late 1976 undermined the immediate potential for an effective monitoring system because it did away with that superb data basis. One of the great ironies of this whole issue is that this Liberal Government, in its ideological obsessions, got rid of Medibank, destroyed that invaluable data basis and, then, three or four years later, had to begin all over again to create an effective data basis on which to base an effective monitoring system. From October 1976-that is, from the end of Medibank Standard-to November 1978 there was a clear loss of control in the Department of Health. There was a rather inefficient, laissez-faire attitude to the whole issue of monitoring and control as the system slipped back towards the private sector. Of course the whole problem for the Department of Health was exacerbated by continual major changes in health insurance arrangements. It was very difficult to keep one's eye on the doctors if at the same time there were constant changes in the health insurance arrangements. In those two years 1976 to 1978 the data basis built up in the Medibank period was sacrificed primarily for ideological reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> From November 1978 the Department of Health began to realise its mistakes and began again to create the data basis which had been abandoned two years before. But it must be said that the top echelon of the Department of Health-the evidence for this is overwhelming-was a rather aging elite, quite unsympathetic to the sort of technology required for monitoring in the late twentieth century. It tended to ignore the problems thrown up by the data base in the hope that somehow they would go away. I think it has also to be recognised that it was mostly a medical elite whose members seemed quite incredulous that their fellow professionals should so blatantly milk the system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As well, probably. Presiding over these four years of virtual inaction from 1975 to 1979 was the then Minister for Health, the present Minister for Transport and Construction. From which party does that former Minister for Health come? Of course, he comes from the chook raffle party, the National Country Party. We know about Country Party Ministers. It is about time that it was said in this House that the Country Party Ministers are like slugs. The slime of their incompetence, their inabilities, their dereliction of responsibilities trails through every office they inhabit. There is no doubt in my mind that when this scandal is fully exhumed and exposed much of the responsibility will rest on the present Minister for Transport and Construction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let it be said of the succeeding Minister, the honourable member for Warringah, Mr MacKellar, that as the Australian Medical Association pointed out in evidence a distinct change came over the whole business with the change from Mr Hunt to Mr MacKellar. I think we have to give the honourable member for Warringah credit for at least recognising the problem. He did not like talking about it very much . He left the AMA and the ALP to draw the whole issue to the attention of the public and he did not, in fact, do very much about it. He brought FODS to completion, he improved marginally the MSCIs and he introduced medical benefit sanctions on doctors convicted of fraud. At least he deserves the credit for recognising that a problem existed after four years of governmental refusal to recognise this massive fraud on the public. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is still no real sense of urgency in the Department of Health in regard to the problem. The quality and quantity of officers in claims review and investigation remains disappointing. The training of medical counsellors is inadequate. Too often the training required seems to be just chummy chats. There is no sense of overall cohesion and direction in the Department of Health in relation to medical fraud and overservicing. Some regional offices are active. For example, the Western Australian office seems to be active although it is plagued by problems from the notorious Crown Solicitor's Office in that State. Other offices are relatively inactive-for example, that in my own State of South Australia-while other regional offices, for example, in Victoria, seem to have developed elaborate bargaining activities with the most blatant offenders. There is no overall cohesion, no overall national policy, no effective responsibility from the State branches up the line to the central bodies. The MSCIs are simply log-jammed. To date they have completed 31 referrals. At present they are working on another 30, with something like 80 referrals pending. That log-jam simply has to be broken. I believe that the whole approach of the MSCIs has to change. </PARA>
<PARA> The need to examine critically the health legislation, the schedules, the policy and the claiming documents to remove ambiguities and legal loopholes has been recognised for at least three years; yet nothing has been done. For at least a year the Government has had proposals before it-a range of options-so that the magnitude of individual doctor fraud could be brought before the courts after conviction but before sentencing. Again, the choice has not been made as to which line to follow. The Opposition has no desire to stampede the Minister; it desires him simply, in the face of this sorry saga, to take some immediate actions. </PARA>

The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) has been saying things around the country which would indicate that there is some sort of class warfare or anti-professional warfare against doctors . I deplore this. On a most unfortunate occasion in Victoria, at the Preston and Northcote Community Hospital on Friday, 18 September 1981, the Leader of the Opposition made a gross and unfair attack against the medical profession generally. I am not accusing the honourable member for Bonython of doing this because he, in his address to the Australian Medical Association and in various other statements, has been careful to draw a distinction between good and poor professional practices. I shall quote one sentence to indicate the tone of that address by the Leader of the Opposition, which brings in a very unfortunate flavour to this kind of debate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In short, in an imperfect market environment the health care system is rigged by doctors to satisfy their pecuniary aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not say 'some doctors' or 'bad doctors'; he said 'doctors'. I make it absolutely clear to the doctors in the community who, for the most part, are obviously people of the greatest integrity and who perform an absolutely essential service to keep the health care services of the country alive, that they have the respect of their patients and, despite the furore, of most of the public. I think it is important for me as the Federal Minister and for my State colleagues-although one of them, I am afraid, has fallen down on this aspect in the last 24 hours-to support the good doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I refer to the matters that the honourable member for Bonython I believe quite properly raised. I do not think anybody could stand by and listen to the evidence that has been given before the Public Accounts Committee inquiry over the last few weeks without asking very serious questions as to how long substantial fraud and overservicing might have been going on in regard to the payment of medical benefits and how quickly the public sector reacted to it. Indeed members of the Opposition have a particular interest-even greater than ours, I suspect-in worrying about how the public sector might react because their policy requires a substantial extension of the activities of the public sector in the provision of health care and, certainly, in health insurance. They extended the scope of the Government very substantially indeed between 1972 and 1975 and in doing so, of course, expanded the areas in which fraud or overservicing could occur. I notice also that in the policy that they have been putting up for future elections-this has been promoted around the countryside by the honourable member for Bonython-they want to extend bulk billing. They say in their policy that where the doctor agrees bulk billing will be available to everyone so that the patient does not have to claim a refund for the cost of medical treatment. That of course would tend to remove one of those checks in the system which have at least some modifying effect on the capacity of people to indulge in fraud or overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us make clear the difference between fraud and overservicing because we will make very grave mistakes if we do not draw that clear distinction. Fraud occurs when a service is just not provided but a benefit is asked for in relation to an alleged service. That is a clear case in which somebody seeks to defraud the taxpayer-the person paying medical insurance-and it is downright criminal. There is absolutely no doubt about it. Those cases are matters for police action and prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area, overservicing, is much more difficult to determine. Although it is possible, under existing systems, to look at computer profiles which are prepared by the Department of Health to see a pattern of servicing which appears to be different from the average, it is not possible from that computer profile to see whether that additional servicing was done in the interests of the patient, according to the professional judgment of the provider, or whether it was done in order to attract further income. In many cases it is very hard to draw a distinction between those two activities. The conscientious doctor will want to see a patient again, having prescribed some medicine or some course of treatment, to ensure that that course has been followed, or out of a genuine concern for the welfare of the patient. Another doctor would assume that the patient's friends or relatives or the patient himself would do all the right things and would go back to the doctor and make a further request if there were any difficulty later. I think we have all encountered doctors who, quite satisfactorily and helpfully from the point of view of the patient, have made another visit or suggested that patients come back to the surgery to be looked at or have a discussion about a course of treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an understandable concern amongst good doctors and highly professional people that the general public will not make this distinction. When there is a lot of Press activity, publicity and accusation, it becomes even more difficult to make this distinction. Therefore, I urge everybody who is talking about this matter to make it clear that it is not always the case that overservicing is caused by an attempt by a doctor to get more money out of the system. It may well be a wise professional judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I go on to deal with what I think we ought to do. I said last week-I stick by this statement-that I will not be rushed into making immediate decisions on the basis of unfolding evidence or accusations which might be ill- considered. I realise the frustrations and concerns of my friend opposite but it would just not be sensible of me to do that. Since taking over this portfolio four months ago, I have treated this matter as one of the major issues I have to look at, in common, I might say, with many others. I have very grave concerns about our care for the aged program and our general policies in relation to nursing homes. I think there are a lot of difficulties in those areas. I believe about six or seven other major issues require a great deal of my personal attention in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. But I have certainly devoted a fair proportion of my time, which is very much occupied in all respects, to this problem in order to gain a detailed personal understanding of it and of the underlying requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also had a look in detail at what has been done over the last few years in order to respond to the various stages of disclosure of the problem. I made available to the Public Accounts Committee material from the Department which will enable members of that Committee to come to a conclusion about the response by officials and Ministers. No doubt the Committee will be doing that. Its report is only about eight weeks away. When I inquired about the matter a few weeks ago I was advised by the Chairman of the Committee that, given the nature of the inquiry and the complications of the matter at which the Committee was looking, the Committee did not think it would bring down a report until well into next year. I expressed concern about that because my firm conclusions about the new steps I might take will be ready, I believe, by mid-November. It would be singularly unfortunate if I had to go ahead and act on those views without the advice of the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee, for which I have the greatest respect, has brought in reports in the health area in the past. Within the last four months I have read ones that relate to my departmental responsibilities and, indeed, have acted on certain areas mentioned in those reports which still required action. I believe that the fact that the Committee is bipartisan is very useful in that nobody will be able to say that that Committee has covered up anything or that it did not address itself to the main issues. I suspect that the aspect that will be difficult to distinguish-I think this has been properly raised by my friend the honourable member for Bonython-is the extent to which bodies in the public sector will react to changing circumstances. It is a matter which is of grave concern to all members of this House. It was reflected in the statement made this morning by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when he referred to the very great difficulties of public sector administration in reacting to the complexities of the modern world. </PARA>
<PARA> My friends opposite have a very substantial interest in this matter, as we do; they even more so perhaps because they have a more optimistic view than we have of the capacity of public administration to deal with the nation's problems. We believe much more in private sector provision on the understanding that the public sector is, by its very nature, cautious in reaction. It does not react very quickly to market forces, external forces of any kind, or even criminal forces. It is relatively slow to react in a proper way in many respects because it has to worry about the public purse. Sometimes the very restraints on it which are designed to protect the public purse also prevent it from reacting where there is a threat to the public purse from other directions, such as crookedness or some other means. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that the Public Accounts Committee will take the view that the reaction was slow. Some of the evidence suggests that. I certainly am unable, given the number of hours in each day and the number of things I have to worry about, to read each piece of public evidence or each submission to that Committee every day. I just cannot do it. Therefore, I have not been able to form a balanced view-as that Committee will in some eight weeks' time-as to what the response of the public sector has been. I merely say at this point that it would not surprise me if that Committee found that that response had been slower than people might have expected. I must say that I would be astonished if it were found that the public sector had responded much more rapidly to changing external circumstances than one is wont to expect of the local grocery store, the local drycleaner and so on. It is not the normal procedure for the public sector suddenly to offer one-hour drycleaning when previously it has been offering it on a 24-hour basis, or to make improvements to meet the requirements of customers when there is a monopoly provision. There are also a number of rules which are designed to protect the public purse but which require departments to go through the Public Service Board and to obtain other approvals before they do various things. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from all that-I am not denying that the honourable member for Bonython may suggest some things once he has had a chance to examine the report of the Public Accounts Committee-there may well be quite reasonable suggestions that things might have been done earlier. It will be interesting to observe the relationship between the Department and the Ministers. From my examination of ministerial correspondence going back over the years, I have no reason to believe that my two ministerial predecessors, the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), failed to act on matters that were brought to their attention. The Public Accounts Committee will be able to examine that material and make its judgment. At the time that material comes before the Parliament and the House, I am sure that my honourable friend opposite will wish to raise the matter more substantially. I certainly will not draw back from responding much more substantially than I do now. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, I merely say that I am very active in the area. I certainly see at least three areas where further action over and above that taken by my predecessors will need to be taken. I certainly am not limiting my examinations to the areas looked at by the Public Accounts Committee. I think I have a wider duty than that. Certainly it is a duty to this House and the Australian people which I hope to be able to live up to. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 is an omnibus Bill, gathering together those social security and welfare initiatives of the 1982-83 Budget that require legislation. Part VI of the Bill contains the major initiatives it deals with in the form of amendments to the Social Security Act 1947. Part II amends the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954, and Part V the Delivered Meals Subsidy Act 1970. The Bill also deals, in Parts III and IV, with consequential amendments to the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 and the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965, and makes minor amendments to the Social Services Amendment Act 1979 in Part VII and the Social Services Amendment Act 1981 in Part VIII. There are further minor amendments to the main Acts in the other parts of the Bill. Since these minor amendments have no policy significance and do not involve expenditure, I do not propose to discuss them in detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The major initiatives embodied in this Bill consolidate and extend the steps taken by the Government in last year's Budget to direct available increases in welfare expenditure to those in the greatest need. In 1981-82 we identified three groups as being in need of particular help. These were families with three or more children, pensioners who pay private rents, and those single unemployment beneficiaries over 18 years of age whose benefits are not automatically indexed. Our assistance to them, through increased rates of family allowance for third and subsequent children, increased supplementary assistance and an increased single rate of unemployment benefit, represented, in our view, the best use of the increases in expenditure we were able to make at that time over and above the increases to which we were committed by the regular twice- yearly consumer price index-linked increases in most standard pension and benefit rates. In the 1982-83 Budget we have again introduced measures that will assist all three of these groups, as well as taking further steps to alleviate some of the pressure points in the system-particularly those that result from inflation. We have also enhanced the incentives for recipients of social security payments to improve their own positions, and so become less dependent on the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's Budget provides for an increase in social security and welfare expenditure by the Department of Social Security from the $9,997m in 1981-82 to $11,471m. After allowing for the additional pay-day last year this is an effective increase of 18 per cent. This is a somewhat larger increase than we have seen in this area in recent years. A large part of the 1982-83 increase- some 75 per cent-is accounted for by the guaranteed indexation provisions I have already mentioned, increases in the estimated number of pensioners and beneficiaries the Department of Social Security will assist during the coming year, and other cost increases that are unavoidably built into the system. This Bill embodies most of the major initiatives, apart from some increases in overall funds available for certain subsidy programs that account for the remainder of this year's increase. I now turn to explaining the main initiatives contained in the Bill. A detailed explanatory memorandum has been circulated for the information of honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA>AGED OR DISABLED PERSONS HOMES ACT 1954</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 of this Bill amends the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to increase the rate of personal care subsidy for frail aged people. This subsidy helps organisations providing accommodation for elderly people to meet the cost of employing staff to provide additional services for frail aged residents, such as assistance with bathing or dressing, room cleaning, personal laundry, supervision of medicine, or for a staff member to be available at all times. At the end of June 1982 a total of 780 hostels were receiving the subsidy, helping to meet the cost of additional services for approximately 21,700 frail aged residents. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill increases the subsidy from $80 to $120 for each eligible person for a four-week period-or from $20 to $30 a week-with effect from 6 July 1982. This rise represents an increase of 100 per cent in the subsidy since October 1980, when the rate was last increased-from $15 to $20 a week-and will help to ensure that a high standard of care continues to be provided for our frail aged citizens. The estimated expenditure on this subsidy for 1982-83 is $35m-an increase of 57 per cent over last year's outlay. </PARA>
<PARA>DELIVERED MEALS SUBSIDY ACT</PARA>
<PARA> The subsidy for meals-on-wheels services is increased by an amendment to the Delivered Meals Subsidy Act 1970. Clause 22 of the Bill will increase the subsidy available from October 1982 from 45c to 55c for a meal where a vitamin C supplement-in the form of fresh fruit or fruit juice-is provided, and from 40c to 50c for other meals. This is an increase of 22 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. At the end of June 1982, 738 organisations were receiving a Commonwealth subsidy for the provision of meals-on-wheels and some 9,650,000 meals were delivered in 1981-82. This compares with 8,947,000 meals delivered in 1980-81. Since the Commonwealth began providing subsidies for meals-on-wheels in 1970 it has spent nearly $23m on this important form of help for elderly people at home, and our increased assistance this year demonstrates the value we place on the effective operation of meals-on-wheels services. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY ACT 1947</PARA>
<PARA> The other main Budget initiatives requiring legislation all involve amendments to the Social Security Act 1947 and are dealt with by Part VI of this Bill. These amendments make a number of important adjustments to the system of social security pensions and benefits, and family allowances. They also introduce several significant new initiatives in the social security field. I propose to deal with these measures as they affect the major client groups of the Department of Social Security, rather than following the strict sequence of clauses in this part of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>INITIATIVES FOR THE UNEMPLOYED</PARA>
<PARA> The single rate of unemployment benefit for people aged 18 years and over who have no dependants will be increased by $6.30 a week, bringing that rate to $64. 40 a week-clause 77. This rate will be equal to half the married rate of unemployment benefit, taking into account the automatic CPI-linked increases that will come into effect in November, which will increase the standard rates of benefit to $77.25 for a single person over 18 years with dependants and $128. 80 for a married couple. The rate of benefit for single unemployed people and sickness beneficiaries aged 16 years and 17 years will also be increased by $4, giving them a total of $40 a week. The new rates will take effect from each individual's first pay-day in November 1982-clause 105. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, to encourage unemployed people to take advantage of opportunities to earn extra income and gain job experience by casual work, they will be allowed to earn more without losing their entitlement to benefit. The more generous income test that will apply from November 1982 is given effect by clause 83 of this Bill. It will mean that everyone who receives unemployment or sickness benefit will be able to have $10 a week of private income without affecting their rate of benefit at all. The amount currently allowed is $3 a week for single people under 18 years and $6 for everyone else. At the same time the partial taper introduced by the Government in 1980 will be extended so that beneficiaries who have more than $10 a week private income will retain 50c a week for every dollar of extra income up to an income limit of $60. The effect of this is that the maximum rate of benefit will be reduced by only half the amount of income the person has between $10 and $60. This will represent a substantial increase in the amount that can be earned before benefit is reduced by a full $1 for every $1 of income. At present the upper limit is only $40 for single people under 18 years and $50 for others. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr WILSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch I explained to the House that the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1982 will amend the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act to increase the rate of personal care subsidy for frail, aged people from $20 a week to $30 a week. It will amend the Delivered Meals Subsidy Act to increase the subsidy paid to meals-on-wheels services from 45c to 55c a meal with a vitamin C supplement and from 40c to 50c for other meals. It will also amend the Social Security Act to increase the single rate of unemployment benefit for people over 18 to an amount equal to half the married rate of unemployment benefit that will apply from November this year. It will increase the rate of benefit for single unemployed and sickness beneficiaries under 18 years of age by $4 a week. I also stated that a more generous income test designed to encourage unemployed people to take advantage of opportunities to earn extra income will apply from November 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>PENSIONERS</PARA>
<PARA> Most pensioners will benefit from the automatic CPI-linked increases in the rates of pension that will come into effect in November and will increase the single rate of pension by $3.10 to $77.25 a week and the married rate by $5.20 to $128.80 a week. In addition the Government has recognised that many pensioners who have a small amount of income apart from their pension have been hard hit by inflation, and that some adjustment in the amounts of private income pensioners can have without affecting their entitlement to a full pension should now be made. From November 1982, single pensioners will be able to have $30 a week of private income and couples $50 a week before their pension is affected. This change is embodied in clause 36 of the Bill for age and invalid pensions. It will also apply to widow pensioners and supporting parent beneficiaries. This is the first adjustment in these income limits for several years and will increase them from their current levels of $20 a week for single people and $34. 50 for couples. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of these changes will be that some 430,700 pensioners with private incomes above the existing free areas will receive higher pensions. About 70 per cent of these will receive an increase of $5 a week if they are single or $7.75 a week for a married couple. Some 16,000 people who are not now entitled to a pension will become eligible for a small part pension of up to $5 a week. This initiative will result in an increase in the disposable incomes of these pensioners, who will be further assisted in this regard by the new pensioner tax rebate scheme which is being introduced to protect pensioners with a modest income from being taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 59 of the Bill increases the income limit for pensioner health benefits. These benefits are available to social security pensioners, including supporting parent beneficiaries, and to sickness beneficiaries, and repatriation service pensioners. We are proposing to increase the limits for these benefits, which were last adjusted in 1979, because we are concerned that a number of pensioners may have lost entitlement to fringe benefits because their private incomes have risen above the existing limits through no action of their own. We are also concerned that some pensioners may be placing themselves at a disadvantage by arranging their financial affairs so as to keep their incomes below the current limits to qualify for a card. The increase in the income limits should help people in both these categories, and should encourage pensioners to enjoy the full advantage of any private assets they may have. </PARA>
<PARA> People who qualify for pensioner health benefit cards are entitled to a range of Commonwealth concessions, the most important being free medical and hospital treatment, free pharmaceutical and telephone rental concessions. The income limits at which entitlement to pensioner health benefits ceases will rise from November 1982 to $54 a week for a single person and $90 a week for a married couple, compared with the current limits of $40 and $68. A new uniform limit of $20 for each dependent child in a family on top of the base limits is also to apply. The additional income limits for children currently vary between $11 and $17 a week. The effect of the changes will be that the new limit for a single person with one dependent child will be $74 a week, and for a couple with one child $110 a week. For each extra child the limit will rise uniformly by $20 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 59 also provides that the higher limits will apply to eligibility for pensioner funeral benefits. People who receive sheltered employment allowance have special income limits for pensioner fringe benefits. For a married couple with no children, this will be increased to $90 a week, the same as for other married pensioner couples. For single people receiving sheltered employment allowance, the limit will remain at its current level of $68 a week, still $14 higher than for other pensioners and beneficiaries. However, the increase to $20 a week in the additional limit for each child will apply to both these groups. In addition to these measures, the supplementary assistance or allowance payable to pensioners and beneficiaries who pay private rent is increased by clauses 39, 50 and 80 of the Bill. Supplementary assistance or allowance is available for pensioners, supporting parent beneficiaries, and long term sickness beneficiaries-that is, those of six or more weeks standing-who have little or no income apart from the pension or benefit and pay private rent or board and lodging. Last year the maximum rate or payment was increased by $5 to $8 a week. This year it will be further increased by $2 to $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 89 of the Bill increases the incentive allowance paid to recipients of sheltered employment allowance in lieu of supplementary assistance to the same level of $10 a week. For these people the allowance is free of any income test and does not take into account whether rent is paid or not. As I said at the beginning of this statement, pensioners who rent private housing are recognised by the Government as having a particular need for assistance-hence our further effort to help them in this year's Budget. This new increase will particularly benefit pensioners with less than $16 a week in private income who pay more than $26 a week in rent. Some State housing authorities also pay rental subsidies to private tenants. To recognise these State initiatives in the housing area and to ensure that private tenants receive the full benefit of them, clauses 29 and 74 of this Bill exempt such rent subsidies from counting as income for the pension and benefit income tests. This exemption will apply, to give one example, to people receiving rent relief subsidised under the Commonwealth's Mortgage and Rent Relief Scheme through State and Territory Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> A further small but important change is made by clause 47 of the Bill. From November 1982 women living overseas who qualify for a wife's pension may, when their husbands die, qualify for a widow's pension without having to return to Australia. The position of women in these circumstances has been of concern for some time and has been raised on a number of occasions by the Opposition spokesman on welfare matters, Senator Grimes. I am pleased that we have been able to take steps to resolve this problem in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>DISABLED PEOPLE</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill reflects the special needs of disabled people in several ways apart from the increases in general income limits for pensions and income limits for pensioner health benefits that I have already referred to. In particular it introduces a series of measures that will be of special assistance to disabled people who are in the work force or who want to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 90 of the Bill adds a new Part to the Social Security Act 1947, establishing a 'mobility allowance' of $10 a week for severely handicapped people who are in employment or undertaking vocational training, and who are unable to use public transport because of their disability. This benefit, which will be available from April 1983, will cost an estimated $18m in a full year. It will be free of any income test or income tax. The benefit will not be available to those receiving the benefit of sales tax exemptions on new motor vehicles, or who receive the benefit of a car under the repatriation gift car scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been designed specifically to recognise the additional travel costs incurred by disabled people who undertake employment or vocational training and the fact that such people are often unable to take advantage of the sales tax exemptions on new motor vehicles. The scheme also recognises that participation in the work force by such people is often precarious, by providing a three month period of grace during which they will continue to receive the allowance even though they have lost their employment or ceased training. The Government has decided to introduce such a scheme as quickly as possible to meet pressing needs in this area, but it will be kept under close review to make sure it is effective in its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> From 10 March 1983 a new form of income maintenance payment will be introduced for people who undertake a Commonwealth rehabiltation program and who otherwise would be eligible for another social security pension or benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The new rehabilitation allowance established by clauses 97 and 98 of the Bill will be at the same rates as the person's social security pension or benefit, unless he is receiving a sickness, unemployment or special benefit which is less than the invalid pension rate. In that case, the person will be treated as an invalid pensioner in setting the rate of the rehabilitation allowance. The rehabilitation allowance will be provided under the same conditions as invalid pension-that is, income tested, but income tax free-and will attract the same fringe benefits. It may be paid during the rehabilitation program and for up to six months afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA> The current rehabilitation training allowance will be restructured to reflect this initiative, requiring consequential amendments to the Compensation ( Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 and the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965. The training allowance will be paid as an additional benefit to people undertaking rehabilitation training who receive the rehabilitation allowance. It is expected that some 4,500 people out of the 6,000 accepted annually by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service will be eligible for rehabilitation allowance, which will involve a net cost of about $1m in a full year. It is obvious that single or young unemployment beneficiaries and young sickness beneficiaries undertaking rehabilitation programs will be particularly assisted by this benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also a number of measures in the Bill designed to remove the anomalies previously existing in the treatment of handicapped people attending different categories of special therapy and training services. For example, the incentive allowance paid to people in sheltered employment, which I have already mentioned, will be increased from $8 to $10 from November and will also be extended, by clause 33, to invalid pensioners undertaking activity therapy and adult training programs in centres financed under the Handicapped Persons Welfare Program. This allowance will be paid under the same terms as to recipients of sheltered employment allowance. Further, to improve the incentives for invalid pensioners to participate in activity therapy and adult training centres, the higher income limit of $68 a week for fringe benefits that applies to single sheltered employment allowees will also apply, from November 1982, to single invalid pensioners participating in the programs of such centres-clause 60. </PARA>
<PARA>FAMILIES</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the very important measures contained in this Bill for the assistance of families. Our initiatives in this area have been designed bearing in mind the extra costs that all parents undertake in bringing up children and the particular difficulties faced in this area by families with low incomes. To help in meeting these extra costs, clause 65 of the Bill will increase the rate of family allowance by 50 per cent for the first and second children in a family from the endowment period commencing in October 1982. This will bring family allowance for the first child to $22.80 a month and for the second child to $32. 55 a month. The increase, which is one plank of the Government's general tax relief measures in the 1982-83 Budget, will cost some $375m in a full year and will consolidate the increases for third and subsequent children introduced in last year's Budget. While it will be of particular benefit to the 1.6 million families in Australia who have one or two children all 2.1 million families with children will gain. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this general assistance for families, the Bill will introduce, from 1 May 1983, a tax-free family income supplement for low income families, apart from pensioners and beneficiaries, of up to $10 a week for each dependent child who does not already attract an education allowance or similar payment. This not only reflects our recognition of the particular cost burden borne by low income families who are bringing up children but also helps to alleviate the unfair and clearly undesirable situation in which an unemployment beneficiary can be better off financially than a person in similar family circumstances who is in employment but earning low wages. Clause 62 of this Bill inserts a new Part V in the Social Security Act 1947 setting out the conditions under which this benefit will be payable. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, the main features are:</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme will be closely aligned with the disadvantaged persons health scheme for low income earners. The maximum rate of allowance of $10 per week for each eligible child is equal to the additional pension or benefit paid for the child of a pensioner or beneficiary. The allowance will be income tested on the joint income of parents and will be paid to the main breadwinner. People with an income less than the amount of the threshold will be eligible for the maximum rate of allowance for each child. The threshold is the amount of income which a married couple with no children may have before they cease to be eligible for a health care card. If the scheme were operating from November, the threshold would be $184 a week; but, because the threshold will increase as a result of consumer price index-linked increases in the benefit rate which affects the eligibility level for health care cards, it will be higher when the scheme comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> In determining eligibility, the maximum rate of assistance will be reduced by half of any income in excess of the threshold. To illustrate how benefit will be calculated, using the November threshold of $184, a family with three children and income of $200 per week would be eligible for a maximum payment of $30 less half the difference between its income, $200, and the threshold, $184. That family would therefore receive a payment of $22 a week. Entitlement will generally be determined for a six month period. Like the disadvantaged persons health scheme there will generally be no decrease in the rate of payment throughout that period if income during any four week period is less than 25 per cent higher than the income on which the original assessment is made. Entitlement will be redetermined at the end of the six month period on the basis of the basic threshold. Of course, a person may seek an increase at any time if his income falls. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation allows a three month period of grace in which claims for the supplement can be made. Thus, if a person is initially unaware of the availability of the new benefit, he may get full payment from the date of its introduction provided that he claims by 1 August 1983. Because the family income supplement is a completely new benefit aimed at assisting low income families who are mainly in employment, the Government will monitor it closely to ensue that it meets its objective of relieving hardships among low income families who are not pensioners or beneficiaries. Families with a severely handicapped child who is cared for at home will also be assisted by an increase in handicapped child's allowance of $12 a month to $85 a month from November 1982-Clause 72. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we have taken the opportunity to remove two unintended anomalies in the treatment of sole parent pensioners and beneficiaries. Currently where a widow pensioner receives maintenance of more than $6 a week for a child the excess is treated as the pensioner's own income for income test purposes. While it is clear that the same principle should apply to supporting parent beneficiaries, there is doubt that the legislation as drafted achieves this intention. The amendment contained in Clause 54 of this Bill will clarify this situation and ensures that maintenance payments received by all sole parent pensioners and beneficiaries will be treated in a consistent manner. This provision will take effect from February 1983. The other anomaly relates to the payment of supporting parents benefit to some individuals who are themselves counted as dependants of another person for the purpose of the payment of a pension, benefit or allowance. From November 1982, it will no longer be possible for a supporting parent beneficiary to count as a dependant in this way-Clause 27. However, there is a savings provision which exempts existing recipients of pensions, benefits and allowances from the effect of this change. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill provides for important new developments in our social security and welfare programs and gives help in direct and realistic ways to those groups in the community whom we recognise as being in particular need of assistance, including disabled people, aged people and families with low incomes. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the Government no longer possesses the confidence of the House and the people of Australia because of its culpable negligence in failing to collect tax revenue, thereby increasing the burden on the community, and because of its failure to prosecute the persons it knew to be conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth'. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion will be seconded. We have only a very short time in which to debate this matter. It arises because the Senate by a resolution required the Government to table some 22 documents. The Government belatedly attempted to answer that request yesterday by tabling eight of those documents and a whole lot of other documents which do not appear to have any continuity of purpose. The documents are in a massive tome of 500 pages. They are in what is called chronological order. The only difficulty about this chronological approach, of course, is that there is nothing to show what happened in between the actions shown in each document in that tome. For example, we know nothing of the verbal replies by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). We know nothing of the conversations that took place between the Minister and his Department. We know nothing of what transpired between the Ministers when they were in Cabinet. In other words there is no memo, no letter or no communication from the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) as to what was proposed to deal with straw companies and the massive evasion of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> There could be no more important matter in Australia at present than the failure of a government to carry out its responsibilities. In accordance with good administration, Ministers are supposed to be able to understand what their departments are doing. Certainly the Treasurer should be able to guarantee that all tax due and payable is duly collected. The Prime Minister has a responsibility to guarantee that the Cabinet functions efficiently and effectively. When there is crime, when there is fraud, the Government should certainly apply the law. </PARA>

<PARA> In the few moments available to me, let me make this point: A few of the documents certainly indicated again the complete disarray of this Government as shown in its inability to understand its obligations in terms of implementing the law. There has been massive tax evasion. The Government knew of it. As the Government had cognisance of that and did nothing about it, it must have had some close association with the people who got the benefit. That is the great indictment from what has happened. We are dealing, in my view, with billions of dollars. There has been a massive increase in indirect taxation to make up for the amount that has not been collected in company taxation. I made the point the other day, in another debate, that from the fuel tax alone-that is an indirect tax-the amount collected was $13.3 billion. In my view there was no need for that when one looks at the evidence before us here today. The incredible aspect about these matters is that they have come to our notice not because the Government has introduced any legislation to protect itself or made any explanation to protect itself but because of other avenues of information. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the information in chronological order. Not the least of the information was contained in the McCabe-Lafranchi report, made under the provisions of the Companies Act, which was presented to the Victorian Parliament this year. If honourable members look at the volume of documents in front of them, they will see that there is a reference to the fact that the Victorians are going to do something about the matter. Why, in the name of fortune, would the Commonwealth Government have to leave it to a State government to do something about the matter? We can look at what McCabe and Lafranchi were able to say under the terms of their investigation. They say that, way back in the 1970s, a person known as Brian Maher established what is called a corporate consultancy and a dealership. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has come in here time and time again and said: 'I have a splendid record. I have passed a number of pieces of legislation that have prevented all this'. That is utter rubbish. What is the good of passing a log of legislation and not dealing with this matter of straw companies? The Treasurer, in an answer to a question today, got half smart because he is a lawyer and said that the questioner did not know what he was talking about when he talked about company stripping. The real issue would have been the matter of straw companies. That would have been the issue because it was mentioned in the same memo of the Commissioner of Taxation. I will quote it to honourable members later. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the honourable member to remain quiet for a change. The Government introduced amending legislation in 1978. What did McCabe and Lafranchi have to say about that? They said that that had no effect of curbing the sale of companies as a means of tax avoidance. In 1978 that was no new matter; it was an old matter. As the McCabe-Lafranchi report indicates, what was the point in passing all this legislation, including the tax avoidance legislation of 1980, if nothing was ever done about the crime?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the notice that the Government had of this matter and why all members of the Government must bear some responsibility. I will quickly come to the point. I acknowledge that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) raised the matter in 1977, and in doing so he was really referring to straw companies as well. He wanted something to be done. It is an indictment of the Prime Minister that since 1977 nothing has been effected. Why was there not a prosecution? That is the issue. Is it because Maher is protected? Is it because Maher still has not been investigated? Is it because Maher says to the tax investigators who go to see him: 'Why should I talk to you when I pay $50,000 a year to the Liberal Party?' Is that a criterion? I suggest that it should not be, but it shows up in the few papers which have been tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> I have before me a note from the Taxation Commissioner in February 1978 which talks about emerging practices whereby a company that has a tax liability is stripped of its funds so it is not in a position to meet its tax liability. The Government knew of that. When the Treasurer answered the question today he was not prepared to admit that the emergence of straw companies was really the issue in the questioner's mind. The Government had all this information about activities in the early 1970s. It is in the McCabe-Lafranchi report. The Government knew that the Taxation Office in Perth was not even prepared to give to the McCabe-Lafranchi inquiry Maher's letter in which he concocted the conspiracy. The guilt of the Taxation Office is enormous from the point of its failure to give the investigators the letter which clearly would have been exhibit one in any conspiracy trial. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what happened after that. I pick the issue that quickly comes to mind. We have an array of dossiers from the Taxation Office. One note from the Taxation Commissioner states:</PARA>
<PARA> I also mention we are becoming increasingly concerned about practices whereby companies that have a tax liability are stripped of assets so there is nothing left to meet tax assessments. There is no readily apparent solution to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>This is very surprising. One of the documents that the Senate asked to be tabled was the opinion of Brinsden, Q.C. We are not going to have that document tabled. The Government is not game to give it to us because the opinion was given to the Government in 1975-three years before-that it could certainly have launched prosecutions. Mr O'Reilly said that he was getting very worried, that the Government had to do something about penalties and that he thought the Government should talk about a minimum penalty or even gaol sentence. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> In making this suggestion I mention that my officers have been pressing the Crown Solicitor to investigate whether prosecution action could be taken under the Crimes Act or the Companies Act against people involved in two cases of ' straw company' evasion. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer is a lawyer. These matters were before the Cabinet and there are a number of lawyers in it. Certainly they would have had a chance to get some advice from the Solicitor-General. They never went to the Solicitor-General at any stage before this year. It was useless going to the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack), who made the stupid remark the he did not know that there was anything wrong and that he would not expect to do anything until he was told that something was wrong. Some officers of the Taxation Office knew that there was a lot wrong; the Crown Solicitor knew that there was a lot wrong; the Attorney-General said that he did not know; and the Solicitor-General was not asked. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to Cabinet submission No. 2290 of 6 June 1978. It was on the basis of that submission that there was going to be something done about these companies that stripped their assets. Why is it that this Government was not able to do anything until 1980 at the earliest when it had Cabinet submission No . 2290 of 6 June 1978 stating that something should be done? That is an indictment of the Government. We have been denied access to all the information. I refer now to a letter written on 7 November 1978 by Mr O'Reilly to his Treasurer asking him why there was a delay as the matter had been before Cabinet . He said that they were not getting anywhere, that there was no legislation. He said that he was concerned as millions of dollars in tax were being missed and suggested that something be done about it. He said that the draft had been in existence for a long time. We also have before us a note written by the worthy Treasurer, I assume, saying: 'I still have reservations. I can see problems. Can we get the Solicitor-General's advice?' It is a note on the bottom of a letter. I do not know whether it is the Treasurer's. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer did not get the Solicitor-General's advice because if he had he would have launched a prosecution. The Treasurer is a lawyer and knows what constitutes crime. How can he excuse himself for so many years? How can the Cabinet excuse itself? Perhaps the Treasurer was doing his best but was overcome by the other heavyweights in the Cabinet. That was made very clear the other day by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), who said that we really ought to be able to forgive the Treasurer now and again, saying that the Treasurer, against enormous difficulties, with pressure from vested interests, with pressure from within his own party and elsewhere, has seen his goal and gone straight for it. The Treasurer went for it via the Cape of Good Hope. He had no intention of getting to this issue. This is an indictment of this Government. I have not got time to deal with all of the issues; but one of the tabled papers, in referring to revenue implications, states how one promoter is known to have stripped over 1,150 companies in Victoria. These companies had tax liabilities in the year prior to the strip totalling $14m. The real indictment of the Treasurer is that he had the opinion of Mr Webb, Q.C., in 1978 but he denies that. Today in answer to a question he said that he knew nothing of it. In 1979 this Treasurer appointed Mr Webb to his Taxation Advisory Committee. Does he mean to say that he knew nothing about Mr Webb's opinion in 1978? Where did that come from? That opinion talks about proposed legislation. Mr Webb Q.C. is properly saying: 'Indict these people as criminals under the Crimes Act and you will get a conviction'. It was never done. We are looking at people in government who deliberately prevented the revenue being collected, who have shielded these corporate crooks for reasons we cannot understand-except for their party affiliations-and who have guaranteed that the rest of the Australian community has had to bear enormous increases in tax. They do not deserve to remain in government.</PARA></TALK.START>

Perhaps the greatest fallacy of his argument was demonstrated in the closing moments of his remarks when he said that just because I appointed a very reputable and worthy Melbourne Queen's Counsel by the name of Mr Arthur Webb to the Taxation Advisory Committee, it followed automatically that every legal opinion that Mr Webb had ever given should have been disclosed to me. Does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, himself a lawyer , know so little about his profession that he does not realise it would be a gross breach of professional ethics on the part of Mr Webb to have done that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the main thrust of the charge made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition against me and against the Government today. I take the opportunity of saying a few things about my stewardship of the Government's campaign against tax avoidance over the last four or five years. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has sought to denigrate the fact that the Government took two and a half years to get the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act developed. Does he not realise that that legislation was radically different from any legislation we had previously had in our tax law? Did he not realise that for the first time we were introducing major criminal penalties into our tax law? Does he really dismiss so lightly the concerns that we entertained about matters such as onus of proof? Had he been in my position, would he have blithely said: 'Yes, reverse the onus of proof; force the accused person to demonstrate against a criminal charge that that person is not guilty'? Are those the sorts of things that any responsible Treasurer in any government or any responsible Minister in any government should, in fact, ignore?</PARA>
<PARA> Even his colleague the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Evans, who has been leading the campaign on this issue, said, when this legislation was introduced into the Senate, that he welcomed it. But he said that it was unprecedented legislation to deal with an unprecedented problem and he believed it would be unprecedentedly successful. He said it was harsh legislation. He said that it was rough legislation. Even my colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis) during the second reading debate on the legislation in this place sought an assurance from me that innocent people would not be subject to criminal penalties. I remind the honourable gentleman and the House that even in December 1980-after this legislation had been subjected to very careful scrutiny -strong representations were made against it by responsible bodies in the community. Will Opposition members brand all of those bodies as allies of the tax evasion industry? Will they brand all of them as irresponsible and as crooks ? Will they say that the Law Council of Australia, which has as its vice- president at the present time a reputable member of the Australian Labor Party, was an ally of the tax avoidance industry? On 4 December that body in a telex to me said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Law Council of Australia wishes to express very grave concern at the implications of the above Bill . . . There is grave concern at the introduction of legislation which potentially has a much wider operation than the prevention of the practices outlined by the Treasurer in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA>That was on 4 December 1980 after a process of consideration and distillation through the Government-the delay and the humbug that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would criticise-yet the Law Council of Australia was moved to say that the Bill was being introduced in haste and would have potentially wider consequences. The Law Society of Tasmania said:</PARA>
<PARA> We protest strongly against the Crimes Taxation Offences Bill which threatens criminal proceedings against professional advisors . . . We request that you delay the passage of this Bill . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Law Society of New South Wales said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Society is deeply concerned at the haste with which a Bill of such wide reach is being introduced. The Bill as proposed goes beyond the defects sought to be remedied and may place in jeopardy the persons conducting genuine business transactions. </PARA>
<PARA>So even in December 1980 very responsible, unimpeachable bodies representing responsible opinion in this country were expressing concern about the legislation. That is a point of view that the honourable gentleman completely ignored in his remarks. Throughout the whole time that I handled the processing of this Bill the matter was handled in accordance with proper procedure; it was properly handled by me. The matter was referred to the Taxation Advisory Committee, a body which was established by the Government in December 1979 representing private legal and accounting practitioners. The establishment of that Committee had been warmly supported not only in the professions and throughout the Government, but also by the Opposition. The honourable member for Gellibrand on 4 April 1979 said this:</PARA>
<PARA> The measures proposed by the Treasurer in respect of setting up an advisory committee meet with our approval. It is true that the establishment of such a committee was recommended by the Asprey Taxation Review Committee . . . the establishment of an advisory committee-</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA>to assist the Treasurer in providing tax avoidance legislation which does not disrupt commercial transactions any more than is absolutely necessary is a sensible policy and we support it. </PARA>
<PARA>They are not my words. That is the honourable member for Gellibrand, Ralph Willis, the Opposition shadow Treasurer, saying that it is a good idea to have a Taxation Advisory Committee. We established that Committee in December 1979. Its main function was to vet upcoming taxation legislation to see that it did not have unintended consequences. It is therefore only natural, in accordance with the bipartisan approach to the Committee, that we should refer this legislation to the Committee early in 1980. As a consequence of referring this legislation to that Committee it entertained major reservations about it. It indicated that there was concern that there would be normal commercial transactions. Amongst other things, it expressed concern that innocent third parties would need to be protected, that there was a risk that the innocent might be convicted and that the onus of proof was being put upon the accused to an excessive extent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, two years later with all our combined and unilateral outrage it is easy to dismiss things like onus of proof and the rights of the accused and to say that those things are of no account. Yet they were of great account then and it will be a shameful day for Australian government if the onus of proof and criminal liability are thrust aside in the way in which the Opposition suggests that they should have been. I believe that it would be a very shameful day for this country if in fact that were to occur. I believe that if one examines the record, if one takes into account the nature of the legislation and if one looks at the matter objectively it can only fairly be concluded that the period involved was not one for which I or the Government can be indicted in the terms moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter goes beyond the circumstances of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act . This whole debate invites us to try to put the tax avoidance issue back into perspective. One would imagine from what has been said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that tax avoidance was discovered by McCabe and Lafranchi. One would imagine that the only tax avoidance scheme that I have had to grapple with , or that any taxation officer has had to grapple with, was the bottom-of-the- harbour tax avoidance scheme. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and no doubt other Opposition speakers will have some pleasure in reading from some of the documents that were tabled yesterday. Let me take them to a minute from the Commissioner of Taxation to me of October 1980 when the legislation was about to be introduced. Even in October 1980 the priorities of the Commissioner of Taxation placed work on a new section 260 ahead of work on straw companies and trusts. Even in October 1980 the Commissioner of Taxation was saying to me that getting a new section 260 was the most effective anti-avoidance measure that the Government could be taking-which, of course, was true. In a minute to me of 22 October 1980 he described work on the new section 260 as being 'the central anti -avoidance project'. That was in October 1980. Mr O'Reilly wrote to me saying that even then the central anti-avoidance project was the work on section 260. Those who might seek to use other words of the Commissioner from amongst the documents I tabled yesterday should ponder the significance of that statement contained in the Commissioner's minute to me of 22 October. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the most shameful things about this debate is the way in which the Leader of the Opposition has sought to convey the impression that $10,000m to $15,000m has been lost through the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. I put the Leader of the Opposition and any honourable member opposite to the proof of that proposition. The latest estimates of the Commissioner of Taxation concerning these schemes are of the order of $400m to $500m. It is a very large sum of money. It will be the subject of the recovery legislation that will be introduced. Even in late 1979 the best and most finite revenue estimate that the Commissioner of Taxation could give me in respect of these schemes involved a figure of $40m to $50m. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the House that I believe that the introduction of the new Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the new general anti-avoidance provision which replaces the emasculated section 260, is far and away the most important legislative achievement of this Government in the tax avoidance area. If the Opposition does not accept my remarks on that, let it look at its own policy statement of 1980 issued by Senator Evans and the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) in which they said that one of the most important things that could be done would be the writing of a general anti-avoidance section. That was successfully achieved in May 1981 and it represents, in my view, the Government's most successful legislative exercise in the anti-avoidance area during the whole time it has been in office. I can remember saying on an earlier occasion that attitudes towards tax avoidance have changed over time. One has to go back, as I did this morning, to 1978 when the Leader of the Opposition was having his doubts as to whether to support our amending legislation striking down the Curran schemes. Unless he was misquoted on four occasions by the Press of this country, at that time he had his reservations. If one goes back through the newspaper columns of the time, if one looks at the shift in editorial opinion, one finds that there has been a change of attitude. In August 1981 the Sydney Morning Herald stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It has only been in relatively recent times that public opinion has hardened against tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>It stated further that some regard could be paid to the role of the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . who played a leading role in persuading the public that tax avoidance was not something worthy of grudging admiration. </PARA>
<PARA>That particular remark was not a Liberal Party public relations handout. That newspaper in 1978, when I introduced the Curran amendments, criticised the Government very trenchantly regarding the application or starting date of those Curran amendments. It was a good example of the way in which public opinion had changed over time. I believe that this Government has played a major role in bringing about a change of public opinion on tax avoidance and tax evasion matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking forward on this subject, I think that there are a number of things that all of us can learn from this debate about tax avoidance. I think that the first thing that we can learn is that whatever the strict letter of the law may be, a number of people in our community have gone into tax avoidance arrangements out of greed and out of the desire to increase very large incomes. Secondly, the excessively literalist approach of the High Court of Australia during the 1970s contributed to the growth of tax avoidance. I believe the complicated nature of the Income Tax Assessment Act, with a plethora of concessions, has also played a significant role. I also believe that the commercially unreal approach of the Labor Party to many normal family and commercial arrangements has fostered a hostility to those arrangements which is not justified by the circumstances. The final lie that I wish to nail completely is the proposition that in some way the Liberal Party is the supporter or the friend of the tax avoidance industry. Never in the whole time that I have been Treasurer in this country has any legislation in this area been held up. Never has action not been taken by me because of a concern about the impact of that legislation on members of my party . I nail that for the complete and utter distortion of the truth that it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to observe the different reactions of Ministers in this Government when they are in trouble. Minister Sinclair said that it was not him, Minister Nixon said that it was all lies, Minister Newman said that he did not hear anyway and Minister Howard says that he is sorry. Well, just being sorry will not wash. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) could possibly sustain a defence only if we accept that he was entitled to disregard the continual and increasingly urgent advice of the Commissioner of Taxation and if we accept that there was absolutely nothing else he could do except to proceed along this tortured path of trying to find criminal penalties to knock out the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. I do not accept that either of those two propositions are true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the first instance we know that at least as early as the middle of 1977 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the then Treasurer were aware of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes or at least their predecessors. In February 1978 the Treasurer was advised by the Commissioner of Taxation of the emergence of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and the serious threat that existed. Indeed, he was given a remedy for dealing with them-a remedy on which we have had to wait four and a half years for the Government to legislate. Still it has not brought in the Bill. I refer to the remedy of making directors and shareholders liable for the unpaid tax. In May 1978 the Commissioner of Taxation told the Treasurer of widespread tax evasion and the need for severe legislation. He was told that prosecutions could have been launched and may have succeeded under the existing law. In June 1978 he said that the 'matter is even more serious'. He said that there were criminal activities involving 900 companies in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1978 he said that it was even more extensive than he was previously aware. Later in July he said that 130 companies had been dropped down the drain in two weeks. He said that there was therefore a most pressing need for action. It was only at this point that the Government-reluctantly-was prodded into any action at all. The matter was shoved off to a couple of departments for their consideration. In December 1978 the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, was asked for his view. In February 1979 an increasingly frustrated Commissioner of Taxation said that these schemes 'continue to flourish'. He said: 'The matter is taking on more urgency'. He reported that one tax dodger's newsletter had now described the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme as the ultimate tax avoidance scheme. In February 1979 even Wal Fife, the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, was gripped with the urgency of taking some action. God knows, if Wal Fife is gripped with anything it must be serious indeed! By July 1979-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will, Mr Speaker. By July 1979, that is a year after the matter was first taken to Cabinet, even the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, had accepted the need for action. But by November 1979 nothing had happened, and the poor old Commissioner of Taxation, who by then was nearly berserk with frustration, had to write to the Treasurer saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These activities are criminal in nature and fraudulent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> This activity is occurring on a large scale, daily . . . I am having to write off large amounts of assessed income tax because companies have been stripped of assets. </PARA>
<PARA>He mentioned that over 1,150 companies in Victoria with tax liabilities of $14m were being stripped. Mostly importantly, in the ultimate paragraph of his letter , he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Unless something effective is done along the lines proposed, we may almost as well not bother with anti-avoidance legislation. I say that advisedly. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in November of 1979. What could the Treasurer have done when faced with the urgency-the accepted urgency-of the Prime Minister in 1977 and his own accepted urgency at various times through this matter? In the first instance the Treasurer could have launched proceedings under the existing law. The Commissioner of Taxation, in May 1978, had said that prosecutions under the existing law may be possible. Surely it was worth a try. Even if they had not succeeded, at least these tax dodgers would have been on notice that the matter was to be taken before the courts and they would have thought twice about entering into these schemes at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The next thing that the Treasurer could have done was to announce his revulsion about these schemes and his intention to legislate to wipe them out. The Treasurer said that he could not do that; he could not put the tax dodgers on notice that he was going to change the criminal law because he could not then back-date that criminal law. He said that if they were given that notice it would be an invitation to get up to their necks in these sorts of schemes in advance of the date of assent of that sort of criminal law. That is what he said -or that is what the Commissioner of Taxation says he said. The point is that he could have announced it because, in any event, things could not possibly have got any worse; people were getting into these schemes at an accelerating pace. Even if the Treasurer had put them on notice it is unimaginable that they could have got into these schemes any more rapidly than they already were. </PARA>
<PARA> But the most effective action that the Minister could have taken, and refused for years to take, was to announce that he intended to recoup the money that was being defrauded under this scheme. That was retrospectivity which the Government had already embraced; it was retrospectivity on which it could have embarked. That would have put all these tax dodgers on notice that, even if they were not guilty of criminal offences, they certainly would not have been able to hang on to the tax they obtained in this fraudulent manner. That is what the Commissioner of Taxation meant when he said that unless the Government was prepared to act on this matter it might as well give up the fight against tax avoidance. It is a necessary ingredient of the government's strategy of knocking out tax avoidance schemes case by case that it acts early and puts people on notice by announcing that it will act against these schemes. If the Government does not act early, by the time it makes the announcement it will be too late. That is exactly what the Commissioner of Taxation meant when he said: 'Unless you act against the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes you can tear up all your intentions about stopping tax avoidance anywhere'. These three clear possible actions existed for the Treasurer to take, but what was the Government doing during all this sorry, tragic time? It is significant that the first time this matter was taken before the Cabinet, the Cabinet was meeting in Perth. I dare say it took a few submissions from Horgan, Mitchell and Corser to see what their views were about how to wipe out tax avoidance. In any event whether it took those submissions or not, it is no wonder that, having met in Perth, the Cabinet members decided to defer any consideration of this matter. I wonder, by the way, what the Cabinet got up to in terms of its entertainment that night. Maybe the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) had one of his officers arrange for the Cabinet to tour some of the red light districts of Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> But the urgency of which the Prime Minister says he was possessed was certainly not evident during any of this time. The urgency of which the Commissioner of Taxation was possessed was certainly not mirrored in any of the action which was taken by the Government. For 18 months the matter was pushed from Minister to Minister and from department to department. The Treasurer said he had to deal with difficult questions such as that of the onus of proof. I remind the Treasurer that he settled the question of the onus of proof in July 1979. That ceased to be a reason for delay, a contentious matter or an unresolved issue, and yet another 18 months passed before the legislation finally hit the deck. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation ran into its first obstacle when it went to the back bench committee. We can see the members of that committee squirming around the place now displaying their abhorrence for tax dodging, but at that time many of them thought-indeed many of them still do-that it was just terrific and that governments should not take action to clamp down on the illegal activities of their financial backers in the business community. The back benchers' committee brought this matter to a screaming halt. So the Treasurer then had to dream up some new elaborate delaying device. That is when he thought of the Taxation Advisory Committee. He did not have one at that time so he had to set one up. It is true that we welcomed the establishment of that Committee but we now know the qualifications which the Treasurer was looking for when he decided to choose people who could advise him on these important matters. Just the other day he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that the authority of people to speak on this subject--</PARA>
<PARA>he was talking about tax avoidance-</PARA>
<PARA>had something to do with their practical knowledge and understanding of what has gone on in the tax avoidance industry. </PARA>
<PARA>From that we are to assume that the people chosen for the Tax Advisory Committee were those who could give him expert advice based on their personal and practical knowledge of what was going on in the tax avoidance industry. Perhaps the sort of people that the Treasurer appointed were those on which the Prime Minister decided. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I think those high priced lawyers and accountants who have devised and promoted tax avoidance schemes do more damage to the basis of this society than a thousand Gallaghers in this world, or a thousand Builders' Labourers Federations--</PARA>
<PARA>Are they the sort of people whom the Government appoints to provide it with expert advice? In any event, it is interesting to note that the postal address for the Taxation Advisory Committee is care of Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. That may well be a branch office of some or the other tax avoidance empire. Indeed, Mr Webb's involvement with this Committee is important because the Treasurer said today that Mr Webb was providing advice to tax dodgers. In fact he was telling those tax dodgers that it might be possible for them to be prosecuted under existing law. It is intriguing indeed why Mr Webb did not convey that important piece of information to the Treasurer after his appointment to this exalted position. </PARA>
<PARA> By now there had been years of delay. Behind the tortured facade of concern by the Treasurer we find sophisticated procrastination. He had been told time and again that his weaponry against tax dodging was fatally restricted, and yet all this abbreviated warrior could do was shuffle paper and dream up new reasons for delay. It is only now that we discover the reason for the Treasurer moving his Parliament House office so close to the Parliament House post office. I thought it was for the view, but I now realise that his staff were getting hernias dragging all the fruitless correspondence to the letter box. He did everything except the one thing which was really necessary, and that was to bring legislation into this place. Meanwhile, bottom-of-the-harbour schemes flourished . The Treasurer was to tax avoidance as Nero was to pyromania; he was standing back and gleefully observing what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not say that the Treasurer alone was to blame; we are censuring the whole Government. Durack, the Attorney-General, also is admittedly involved in this. He administered a department which failed to prosecute clear cases way back in 1976 and since. When the Cabinet submission got to him for consideration he managed to bail it up for eight expensive months. Then of course there is Minister Fife. He was, I must confess, convinced about the urgency of the matter , but what did he do about it? Dear old W. C. Fife, with those exquisitely expressive initials in his name, had become known as the Minister for misfortune . He is the Minister who had to defend Harvey Bates and the Narcotics Bureau about two weeks before the Bureau was wound up because of its total incompetence . Last year he went around Australia as Minister for Education like some maniacal iconoclast opening buildings so that he could then close the institutions who owned these buildings. Now he is Minister for Aviation and it is no wonder that Australians are losing their enthusiasm for air transport. He is the Minister for misfortune and disasters. All that the Attorney-General could do during this whole period when he was centrally involved in the delay was to blame the Commissioner of Taxation. If these documents prove one thing, it is that the Commissioner of Taxation was the only person in the Government who not only was possessed with the importance of taking action but also was proposing realistic action time and time again. The great pity was that the Attorney-General and his Department were doing nothing about it and the Ministers in the Cabinet who represented those departments were doing nothing as well. </PARA>
<PARA> During this whole period of hiatus, during this important few years when the Government was doing nothing, pondering the various difficulties of the legislation that it finally brought into this House in 1980, the number of companies involved in this scheme was escalating enormously. The number grew from 500 in 1977 to 1,412 by 1980. Had the Minister acted in any of the three ways which I have proposed, very few, if any, of those companies would have gone to the bottom of the harbour and the hundreds of millions of dollars of tax might have been claimed by the Treasury to which it rightly belongs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Notwithstanding the speech made by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), the Opposition presents this censure motion moved in the form of an amendment by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) as a serious motion involving grave allegations which require a critical and an analytical response. After carefully examining all the documents tabled in this House yesterday evening by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and after listening to the arguments advanced to date in this debate by the Opposition, I have to say that the motion stands condemned for intellectual dishonesty as does the Opposition for bringing into this Parliament a motion which has no substance to back it and no merit whatsoever, legal or moral, upon which any fair minded and right thinking person could make a finding of guilt either against the Treasurer of against this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Paradoxically, this motion has been brought into this House and, although it does not name him, it is specifically directed against the present Treasurer who has demonstrably done more to tackle the cancer of tax evasion and malpractice than any other Treasurer since Federation. The censure motion is intellectually dishonest and, therefore, unjust. It is based on innuendo, exaggeration and smear. The motion is gravely unjust in that it is non-specific. It imputes by innuendo culpable negligence, yet it does not dare to provide the particulars.

<PARA> We do not live in the Soviet Union. This is Australia. It is not Russia. The Australian Labor Party does this Parliament a great disservice and it does this Treasurer a grave injustice in today pursuing the tactics which, to its discredit, it has resorted to over and over again during the past few weeks. The people of Australia who are the ultimate jury in this matter will deal harshly with those who falsely allege and maliciously pursue such a flimsy case so lacking in substance and merit. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the charges against the Government and the Treasurer? Last night, outside this House, we heard the incredible allegation of a 'cover up'. The truth, as I will prove, is the absolute reverse. Rather than cover up, this Government has displayed more openness and frank disclosure than any government since Federation, not just over the past few weeks but over the past 7 1/2 years . By legislative reform, this Government has enabled the citizens of Australia to gain more access to the workings of government than ever before. We are an open government and we are seen to be so by the overwhelming majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday's tabling of documents by the Treasurer in this Parliament represents an historic first. Without being forced by any law presently existing or about to come into force-namely, the freedom of information legislation-this Government and this Treasurer have tabled in this Parliament every single document requested in Senator Evans's motion save only those in respect of which the second law officer of the Commonwealth, the Solicitor-General, has certified that it would be contrary to the public interest and specifically the administration of justice. Does not the Opposition have even the slightest understanding of these words, in particular the words 'the administration of justice'? Where is the cover up? Over 80 documents extending back over five years and contained in a book the size of a major city telephone directory of 443 pages do not look like a cover up to me. Indeed, it is a very antithesis of a cover up. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's false allegation of a cover up can only relate to the documents which have not been tabled and, in so doing, the Opposition impugns the integrity of the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Sir Maurice Byers, Q.C., appointed by the Whitlam Government, a distinguished lawyer who has enjoyed the unqualified confidence and support of governments of all political persuasions, a statutory office holder and a man against whom not one word of personal criticism has been uttered in this Parliament since the day he took office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's tactics are disgraceful and shameful and will be seen to be so . By innuendo and implication, not by a direct and specific charge, the Opposition is effectively challenging the Solicitor-General's advice, his considered opinion, his certificate and his integrity. In public presentation, the Opposition attacks this Government but, in truth, its baseless allegations on the question of a cover up constitute a sordid attack on Sir Maurice Byers. If the Opposition is not attacking the Solicitor-General, on what basis does it allege that there has been a cover up?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government and this Treasurer have produced in this Parliament everything that it is proper to produce on the best legal advice in the land without seriously endangering the administration of justice and without prejudicing proceedings-both criminal and civil-which are in train. So much for the baseless allegation of cover up, unless the Opposition is now prepared to reveal itself in its true colours and publicly to challenge the clear and explicit advice of the Solicitor-General. In any event, how anybody could allege a cover up in the face of over 80 documents tabled-over 40 of them being communications between the Commissioner of Taxation and the Treasurer-is absolutely beyond me. The Treasurer has provided in this Parliament just about everything except the private telephone numbers of members of his staff. Yet the Opposition has the audacity to allege within this Parliament and outside that the Treasurer is guilty of a cover up. If truth and credibility were measured in snow flakes, the Labor Party would just about dead heat with the Simpson Desert. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the charge of delay-a false, untrue and unjust charge against an honourable Treasurer of this country. In a very detailed analysis, my colleague the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), who will follow me in this debate will outline in detail the chronology of this matter and prove beyond all reasonable doubt that if there was a delay-which is denied-it certainly was not at the instance of, nor in any way caused or contributed to, by the actions of the Treasurer. On this matter the people of Australia should know that a careful analysis proves beyond any doubt that the Treasurer's hands are clean. In many cases he acted within hours, as the record shows. I instance some specific examples: Firstly, on 2 June 1978, the Treasurer received a very detailed draft Cabinet submission. Within 96 hours, that Cabinet submission was settled and it was lodged. Was this delay? Was this procrastination? Did this prove culpability ? Secondly, on 20 December 1978, just five days before Christmas, with all that that entails in terms of pressure and activity, the Treasurer saw, settled and despatched a very detailed letter which has been tabled to the Attorney-General within four hours. Does this prove procrastination? Does this prove delay? Does this prove culpability? Thirdly, on 31 July-within a mere 12 hours-the Treasurer approved a detailed revised draft of a very detailed Cabinet submission on the very complex reverse onus provision and lodged it with the Cabinet office on that very same day. I ask the Parliament and the people of Australia: Was this delay? Was this procrastination? Does this prove culpability? The Opposition's case against the Treasurer on the ground of delay is in tatters and the Opposition knows it. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Opposition's grave allegations that billions of dollars have been permanently lost to the revenue and that the people of Australia have, as the Opposition says, been ripped-off to the tune of up to $15 billion. These allegations, unsubstantiated as they are, constitute a deliberate and concerted attempt at massive public deception by the Australian Labor Party. The documents tabled do not talk in terms of billions of dollars or in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars. The documents talk of figures such as $1m, $6m and $23m. Where is the proof of billions of dollars being lost? Where is the evidence to support these highly exaggerated claims brought into this Parliament by members of the Australian Labor Party without one iota of evidence to back them up? As my colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) so clearly pointed out in this House last week, on the Labor Party's figures the amount of revenue allegedly lost is greater by far than the highest amount of revenue which could have been collected, if everybody had paid, on the assessment of the man best qualified to indicate that figure-that is, the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the Opposition's allegations of evasion exceed the maximum amount that could be payable in a Utopian situation in which everybody pays 100 per cent. Again the Opposition has come into this Parliament and made false and unsubstantiated allegations against the Treasurer of this nation. I think the people of Australia outside this Parliament are getting a bit sick and tired of this. People in the wider community who make false allegations are liable to sanctions under the processes of the law, whether they be criminal or civil proceedings. The Opposition, by bringing into this Parliament wild and exaggerated allegations, unsubstantiated by any evidence whatsoever, demeans itself and this institution. The Opposition will deservedly earn the contempt of the overwhelming majority of Australians for its concerted efforts in recent weeks to smear and denigrate, to slander and defame, to indulge in character assassination on an unprecedented level and to substitute, for the most precious principle of law and justice, suspicion for proof. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition earns no credit by acting, as the Treasurer so correctly said, in apparent total ignorance of the basic and fundamental principles of the law. The Opposition throws aside suggestions about the question of reversal of the onus of proof and says that it is nothing but a mere trifle. It would act like a totalitarian regime which the state is pre-eminent and the individual's rights are totally subservient. I put it to the House that there is more of Moscow than there is of Westminster in the speeches of members of the Opposition. This motion is comtemptible and shameful and will be rejected by this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion. This debate, reduced to its essentials, is simply this: Are the laws by which there is an obligation on the community to pay tax fair, equitable and just? The answer is no. Equally, are those laws effective, efficient and enforceable? Again, the answer is no. Let me quote what my colleague the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) said the other night in the House when dealing with the prosecution aspect of the Government's record. My colleague said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . On 16 September the Treasurer stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Until such time as a court of this country demonstrates that a person involved in that-</PARA>
<PARA>I assume that the Treasurer was referring to the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes-</PARA>
<PARA> could have been effectively prosecuted under the previous law, the opinions given by the Solicitor-General, whom I respect enormously as a lawyer, and the opinion given by Mr Costigan represent not declaration of the law, but opinions by them about the law. </PARA>
<PARA>My colleague then said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . but the fact is that this Government failed to take any action. It sent nobody for trial. It did nothing about the matter. On 13 September in a hearing before Estimates Committee A the Crown Solicitor, Mr O'Donovan, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say categorically that, before Mr Costigan's report was published, there was no instruction or request to my knowledge given in my office for a prosecution under the 1980 Act. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government has absolutely no excuse for its failure to do nothing in this massive tax loss area. It has failed to take account of the fact that some of the laws were and still are outmoded. The existing laws are ineffective, inefficient and above all unforceable. The Government is culpable of the charge that it has, in fact, failed to enforce the existing laws. Let us look at what the tax baron from Queensland, Brian Maher, has had to say. An article appearing in the National Times on 1 July 1978 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> He noted also that the recommendations of successive inquiries into taxation, the Ligertwood and Asprey committees (and later Mathews) had been ignored by Federal treasurers. Here then was a certain growth industry, as long as inflation reigned, in which the Government was unlikely to meddle while its tax receipts multiplied. </PARA>
<PARA>How many recommendations of these reports, which highlight in so many areas the need for tax reform, have been placed on the statute book? The answer is simple- none. This country has had throughout the business community over at least the last two decades persistent debate over the need for a Federal companies and securities takeover law. The new national companies and securities takeover codes are ineffective, inefficient and unenforceable. It is a charade, as any study of the McCabe-Lafranchi report clearly testifies. The McCabe-Lafranchi report and the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union reveal something more sinister; that is, that the laws were in place but because of sheer incompetency they were not enforced. The culpability lies in the fact that Ministers responsible have failed to test the laws. Equally they have failed to act in a number of areas to update the machinery so essential if existing laws are to be made effective and efficient. Under this Government-let it be said so that people understand it clearly-tax has been made optional for the rich. As my good friend, Professor C. Stone, in his book entitled Where the Law Ends, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have arranged things so that the people who call the shots do not have to bear the full risk. </PARA>
<PARA>For years I have repeatedly made this claim:</PARA>
<PARA> Some tax evasion schemes are so blatant and unreal that they constitute obviously a fraud on the revenue. I feel it is about time that some thought was given to taking actions against the nefarious characters who sell the schemes, on the grounds that they are conspiring to defraud the revenue. Possibly, action of this type could be taken under the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly bottom-of-the-harbour schemes are well within that category. I direct the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to section 231 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which is the tax avoidance provision. It has been on the statute book since 1915. The Treasurer ought to have applied his mind to section 5 and section 86 of the Crimes Act. Before I deal with that matter, I return to the celebrated case of Slutzkin. Let us remember the time frame. The Slutzkin case occurred in 1977. I stated in the House:</PARA>
<PARA> The Slutzkin case constituted a dividend stripping arrangement. Slutzkin was a taxpayer closely associated with one Rosenblum who was a director of the company which per- formed a dividend strip. The whole scheme was effected at the same time shares were transferred, considerations paid and assets stripped by the stripping company, Cadez. Cheques were exchanged between the parties and banked simultaneously. In view of the evidence a Supreme Court judge had no hesitation in finding against Slutzkin. </PARA>
<PARA>Shortly after that, on 1 July 1978, an article appeared in the National Times headed: 'Brian Maher has a fine eye for tax avoidance: it's made him a millionaire'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> One day about 10 years ago, Brian Maher, car salesman, was drinking with a mate , one of Sydney's best-known company liquidators, who gave him the following advice. </PARA>
<PARA>This was in 1968-</PARA>
<PARA> 'You're mad paying taxes. Why don't you diversify into loss companies. I'll show you how and I'll supply you with the stock. That way I'll be able to sell my loss companies and you'll be able to make a quid'. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Today, his company, Commercial Securities Ltd, employs about 70 people around Australia. He estimates that the top 10 tax-avoidance companies, of which his is one, have about 20,000 clients and made collective profits of $50m. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of that I put the following question on the Notice Paper to the Treasurer in September:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Has . . . the Commissioner for Taxation given consideration to prosecuting Mr Maher under section 5 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act for aiding and abetting offences against the Income Tax Assessment Act or under section 86 of the Crimes Act for conspiracy to commit an offence or to prevent or defeat the execution or enforcement of tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is he satisfied that the Commissioner for Taxation is doing everything possible to ensure that Mr Maher, as well as his clients, are paying their fair share of the tax burden?</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer thanked me for drawing his attention to the article. I bet he did! He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the secrecy provisions of the income tax law, the Commissioner of Taxation is unable to divulge any information relating to the affairs of Mr Maher or any other person. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner informed me, however, that all available administrative means are used to enforce the taxation laws. </PARA>
<PARA>Before I go back to that matter, I will quote a pertinent question. This was asked by the former honourable member for Hindmarsh on the same date:</PARA>
<PARA> Will he allow members of the Parliament to see the reports given to the Government since 1 January 1976 on tax avoidance schemes including his estimate of the loss to revenue of such schemes?</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Wherever possible revenue effects have been stated in respect of matters on which the Government has, in its vigorous program of action against tax avoidance, already taken action. When further action is taken on other matters at present under consideration this information will be given to the extent that it is available. It is not customary to make Cabinet Submissions and kindred confidential reports available to members. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say at the outset that the Treasurer has misled this Parliament. The Commissioner of Taxation has persistently pressed the Treasurer to take action under both sections of the Act. The Treasurer has failed to do so. The more important thing is not the question of the Mahers, the Horgans and people like that. The thing for which this Government stands indicted, and specifically the Treasurer, is simply this: You tell me now in this chamber under what sub- section of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, you are prevented from notifying this Parliament on taxation schemes. You had the responsibility--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CV4">Mr JACOBI</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has a responsibility on receipt of that question-in view of the article, which was quite lengthy, of the activities of Maher and his nefarious schemes-to ask Mr O'Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation: 'Is this a fact? Are these schemes, in fact, in operation? If they are, what action do you intend to take to block them?' The second question I would have asked as the Treasurer is: 'Mr O'Reilly, are the tax laws, company laws, liquidation laws and bankruptcy laws capable, effective and efficient? Can they be enforced to block that massive rip-off?' Did the Treasurer ask that question? I doubt it. In 1978 the Treasurer had an obligation to apply his mind to that problem. He failed to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have another look at the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Royal Commissioner Costigan deals with the questions I raised in 1978. He stated that the Treasurer could have used the Crimes Act, but he failed to do so. What an appalling indictment it is. In Interim Report No. 4 Costigan stated:</PARA>
<PARA> However, the general Criminal Law also applies with equal force irrespective of whether the victim of the fraud is the revenue of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>In this case I say that the Commonwealth is the creditor. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>It has long since been the law that all frauds affecting the Crown and the public at large are indictable at Common Law as cheating. That was established as early as 1973 in Rex v Bembridge . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Costigan continues:</PARA>
<PARA>To add emphasis to this point, attention is drawn to section 86 of the Crimes Act of the Commonwealth. This section specifically provides that it is an offence to conspire with intent to defraud the Commonwealth. It also proscribes a conspiracy to defeat the operation of a law of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Income Tax Assessment Act is a law of the Commonwealth, and conspiracy to defeat its operation is as much an offence as conspiracy to defeat the operation of any other law. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us have a look at what Costigan had to say about the Crown Law officers. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is sufficient in law for there to be reckless disregard of the financial liability or prospective liability for intent to defraud to be established. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Treasurer that his difficulty at that time was to find, within his Department, a one-armed lawyer. He had too many two-armed lawyers. The advice he was getting on the one hand was this and on the other hand that. Let us have a look at the question of misfeasance. On this matter Costigan stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As long ago as 1870 it was determined that where directors improperly invest or pay away companies' monies, they are liable in misfeasance and that has been re- affirmed many times over the last one hundred years. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer could have and should have used section 231. He could have applied section 5 of the Crimes Act. I do not have the time to quote what Spry said, but honourable members ought to read Spry in a recent paper delivered at a seminar. When dealing with section 231-he is not one of our supporters-this is what he had to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It might have been thought that the various provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Crimes Act to which reference has been made here are sufficiently broad to render illegal most, at least, forms of tax evasion. It is perhaps curious, therefore, that when recently it became apparent that tax evasion on a large scale had been taking place which involved the removal or dispersal of assets of companies in order to prevent the recovery of tax the Commonwealth chose, instead of invoking these provisions, to have the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act 1980 enacted. </PARA>
<PARA>There is yet to be a prosecution in that area. The other question I want to ask the Treasurer is this: What is he going to do to the merchant bank people who have been involved in the conspiracy-they would have to be involved-to facilitate 'Round Robin' cheques? Is he going to apply the law as it is in sections 263 and 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act? I will be interested to know. The other question I would like to ask is: Why, in the intervening period, have there been no prosecutions pursuant to the new National Companies and Securities Act? There are at least six provisions and at least six areas where people ought to have been prosecuted for failure to comply with the Companies Act. I will conclude with a very telling article. It is a question that really sums up the Treasurer's incompetency. It was a question I asked but it was ruled out of order in March of this year. It sums up this Government and its dilemma. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Can the Treasurer confirm that in the administration of taxation he is guided by the advice of Napoleon to Marshal Kleber that 'to squeeze the poor is safe, but to squeeze the rich beyond accepted limits is decidedly dangerous'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the dilemma of the Treasurer, and of every honourable member opposite. Let me tell the Treasurer this: In 1979 he gave me an undertaking for 400 staff in the Taxation Office. The following year he reduced this by implementing staff ceilings. He saved $1,250,000 but he lost $45m in revenue. This is not the mark of a competent Minister; it is the mark of incompetency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing that is perfectly obvious is that the telephone book is not to the liking of the Opposition. One can see this being considered and a few thoughts have been exchanged between those mighty people who are the leaders. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) says: 'My God, those fellows are for real after all. They have really been trying to do something. What are we going to do?' On 17 August the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) said: 'I had a nice little motion in this House on 17 August and I think I will recycle that.' That is what is being done. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was putting the same sort of arguments as he put then. What was he back to? He was back to the McCabe-Lafranchi report, he was back to billions of dollars, back to the usual assertions which are completely groundless as he knows and which he did not try to establish. As for the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) with his talent of a very minor kind for vilification, that is how he employed it, and that was all he was interested in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us see what the Opposition is saying. It is continuing, despite the release of almost 400 pages of documents, to conduct a campaign of misrepresentation and vilification of what the Government has done and is doing in the area of tax avoidance and evasion. Specifically, it is deliberately misrepresenting to the Australian people this Government, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the efforts they have made over the years to stamp out tax avoidance and evasion. Let me, at the outset, nail that misrepresentation. It has continued, yet one of the documents which has been produced is the best possible evidence to establish what a lie that misrepresentation is. It was not referred to but I would not have expected it to have been referred to. On 15 July 1977 the Prime Minister wrote to the Treasurer and said:</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw your attention to a paper which Dale Budd passed to Andrew Hay a couple of days ago. The paper, which was prepared by a person outside the government, sets out a number of tax avoidance schemes which are said to be in current use. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the document should be examined most urgently and that if the schemes are correctly described we should be looking to appropriate legislation at the earliest possible date. </PARA>
<PARA>That was from the Prime Minister, the person whom the Opposition has the effrontery and dishonesty to describe as a supporter of tax avoidance and evasion. Let us come to the document which the Opposition did go to-it would not have understood it anyway-and recall what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) said. He said that the document referred to bottom-of-the- harbour schemes yet he did not go to the document. He knows very well that had he gone to it he would have found that that was not so. Let us go to page 84 of the document that the Prime Minister sent forward to the Treasurer. That is the only page which mentions any scheme which could possibly be described as being close to a stripping operation.That part of the document referred to the sale of companies with current year profits. It sets out the details of those sales and concluded in paragraph 3 in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The company broker, once acquiring the company with company profits, injects tax losses into the company to avoid the existing company tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA>That scheme was legislated against in 1978 but nobody from the other side who spoke had the honesty even to refer to that fact. Let us turn to the Treasurer. It has been said that the Treasurer has been dilatory. Many things have been said of him, particularly by that disgraceful object, the honourable member for Fremantle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What does that make perfectly clear? It makes clear that the Commissioner was not willing to travel at the same rate as the Treasurer wanted to travel in acting against tax avoidance. The documents which have been tabled are internal documents. They would never have been disclosed save for the motion of the Senate and the Government's response to that motion. To any fair-minded person-I certainly would not include the Opposition in that category-they established beyond any doubt that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been determined and dedicated to eradicate tax avoidance and evasion. One can only thank the Opposition for having caused those documents to be presented to the Parliament. One of the reasons that the Opposition did not like the telephone book was that it demonstrated beyond doubt the kinds of actions the Government was taking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What have we heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? He has said: 'Well , now, let us look at the evidence'. But when it came to looking at the evidence he was remarkably shy. He made the usual allegation that billions of dollars have been lost. Of course, as is usual, he made no attempt whatsoever to substantiate that allegation by reference to any document, any set of facts or even an opinion. It was something plucked out of the air and it is directly contrary to the assessment made by the Commissioner of Taxation. What else did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say? He said that the Prime Minister was aware of a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme in July 1977. That is patently untrue.</PARA>
<PARA> We had the usual story about Perth. We know perfectly well that the details of the Perth case were not known to the Treasurer. That is apparent from the report of the Costigan Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. It is apparent to anyone who bothers to read the telephone book because there is nothing there which could ever alert the Treasurer or any other person to what was allegedly taking place in Perth in relation to the test case. If there was, no doubt there would have been a reference to it from honourable members on the other side of the House, having culled through the documents overnight. The question might be asked: Does the Opposition accept the figures put forward by the Commissioner of Taxation? He assessed in rough terms a loss of tax liability of around $350m. Does the Opposition impugn the integrity and the competence of the Commissioner as well?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) said that I would refer in some detail to some of the steps in the sequence of events. Time does not permit reference in detail to the sequence of events but some points need to be drawn out. The first of these is that, as soon as a submission was received by the Treasurer relating to the emergence of matters that needed to be looked at, it went straight in. That was on 6 June 1978. There was no delay whatsoever. After a ministerial decision was made that the matter should be considered urgently, on 23 August 1978 that consideration took place. Anybody who looked at the consideration by the three departments involved-that is, the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Australian Taxation Office-would realise that there were deep differences of principle as to the proper approach towards remedial legislation. I say in passing that anybody who looks at the file of documents will realise that not once was it put to the Treasurer that existing remedies should be pursued in place of remedial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> After problems were raised which occupied some three and a half months of work within the three departments, the Treasurer sought the advice of the Attorney- General's Department. I am sorry to say that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) is unwell and is not in a position to answer to this House. I expect that one would find, if one looked, that there were great differences of view within the departments as to the resolution of an extremely difficult question. At the forefront of the problem was the question of a reversed onus which had originally been put forward by the Taxation Office. The advice was finally given in July 1979. Within two days of the letter of advice coming from the Attorney- General through the Commissioner of Taxation the Treasurer approved it. It was lodged on the same day. Within four days there was a Cabinet decision. So much for delay there. What then took place? Two and a half months was spent on drafting while the papers were with parliamentary counsel. There is no delay there. What then took place? The Government members taxation committee did not like the proposed legislation, as was the case with many people in this country. Many lawyers, many organisations and many ordinary citizens did not like the legislation. What then happened? There was a reference to the Taxation Advisory Committee which one of the honourable members of the Opposition in passing, in his usual and inimitable style, sought to vilify. That Committee had before it the recommendations that came from the Taxation Office for a period from 1 February 1980 until 26 November 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> If one wants to look at the degree of urgency that the Taxation Office thought the matters merited then it is worth while taking in these dates. On 1 February 1980 the Treasurer wrote a letter that had been prepared by the Taxation Office asking the Advisory Committee to look at certain matters. The Advisory Committee responded to that letter on 28 February 1980. That response was then put to the Taxation Office. The Taxation Office gave that due consideration. I am not critical of the Taxation Office but it was not until 10 June 1980 that the Office replied-that is after some three months or more. I am not critical of that but it does throw some light upon this supposed immense urgency, upon this supposed extraordinary problem, upon this matter, which it is said, was going to bring taxation avoidance falling to the ground. Of course, this did not take place. What took place then? The Advisory Committee replied. Then there was a final response from the Commissioner of Taxation on 31 October. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation was put into this House. There were amendments to it. Why were there amendments? There were amendments because people found parts of the legislation obnoxious. Some were very concerned about it. Who in this House would have been satisfied with the original proposals which were put up by the Taxation Office? The legislation which was proposed originally was radical. The legislation which was introduced was very far reaching in its consequences. It attracted the widest of criticism throughout the community by people who were concerned with justice-not justice as between the state collecting revenue and getting it in but justice as between citizen and citizen, justice in the courts. It was because of the very deep reservations that the Treasurer held throughout that this matter was looked at so closely. I for one do not apologise for one moment for the Government's taking its time. In making the judgment that the Treasurer did he had to come to an honest, just and decent balance between the needs of the state and the rights of the individuals. No doubt that kind of balance would not be made by the Opposition. When the day comes when we overlook the need to make that balance then we will have lost a very great deal indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now just over five years since the Ombudsman Act 1976 came into effect and the Commonwealth Ombudsman commenced operations. Professor J. E. Richardson was the first Ombudsman appointed with jurisdiction over the administrative actions of central government agencies in a federal system. During the first five years, the Ombudsman received complaints from around 50,000 people, including 13,300 written complaints, about the administrative actions of Commonwealth departments and authorities. I am advised that the Ombudsman has processed around 44,000 of these complaints. All honourable members will have developed an understanding and appreciation of the work of the Ombudsman through his comprehensive annual reports to Parliament and, for many members, through his investigation of around 300 complaints which members of parliament have raised with him on behalf of constituents. Two further enactments of this Parliament, the Complaints ( Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 and the Freedom of Information Act 1982, have recently expanded the Ombudsman's jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Bill has two purposes. First, it will implement the Government's decision that a statutory office of Defence Force Ombudsman, to replace the non- statutory office established in 1975, should be created and conferred on the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Second, it will make various other amendments to the Ombudsman Act in the light of operational experience to date. In both areas of the Bill, the Government's decisions have been based largely on reports and recommendations of the Administrative Review Council, a statutory advisory body established by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. I take this opportunity to commend the Council for its contribution to the development of Commonwealth adminstrative law. The Council's report on the Government's proposal for a statutory office of Defence Force Ombudsman was tabled in the House on 4 June 1981 and, on 10 June 1981, the Minister for Defence tabled a statement indicating that the Government accepted the report's recommendations. An edited version of the report by the Council working party which reviewed the Ombudsman Act and the Ombudsman's jurisdiction was tabled on 2 June 1981. I now seek leave to table a copy of the full report of the Council working party. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr FIFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Further copies have been placed in the Parliamentary Library. The Government has accepted virtually all of the Council's recommendations on the Ombudsman Act and jurisdiction. I seek leave to table a paper detailing the Government's response to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr FIFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The Council's recommendations on the Ombudsman's jurisdiction over Commonwealth companies and commercial and trading authorities remain under examination, though I hope to be able to announce the Government's decision on these in the near future. The Council's report on the statutory Defence Force Ombudsman favoured conferring the proposed jurisdiction on the Ombudsman because a small and separate Defence Force Ombudsman organisation and the existence of two ombudsmen with overlapping jurisdictions would impose significant administrative difficulties and an unnecessary extra cost. The Council proposed, nevertheless, that a special Deputy Ombudsman (Defence Force) be designated to assist in day to day Defence Force Ombudsman work and that a separate part of the Act create the jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill, in consequence, aptly identifies the Defence Force Ombudsman's distinct character. The Government sees the creation of the statutory office as an important advancement in conditions of employment for service members. Servicemen and service women differ from most other Australians in that their relationships with their employer can extend into almost every aspect of their lives. It is in the nature of Defence Force service that members do not have the advantage of external grievance mechanisms typical in civil employment. Recognising this before a deputy ombudsman is appointed or designated for the Defence Force jurisdiction, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)) will consult with the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair). </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force Ombudsman's basic function is to investigate, either on complaint being made or of his own motion, administrative actions related to or arising from a person's service in the Defence Force. Although most complaints will come from current or former Service members, other persons, such as their dependants, will also be able to lodge complaints if they are affected by actions which are within the Defence Force Ombudsman's jurisdiction. In recognition of Service members' special position, the Defence Force Ombudsman's jurisdiction is defined by service in the Defence Force, whereas the Commonwealth Ombudsman is excluded from investigating matters arising in Commonwealth civilian employment. There are, however, some exclusions from this jurisdiction which parallel exclusions from the Commonwealth Ombudsman's jurisdiction. In addition, the Defence Force Ombudsman is excluded from investigating action taken in the conduct of disciplinary proceedings, and action relating to the grant or refusal of honours and awards-but not awards for service in a particular area or for a particular period. </PARA>
<PARA> Review by the Defence Force Ombudsman will complement, rather than compete with , existing internal redress procedures: For effective management in the Defence Force, officers should usually hear and have the first opportunity to remedy the grievances of those under their command. Thus the Bill provides that the Defence Force Ombudsman shall not investigate a complaint by a serving member of the Defence Force unless the member first seeks internal redress and a period of 28 days elapses, though he may investigate earlier in special circumstances and may also further investigate a complaint where he and the complainant are not satisfied that the redress granted is adequate. The legislation applies most of the procedural provisions in the Ombudsman Act to the Defence Force Ombudsman- such as those concerning the conduct of investigations. To avoid artificial jurisdictional difficulties, special provision is made for handling complaints which involve both the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Defence Force Ombudsman jurisdictions or which are not directed to the appropriate Ombudsman. As well, transitional provisions in the Bill provide for the transfer to the statutory office of any unfinished business of the non-statutory office. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the Bill, as I have mentioned, makes a number of amendments to the Ombudsman Act based on the Ombudsman's operational experience to date, drawing on the review of the Administrative Review Council. The main theme of these amendments is that the Ombudsman, primarily an independent officer with the statutory formal duties and powers essential to vigorous investigation and reporting of defective administration, should normally operate less formally than is appropriate for other administrative review mechanisms, such as courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Professor Richardson has developed this theme in his annual reports and has explained in these reports the informal operating procedures which he has built up with the co-operation of Commonwealth departments and authorities. The Government endorses these developments and believes that, where possible and proper simple and prompt remedies for complainants should be recognised and facilitated by the Ombudsman Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, several amendments are made which give the Ombudsman greater discretions and flexibility by modifying formal procedural requirements in the Act. In particular, the Bill includes amendments which recognise that the Ombudsman may accept and resolve oral complaints, unless there is need to investigate formally; simplify the Ombudsman's discretion not to investigate formally certain complaints; streamline the requirements for the Ombudsman to notify the Minister and agency head of his decision to investigate a complaint or otherwise; and give legislative backing to the Ombudsman's practice of making informal inquiries. The last amendment will also clarify that the Ombudsman may inquire informally to establish that a matter is within his jurisdiction before investigating formally. In amendments which are similarly to facilitate his role in encouraging better and more accessible administration, the Bill also gives the Ombudsman greater discretion to disseminate information or comments on his investigations to Commonwealth agencies, the Parliament, other persons with an interest in the outcome of investigations-for example, parliamentarians-and, where special circumstances so warrant, the public at large. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments variously strengthen or widen the Ombudsman's role commensurate with developing practice and with the Government's intentions when the Ombudsman legislation was introduced in 1976. These amendments will provide a sounder statutory basis for co-operative investigation by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and his counterparts in the States and Northern Territory where both Commonwealth and State and Territory activities or undertakings are involved; empower the Federal Court to determine issues arising in relation to the Ombudsman's powers and jurisdiction when normal consultation processes cannot otherwise resolve them; expand the circumstances in which the Ombudsman can cause matters to come before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; and clarify certain doubts that have arisen regarding the Ombudsman's jurisdiction over particular types of action, including action preceding or succeeding action by a Minister, or over particular types of Commonwealth bodies. More detailed information on the provisions of the Bill is set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated. I foreshadow the Government's intention that the Committee stage of the Bill be taken in a Legislation Committee of the House. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>On 9 September the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) tabled in Parliament the report of the Commonwealth Schools Commission containing its recommendations for the calendar year 1983, in response to the Government's guidelines. The Bill gives effect to the Government's decisions on the Commission's financial recommendations for 1983, all of which have been accepted . As announced in the Government's guidelines statement, the Bill also provides for additional funds for 1982 programs, to help meet unanticipated cost increases arising from recent teacher salary determinations. The overall level of Commonwealth expenditure on schools programs in 1983 will be about $1,241m, an increase of 3.9 per cent in real terms over 1982-all amounts being in 1983 outturn prices. The value of most programs will be at least maintained in real terms. For some programs there will be significant real increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Part II of the Bill contains provision for programs in government schools. To assist the States to overcome the financial difficulties which the Commission reported were facing government school systems, general recurrent grants for government schools will be increased by 2 per cent in real terms in 1983. Funds for the capital grants program for government schools will be maintained at the same real level as in 1982. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that 10 per cent of the funds be distributed on the basis of certain indicators of the need to provide new pupil places. In addition, a general clause has been included in the Bill indicating that prior to the granting of funds to a State, the Commonwealth Minister must be satisfied with arrangements to identify projects to which Commonwealth funds are to be applied.</PARA>
<PARA> Part III of the Bill contains provision for programs in non-government schools. General recurrent grants to non-government schools have been increased in accordance with the policy which ties Commonwealth per capita grants to non- government schools to movements in the average cost of educating a student in a government school. The increases in commitments to non-government schools are also a result of increases in the subsidy rate to schools with the lowest recurrent resources-group 3-from 38 per cent to 40 per cent of average government school standard costs. This fulfils the Government's commitment in the 1980 election to provide three levels of assistance for non-government schools equal to 20 per cent, 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the average cost of educating a student in a government school. Almost 95 per cent of the increase in Commonwealth general recurrent grants in 1983 will be directed to those schools assessed as having lowest recurrent resources. On average such schools operate at recurrent resource levels some 30 per cent below those of government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government endorses the Commission's intention to implement fully the previous decision to give consideration to income as well as expenditure in the assessment of non-government schools' subsidy categories and expects that the income checking procedure introduced on a limited basis in 1982 will be applied to all non-government schools eligible for group 2 or group 3 grants in 1983. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that eligibility for grants under the Short Term Emergency Assistance Program be extended to include any non-government school suffering a financial crisis caused by a sudden disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Government's acceptance of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs recommendation that funding for new arrivals should be adjusted according to the number of newly-arrived students, this element of the English as a Second Language Program in 1983 will be funded on the basis of a per capita grant of $880. This is essentially the same per capita amount in real terms as in 1982 and has been calculated to provide a program of intensive English language instruction for a period of up to six months. The final cost of the program will therefore be determined by the actual number of eligible newly- arrived students. For the general support element of the English as a Second Language Program a further adjustment has been made to the distribution of program funds among the States to accord with the results of a recent national survey of students of non-English speaking background. Funds for the general support element for non-government schools have not been allocated on a State-by -State basis in the Bill. However, the Government intends that the allocations to Catholic schools in the various States and Territories will be in accordance with the recommended distribution in the Commission's Report. For non-Catholic schools, the Government intends that State planning and finance committees should continue to be responsible for recommending the distribution of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant new policy development encompassed in this Bill is the provision for the participation of children of below school age in the Special Education Program. This also applies to the children in institutions and severely handicapped children's programs which are joint programs for both government and non-government schools. Joint programs are dealt with in Part IV of the Bill. The allocation for the Severely Handicapped Children's Program has been increased by 25 per cent or $0.7m in real terms. The same real level of funds will be provided for the Professional Development Program for 1983, including funds for education centres. </PARA>
<PARA> Allocations of grants for 1983 for the various programs for the States and the Northern Territory, are detailed in Schedules 1 to 11 of the Bill. These grants include provision of a prospective allowance for cost increases up to the end of 1983, in accordance with established Government policy. Grants for current programs for calendar year 1982 are adjusted under Part VI and Schedule 12 to help meet unanticipated cost increases arising from recent teacher salary determinations. The additional cost of these adjustments is $45m. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment has been made to the relevant clause in Part V of the Bill to enable the Commonwealth Minister to delegate all or any of his powers under the Act, other than that of delegation. This will improve the administration of programs and the Minister will consider carefully which matters should be retained for ministerial decision. The provisions of this Bill demonstrate the Commonwealth's continuing commitment to high standards in all Australian schools , whether government or non-government. The increased overall level of support will enable further real improvements in the recurrent resource levels of all schools in Australia. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) tabled in the Parliament on 9 September the report of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission for 1983. This report was in response to the Government's guidelines for financial assistance for capital and equipment programs for universities and colleges of advanced education, and capital, equipment and recurrent programs for technical and further education institutions. The primary purpose of the States Grants ( Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill is to amend the States Grants ( Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981 to implement the Government's decisions for 1983 on the financial recommendations made by the Commission, all of which have been accepted. Higher education recurrent grants for the 1982-84 triennium were determined by the Government in 1981 under the existing fixed triennial arrangements; however these are adjusted in the Bill to take account of recent Government decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital grants contained in this Bill total $137.6m, of which $34.7m is for universities and advanced education. For TAFE, the 1983 capital grants amount to $102.9m. The Bill appropriates $58.8m for the 1983 equipment program for universities and advanced education and $10.1m for TAFE special equipment grants . Recurrent grants for TAFE for 1983 contained in this Bill amount to $88.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the principal Act, certain institutions of higher education do not have recurrent grants appropriated for 1983 and 1984. Consolidation arrangements were recommended by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission and required by the Government's decisions arising from its Review of Commonwealth Functions. Consolidation arrangements have now been made for 26 of the 30 colleges of advanced education listed in the RCF decision. These include an amalgamation of the Institute of Early Childhood Development and Melbourne State College which has now been agreed by the Victorian Government. Funds have therefore been included in this legislation for the new amalgamated institution for 1983 and 1984. Acceptable proposals have yet to be made in respect of Armidale CAE, Newcastle CAE, Milperra CAE and the State College of Victoria, Hawthorn. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report the Commission has noted the progress being made towards integration of the activities of the University of Newcastle and Newcastle CAE under a single governing body and towards consolidation of activities of the SCV , Hawthorn. It has suggested an appropriate approach to the consolidation of the activities of the Milperra CAE. However, at Armidale, the university has maintained its opposition to integration of its activities with those of the college, notwithstanding the college's preparedness to meet the Commonwealth's conditions for consolidation. The Government strongly supports the view of the Commission, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . higher education in Armidale and the surrounding region would benefit from an amalgamation of the University and the College. It regrets the attitude which the University has taken on this matter. The University's attitude prejudices the improved provision of higher education in Armidale and the region , and puts at risk future funding. </PARA>
<PARA>The shift in Australian demography has required fundamental changes in the structure of higher education as so much of that system related to teacher education. The consolidation of these remaining institutions will complete the comprehensive reorganisation of higher education which was recommended by the CTEC and supported by the Review of Commonwealth Functions. It is essential that we enter calendar year 1983 with a reorganised system which will provide improved and expanded opportunities for higher education. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances the Government has decided that recurrent funds for all the institutions concerned, including the two universities, be put aside in a national unallocated grant. These funds will be allocated by the Minister, after advice from the Commission, when acceptable proposals are recommended in respect of the institutions which have not yet met the Commonwealth's requirements on consolidation. This means that acceptable proposals will need to be available by the end of 1982. The Minister is anxious for the institutions and State Governments concerned to produce acceptable proposals before the end of the year so that he can make these funds available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission, in preparing its report, also considered the future of the Orange Agricultural College. The Government supports the Commission's recommendation that separate funding for the Orange Agricultural College should continue in 1983. It expects that the College will enter into an appropriate consolidation arrangement by January 1984. For this reason the Bill includes the 1984 recurrent funds for the Orange Agricultural College in the National Unallocated Grant for Higher Education. </PARA>
<PARA> The higher education recurrent grants include provision for up to an additional $4m in 1983 and $8m in 1984 to assist institutions to meet increased superannuation costs. These grants will assist with the cost of the new national superannuation scheme developed by the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee and the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations. This new scheme is designed to replace existing arrangements which give inadequate benefits to many staff. In addition, the grants will assist with the problem of meeting increased costs resulting from membership of State government superannuation schemes with a view to limiting these costs to the level of the new AVCC-FAUSA scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional recurrent grants of $0.2m in 1983 and $0.3m in 1984 have been included in the Bill for the University of Melbourne to assist with the development of graduate teaching and research in management education. This results from the Government's consideration of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Management Education, the Ralph Report. The provision of up to $4m as the Commonwealth contribution towards the construction of a building for the new graduate school of management at the University of Melbourne will be finalised following the Government's consideration of further proposals to be developed for the establishment and management of the school. These proposals will include the active co-operation and involvement of the Australian business community. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Government's consideration of the evaluation of post-arrival programs and services for migrants by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs, the Government decided that 15 per cent of TAFE particular purpose grants will be allocated for implementing programs of advanced English language instruction for migrants. An additional amount of $1.1m is being transferred to assit in meeting these costs. The Commission will be consulting with the States on the implementation of this program and will report in November on the most appropriate method of giving full effect to the decisions within 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Technical and further education capital grants include financial assistance for the construction of seven major building projects and the design of a further two building projects under the new three-year $60m National Priority Projects Program. The first instalment of this new three-year program which is included in the Bill will be $12.2m for 1983. This level of activity recognises that expenditure on new projects is inevitably less in the first year than occurs in later years. However, the Commission's recommendations provide for the full expenditure of the $60m allocated over the three years 1983 to 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage all money amounts in the Bill are expressed in 1982 outturn prices. These will be adjusted to 1983 outturn prices at a later stage. The Government has been giving consideration to the recent report of the Academic Salaries Tribunal. It had also been awaiting the 17 September decision by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on Commonwealth Public Service salaries, since these salary levels are taken as the basis for funding non-academic salary costs. The Government will now consider both decisions and will determine the prospective allowance for tertiary education grants for 1983. The Government's decisions on these matters will be incorporated in the Bill at the Committee stage. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Replacement of operating theatres and refurbishment of the surgical wards at the Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park, SA. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is for the construction of a new operating theatre building and the refurbishing and extension of existing pavilion wards 5, 6, 7 and 8. The new building will contain four operating theatres with theatre sterilising and support facilities. The Committee has endorsed the need for the work and reported that the design is satisfactory. The Committee has further recommended that wards 1 and 2 also need upgrading and that this work should be undertaken immediately after completion of the work covered by this motion. The Government agrees with the recommendation to upgrade the standard of accommodation in wards 1 and 2 and understands that the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be seeking the inclusion of this work in the 1984-85 capital works program. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report the Committee said that the Department of Veterans' Affairs should have corrected the deficiencies in the standard of facilities at the hospital earlier. The main reason for the delay in bringing the proposal forward for government approval related to the need for and relative priority of capital works projects in all repatriation hospitals. The majority of the buildings in these hospitals were constructed in the early 1940s and, by the late 1960s, the Department, faced with significant changes in medical technology, treatment procedures and accommodation standards, proceeded progressively to upgrade the aging facilities in all institutions. Throughout the 1970s, against a background of expenditure restraint, major capital improvements programs were initiated on a priority basis in many of the repatriation general hospitals throughout Australia. With the endorsement of the future role of the hospital at Daw Park by the Repatriation Commission, following a review in 1978, the Department proceeded with planning to upgrade the facilities at the hospital as quickly as possible including a new medical ward, construction of which commenced in July this year. With the completion of the work referred to in this motion, the standard of surgical facilities will be comparable with the most modern available in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 32 of its report the Committee indicated that it would like to be assured that the provision of laminar flow air conditioning to only two of the four operating theatres will not diminish the overall efficiency of the operating theatre complex. It is now generally accepted that the installation of laminar flow or controlled directional air flow systems in operating theatres is essential for major orthopaedic surgery, particularly surgery involving joint replacement. In view of the expense associated with the installation of these units, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in defining its needs, was careful to ensure that what was proposed was consistent with the work load projected for the facilities. The Department has concluded that two units are adequate to meet current and projected demand and will not impede the future operational efficiency of the complex. </PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 42 the Committee noted that, following a recent overall reduction in staff ceilings throughout the Commonwealth Public Service, ward 8, a female ward at the hospital, was closed. As a result of the recent Budget announcements , the hospital will be allocated an increase in staff to enable a ward to be reopened. Finally the Committee has reported that it was gratified to find overwhelming support from ex-service organisations for the proposal and for the retention of Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park, as the primary facility for the treatment of veterans and war widows in Adelaide. The work is estimated to cost $6.5m at April 1982 prices. The Committee has recommended construction of the work in the reference. If the House agrees to support this motion planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 22 to 24 (1982). </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs tariff proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966 Proposals No. 22 which operates from 31 May 1982, contains changes to the concessions accorded under the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement. The agreement is a preferential non- reciprocal agreement between Australia and New Zealand on the one hand and the island member countries of the South Pacific Forum on the other. Some of the changes in the proposals result from the addition of further products to the list of goods accorded concessional tariff treatment while the remaining changes are caused by an alignment of the Customs tariff on the schedules to the agreement, which has been recently ratified on the basis of the four-figure items contained in the Customs Co-operation Council's nomenclature. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 23 which operates from 1 July 1982, implements the Government's decision to add further goods to Schedule A of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The goods of New Zealand origin which will have their duties reduced are: Resistors, fixed or variable, including potentiometers; arc lamp carbons, battery carbons, carbon electrodes and other carbon articles of a kind used for electrical purposes, other than carbon brushes and goods which are already on Schedule A of the agreement; and truck trailer automatic couplings. Proposals No. 24 (1982) which operates from tomorrow introduces tariff changes arising from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on products of the forging, foundry, die casting, sheet metal industries and other fabricated metal products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendations with some minor variations to the phasing arrangements to apply and to rates for certain goods from Canada, New Zealand and some developing countries. The assistance for the goods under reference will be: A long term rate of 20 per cent for most of the goods under reference, phased in over one, two or three years in some cases; a long term rate of 25 per cent for certain industrial and other fasteners, locks and padlocks et cetera, stationery fittings etcetera, and certain lamps and lighting fittings, phased in over one year in some cases; minimum rates on goods currently receiving low levels of assistance or where local production is minimal; and, a rate of 5 per cent on cigarette, cigar and pipe lighters to accord New Zealand a margin of preference under Australia's agreement on tariffs and tariff preferences with New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has noted the IAC's conclusions that implementation of its recommendations should not have any serious adverse effects on levels of activity or employment in most areas of local production and that the reductions in duties and in disparities should provide benefits through improved resource allocation and production and consumption patterns more closely related to the dictates of the market. The proposals-and I must say that I am still getting used to 'proposals', a plural, attracting a singular verb, but that is the form of language traditionally used-also contains provisions to exempt one further category of steel which is included on Schedule A of the New Zealand Australia Free Trade Agreement from the scope of the temporary duty imposed on above quota imports as a result of the Government's decision on the Temporary Assistance Authority's report on certain flat steel products, pipes and tubes of iron or steel. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 24 (1982) also contains an amendment to allow textile fabrics and articles made up from textile fabric that are otherwise eligible for admission under handicraft quota to qualify when they contain not less than 90 per cent by weight of natural fibres. This change results from the Government's decision to reduce the natural fibre content requirement from the current 95 per cent by weight. I have already signed a Customs by-law making a similar change for those textile fabrics and textile articles which are eligible for unrestricted duty free entry under the handicraft by-law to item 36 of Part I of Schedule 2 to the Customs Tariff Act. A comprehensive summary of the duty changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I say how much I regret that we will not have the opportunity by way of the Estimates committee system that operated last year and, indeed, over the last few years to question the relevant Ministers in more detail about the Estimates. However, we are back to the old form. The Estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet allow me a wide canvas. The Department has, for instance, an economics branch. Through that branch, the Department has a significant influence on the decisions taken by the Government as they relate to the level of economic activity in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I need hardly tell the House that we are suffering depression conditions in Australia at present due to the wrong economic strategy being pursued by the Government. I wish to illustrate the problems that this is causing for the people of this country by talking of one of the areas of my own responsibility as shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce, namely, the small business area. I will talk in particular about that small business area whose members are known as the truckies of this nation. The truckies are being squeezed. Owner-drivers have enormous problems. If only the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of $68m were used a little more effectively by, hopefully, better advice being given to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) we might have a change of economic strategy which would help this group. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian road transport industry, including long distance interstate and short haul intrastate transport, is facing one of its most serious recessions in 50 years. A combination of drought and recession-as well as those wrong economic policies-has led to average declines in freight tonnage movements of 12.5 per cent in the 12 months to 31 August. I emphasise 'average decline' because for many companies in many sectors the decline is much higher and their situation is correspondingly that much more serious. The road transport industry is especially vulnerable because of the very high proportion of small business operators-with up to six vehicles-and owner-drivers. Subcontractors in this industry carry an estimated 75 per cent of the freight forwarders' requirements. The remaining 25 per cent is carted by direct employees. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the fact that industry Australia-wide is facing difficult times. I assert that to a great extent this is due to the wrong domestic economic policies. I have stressed many times in this House and elsewhere that the responsibility for the recession overall must be laid firmly at the feet of the Government. Therefore, it is appropriate that I should talk about this matter in the estimates of such a significant Department of the Government as the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. That Department must be partly responsible for advising on the efficacy of the monetarist policies being followed. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere is the irresponsibility more evident than in the case of the road transport industry. On representative figures adopted by the Australian Road Transport Federation and Transport Workers Union of Australia, the average owner -driver on the run between Melbourne and Sydney has been pushed below the margin of viability. The result is that many hundreds of small business operators and owner-drivers are now being forced into bankruptcy. I repeat that this is just one example of what is happening to the small business sector generally. Under normal circumstances bankruptcy would be bad enough, but in this industry the liability of the business extends well beyond the assets of the business and includes the home, the private car and, indeed, anything and everything that might be appropriated to meet the debts of the business. In this industry bankruptcy means total ruin-ruin for the family, not just for the business. So much for the effects of the recession arising from the contradictionary policies of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is responsible in yet another important sense; namely, the taxes which it imposes on the fuel costs of the transport industry. Freight rates, the vital source of small business revenue in this industry, are already inadequate. They have been squeezed too hard. Whatever margin they may have yielded has been eroded by the high level of and rapid increases in the Federal oil levy and the Federal excise tax on diesel fuel. I repeat that it is appropriate that this matter be brought up under these estimates. Because the economics branch of this Department will advise the Government on these matters and the effects they are having on our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Federal fuel taxes currently amount to 19.65c per litre. This is made up of a 13.5c crude oil levy and a 6.15c excise. Since December 1981 the Federal Government has increased the crude oil levy by 1.94c per litre, or by a massive 17 per cent. Additionally, over the same period, the Federal Government increased its excise tax take by 19 per cent. These extraordinary and, I believe , irresponsible increases in owner-driver costs are occurring in the very same period that owner-driver revenues are collapsing because of the lack of economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether the Government has any idea of the personal distress these policies are causing the small business sector. I have already referred to the spectre of bankruptcy which is haunting that sector and, in particular, the owner-driver industry. I wonder whether the Government has any idea of the hazards the distress causes in the wider community through, for instance, the road toll. I refer particularly to the safety factors involved here. State police forces have repeatedly drawn our attention to the dangers of unsafe vehicles and exhausted drivers, of drivers being forced to cut corners in terms of vehicle repairs and maintenance, of drivers being forced to work incredibly long hours and so on. These factors create risks for the community, especially the country areas, which any responsible government would not tolerate. This Government is not only tolerating them but is also, as I have shown, introducing yet more costs which make them worse. I refer again to the crude oil levy, the excise taxes and the other costs imposed on this small business sector as an example of the burdens being imposed on the business community generally, with such dire effects on so many families. </PARA>
<PARA> Anticipating the response on these matters from the Government, I say that it is no use blaming State governments for this problem. Despite the recent increases in New South Wales, the owner-driver still pays more than 80 per cent of his total fuel tax liability to the Federal Government, as I have shown. The Prime Minister would be foolish to deny that it was his policies which forced the New South Wales Government into raising fuel taxes in that State. The Premier, Mr Wran, returned from a Premiers Conference and imposed these fuel taxes because he was not given an adequate proportion of the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> What can be done? A Labor government would examine seriously the possibility of a temporary exemption for the small transport operators and owner-drivers from the 6.15c Federal tax. I do not make any promises in that area at this stage because the matter has not been properly processed. But that sort of exemption was granted to farmers long before they began to face the problems of drought. We now have the absurd situation in the country of the farmer being granted an exemption and the hard pressed owner-driver who carts the farm produce having to pay the tax in full. In the longer term there is no solution to this problem which does not acknowledge the important and positive role which the Transport Workers Union has played and is playing in establishing more viable freight rates. But-again the irresponsibility of the Government is clear-the status of the owner-driver in terms of his right to join the representative organisation of his choice has been thrown into question by deliberate confrontationist amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Yet it is generally acknowledged around the industry that the freight rates negotiated by the Transport Workers Union have led to a considerable improvement in the well being of the owner-driver sector-a well being which is now being destroyed by the activities of the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have debates on the estimates in this form, we will paint a wide canvas and make these sorts of points. I welcome the opportunity to do so. I was not able to make a speech on the Budget itself. I use this example of the burdens on the smaller business sector as an example of the wrong economic policies being imposed by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, I would like to make some comments about the general direction Australia is heading economically and the need for various elements of the Australian community to seek to pull together so that in fact the productivity, profitability and way of life of this country is maintained and improved. In the year just concluded the average wage for Australians rose by about 17 per cent. Taking account of the shorter working hours as well as the additional wages paid, one can quickly identify industries which have received more, such as the printing industry, with an increase of 46 per cent, and the metal trades and building industries, with increases of 25 per cent or more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In total, Australians felt that they were worth 17 per cent more in money last year than in the year before. At the same time inflation rose at a rate of about 10 per cent for the financial year. So Australians are more than maintaining their disposable income. If one assesses the income for various levels of employment and various types of employment over a long period one can readily see that the net disposable income for Australians has been more than maintained and has done so over a considerable period. In no financial year has it been more than maintained than in 1981-82. I believe that the Australian community needs to realise that there are some generous aspects of the Budget-in fact, it is a generous Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The parts of the Budget that are directed to the wage and salary earner in general and to families in particular seek to provide assistance to meet increases in the cost of living over the forthcoming year. At the same time, if the Australian community continues to increase its demand on our resources, the wealth of the nation, our capacity to continue to function as an exporting nation, as a major trading nation, and to be basically self-reliant regarding basic commodities will be eroded and could be destroyed. The whole community is aware of the possibility of the loss of markets for coal, iron ore and other major commodities produced in this nation. There are two reasons for this- industrial disruption and increasing costs. The basic factor of increasing costs has been the increases in wages and salaries during the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget sets out to alleviate the situation of families which are facing higher costs of living and to provide the basis of moderate and reasonable wage settlements for the forthcoming year. The Budget provides many families with two -thirds or more of the income increase they need to cover inflation during the coming year. I will give a couple of examples. From 1 November the disposable income of a man on an average wage of $300 a week with a dependent wife and two children and with a mortgage on his house of roughly $30,000 will rise by $18 a week. This is after allowing for increases in indirect taxes. This, if one translate it into a wage rise, is an increase of perhaps 9 per cent. A reduction in the tax that an individual pays is much more advantageous than a wage rise of a similar amount. A disposable income increase and a reduction in tax which I am talking about is of greater benefit to the family and is equivalent to a wage rise of approximately 9 per cent. The inflation rate will be 10.5 to 11 per cent at the end of the year. The wage increase such a family needs to cover the increase in the cost of living is about 5 per cent for 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that members of this Parliament have settled for a salary increase of 7 per cent. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has recommended wage and salary increases for the Commonwealth Public Service of 5 or 6 per cent. I believe these are examples that should be followed by the rest of the community if we are to maintain our way of life, our competitiveness and our capacity to earn export dollars. If the community were to accept an average increase for the forthcoming year of 5, 6 or 7 per cent then I believe it would be possible for Australia to compete on world markets and resolve the economic difficulties in the nation at the moment. As I said, an increase of $18 in a family's disposable income is equivalent to a wage increase of $26 a week. Most families with incomes less than $300 per week or with more than two children will benefit even more than the family I have used as an example. They will have a greater capacity to offset inflation in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Those generous benefits are directed at people who most need them. They come on top of very substantial real wage increases for the past year. They will seek to supplement modest wage gains during the forthcoming year. It is to be hoped that the metal industries and the trades involved in those industries, the great manufacturing industries of Australia, the building industry and the export industries, will recognise that their employees will, as a result of this Budget , need only modest wage gains for the forthcoming year to maintain their average standard of living and, in fact, to continue the trend that has been obvious since this Government came to office. It has constantly increased real average wages. A man on average weekly earnings with a dependent wife and two children will have an estimated real net disposable income of $261 per week in 1982-83. This is an increase of $18 or 7.5 per cent from two years earlier. That is a very great increase in the take-home pay of families. This Budget has said to the Australian community: 'We need to be more moderate. We need to be more thoughtful of the eventual future of our own nation, our own employment and the employment prospects of our children'. This Budget seeks to establish a rapport with the people who contribute so much to the nation in the work place by ensuring that they will best benefit by significant moderation in wage claims in the forthcoming year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet I will confine my comments to division 516 which deals with the Public Service Board. In passing I will also make some comment on the Public Service generally. This morning the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced an inquiry into the Public Service. I can only say: ' What a farce'. Any problems in the Public Service have been caused by seven years of this Government, by its policy of reducing staff numbers, undermining morale, keeping a lid on the salaries of public servants and, now, of blaming public servants for the faults and the neglect of Ministers. The Public Service Board demonstrates in many ways what is wrong with the Public Service. I believe that the Public Service Board is reactive, with little vision, and this is directly because of the policies of this Government. It has spent so much of its resources and the time and resources of the senior staff on the Board in implementing the Government's staff ceiling policy and in dealing with one crisis after another. It is really the band-aid or crisis approach to public administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What resources and priorities has the Public Service Board or the Public Service generally been able to give in the last seven years to promoting efficiency and encouraging the adoption of modern personnel practices in the Public Service that has caused this Government to decide suddenly that they are so important? Why does the Prime Minister now suddenly see fit to introduce another inquiry into the Public Service? This is the fourth since he came into office. We had the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, the Bland Administrative Review Committee-now, of course, we will recycle one of the members of the Bland Committee into the new inquiry if he lasts out the day-the razor gang and now we have the new inquiry. When Dr Coombs, the Chairman of the Royal Commission, presented his report, he set out in great detail the problems of the Public Service. Honourable members should remember that this occurred in 1976 when this Government and this Prime Minister were in office. I will quote selectively from an article in the Canberra Times which reports Dr Coombs's speech to the Press Club. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It's time that we concentrated on the defects of Government administration and on measures to improve its performance . . . Australian government administration compares favourably with that of other countries and with most large organisations in the private sector . . . The raw material with which the system has to work is of good quality . . .</PARA>
<PARA> However the best of the top levels of the bureaucracy are men of capacity and vigour. They compare favourably with leaders of industry, commerce and the professions . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Effective government requires a partnership between the political arm of government and the bureaucracy . . . I believe that within the Australian bureaucracy there are men and women of dedication and capacity struggling for a chance to serve Governments and community more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>These statements were made in 1976. Dr Coombs identified problems in the Public Service-there is no doubt about that-but his recommendations tried to come to grips with those problems, particularly with the aspects of morale, trying to get the best out of individuals, and the government arm working closely with the bureaucratic arm. Those recommendations are all in his report. They are still there today and they are still as relevant. The real problem is the fault not of the bureaucracy but of the Government because it has done nothing to implement those recommendations, except to instigate, the razor gang report and now another one. The Commonwealth Public Service is over-reviewed. It has spent so much of its resources reviewing itself. Why do we not just get on with the job of doing something constructive with the Public Service and improving its morale ? In a moment I will give some recommendations on how we can do that. The problems have been there throughout the seven years of this Government. They have been reinforced by this Government. They have even been identified in the Public Service Board's annual report. Page 1 of the Public Service Board's annual report for 1980-81 states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . public servants are used to being singled out for lampooning. </PARA>
<PARA>They ought to be used to it; they get enough of it in this Parliament. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>But it becomes at best tedious, and at worst destructive or morale, for public servants to be incessantly the target of generalised and sweeping criticism, especially when it is only too rarely that contrary views from any quarters are expressed and given publicity. </PARA>
<PARA>That has been one of the major problems that have led to the reduction of morale . We can solve many of the problems in the Public Service by treating public servants with respect. Sure, there are problems but many of those problems are caused by the neglect of Ministers, by the neglect of the Prime Minister and generally by the neglect of this Government. Did the Lynch razor gang, in bringing down its recommendations, do anything particularly constructive? No, its main emphasis was on cutting numbers. Then it moved in. One of its recommendations was to cut the staff numbers in the Australian Taxation Office. Of course, one year later the poor old Taxation Office is copping the blame for not telling the Treasurer (Mr Howard) about the tax avoidance and evasion schemes. However, one year ago the Taxation Office was told to cut down its numbers. Of course, a few months after that the Government realised that it had made a mistake and the numbers in the Taxation Office were reinstated. </PARA>
<PARA> How many people are really needed to keep reviewing the Board? In the Prime Minister's statement this morning he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Review in particular should take into account--</PARA>
<PARA>Let us just look at some of these issues that the Review of Commonwealth Administration will take into account, and maybe with my assistance we can get this review over with in one day. The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The need for the Public Service to have high standards and good morale;</PARA>
<PARA>I think we can solve that by having a few positive statements about the Public Service, by constructive leadership of the Public Service, especially from the Ministers and from the Prime Minister. The next items which the Review should take into account are:</PARA>
<PARA>The need for the Public Service to provide the professional managerial component of public administration; the need for the Public Service to possess management skills and to develop management structures . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts has just spent the last nine months looking at this question. I am a member of that Committee. It will be bringing down its report to this chamber in a few weeks. Its recommendations deal specifically with this issue. The Committee looked specifically at the training of senior managers in the Public Service. We had submissions from every department. We had submissions from the Public Service Board and also from the private sector. Some of the information from the private sector was very interesting. Many members of the private sector made the point that one just cannot carry over the standards of management of the private sector to the public sector. Yet we notice that all the members of this new inquiry have private sector experience. What do they really know about the Public Service? In fact, I would much prefer to have the Vice-President of the Executive Council ( Sir James Killen), who is sitting here in front of me today, as a member of that inquiry instead of these people just from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need in the Public Service is a change in attitude-not just a change in attitude of our public servants, rather a change in attitude by every member of this Parliament, especially members of this Government. We need to stop criticising public servants every time we open our mouths. We need to do something constructive in terms of their salaries. Sure, we need to look at management structures, but that is already under way. There is absolutely no point at all in having a further inquiry. Why was the Government not very frank when it made its statement this morning? Instead of giving us six pages of justification for this new review the Government should have simply said: 'Look, the public servants are going to be made the scapegoats once again for our faults and our deficiencies. It is popular throughout Australia to lampoon the Public Service, to criticise the Public Service. Let us hope we can pick up some electoral advantage by blaming the Public Service for our mistakes'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable members. Some of the areas that this Government could give its attention to relate very much to the Public Service Board's annual report. The Public Service Board, in fact, is supposed to do the job that has been set out as the role of this new, special, three-man team which is now supposed to be conducting the fourth Fraser review into the Public Service. This is the body that is supposed to be looking at the management techniques and morale of the Public Service.The real problem is that the Public Service Board has not been able to do that because it has had to confine all its attention to looking at staff ceilings. The Board, in fact, instead of having a support role in the Public Service has taken on the role of being really a sort of enemy, the arm of the Government, there just to implement Government policies, not to be supportive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One way in which I think we could constructively change the role of the Public Service Board would be by taking away from the Public Service Board its role in determining staff ceilings. I believe that there is considerable duplication in the Public Service Board looking at staff ceilings. I believe that functions to a great extent is currently carried out anyway by the Department of Finance. I would much prefer to see a system whereby the Department of Finance took sole responsibility for staff numbers in the Public Service and linked them specifically to money. I think it is a crazy system that we have today when, under staff ceilings, we see reductions not in the Third Division or the Second Division but in the Fourth Division of the Public Service. I think that in the future we should see staff numbers in the Public Service linked with salary budgets for each department. In that way there could be much greater flexibility in how each department is staffed. </PARA>
<PARA> A second way of improving morale within the Public Service would be for departmental heads to have more flexibility in staffing the Second Division. I think that if we were to break down some of those strict structures in the Second Division we would then see greater flexibility on the part of the departmental heads. Departmental heads might be able to manage their departments instead of having to be consistently involved in Public Service procedures in relationships with the Public Service Board. These are just two measures that I think would loosen up the Public Service management structures, making the Public Service more responsive to the community. Thirdly, I think that we must do much more for the upper levels of the Third Division. It is necessary to identify people who are potential departmental heads. They need to be encouraged . They need to be given a balanced development. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these matters will be dealt with in very great detail by a report of the Public Accounts Committee which, as I foreshadowed, will be tabled in this chamber in a few weeks. I think this highlights the fact that so many of these issues have been examined and overexamined. The time has come now to stop just talking about what is wrong with the Public Service or what can be done in the Public Service. Let us do something about making our Public Service more responsive to the government arm. More importantly, let us do that in a constructive way and not use the Public Service as a scapegoat for government maladministration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council are departments of some stark contrasts. One is a department in name and the other is a department which has very extensive responsibilities in relation to the management and leadership of the country, and the provision of co-ordinating and structural support to the Government and to the people of Australia. Unfortunately leadership is totally lacking in this country at the moment. It is lacking to such an extent that Australia is in a time of crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a period in which there is need for example to be set and leadership provided. Unfortunately that is neither forthcoming nor capable of being given by the present administrator of one of these departments, namely, the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He is a person whose political activities basically have division as their foundation. He promotes division. He exploits situations to the disadvantage of others and provides an example of leadership which is to the disadvantage of the nation. His example is certainly not what Australians collectively wish to do or to be seen to be doing. Occasionally good speeches are made about the need for Australians to pull together. There is a massive Government public relations unit which serves the Prime Minister. Unfortunately none of those resources can have credibility or any degree of efficiency or competence while the leadership is devoid of that credibility, and deservingly so. </PARA>
<PARA> This is unfortunate at a time when many Australians are suffering from burdens which they believe are unfair. Whilst it is easy for an honourable member in this House to stand up and talk about disposable incomes being increased at a rate greater than the inflation rate I suggest that that honourable member would not find many people who work for wages in this community being included in the real levels of average wages in the community as distinct from those stated by the statisticians. Some 70 per cent of people receive less than the average wage . I am sure the honourable member who makes that point will not find much support amongst those people when he states that they are now able as a result of a combination of salary increases and inflation to purchase more goods this year than last. That is humbug. It may be statistically provable, but it is not true. It is a truism that statistics lie. It is certainly not provable that those people in the lower income groups in this community as a result of the leadership-</PARA>

That Department is led, at least notionally , by the Prime Minister who is the senior political figure in this country. He is the person whom we would expect to provide leadership but who fails to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to draw attention to certain expenditures not included in the estimates of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, but spread throughout other departments. These expenditures should, but do not, appear in the estimates of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet because they are for purposes such as overseas trips. I am not arguing either for or against that expenditure. I am merely saying that it is not properly reflected in the departmental estimates. It has been the Prime Minister's practice in the past to compare the estimates of former Prime Ministers in these areas with the estimates and moneys provided for his own Department, where they are not comparable. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that there is an enormous public relations organisation which is now responsible to and operated by the Prime Minister and which has some of the highest salaries available anywhere in the community. This is occurring at a time when the Government talks about restraint and the need for minimising expenditure. The whole of that operation is not for the purpose of advancing the work of the Government of Australia but is for the purely political purpose of advancing the interests of a political party or a political group. That is not a proper expenditure of funds. It is not an expenditure of funds which appears under its proper category in the Estimates before this Parliament. Australia is in a state of crisis. On so many occasions we have seen campaigns mounted with public funds in order to mislead the Australian people. These funds have been provided out of Budgets and Estimates and put into operation by an enormous public relations organisation which is sponsored and funded under the Prime Minister's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make one other point in relation to the Government's treatment of public servants. This is very specifically within this area. Over a period of time there has been a massive assault on the credibility and honesty of public servants in Australia by members of this Government. They have never failed to use public servants as a whipping boy and Aunt Sally for their own political purposes. They are now seeking to blame public servants for their own lack of credibility and responsibility. The Prime Minister recently said that senior public servants should be satisfied with a certain level of salary. I do not dispute the accuracy or otherwise of that statement. The level is certainly less than that which would have been assessed by a tribunal operating freely and not under political pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently in this House we were told that a person would be appointed to act as a special prosecutor. I ask honourable members to remember that the levels of salary recommended by the Prime Minister for his senior public servants apply to such persons as the Solicitor-General, who is said to be the senior Public Service law officer in the land. No person could have been obtained for the position of a special prosecutor at the level of salary paid to our most senior and therefore most responsible public servants. That could suggest that the Government is prepared to misuse the capabilities and values of the Public Service but when it needs someone to cover up or to get it off the political hook it finds it necessary to pay considerable greater salaries to attract someone from outside. I suggest that if the Government wants a competent administrative structure in this country it should provide leadership and give support to the Public Service. It should not seek to pass blame from itself to the Public Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we are now debating the estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs outside a question and answer situation, I think we will have to cover more of the general ground. The Senate appears to have the opportunity to ask detailed questions on expenditure. At the outset, I appreciate the difficulties that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) has in this area because it seems to be an area where everybody else will take the ground from him if they think that is the way to attract public attention, not least amongst those people being the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). In fact a number of areas of our foreign policy and foreign representations come under the Prime Minister's wing. On matters such as nuclear safeguards which come within the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in my view- no doubt he will not agree with me-the Minister is overshadowed by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) who looks after overseas trade. In other words, the National Country Party takes a very keen interest in such matters. Yesterday, the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony), as Deputy Prime Minister, made a strong attack on the Australian Labor Party's uranium policy, and that was immediately followed by what was deemed to be a supportive statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on nuclear safeguards. How counter-productive that is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Deputy Prime Minister with his persuasive powers is able to sell uranium to Finland knowing full well that it will be enriched and perhaps reprocessed in the Soviet Union. I wonder how that squares with the stance of the Government on other matters in relation to the Soviet Union? We have virtually boycotted the Soviet Union in a number of areas-quite fairly in relation to its invasion of Afghanistan-but it is a bit ridiculus to talk about trade in such a sensitive area as uranium enrichment and reprocessing and perhaps at another level to suggest that it would be wrong for our athletes and swimmers to compete in the Moscow Olympic Games. I think this question of where we stand in relation to such policies brings us into much disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it again to the Government that it is about time that Australia had a foreign policy which represented the aspirations and views of the Australian people. Quite clearly, by a majority the Australian people felt that we should have participated in the Moscow Olympic Games. It had nothing to do with the politics of the Soviet Union. International sporting arrangements do not have anything to do with politics. So, why did we politicise them? It was done because apparently President Carter of the United States felt that that was the way to go. I think this is the problem that I find as spokesman for the Opposition in trying to identify the role that Australia sees for itself. Its role is certainly not to follow what Presidents of the United States do because they do many things and there are many presidents. </PARA>
<PARA> The significant thing about the Fraser Government is that it religiously follows whatever the foreign policy of the United States may be, which is not always the policy which suits us. It does little for us to have in Moscow an ambassador whose hands are tied because our policy is virtually one of opposition to the Soviet Union. Our ambassador in Hanoi is in a hopeless position when our policy is not to give Vietnam any aid. Is that in our interest ? Do we really gain any credit from China or from anywhere else by suggesting that we will be as hostile to Vietnam as the United States wants us to be?</PARA>
<PARA> If that sort of consideration is to dominate our foreign policy, which in turn- in all fairness to the Minister-is dominated by the Prime Minister, should we not look at what is happening in the Department. More than 1,000 people are employed in the Department of Foreign Affairs, at a cost to the taxpayer of $25m . They expect a fair result and would get it were the Department given some strength and initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that I would be wrong to raise an article by Teresa Mannix which appeared recently in the Canberra Times. It stated that there was widespread unease about the effectiveness of the Foreign Affairs Department. The officers in that Department were so concerned about their career prospects that they wrote to the Secretary to the Department. They alleged that up to 20 per cent of ambassadors are not sufficiently competent to hold their jobs and that the speeches delivered by the Minister were sometimes lacking in vision. I agree with that, but I always thought that was due to the Minister and not to his speech writers. I am not being personal when I say that; I understand that he has a blinkered position because of the dominance of either United States policy or the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, the plea of Foreign Affairs employees to their own departmental head is that they want to work for a strong, sure and efficient department led by officers whom they are able to respect. I will not say any more about that view of the staff of the Foreign Affairs Department. I have no doubt that there is an answer to it. It is fairly significant in that they know full well that they have not been able to get the best out of their Department because it is superimposed by some other area. In the nuclear area it is superimposed by the National Country Party's dominance of trade. Certainly Australia's international policy seems to be devoid of any initiative because of having to be subservient, whether to the United States or somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the problems that we are now facing. In my view, and in the view of the Opposition, it was never in our interests to commit ourselves to United States policy in the Middle East without a guarantee that there would be some solution to the Palestinian problem. Everybody is quite fairly and properly saying that the massacre of innocent women and children in Palestinian camps is dreadful, the most recent one being a few days ago in West Beirut. As the Minister knows, I made representations to him about a massacre on or about 2 July in another camp when allegedly large numbers of women and children were killed. That information came from World Vision in Australia. I think the sources were reasonable and rational. The man who made the submission to me had been there. He said that he thought there was something genocidal about the way the attacks were always on the refugee camps of the Palestinians because allegedly that was where the arms may have been. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, the invasion of Lebanon cannot be pardoned at all, never mind the invasion of West Beirut. To go into Lebanon was wrong. Nobody has done anything about it except wring their hands and say how dreadful it is. I was swayed when I heard a Muslim Lebanese person saying what a dreadful thing it was for the people of the United States to have to acknowledge that all the deaths of the women and children were due to United States armaments. He asked: 'Would it not give them a sense of conscience?' He is right. The point about the Middle East policy is: Why are we always so reluctant to criticise? In my view, the best the Prime Minister could offer was to think that the only thing for the Israelis to do was to invade Lebanon. We really want to see Israel in peace as an independent state, but it will not be able to do that unless it solves the Palestinian problem. What about an Australian initiative? We were so subservient that we committed troops to a Sinai peacekeeping force, and ever since we made the commitment there has been nothing but war in that area. It was very clear that if Begin's southern flank were safeguarded he would invade Lebanon. The United States knew that. Everybody here expected that. Begin does not always represent the best interests of Israel. Perhaps the sooner he goes the better it will be. But how important it would have been for an Australian Foreign Minister to say to the United States: 'In the interests of peace in the Middle East, we do not think that we should agree with your short-sighted view'. That is just a sample of what happens if the Government does not understand what its own nation wants. The majority of Australians deplore the massacres and deplore war. They would offer a peacekeeping force that would guarantee the Palestinians an independent homeland on the West Bank in accordance with the Camp David provisions. But that will never happen. All we read about is the misery and the difficulties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to make a few comments and observations about my recent visit to Israel, which included a period of less than a day in Lebanon. This took place in June during the recess. I had not been to Israel before. I had not really had an all-consuming interest in that country , although I had an inquisitiveness about it. I thought I would take the opportunity of visiting that country, and as it turned out my visit occurred shortly after the Israeli defence forces moved into Lebanon. The Australian Government contributes to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon-UNIFIL-and to one other peacekeeping force in the area, in the Sinai. The latter contribution is a very real one in terms of manpower and equipment, whereas the UNIFIL contribution is one of funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is appropriate to re-examine our commitment to some of these peacekeeping forces. In my view, UNIFIL fell down in two areas. Firstly, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and its sympathisers continued to shell northern villages in Israel and to undertake terrorist activities despite the UNIFIL presence. That must have aggravated the Israelis to the point where they felt justified in moving into Lebanon. The second point about UNFIL is that the Israelis, having taken that decision, virtually ignored what establishments there were in the UNIFIL area. The world media produced a considerable amount of pictorial evidence that the Israelis had just swept past the UNIFIL lines. I think it was only one small contingent of Nepalese that in any way attempted to lodge an objection to their moving through. I think the Australian Government should examine the effectiveness of some of the forces that it contributes to. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say, as a first time visitor to Israel, that I was enormously impressed with the case that it has, just on pure geographical considerations. When one stands on the edge of the Golan Heights looking into the northern villages of Galilee and across to the Christian occupied area of Lebanon one realises what an extraordinarily short distance is involved. One has to see to believe that there are bomb shelters within virtually a few metres-walking distance-of every kibbutz, every settlement. Around the pre-schools I saw bomb shelters that had been set up to enable the children to continue their kindergarten and school education irrespective of the bombs and rockets falling. I would suggest to anybody who has not been to the area and who is interested in the question that he visit Israel if given the opportunity to see how difficult the situation must have been, particularly in the northern area. I can certainly understand the Israelis not wishing to give up the Golan Heights for purely strategic reasons. There is, of course, another force on the border there. When I visited the border area of the Golan Heights and Syria I was again struck by the outward appearance of ineffectiveness of what I think is merely an observer force. </PARA>
<PARA> My visit to Lebanon was not predictable. It was suddenly made possible by the IDF at very short notice. It was interesting that many of the claims made by the people I talked to in Israel-in the government, in the defence forces and in the foreign affairs area-certainly appeared to me to be confirmed. They claimed, of course, that they had made every effort to be extremely selective as to the targets that they moved in on. I visited the town of Nabatiyet. One could see with one's own eyes that the Israelis had been selective, to the point where one would find one shop front that had been completely annihilated and yet two shops away one would find a new installation of plate glass, still with the paper crosses on it to indicate that it was new glass, that had been untouched. I was there literally only 48 hours after the Israelis moved through. Inevitably some civilian targets become subject to damage. There was the odd hit on schools and hospitals but I must say that from what I saw it was borne out to me that the IDF had made every effort to concentrate on known PLO positions. There had not been-certainly in that instance-indiscriminate shelling or selection of target areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise in visiting Beaufort Castle I got a very good appreciation of the strategic advantage that the PLO had in that area. It could launch rockets well over the Christian controlled area of Lebanon into the northern Galilean villages. Again one had to ask: What is the point of a United Nations involvement there when such a force was either incapable of preventing this sort of action by the PLO or felt disinclined to make an issue of it?</PARA>
<PARA> I also visited a very interesting gentleman on the recommendation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). I refer to Mayor Freij of Bethlehem. Whilst some people said that the Israelis would not be very enthusiastic about my talking to Mayor Freij, that was certainly not the case. The Israelis were quite happy to arrange the visit if necessary, to take me there and to bring me back again. Mayor Freij is a very sensible, rational, moderate Palestinian. He is the elected Mayor of Bethlehem. On the day on which I visited him he was having a meeting with other West Bank mayors. Their attitude towards the invasion of Lebanon, whilst critical of it, was that it was somewhat inevitable given the situation that Israel had been put in and given the postering and the position that was being taken by Prime Minister Begin. Indeed, it was Mayor Freij who told me that he had recommended to Arafat that he should withdraw from Beirut. I point out that that was in the very early days of the invasion of Lebanon-some four or five days or perhaps a week after the initial action had been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Israel must recognise that the Palestinian problem of finding a homeland must be reconciled. I do not believe that it is realistic for the Israelis to continue making excuses, to say that the Palestinians should be accepted by Jordan. To my mind there must inevitably be some sort of accommodation for the Palestinians on the West Bank. I do not believe that that is necessarily a position of weakness; I think it is just a fact of life that the Palestinian problem will not go away. There are moderate people in the West Bank-sensible people, non-extremists, people who are not interested in being in any way associated with the PLO or its activities-who I imagine could be consulted and with whom meaningful negotiations could occur about a homeland in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the commitment of the Government and, indeed, of Australia to United Nations forces should be carefully examined. I do not think they should be taken lightly. I think the effectiveness of the forces-I refer again to UNIFIL-should be assessed very carefully before our commitment is either undertaken or necessarily continued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to respond to remarks made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie) and also to make one or two points about an aspect of the estimates which relates to our United Nations delegation and our participation in arms control discussions. I will deal first with the question raised by the honourable member for Calare. I was very disappointed by a number of things he had to say about his visit to Israel and I will refer to them in a minute. But first of all, my specific criticism relates to remarks he made in connection with the Golan Heights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, like the honourable member, had the opportunity to visit Israel this year with a number of parliamentary colleagues, and, like the honourable member, I appreciated the assistance given to us by the Department of Foreign Affairs and also by the Israeli authorities. I agree with the honourable member in respect of some of the general propositions he made about the nature of Israel's security problems. I think however that a somewhat different perspective is required, particularly at this time. I was very concerned to hear the honourable member say that during the course of his visit he had gone to the Golan Heights. In Israel, travelling not as a member of any formal parliamentary delegation but as individual members of parliament, we had put to us very strongly that the Department of Foreign Affairs and by implication, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), was most concerned that Australian politicians visiting Israel should appear to give de facto recognition to the seizure and incorporation of the Golan Heights which took place a few months earlier, in the latter stages of last year. This position was quite correctly strongly opposed by this Minister for Foreign Affairs. We studiously avoided invitations to go on to Golan Heights. We were perfectly well aware of their strategic significance to Israel. We did not actually need to go on to them to see that, and I am a little disappointed that the honourable member did that. I am also disappointed that he went to Lebanon. A similar offer was made to us and we were quite firmly of the view that one does not visit other people's countries unless one does it through the normal channels. A member of parliament does not do something in another country of a semi-official nature unless one has an invitation to do so. I was disappointed with his remarks on those two grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think one is any real friend of Israel these days if one is consistently reminding the Israelis of their difficult strategic geography. The Israelis really need an alternative perspective on where their security lies, and one or two other points need to be made to them. One of those points is that the Israeli Government presides over the fourth most effective armed force in the world. Israel's neighbours are nowhere near it on the list of effective armed services. For all practical purposes Israel can put more planes into the air at 24 hours' notice than can the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries in Europe. When we consider the incapable nature of the armed forces of countries around Israel, irrespective of the difficulties with early warning that the Israelis have, that is a very formidable capability indeed. What is required more than ever is that the people who consider themselves to be Israel' s friends start to point out quite clearly to Israel that Israel is and has been for some time perfectly secure within the region. What is now necessary from Israel's point of view is no longer the pursuit of political solutions by military means but the pursuit of a final and conclusive peace in the area by the astute efforts of Israeli diplomats exercising a degree of goodwill towards their neighbours. I regret that the honourable member for Calare-this is evident from the remarks he made here-did not point out those facts to Israel while he was there. </PARA>
<PARA> In Israel there is an increasingly receptive attitude to that point of view. I think that politicians who visit Israel and who share the view of the honourable member for Calare-certainly it is my own view-that Israel has a perfect right to exist within secure and recognised boundaries in that region and that its neighbours ought to recognise it, will agree that that is no longer seriously under challenge in any military way and that what is necessary for the peace of mind of Israel in the long term is a more generous attitude towards its neighbours. In this regard I congratulate the Minister on changes in his policy, even though in the last few months I have criticised some aspects of the way in which his policy has developed. In particular instances I do not think he has been fast enough off the mark with constructive suggestions, but I congratulate him for shifting Australian policy in the direction of a rational solution of Middle Eastern affairs and exercising a preparedness-evidently in the face of some abuse-to pursue this objective. I hope that he will not be put off by any gestures of contempt, of calumny or whatever, that are heaped upon his head. I think that the views which countries like Australia may put forward to the Israelis at this time-no matter what may be said in return to them publicly-in the long term will have some impact if not on their policy makers, then on their domestic political processes. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I raise in relation to the estimates relates to arms control arrangements and Australian participation in arms control discussions, particularly Australia's role at the last United Nations General Assembly which discussed the matter. I have not yet seen an official report of our participation in those discussions, but it would appear that in a number of areas Australia was again obliged to press a viewpoint on to its principal ally. We were at variance in relation to nuclear test bans. I will be very interested to see whether that position was as effectively and strongly pressed as it has been in the past. The Minister may like to address himself to that point if he speaks later in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned before in this House, we have the certain knowledge in this country that nuclear test ban agreements can be verified. We have the capability within our own scientific establishments and resources to verify those agreements. We have pointed out that fact to the United States, to the Soviet Union and to other parties with a direct interest in the question of whether test bans are negotiated. We have also indicated this to those who have, to this point at least, tended to ignore or deny the fact that test bans are thoroughly verifiable. I very much hope that we pressed that point strongly again this year . That is only a small step, admittedly, but it is a very important step in the area of arms control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister made a statement in the House yesterday on another area of arms control related to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Rather than see a Minister come into the House and deliver what effectively was a cheerio speech for the non-proliferation treaty, what it has achieved and Australia's role in relation to it, it would be nice to see a Minister come into this House and state in detail Australia's objective in international arms control arrangements and indicate the weaknesses in such international arms control agreements. The non-proliferation treaty, a fine concept though it is and as effective as it has been in some cases, nevertheless has very glaring weaknesses which will become much more significant in the near future. Over the next decade we will find that a substantial number of non-nuclear powers in sensitive areas will become nuclear powers. We must resist that, particularly any such developments related to any area of the Middle East. What we would like to see is evidence from this Government that it takes its obligations in the arms control area seriously, not just to the point of agreeing with the provisions of those agreements that are already in place, by taking initiatives to strengthen those agreements to make them more effective. It would be a source of considerable comfort to people in this country, and I think a source of considerable relief to a large number of people in the international community. I can think of no better way of expending a substantial proportion of our Department of Foreign Affairs estimates than in that endeavour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Australia moves closer to its south-eastern neighbour, New Zealand, through the Closer Economic Relations Scheme, following the successful New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, I believe it is proper to remind the House of the very close association that the nation of Australia has had over many decades with the independent nation of Papua New Guinea. The success of this association between these two countries has been well documented in the past and I will not dwell upon it except to note that we do not now debate Papua New Guinea as we used to under the estimates of the Department of External Territories but we do so under the estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs. This transfer of sovereignty was achieved with enormous good will between the two parties. People on both sides of this Parliament have played important roles in their own fashion, including I might say Prime Minister Whitlam in his thrusting fashion and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who developed such a close relationship with Michael Somare and his Cabinet. I was privileged to represent Speaker Aston at the opening of Papua New Guinea's first Parliament-an occasion I will not forget. My interest in Papua New Guinea goes back to early 1943 when I arrived at Port Moresby as a very young fighter pilot. Subsequently I flew from the Trobriand Islands, Nadzab, just out of Lae in the Marbham Valley, Cape Gloucester in New Britain, Tadji or Aitape and Hollandia, now in West Irian. I mention these areas because naturally over the last 20 years I have tended to return to see for myself the exciting developments that have taken place in areas that I knew so well. Over many years I have visited, for instance, the oil palm projects at Talasea and Cape Hosking-because I used to strafe those areas. I visited coffee and tea plantations and saw how they developed on the highlands and elsewhere. I visited cattle projects in the Markham Valley. These are just some of the examples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make the point that today the younger generation of members of parliament, in their excitement to visit other countries on credits provided by this Parliament, tend to overfly small and important nations such as Papua New Guinea. I am perturbed that the new generation of members in Federal Parliament will not give attention to our very important neighbour. A quick look at our overseas aid program will show that many years ago 50 per cent of our overseas aid program was aimed at Papua New Guinea, and rightly so, as we helped it towards some form of economic independence. The World Bank program and its finance helped to produce rational development programs for that nation as did, for some years, financial agreements with Bougainville Copper Mines. Of course, in real terms the latter is not now donating the same proportion of funds to the Papua New Guinea economy. Today's proportion of our overseas aid to that country is probably somewhat less than 40 per cent, for good reasons which I will explain later. Obviously we expect an increase in Papua New Guinea's capacity to raise internal revenue to take up some of its total expenditure program. </PARA>
<PARA> How many honourable members in this chamber today would know whether the sum of $253m net bilateral aid last year-or an estimate of $264m of our aid in 1982-83- is warranted? In my opinion it is. No doubt the Department of Foreign Affairs, through our High Commission in Papua New Guinea, would say roughly the same thing. But is this chamber to be informed in the future on the progress of this important neighbour? During the 1960s and the early 1970s under the control of a previous member of parliament for the seat of North Sydney, et al, Mr Bruce Graham, groups of us returned to Papua New Guinea each Anzac Day. Originally the team of six split between Rabaul and Port Moresby after dawn services and we remained for a week to look at the development of that new nation, particularly the development in rural areas. Many of the areas we visited in those days were quite new, such as the higher rainfall areas of Mt Hagen. Each year, by repeated visits, we were able to comprehend change and more clearly see differences. A great many Australian members of parliament were able to see in those days how our aid, pumped directly into Papua New Guinea's consolidated revenue and not individually allocated to publicity seeking schemes as so frequently can be seen in other developing nations without much dovetailed planning, was successfully utilised. It perturbs me that today so few of the members of this chamber have any idea of our neighbour's progress or its difficulties, nor have they any base for comparative purposes. I believe that the Government, in consultation with the Government of Papua New Guinea, should plan frequent trips to that nation so that this chamber does not lose an important contact with a friendly and important nation. </PARA>
<PARA> About four years ago Sir Julius Chan perceived just this problem. At that time he invited the Government parties rural committee to visit his nation. We gratefully accepted that invitation and after a week of looking at new development projects in that area-I might add that some new and younger members of parliament on this side of the chamber were with me on that occasion-we were privileged to have a debriefing session with many officials around us before we left that nation. We discussed the difficulties of raising taxation revenue when so few of the areas had a cash economy. We discussed the repayment of World Bank Loans and other loans such as those granted by this nation. We discussed the problems and the pangs experienced by any new and developing nation. </PARA>
<PARA> All honourable members in this chamber have fond memories over many years of different aspects of our interests within Australia and around the world. But that debriefing session which we had in Papua New Guinea will stick in my mind for a long time to come if for no reason other than the sheer brilliance of the Prime Minister of that country at the time, Sir Julius Chan, of whom I have very fond memories and for whom I have great respect. How lucky it was for the development of that nation that when it obtained its independence its first Leader of the Opposition, that marvellous man Matt To Liman from New Britain, was so responsible and so friendly to people who came to view the problems of his country. Michael Somare was a marvellous Prime Minister in those early days. Indeed, the friendship between Michael Somare and Julius Chan assured a continuity of the democratic process so important to a developing nation where, let us face it, people in our language near enough to head hunters-people quite out of touch with their form of civilisation-were still discernible. Because of my very great interest in that area, which stretches over many years, I suggest seriously to the Government now, in case I do not have an occasion on which to do so in the future, that we must not lose the valuable contact that this nation has had with Papua New Guinea over many years. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking back, when I first entered this Parliament each year we could have a free trip to Papua New Guinea. Bear in mind that that country was under Australian sovereignty in those days and we could lay down such laws. Younger members of parliament went to Papua New Guinea during the winter recess imbued, no doubt, with the history of World War II. They watched that nation's development in those early days when I was a member of this Parliament. Those free tickets-if one can put it that way-do not apply any more. All honourable members, when they are able to go overseas, want to take advantage of their around the world air tickets. They want to go to Europe, to the Parliament of the European Economic Community or perhaps to South East Asia. But how many overfly Papua New Guinea on every occasion? I believe that this Parliament will be the worse if we lose the valuable contact that we have had with that nation over previous years. </PARA>

I am prompted by what the previous speaker just said about New Guinea. My notes show that the present Prime Minister, Mr Michael Somare, is asking for budgetary aid support and wants it maintained at its present level which, I am told, is $253m for the next two years. He does not want it decreased-as I understand the Government may do-by 5 per cent in real terms. I understand that all that has been said is that there will be a mid-term review of that aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to support what the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) has just said about visits to New Guinea. I think it was very beneficial to be able to go there in those earlier days when we were first elected to this place. I think it is a shame that, apparently because of other developments, that has not been maintained. I think those visits were important and in our own interests. I want to support fully the honourable member for Wakefield in what he said. I would also like to mention that in those earlier days when we were in Opposition and about to take government there was an objection to the fact that one of our policies was to give independence to Papua New Guinea. I think the reason was that prior to that the territory had always been under the control of the National Country Party. It never seems to want to part with anything. I am happy to say that when my colleague, the present honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison), became the appropriate Minister, independence was granted. I am delighted to know that the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) is in the chamber. He carried on that task in a very excellent fashion indeed. I think that did great credit for Australia. It is rather significant that we can have immediate telephonic communications with Papua New Guinea, yet we do not seem to be able to have the visits, which we ought to try to maintain. So much for the question of aid. </PARA>
<PARA> Without trying to detract in any way from those essential remarks, and leaving aside Papua New Guinea, I wonder what is happening to aid programs. I really think that we have to do something about the matter in a number of ways, not the least of which is, for example, connected with the Australian Council for Overseas Aid. Fifty non-government agencies are dividing limited funds. I also mention the International Planned Parenthood Federation. We contribute to four separate population control programs. We give different sums of money. I wonder whether we could not put the money in one direction rather than trying to spread it simply because those other organisations exist. Should we conduct some review of what we do with our aid? At present we support 33 multilateral programs. It seems that we have a shot gun arrangement to try to guarantee that at least some of the money lands in the right place. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matters I am anxious to mention, which I also did yesterday, relate to Vietnam. I think it is important to regional stability that we talk about aid to the people of Vietnam. They need it, they are entitled to it and they certainly qualify for it. In the early part of the week we were discussing the Asian Development Bank. Again, Vietnam has been prevented from getting aid to which it is entitled. That is quite counterproductive. I reiterate that it just drives the Vietnamese into the arms of the Soviet Union. I understand that Prince Sihanouk is going to visit Australia in the next couple of months. We do not mind his making that visit. But if it is made on the basis that he effectively represents the Khmer people, I very much doubt-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nevertheless, there has already been a suggestion of a tripartite coalition to represent the legitimate aspirations of the Khmers. I very much doubt it. While recognising that Sihanouk was around in the time of Pol Pot, he could not do very much; in fact he was a prisoner. In my view, after discussing matters with the people in the refugee camps, I found he does not any longer have the support of the people. It is wrong and counterproductive to be suggesting that we are helping in any way Kampuchea, good future relationships, or the withdrawal of the Vietnamese Army from Kampuchea, by suggesting that there be some coalition including the Pol Pot regime. That is a genocidal regime which is not entitled to any support at all. Honourable members should bear in mind that two Australians were murdered by that regime. I think it is important that we get our priorities right. If we are to invite Sihanouk that is fine, but I think at the same time it might be helpful if we arranged a visit from Nguyen Lo Thach, the Foreign Minister of Vietnam, even on a private basis, if the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) wants to put it that way. The issue is of importance to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I like to think when we are talking about this matter that we should emphasise the responsibility we in Australia have in our own region. The matter certainly relates to Papua New Guinea first and foremost. It certainly relates to South East Asia and to the Pacific Basin communities. In the law of the sea and other essential matters we are able-and I want to see this continue-to develop leadership potential; we should not follow somebody else's view. I think we should also be talking about joining the Latin American Development Bank. Despite some of the problems there might be with regimes in Latin America, there is an opportunity across the Pacific to develop effective trade and investment. I think there is a potential in that area for our commerce. With those few comments I urge the Minister to take those remarks on board to guarantee that when we are discussing these important matters in future we can have more bipartisanship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to make some comments on the speeches made by each honourable member participating in this debate. First of all I would like to refer to a couple of points made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) in his first intervention. I will come to his second intervention later. I would like to assure him and the Committee that Australia's foreign policy is determined in Australia for Australians. It is not subservient to anyone. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition seems to return continually in this context to his anti-United States theme. Unfortunately that is a constant thread which seems to run through his comments on foreign affairs. There is a basic difference between being a consistent and reliable ally and being a subservient one. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition cannot bring himself or his Party to recognise or accept the difference. I think that is a great pity for the sake of Australia and her friends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other main point made by the Deputy Leader in his first intervention related to criticism of Australian participation in the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers. The fact is that the Egypt-Israel peace treaty is the outstanding achievement in the Middle East in recent years. It was crucially dependent on the return of the Sinai to Egypt. I assure the Committee and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that that plainly would not have happened without the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers being established. The greatest risk to the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty would be the collapse of the Sinai MFO. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition really does the cause of peace in the Middle East no service by his approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the remarks of the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie) who referred particularly to the care needed in committing Australian forces to peacekeeping operations throughout the world. I agree with the honourable member in that respect. I assure him that this is done. I was interested also in his general comments on the Middle East, particularly in relation to the Palestinian problem. This theme was taken up again by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). I was interested too in the comments that he made. He and I have exchanged some correspondence on the same topic. This situation-even judging by the comments that have been made in this debate-is very near the top of the table when considering issues of current foreign affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member made some comments about Australia's position in arms control. This is not the time to go into detail, but I draw the honourable member's attention to the statement that I made before the United Nations special session on disarmament a month or two ago. He mentioned particularly the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the general problems relating to the spread of nuclear weapons. He urged initiating moves to strengthen agreements in that respect. I draw his attention to Australia's specific support by way of detailed programs in the International Atomic Energy Agency. Details of those specific projects are available in the Budget Papers or from my office. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) referred to Papua New Guinea. He also referred, in that respect, to the smooth transfer of sovereignty. There is a great deal of good will between the two countries. In that respect he paid tribute to my predecessor, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). I have much pleasure in doing that as well. It is true that Australian members of parliament visited Papua New Guinea in earlier times a great deal more frequently than they do now. He is correct in saying that this enabled them to assess the results of Australian support to that country. I agree with him that it is important for these links to be maintained. I join with him in urging all members of this Parliament, when they have an opportunity to do so, to visit Papua New Guinea. Such a journey may require some organisation, but my office and Department would be very happy to help any members of this House in any way in making a visit to Papua New Guinea easier and more productive. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's second series of comments in relation to this debate. I take up the point that he raised about the recent request for aid by the Papua New Guinea Government. I thought that it might be useful for the House if I made clear the foundation on which aid is presently based. A report by Sir John Crawford established the base amount. The time of the agreement was to be five years and the terms were that, on the assumption that there would be an inflation rate of 10 per cent, there would be a reduction of 5 per cent in real terms each year in the amount of aid provided by Australia to Papua New Guinea. The Papua New Guinea Government has now asked that the review of that program, that was originally scheduled after 2 1/2 years for mid- term which is the middle of next year, should be brought forward. The Government is now looking at the possibility of doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also referred to population control programs. I think he said that we contributed to four of them. It is true that there are many programs. The fact is that they are not common in the sense that they cover the same ground; they cover special ground. Whether one puts all one' s eggs in one basket, as the Deputy Leader seemed to suggest, or whether one tries to pick the programs which one believes have particular relevance in the circumstances for which they are designed and helps those programs with special characteristics is a difficult judgment to make. I accept it is a judgment that has to be made. There are many demands on Australian aid and we cannot fulfil all of them. Difficult decisions have to be made in relation to the ones that we do fulfil. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable members also referred to the need for aid to Vietnam. I think there is a basic difference of opinion between the Opposition and the Government . The Deputy Leader and I, I am sure, know each other's minds pretty well on this matter. The fact is that the Government will not reward Vietnam for its invasion of Cambodia. As for the Cambodian coalition, we are encouraged by its establishment. We are not clear what effect the coalition will eventually have. We have made it clear that we will not support any coalition which turned out to be the old Khmer Rouge with another face on it, or which operated as a vehicle for the return of Pol Pot to power in Cambodia. Nevertheless it includes men who are recognised as genuine nationalists and genuine patriots of Cambodia in Prince Sihanouk and Mr Son Sann. They would be welcome, as I interjected across the table to the Deputy Leader, in Australia in their private capacity. In conclusion, I make it clear that representatives of the Khmer Rouge in that capacity would not be welcome.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unfortunate that members of this House have not had the opportunity to go through the procedures which existed in the past couple of years whereby a committee hearing was held on these expenditures and questions could be asked of the appropriate Minister and his officials. The then Minister for Defence last year chose not to bring his officials. Information on the actual expenditures, what is expected to be achieved and what was achieved by the expenditures in the defence area could be provided directly. It was a procedure which was developing and unfortunately it has been terminated. We are in a situation now where we are making short speeches which are likely to remain unanswered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it should be made clear that, despite claims to the contrary, there has been a significant reduction in this year's Budget. The Government has claimed an increase in real terms in defence expenditure. It has also made some exaggerated claims in respect of areas of defence expenditure where it has claimed very substantial increases in funds have been made available. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we should examine the total defence vote which has dropped in its share of Budget outlays from an actual expenditure last year of 10 per cent to 9 .8 per cent. When compared with the estimates for last year, it has dropped from 10.1 per cent of its estimated share of government outlays to 9.8 per cent. There is an even more significant drop if one takes into consideration wages and salaries. Adjustments were made to Defence Force pay and conditions which had not been made for some seven years. One would think that this would have caused serious problems in any sections of the community other than the Defence Force. As a result of Government policy, those increases were in fact absorbed into the defence vote in the appropriations last year. The result was that the non-salary section of defence expenditure was reduced substantially in actual terms. The area of defence expenditure devoted to other than the payment of salaries dropped from over 50 per cent to a figure slightly below 47 per cent of the total defence expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very serious problems for the Defence Force in the equipment area. I am not talking about big budget glamour items which seem to get the headlines and have a greater precedence in Government thinking than the realities of defence needs. I would think the basis of an Australian defence policy would be to provide, firstly, an adequate defence capacity for Australia. That is obviously not Government policy. Some of the suggestions which have been made since the Falklands conflict seem to indicate that as long as they are able to get headlines it does not matter how irresponsible they are. In one statement the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair)-he has made about 70 statements since he became Minister in May and I find it hard to find anything of substance in most of them-suggested that we might replace HMAS Melbourne by buying an obsolete American aircraft carrier, launched in 1945, which would absorb about half our defence equipment budget in one year merely to get it steaming, and steaming is the operative word as it is not a modern vessel. It is suggested that we use the F111s as aircraft to fly off the decks. I presume we use the Army as stokers and therefore we would have a very unitary Defence Force. That is about the height of Government policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious deficiencies exist in much less glamourous areas of defence. Firstly, there is no Government policy on defence, no stated guidelines and nothing for the Defence Force planners on which to plan the development of the Defence Force or base its equipment requirements. Some very big budget items have been ordered in recent times. There have been massive deferments and a series of under- expenditures in equipment items since and including 1976. The 1976 White Paper on defence was substantive. The Opposition says it was a document which reflected a reasonable plan for Australian defence. At the time of its presentation to this Parliament it ceased to have any effect on Government defence policy or commitment. It was one of the typical announcements of defence policy which have come from conservative governments in this country. The policy was announced; a program was set out; certain basic requirements of the Defence Force were clearly spelt out and immediately forgotten. Three years after the five-year plan was supposed to have commenced there was an under-expenditure of over $1,500m. By the time the plan was replaced by the post-Afghanistan hysteria statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) it was two years behind; that is, two years behind after a four-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Afghanistan policy resulted in such statements as: 'We'll build 10 more Fremantle class destroyers. We'll do this; we'll do that'. The only thing that really came out of it was a massive advertising campaign and an increase in manpower in the reserves. It then came to a full stop. The Government forgot about it. It cut the defence vote again. It is now talking about the post- Falklands period. I think we ought to look at what the Falklands war taught us because the realities are that if Australia is placing itself in the position of learning defence lessons from one of the combatants in the Falklands war, it should see itself in the position of the defending nation and not the attacking nation. We are remote. Any country likely to attack us would be likely to undertake the same sort of exercise as the British did. We should examine the extent of the capabilities we would have to defend ourselves against a force similar to that which the British were able to put in the field. The main attributes of the British force were that it was highly professional and reasonably well equipped. Certainly it was not equipped to the most modern standards and the British had not provided adequate protection for their naval vessels. This fact also applies to this Government which, as a cost cutting measure, had decided prior to the Falklands crisis not to put defensive weapons on our FFG destroyers, thus making them totally vulnerable to any modern missile weapons system which could be carried by a relatively simple weapons platform. Because of the lessons of the Falklands crisis it has now been decided that that will be done. </PARA>
<PARA> What else have we decided? Are we going to buy a 1940s aircraft carrier? Are we going to put all our defence funds into Harriers? Is that a realistic assessment of Australia's defence needs when we have no surface to air missiles, no anti- tank weapons and inadequate transport capabilities within our Army? We have no early warning radar aircraft and tankers are still in the 'we're going to do it some day' category. Basic requirements of defence come before the big budget items. The follow-on destroyer program-half of our naval surface fleet in that area is subject to obsolescence in the next 10 to 15 years-is in limbo while the Government tries to find a way round having to comply with the recommendations of the Hawke Committee which it set up. It has decided to go to a half-way house . If the Minister for Defence reads the Hawke report-I hope he has-he will find it has said that on numerous occasions solutions were found and that the Department of Defence was good at finding solutions to the problems; its problem was that it could never implement them. Now another half-baked solution is being discussed rather than full implementation of a plan that has had come success. If the Government continues on its present path, we will be talking about building those destroyers when the present fleet is obsolete, long forgotten and gone to the breakers' yards. </PARA>
<PARA> This year, taking into account the under-estimated increases in wages, there is an actual increase in the non-wages section of the defence vote of 2 per cent. That represents a cut in real terms of about 6 to 7 per cent in the amount of money available for all expenditures on defence, including equipment, other than manpower. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address my remarks to a hearing that was conducted by the Sub-Committee which I have the privilege of chairing of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. First of all, I wish to comment on the effect that the decision of the Government as to whether it would buy HMS Invincible and now as to whether it will purchase an aircraft carrier will have on the funding of the defence forces generally. We must look at two alternatives . The first is the purchase of an aircraft carrier and the amount of funds that would be absorbed. If we do not go ahead with the purchase of the aircraft carrier, perhaps we will go back to some of the estimates of expenditure that we had previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The job of the Sub-Committee was somewhat unique insofar as it was based on a decision by the Senate that a term of reference be handed over to the Sub- Committee to examine closely and responsibly the desirability of the purchase of a new aircraft carrier to replace HMAS Melbourne. We considered that this was a term of reference with a difference as it was based on a decision of the Senate. We made every effort to create a balance in the sort of evidence that would come before the Sub-Committee. Let me explain the situation to the House and to the people throughout the nation who have found fit either to endorse what we have done or to criticise it somewhat harshly in one or two respects. I think that if I told the House the way in which we proceeded, then that would explain, perhaps a little more clearly, the way this Sub-Committee operates and the way it operated in relation to this matter. We felt that it was desirable, first of all , to obtain evidence at a very high level from those most involved-that is, the defence forces. Our first witness was a man who was about to retire or who perhaps had just retired as Chief of Defence Force Staff, Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot. We then called Air Marshal Sir Neville McNamara, Mr Pritchett and so on- people at the very high level. Their evidence was given, I think, honestly and with a degree of balance despite the fact that they have been associated with the decision to purchase HMS Invincible. </PARA>
<PARA> We then branched out into other fields. One witness who created a lot of interest was Air Vice Marshal Barnes. It is on one element of his evidence that I want to spend half a minute. He was quite critical of the role played and the actual capability of the Sea Harrier aircraft. He gave his evidence in a very forthright manner. He indicated that he considered that the Sea Harriers were not aircraft that played a very important role in the whole scheme of things generally. I am speaking personally now, not on behalf of my Sub-Committee. But I rather wonder, with hindsight, whether the Sub-Committee may have gained something by delaying the presentation of that report, perhaps, for another month. I put that proposition to the Sub-Committee members. They, in their wisdom-I was quite impressed by the arguments put forward-decided that there was not much to be gained by it, and perhaps there was not. I just rather wonder whether, if we had taken evidence based on at least preliminary reports of the Falklands experience, that might have influenced us but that is only that element of the report. I am not here to apologise at all for the report. I think it set out the position, as it was indicated to us, and as we evaluated the evidence which was received, I think at the very highest possible level, from people like Dr Bob O'Neill and so on. What I would say is this: There is the possibility that had we evaluated the evidence forthcoming from people who were involved, not only with the conduct of the Falklands conflict but also who actually participated in the Falklands conflict, then maybe the matter of the role of the Harriers may have been a little different. I would like to say that the Sub-Committee had no alternative but to come forward with the proposition that perhaps the purchase of the Invincible would have been of immense value. If one were a pro-aircraft carrier supporter it was a steal. Let me put the position quite frankly. But when one leaves that proposition and looks at the alternatives of, perhaps, paying for a fully armed aircraft carrier, with the aircraft that go with it, the radar systems and so on, then one could well be looking at $2 billion in expenditure. That would have meant that funds would have not been available for other very vital elements associated with the very difficult and complex defence of this country such as forward warning aircraft and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sub-Committee examined the evidence very closely. We had a very eminent consultant in Commodore Gray, so it was not just precisely and entirely the opinion and evaluation of the Sub-Committee members, although I must say that each man on that Sub-Committee had had a good deal of experience and was not entirely new to the process of looking at a defence situation and evaluating matters of that nature which we considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter I mention briefly is the matter of Norforce. I indicate to the Minister for Defence Support and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence (Mr Viner) that I, and I think many people who look at the defence of Australia from the point of view of the requirements of mobility and effective strike force, hope that Norforce eventually will develop into an operation of this nature. At the moment it is more or less an operation of patrol, surveillance and of using the abilities of people who know the area and who have the capacity to defend it realistically. I always have the concept in mind of this growing into a series of units or sub-units which would have the sort of mobility, strike force and adaptability which the Israeli forces had in earlier days and, let us face it, which the Vietnamese forces had. I refer to the capacity to know an area, to exploit it, to be sufficiently armed to defend it and to be readily available in a time of emergency to move quickly. I hope that the Government, in the course of time, will adopt as a principle the expansion of such a force. </PARA>
<PARA> I place on record the disappointment that I feel when I look at a concept of this nature, the requirements of defence in northern Australia and the vulnerability in a first impact situation in which we find ourselves in that area. I find it a little disappointing that we would decide to sell a camp such as the Sellheim Army camp. I rather wonder, if there were an emergency, and we wanted to set up a training area again, what we would do. Would we look for a new area? Would we just say: 'There are vast spaces; there is no damn problem there'. There is a problem. Sellheim Army camp served the forces of this country faithfully and well. Tomorrow the tenders close for its sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other thing I say is that I want to expose the activities of the Sub- Committee on Defence matters because I think it is a committee that works damned hard, has a great sense of responsibility and has an extremely bipartisan attitude towards things. I want, as I said, to expose its activities. We are going to embark now on our major term of reference and that is, to examine the situation as it exists, if I might get down to simplistic terms, in relation to the capacity to expand our training programs. We will inquire into where they go , how they should develop, where the deficiencies lie and so on. As a first move we will look at the Army. It has been somewhat neglected. I am sure that many of my Army friends who may hear my comments will know that we have not forgotten the Army. Today the Sub-Committee decided unanimously that it should embark on a very close scrutiny of the Army as it exists today and where we feel the deficiencies may lie. Time does not permit me to go further into these matters. I am rather conscious of the fact that this Sub-Committee plays an important part in the role of defence in this country. Our desire is to work with our defence forces and to be an addendum to what would be the normal channels of information available to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I quickly enter this debate to again draw the attention of the House to what I believe is a matter of considerable concern -that is, the future of Australia's aircraft industry. In August this year I led a deputation which consisted of blue and white collar unions to a series of meetings in this Parliament with the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and with representatives of defence committees of all parliamentary parties. We spent some considerable time with the Minister for Defence Support and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence (Mr Viner).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of our submission was to put to the Minister that the decision of the Australian Government to phase out the production of the Nomad aircraft and to discontinue its operation with a subsequent reduction in the very skilled work force in that industry could have a very severe impact on the future of the aircraft industry. What is contemplated is that there will be a reduction in staff in October this year of some 150 people. By 1984 there will be some 370 people lost to the aircraft industry. These are people with very specialised skills who in my view cannot afford to be lost. I have some sympathy with the argument advanced by the Minister that the Government found the finances involved in the future production of the Nomad excessive. The submission from the union delegation stated that there ought to be a continuation in production of some 20 aircraft-that is all that would be needed to keep the work force intact-while the Government rethought its position on the future of that industry. I have had a very lengthy three-page letter from the Minister. What concerns me is that nowhere in that correspondence does the Minister indicate that the decision to phase out the Nomad was taken on any grounds other than the financial problems involved in its production. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am concerned about is that if we are looking at Australia's total defence capacity we ought not to be making on such a basis important decisions about the future of an industry which has always been conceived by this Parliament- by all governments irrespective of their political complexion-as an industry which is absolutely essential to Australia's future defence capacity. I appreciate that there have been tremendous developments in the techniques and technology of aircraft production. What I am concerned about is that what is occurring in the aircraft industry is something like what is occurring in the automobile industry. Where we once had the capacity to produce a whole motor vehicle we now have an industry that produces part of a world car. </PARA>
<PARA> The tradition of the Australian aircraft industry is very fine. The industry has traditionally served this country well. It certainly did in the last war when it had the capacity to design and manufacture, and to see that our Air Force was equipped with, planes which served Australia in periods of armed conflict. I am concerned that if we reduce the overall level of skill and the state of the art in Australia we will face the situation where as a nation we will have the capacity to produce only part of an aircraft instead of being able to maintain what, in my view, is an important aspect of our defence industry, and what ought to be an important aspect for any government concerned to see that we have a defence manufacturing capacity capable of meeting any future defence contingency. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the initial problem by saying that the Government has had a scathing report from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which pointed out very serious deficiencies in the organisation and structure of the Government Aircraft Factories. To date there has been no response at all from the Government to the findings of that Committee. I would have thought that the very nature and terms of that report required a fairly immediate and important response from the Minister and the Government. More importantly, if what is being urged as a result of a very detailed examination of one major aspect of aircraft production is a major restructuring, I would not want to see that restructuring taking place just in terms of the isolation of the problems that beset Government Aircraft Factories. I would want to see any restructuring and reorganising of any aspect of our manufacturing industry in this vital area as part of a total thought through and well-considered Government strategy for the future of this industry. I suppose that is the essential thrust of my plea to the chamber on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> With great respect to the Minister, there is nothing in his letter to me to go to the unions which saw him which indicates that the decisions which have thus far been made were based on anything other than a fairly immediate short term response to financial problems. I can understand the pressures of that, but where is the strategy for the future of this industry? We now have a new Minister heading a new department concerned with defence manufacturing. Does the Minister see himself as having a role in terms of plotting the future strategy of defence manufacturing or does he see his role simply as sitting on and servicing the problems as they arise on a day to day basis? I believe that if Australia is to be self-reliant in defence esentially the emphasis and thrust of ideas within the Department of Defence, and this Government, and certainly within the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence-whatever view one might take of being part of a broad alliance-increasingly should be upon self- reliance in meeting any defence contingency. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately self-reliance means not a self-reliance in terms of our capacity to put aircraft into the air, to see that our Royal Australian Air Force personnel are highly trained and competent and there is no loss of training flying hours, but a continuing and thought through strategy about the capacity of our own manufacturing base to service those contingencies. I believe that the Government ought to review its attitude. I believe there should be no dismissals involving the very highly trained personnel at Government Aircraft Factories and I believe the Government should not merely respond to the Committee report in terms of the future of GAF. I would like to see a statement of strategy by the Minister for Defence, a strategy which involves some long term policy considerations. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the document relating to the submission made to the Minister by the deputation of unions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In any defence debate it is surely necessary to define what we are trying to protect before trying to decide how we are going to protect it. Our first responsibility must be to protect Australia and its Territories, which include the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Islands, 1, 300 miles and 1,000 miles respectively from the Western Australian mainland. Our second responsibility and one which most commentators decline to acknowledge is to assist, where necessary, our friends, allies and neighbours in this part of the world. If nothing else, this responsibility is conferred on us by our participation in the ANZUS agreement as far as American and New Zealand interests and territories are concerned. It is important to recognise that our regional defence responsibilities are very real indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is this second responsibility, that regional responsibility, that many people have trouble in understanding. Since the end of the Vietnam war 10 years ago there has been a defence philosophy in this country that Australia should withdraw to fortress Australia and ignore what is happening in neighbouring countries and territories in the nearby Pacific and Indian Oceans. Such a philosophy is fraught with danger. It ignores the realities of life in some 30 countries and territories within 3,000 miles of our shores. It is naive to believe that what happens in Papua New Guinea, Timor and Indonesia, for example, is not of vital concern to Australia. It is also foolish to believe that our defence starts at Australia's shores because the reality is that the defence starts as far as practical from the ground to be defended. Thus, the further from Australia's shores that we can commence to inflict casualties on an enemy, the further the reach we have the more difficult it becomes for that enemy and the greater the deterrent to him. </PARA>
<PARA> The largest of our neighbouring countries is Indonesia with a population of over 150 million people. Other major countries include Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. In the South Pacific area alone within that same 3,000 mile radius there are 21 states and territories with populations totalling more than two million people. To the south lies Antarctica with its largely unknown but no doubt important resources. To all these countries within this area we give leadership, educational and industrial assistance, trade opportunities, military training and equipment and, in most cases, friendship and assistance in times of trouble. We have a record to be proud of but, more importantly, we must face up to an increasing responsibility for the future of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the South Pacific area with its 21 states and territories. With few exceptions these islands have now acquired full or partial independence and with few exceptions they are now facing the isolation and difficulties which independence brings. They are looking for leadership and they are looking to Australia. Most importantly, recently they have sought assistance in the development of a Pacific economic community possibly along the lines of the Association of South East Asian Nations experiment, and Australia is expected to play a leading part. Papua New Guinea seeks continuing aid, and we are rightly giving it. Michael Somare has reaffirmed Papua New Guinea's dependence on Australia for military assistance should it require it. It certainly expects it and we would ignore such a call at our peril. None of the countries of the South Pacific can forget that these island states were used as stepping stones to Australia in World War II, and Australia should forget least of all as it was the eventual target. Most of these countries in the South Pacific have underdeveloped economies, limited natural resources, little skilled manpower and practically no defences. Generally they look to Australia for assistance in all these things and it is very much in our interest that their appeal be heard. </PARA>
<PARA> The countries to our north east are different in character. Some are more populous and more developed both in skilled manpower and natural resources. Nevertheless, they seek our aid and assistance. Malaysia, Taiwan and Singapore are becoming highly developed countries with strong economies. They require not so much aid as closer trading links and defence arrangements which are, of course, to our common advantage. The same degree of development cannot be said to exist in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Kampuchea and Laos. In these countries the need for assistance is as great as ever particularly in economic matters. In military matters we have a long history of involvement in the Pacific and in South East Asia dating from the Maori wars in New Zealand through the Boxer Rebellion in China, World War I and World War II, Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam. We still have Mirage fighters based in Malaysia. We take part in regional defence exercises. We have been involved in New Guinea for over 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst some of our military involvement has been criticised particularly in Vietnam, the point to remember is that we have always been heavily engaged in trying to secure peace and stability in this area. That involvement will only increase as the larger nations of the world, such as the British and the French, concentrate on their domestic affairs and the Americans look more and more to Australia to shoulder an increasing share of the economic and defence burden on our own doorstep. It does not seem to be possible to do what a lot of well- meaning but naive members of the Australian community wish-to pursue our own interests entirely whilst ignoring the hopes, aspirations and requirements of countries which share our corner of the world. We have responsibilities we must face up to, and it is in our interest to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to World War II we relied almost totally on Britain for our defences. In the event, in World War II Britain was unable to assist us in our part of the world. Since that war we have looked to the United States in the hope that the ANZUS Treaty might prove to be the solution to our defence problems. But important as the ANZUS Treaty is to Australia, the Falklands war should be enough to disprove the theory that ANZUS is not the total solution. The United States of America is not automatically committed to any country, no matter how close the ties. The first and foremost concern of any country, including the United States of America, is the pursuance of its own interests, and that is a lesson Australia should never forget. We are part of Asia and we are part of the Pacific. It is important that we play our part in this area of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> If we accept, therefore, that our regional defence responsibilities are not only domestic we should look next to what sorts of threats are posed to Australia-the threat of a full scale invasion, the threat of the occupation of a particular part of the country, the threat of guerrilla activity against towns or installations and the threat of terrorist activity against people or facilities. Sitting comfortably in Australia it is hard to imagine that any of these threats will really develop, but it is pertinent to ask how many of us had ever heard of the Falkland Islands six months ago, let alone envisaged a major war there. It is also relevant to note that the cause of the Falklands war was the run down in the British defence forces and the erroneous view of the Argentine junta that Britain no longer had the capability or the will to defend those islands. In short, when a country's defences are weak aggressors will always be tempted. </PARA>
<PARA> The defence forces of Australia, I believe, are in reasonable shape. I must say that the total amount of money spent in the Budget is somewhat disappointing in view of the fact that the real gain is about 0.8 per cent. The point I wish to make tonight in the short time available is that our defence responsibilities not only to our country but also to our nearby allies will increase and not decrease. I make the plea to the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) and the Government that any rundown in those defences in the long term will be disastrous for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very great shame that the way in which we must discuss defence matters in connection with this Budget means that we do not have the opportunity to cross examine in detail the Ministers and the officials who are responsible for having drafted it. This Budget is perhaps the most disappointing of a series of disappointing defence budgets that have been introduced in this place over the last four or five years. It represents without any real argument or any detailed announcement a substantial reduction in the Government's commitment to improving what might be described as the sharp end of Australia's defence forces. All the increase in this Budget can be attributed to anticipated increased costs in the manpower sector of the defence forces. In fact, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), those aspects of it which relate to equipments, installations and the like have suffered a real reduction in this Budget. This is at a time when there are very considerable needs in all three armed services. It is not a Defence Budget of which the Ministers who produced it can be proud. It is a Defence Budget which will create very substantial problems for this Government's successors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that we find in these appropriations very specific problems for my area of Australia, that is, Western Australia. While we had every reason in my home State to anticipate, as a result of the Government's decision to abandon the immediate purchase of an aircraft carrier, that there would be something for us in this Defence Budget, there is nothing in it at all that has not been announced earlier. In fact there is not even to be a speeding up of the construction of the air base at Derby, a construction which was slowed by Government decision earlier in this year precisely because it was necessary to factor into defence budgeting in the immediate future an amount for the purchase of aircraft carriers. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that you, Dr Jenkins, as a medical man and an amateur psychologist, would acknowledge, along with the rest of us, that human happiness is to a very considerable extent dependent upon a personal sense of security. One of the aspects of security, Mr Deputy Speaker, is familiarity. So, with that, and nothing else, in mind, I listened to an announcement by the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) in answer to a question from the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey) yesterday that he was giving very serious consideration to the speeding up of home porting at HMAS Stirling in Cockburn Sound. Of course, the familiarity that gave me such cause for pleasure and improved my own personal sense of security lay not in the fact that I actually believed that the Minister was going to do something about it but in the fact that it can be anticipated that, when an election is about to occur, that promise will be trotted out. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Committee to the statements made by the then Minister for Defence, the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Sir James Killen), in the 1977 election campaign. Two months prior to that Federal election, the Minister for Defence announced that two destroyers and two submarines would be home ported at HMAS Stirling by late 1979 or early 1980. It was then announced in the course of the 1980 election, when this had not occurred, that we could anticipate the home porting of at least one warship worth $200m by the time the next election came around. There have not been too many explanations offered by Defence Ministers over this dereliction in keeping to promises solemnly announced to the Western Australian electorate, but there has been one at least by the former Defence Minister. On 19 February 1980, when he was asked by a journalist why this hardy perennial promise had not been kept and was merely being trotted out repeatedly at elections he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, you know inexorably, . . . that with the cuts, and they have been inevitable, . . . But in areas its been a matter of seeking what at the proper priorities regarding resources made available . . . I am certainly not going to say how many ships will eventually be home ported there. </PARA>
<PARA>We are deeply grateful for that very clear explanation as to why there ought to be no home porting in Western Australia, but still we live in hope! We live in hope that perhaps one day an election promise will be fulfilled. Who knows-this might be the one-but I can assure the Committee that no honourable members from Western Australia are holding their breath on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Another feature in the context of Western Australian defence promises that is an absent friend from this Budget feast is the promise of the appearance of a patrol boat base on the north-west coast of Western Australia. It has been solemnly intoned by successive Defence Ministers that this would in fact eventuate in Western Australia. It appeared in the 1976 Defence White Paper as a promise to be implemented by 1981. In the 1980 Budget, it even made a guest appearance in the form of a promise to expend an amount of $250,000 on the purchase of a site in the north-west, but it slipped from that Budget as a useful saving. It has not made a guest appearance at this feast and therefore must be regarded as an absent friend. It can still be included in that category, as the friendly attitude of the Government towards it was expressed in just about every town of the north-west by the Minister in his first tour as Defence Minister through the area. There are now at least four towns up there that confidently expect that they will have a patrol boat base in the near future as the Minister, with a nod as good as a wink, indicated to them that each of them would get it. I would be very grateful if we got four patrol boat bases up there but I will settle for one, and I will settle for it appearing in a Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that one can expect that there will at least be a higher degree of honesty from some of the Government's advisers as to why that has not appeared than one might expect from Ministers interested in election promises. Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot, former Chief of the Defence Force Staff, was more candid on his retirement when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Navy will go without a patrol boat base in the north-west as long as they can, if money is short. I don't think the Navy has considered that a patrol boat base in WA is quite so vital as updating the base in Darwin and the base in Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA>I would give that argument a serious quarrel bearing in mind other priorities which have been established by the Department of Defence in public statements by Ministers over the years and which have accorded a far higher level of significance to the north-west of Western Australia than those other areas mentioned. Indeed, if one looked at the value of the offshore installations in Western Australia and how useful a patrol boat base is simply in terms of enforcing Customs regulations, if nothing else, in that area, one would see ample reason for a patrol boat base there to have priority over Cairns and Darwin-certainly enough priority to have made a little more than guest and absent friends appearances in Budgets since it was first promised in 1976. But I suppose that we can anticipate that as the next election rolls inexorably closer and the Government seeks futilely to save itself seats in Western Australia we will get more mewling and pewling performances from Ministers for defence somewhat similar to those of the Minister for Defence yesterday when he told the honourable member for Canning that the Government was looking very seriously at having ships home ported at HMAS Stirling a little earlier than 1984, but that terribly serious strategic considerations and budgetary considerations were associated with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the combat forces of the Royal Australian Navy, 12 destroyers, six submarines and 14 patrol boats are deployed or being refitted on the east coast of Australia. There is one patrol boat on the west coast of Australia. This Government is supposed to be reasonably committed to a two ocean naval policy. That situation is ludicrous. It certainly demands a higher level of genuine priority as opposed to deceitful promises at election time than this Government has so far been able to give it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise one or two matters which are of lesser significance than the total overall defence policy of Australia. But I want first to correct a matter which an honourable member raised earlier. Forward defence and assistance with the defence of our allies are a laudable aim. However, this is something that can be done if one has provided for one's own defence adequately first. I point to a statement made in 1938 by the then Prime Minister, Mr Joseph Lyons, about the security which Australia would enjoy because of the establishment of forward defence facilities in Singapore. I need say no more about Singapore. It is an aim but surely it is an aim of Australian defence policy that we should have at least some commitment to the basic defence of Australia, and that means a balanced development of capabilities within the likely requirements of defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to continue with general remarks. I want to raise one or two specific matters. They deal largely with the conditions under which Australian servicemen serve in peacetime. I mentioned a significant change in the wages and conditions of servicemen which took place last year and which was long overdue-I think everyone is aware of that-but which, we are also aware, placed extreme strains on the defence budget. Some time ago the means by which defence salaries were fixed were changed from what was previously a very cumbersome and slow process to one by which reference to a tribunal is made by the Minister. That tribunal reports to the Minister, who determines whether he will sign certain recommendations and they become a determination. I have said in the past and I reiterate that this is an improper way of fixing salaries. It should not be up to a Minister to decide whether the recommendations of an independent tribunal should become determinations. That does not apply in respect of any other set of government employees. In all other cases the Government exercises its right to dispute those decisions by moving for their disallowance in either House of the Parliament. In this case the Government is able to make a decision on the basis that the Minister has to sign a recommendation before it becomes law. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise one other matter in this area; that is, the question of the ability of members of the Services, or anyone on their behalf, to raise matters in which there are anomalies or disputes in relation to what are usually substantive determinations. Small groups can be significantly disadvantaged. I raised one of these matters last night. There was a very significant row a couple of years ago in respect of the Bendigo survey unit printers. There have been numerous occasions on which small numbers of servicemen have felt that they have not been adequately dealt with in respect of the determinations of tribunals. I believe that the proper approach would be for the tribunal to be given the authority to make determinations in respect of the defence forces. I also believe that, as it is highly unlikely that in the foreseeable future advocates will appear on behalf of and from the Services, a special office of defence force advocate should be established, probably as a statutory position, and that person should be responsible for taking up and presenting argument on behalf of persons or groups of persons in the Services who consider that they have been disadvantaged or that their case has not been adequately heard or presented. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the cases that go to the relevant tribunal are prepared by different sections of the Department of Defence. Whilst I do not in any way suggest that these officers do not do their best, they are not closely in contact with those whom they represent, especially in the narrower context of specialised positions. It is highly unlikely that those cases are able to be properly presented without the opportunity to present argument and to challenge the submissions made on behalf of the Department or the Government, as is the case with other tribunals before which cases can be argued. I think it is important that members of the Defence Force have their conditions fixed in a manner which parallels as closely as practicable those of other government employees. I commend to the Government that this be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one other point in relation to this area. The Budget Papers show that the sum of $300,000 has been set aside for the Commonwealth Games which will take place in Brisbane over the next two or three weeks. It is a contribution from the Commonwealth, especially allocated from the defence vote-incidentally, it is not added to the defence vote but is taken from it-for the conduct of the Commonwealth Games. It is obviously of significant assistance to the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Games authorities. There are a number of allocations in that area, including $30,000 for ammunition and special travel allowances. One of the things I find objectionable is that members of the Defence Force will be expected to carry out jobs together with and quite often paralleling jobs which will be carried out by members of other public and private bodies. They will be expected to perform duties in addition to their normal duties but will receive no additional pay or compensation for the additional time and effort required. They will be disadvantaged and will be utilised in an unpaid capacity. It is a matter of concern to me and I think it should be of concern to everyone who has a fair approach to these matters. I am aware that the commanding officer can give them time off if he decides it is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise another matter of concern in relation to the conditions of service. There are provisions whereby, if a serviceman is away from his home for a specified period, he will be paid an allowance for living away from home. A practice has developed whereby persons who are required to be away from home for a time which would qualify them for the living away from home allowance are in fact having the period split by spending one day at their home base, and thus are denied the allowance which would properly be paid to them if they spent the entire period away from home. These practices would not be acceptable in the Public Service and they do not add to the standing or morale of the defence forces and they should be corrected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member will not be around, but I will be here. The Army Survey Regiment has become an integral part of Bendigo life. Many of the people who have served in the Survey Regiment, at the expiration of their term of service, have become citizens of Bendigo and are employed or own businesses in Bendigo. We want to see many years of this ahead of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now refer to the other matter I wish to raise. Recently the Minister for Defence Support announced that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory is to commence the contract to supply the Army with the 1.05 millimetre Howitzer gun-that is, the Hamel project. We had much pleasure in announcing that recently. It is interesting to note that this follows a promise which the Government made some time ago when all the furore about the disposal of the factory was in the air. The Government stated then that the factory would keep going and that this contract would be one of the contracts to be continued. I am delighted to see that. I am delighted also to see the Minister return to the table because I know he is anxious to hear that the people at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory and I are particularly determined to see the management of that project come back to Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> The original story is that when the Army decided it wanted a 105 Howitzer gun two types were available for its consideration. One was the United States production and the other was the United Kingdom production. The Army had to decide which gun would be chosen and this would determine whether the management of the project would be given to the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo or the Ordnance Factory at Maribyrnong. If the United States gun were decided upon then the Ordnance Factory at Maribyrnong was to have the management of jointly supplying it. If the United Kingdom gun were decided upon the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo was to be charged with the management as it had carried out all the preliminary work. </PARA>
<PARA> Somewhere along the track, and for no reason that I can ascertain, Canberra decided that it wanted to get into the act. So the management sector was taken back to head office. Perhaps the pundits in Canberra believe that there was no way in which the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, which had so capably carried out all the preliminary work and conducted the negotiations, was capable of management. I assure the Minister for Defence Support that Bendigo is capable. He has visited Bendigo and the Ordnance Factory and I am certain that in his own mind he knows the situation. Whatever happened, at the present time that management decision lies in Canberra. I think that is wrong. The Bendigo Ordnance Factory will be doing the bulk of the work in regard to this United Kingdom Howitzer model. It will be working in conjunction with the Ordnance Factory, Maribyrnong. But quite rightly, under the initial agreement, it should have-I hope it will- the management returned to it. There is not a great deal of money involved in the management being returned and not a great deal of extra staff are involved. I would not think that any would be involved. But the important thing is that this project which was initiated in Bendigo should be looked after and nurtured by the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The prestige should go to it. Now that it has successfully obtained the contract I believe that in all justice it should have the management of this contract returned to it. I hope that the Minister will take note of that. </PARA>
<PARA> One other thing that I am rather delighted about is that the Victorian Government has decided to organise that part of the contract to supply coal dredgers and crawler tractors for the State Electricity Commission in Victoria. I believe that that part of the contract for production of the crawler treads is to be undertaken at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The State authorities are trying to take the credit for this. One does not blame them. But it should be clearly pointed out that when the first contract was let the Bendigo Ordnance Factory was not able at that time to become involved in the tender. Through my efforts in approaching the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch ) and through his efforts we were able at that time to arrange for the successful tendering company-an Australian-based German company-to negotiate with the Bendigo Ordnance Factory in the hope that it could come to some agreement whereby the expertise of the factory could be used in the manufacture of this part of the crawler tractors. This was all going on at the time people were saying that we were going to close the factory down. This just indicates how untrue it was. </PARA>
<PARA> A change of government occurred in Victoria and the Minister responsible for power in that Government made it quite clear that he was going to have the tractor parts made in Germany as had originally been planned. We cannot blame him for that. I am not being critical because, after all, he had to look at the economic situation of his State. But I managed to mention to the Minister for Defence Support, to the people in Bendigo and to the State members of parliament that the State Labor Government had made election promises that it would have these parts made at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. It had insisted, prior to the election, that when it got into office it would make certain that it would give preference to State manufacturers. Having reminded the Victorian Labor Government rather loudly of that fact I must admit that at last it took heart and decided that it should carry out its election promise. I congratulate it on acknowledging the fact that it made an election promise and for accepting the requests of the Minister for Defence Support and me to do the right thing and to give that contract to the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> Together with the Hamel project for the Howitzer gun, this will provide the Bendigo Ordnance Factory with a base load of work for some 15 years or more. This will allow the Factory to build, to provide employment, and to be certain of carrying on its good tradition. The future of the Factory is now quite assured through the efforts of the Minister and myself. We are both very modest about it. As a result, the people of Bendigo realise that the Government is determined to carry out the promise it made in the first place. The Factory will stay in Bendigo and receive all the help possible from the Government to ensure continuing employment. On behalf of the people of Bendigo I thank the Minister. More importantly, the Minister should finish off his good work by bringing the management of the Hamel project back to Bendigo. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to take up one or two of the points that were made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) on the work of the Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. I refer particularly to the remarks that he made about the work of the Sub-Committee on the question of the aircraft carrier. By and large I agree with what he had to say on the matter but I do not quite agree with some of the strictures that he placed on the question of evidence. Most of the criticism of that report since it has emerged-the criticism has emanated from the Minister for Defence Support (Mr Viner) and it was followed up by his announcement that a carrier purchase is still under review and likely, and also by other circles outside this Parliament-has centered on a question of an assessment of the value of the Harrier aircraft. Of course, that is a very minor aspect of the report. Whether the Harrier has the capabilities ascribed to it-even in the criticisms of it the capabilities do not vary very much-the question as to whether the Harrier is a useful weapons system is close to being irrelevant to the question of whether Australia should have an aircraft carrier. Even if the Harrier were the most singing and dancing aircraft in the world, we still would not send a single aircraft carrier armed with a dozen of them against a reasonably competent air power within the range of operations of its land-based air force. The carrier simply would not have the capability of dealing with that air force. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make is that, irrespective of what advocates of the carrier may have said about the need for a carrier to be armed with Harriers, the evidence presented to us by the Department of Defence emphatically argued that any purchase of a Harrier-this was associated with the purchase of the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible-was a very long way down the line and not within the immediate consideration of the Government. The aircraft carrier was being purchased to perform specifically an anti-submarine warfare role. So we have never had placed before us by the Government a serious proposition for what might amount to a full blown aircraft carrier capacity within the Australian defence forces. One could argue, I think quite reasonably, that any full blown aircraft carrier capacity would require us to have two or three of them but, at a minimum, it would require any aircraft carrier to be armed to its fullest capability. It certainly was never an intention of the Government, at least in the foreseeable future, that this should be the case in the purchase of the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible. </PARA>
<PARA> We on the Committee believe that the aircraft carrier purchase bore no relationship to the immediate priorities of the Australian defence forces. It might have been useful were a substantial number of other areas of Australian defence capability properly catered for in terms of equipment and personnel. It would have had its uses. But certainly in circumstances where an aircraft carrier would have cost us a great deal more than the Invincible, as will be the case now if we purchase an aircraft carrier with anything like the capabilities of the Invincible, such a purchase would not only not be within the framework of Australia's defence priorities but also, in fact, it would seriously detract from them. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were to purchase a carrier and all its equipment for a price of about $1. 5 billion-that is the lowest estimate of what an aircraft carrier with the capability of the Invincible would cost us now-and pay all that off over a decade it would account for something like 50 per cent of the amount in each annual Budget devoted to equipment purchases for the armed Services, assuming that the equipment budget maintained the pattern it has established in the last few years in relation to overall expenditure on defence. That simply would be ludicrous. That would be an absolutely absurd waste of important defence funds. The Committee identified areas on which we thought the Government ought to concentrate relating to both the Fleet Air Arm and also the effective defence of Australia. I mention one area, the airborne early warning system, which the Government has actually said occasionally that it considers important too. If we are to get a decent airborne early warning capability it will cost the Government at least $300m. If the Government were to choose to do that we on this side of the chamber would strongly support that. It would be money very well spent indeed. Regardless of whether the Government chooses to purchase an airborne early warning capability there are still useful things that could be done with the Fleet Air Arm within the framework of the current Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> We were very upset with the situation we found in Nowra. There was low morale and real concern on the part of the officers as to what their future would be. It is an extremely distressing situation to have so many highly capable people, who have a very high sense of service to the country, in the depressed situation in which they now find themselves. I do not believe that this Government will proceed with the purchase of an aircraft carrier. It will make a promise and an announcement that perhaps the Navy will look at a couple of options in a few weeks time, particularly if an election is going to come forward. Even if the Defence Department goes ahead with the purchase of an aircraft carrier that will not resolve the immediate problem of the Fleet Air Arm. It is high time this Government started to give serious consideration to what can be done for the people in the Fleet Air Arm. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee made a couple of very constructive suggestions. One of those suggestions was that as the Grumman trackers were available with all the appropriate spare parts and were capable of flying, they ought to be included in the surveillance program of the Australian defence forces. They were deployed extremely usefully from points in the north and west of Australia in the mid- 1970s when there were some real concerns about our capacity to conduct effective surveillance of our off-shore fishing zones. They did a very effective job. They could be well deployed there again. The deployment of them there would enable a massive improvement in the morale of the Fleet Air Arm. The Committee also pointed out the fact that the A4 Skyhawks have a lifetime which will take them readily to the end of this decade, that they remain a very useful ground attack aircraft and also a useful maritime strike aircraft. In those capaicities they ought to be fully utilised from land bases by the Fleet Air Arm. They would thus provide useful training in maritime operations for members of the Fleet Air Arm and also for the Royal Australian Navy generally in developing its capabilities to deal with air attacks. We believe that both those uses of those aircraft ought to be made. If the Government were to make the announcement now instead of chasing around after pipe-dreams it would do a very great deal of good to that section of the Services. </PARA>
<PARA> I will have to conclude on this note: One of the problems with which we are confronted in this Budget-I have essentially been talking about training of the Fleet Air Arm-is the reduction that has occurred in the fuel to be available for training purposes in all sections of the Australian armed Services. There have been substantial reductions throughout this Budget although they are not outlined in specific detail in one block, which makes criticism extremely difficult. But that reduction will have a substantial effect on the capacity to conduct training operations in Western Australia and also on the type of activity of the Fleet Air Arm about which I have been talking. I hope the Government will review that decision along with the review I have suggested of the Fleet Air Arm. That would do a great deal for the morale of the Australian armed forces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some time ago the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on behalf of the Government indicated that it would be a policy of the Government to endeavour to respond to all reports of parliamentary committees within six months of those reports being tabled. One of the most important reports tabled in this Parliament in my view was the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled 'Threats to Australia's Security'. That report was tabled on 18 November 1981. To date there has been no response from the Government to that report, nor has there been any indication by the Government that it has any intention of honouring the promise made by the Prime Minister. The reason I believe it is important for there to be a Government response is that I believe it is surely time there was a debate in this Parliament on defence and foreign policy matters and the potential of threats to Australia in a politically balanced climate.</PARA></TALK.START>

They have trotted out the same old hairy logic saying that either the Russians are coming or that we are being subjected to a communist takeover. A very significant and unanimous recomendation in the threats report is significantly ignored. All that has occurred ultimately-with Government members retiring from the debate hurt and certainly unpersuaded-has been another exercise in political confrontation. The people of Australia are entitled to expect better than that from this Parliament and they are certainly entitled to expect better than that from this Government. The view of this Parliament that this Government is taking is shown by the fact that the Minister for Defence has not even seen fit to make himself present in this House while this Committee debate on the Estimates is taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Mr Mack says about the report is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . is comprehensive-balanced, clearly written and intelligently argued- indeed, it is without doubt the best introduction yet published on the vital question of threats to our security.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this 60-page report received so little serious examination by the media when published at the end of last year is a sad commentary on the seriousness with which the press and other media treat defence issues.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to make the point very properly that the report not merely confronted the issues as to the nature and probability of threats to Australia but in fact it reached conclusions which were largely at variance with much of the pre- conceived thinking that exists in the Australian community at large and in this Parliament in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that this is the first time any document has emanated in this Parliament which has given consideration in any depth and detail at all to the problems that confront Australia with the threat of nuclear war between the superpowers. It analyses at some length the build-up and the awesome range of weapons which exist between the two major superpowers. It deals with the problems of so-called limited nuclear war and with the problems that would confront Australia in a situation where our hosting of joint facilities with the United States would certainly make Australia in the event of a global conflict a target for Soviet nuclear missiles. I would have thought that was just one area alone which I believe ought to be seriously engaged and subject to earnest debate in this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to point out on the basis of the evidence which was given by Admiral Synnot and supported by other defence analysts that no superpower except the United States of America could successfully mount an armed invasion of Australia. That is an important conclusion. One hears so often from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other senior Ministers, when they want to talk about the threat to the Australian community, the cry: 'The Russians are coming' . That cry has been analysed by members on both sides of the House, and that concept as a concept in terms of armed invasion is rejected. I would have thought that that was a matter which would have excited some concern and some need for debate in this Parliament. The report goes on to talk about intermediate level threats and the capability that would need to be created in any regional power that was concerned to attack Australia. It deals with our capacity to defend ourselves and it rejects the widely held notion that this nation, because of its size and the geographic distances that we have to overcome, is defenceless. It rejects that notion, and it does so on the basis of a range of evidence which ought to be again, I believe, seriously considered.</PARA>
<PARA> The report deals with the problem of low level contingencies and raises some very serious issues which ought to be the subject of future consideration by members of this Parliament. It points out some of the important foreign policies and defence issues that need to be faced up to. I would have thought that it was no easy matter on issues as vexed as this to take a group of parliamentarians who represent every political philosophy within this community and have them make an analysis of this kind and reach a broadly unanimous agreement. Having reached that agreement and having reached what I believe are very important conclusions, I believe that this report gives an opportunity for the Government, if it is sincere and is concerned to get some sense of unanimity in this Parliament on these important issues, to provide the basis for debate. That opportunity has not been taken. It will not be taken because this Government is more concerned when the occasion suits it to try to use defence as an issue of confrontation to divide the Australian community rather than to unite it.</PARA>

I notice from the Estimates that $10,150,000 has been provided for defence co-operation with this country. I think it is very important for us to realise that this is a country with a very bad record of human rights. I would like to bring a matter before the House tonight, a matter of human rights in relation to trade unionists. I want to talk about the sentences of death on two Indonesian trade union leaders which have recently been upheld by President Suharto.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we ought to set a background to these death sentences. There are at least 67 political prisoners in Indonesia under sentence of death. A total of 63 were charged with alleged pro-communist subversion for political activities undertaken after the military takeover of power in October 1965. All these men have been in prison since the late 1960s and were tried and sentenced many years ago. Some have lived under the threat of their death sentences for as long as 15 years. The other four men were charged with alleged Moslem subversion and were all tried in the past five years. In all cases the prisoners have been tried on the basis of Indonesia's anti-subversion law which allows the courts to apply the term 'subversion' to any political activity deemed to be a threat to the Government. </PARA>

I think this is a matter which the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) should take up urgently.

<PARA> The honourable member for Fremantle and the Minister for Defence have, over the last day, been engaged in an exchange of statements and rebuttal of statements in the House.

The Minister in turn took umbrage and rebutted the remark by the indulgence of the Chair. The honourable member for Fremantle subsequently sought the indulgence of the Chair to make a personal explanation on the score of being misrepresented. I was in the House at the time but I was not occupying the chair . I feel free to say that, during the honourable member's remarks, he did not establish where he had been misrepresented. By circumstance, he had the opportunity to compound further his original mischief. I suggest to the honourable member for Fremantle and the House in general that the matter be not further pursued. I called him to order because the comments that he made again constituted a reflection on another member in this House and such reflection is not tolerable, certainly not unless it be in the course of a substantive motion and then it must be couched in parliamentary language. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) The following Funds were misappropriated by the late G. M. Sinclair from:</PARA>

<PARA>542,125.05</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I stress that this was over the period of the incorporation of the companies, about 20 years before. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that $250,093.34 is shown in the 1978 group accounts of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd as a loan to Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd. This transaction was made to establish liability not to settle the amount outstanding. Together with amounts standing to the credit of Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd and the estate of the late George Sinclair of about $174,000 in the accounts these sums remain to be settled between the three family shareholders of the companies. A further sum of $292,031 is identified as losses by misappropriation. That is in the accounts for the year ended 30 June 1978. With respect to this sum, I have written, as trustee of the estate of the late George Sinclair, to the directors of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd on 11 April 1979. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> An investigation of the accounts of the above company and its subsidiaries has identified in the year ended 30 June, 1978 an amount of $292,031 as losses by misappropriation. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to adjustments yet to be determined between the shareholders and directors of the companies, I accept responsibility for the repayment of this amount as trustee of the estate of the late George Sinclair. </PARA>
<PARA> Repayment will be in accordance with arrangements to be determined with the company. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that $4,000 in all in this earlier period is shown as having been paid into my personal account in two lots of $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA> This money was repaid as soon as its source was identified by investigating accountants. Other than that the money had been paid into my account by my father, I had not previously been aware of its origin. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the amounts identified as losses by misappropriation, there has been an understatement of income in the accounts of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd , Allan Walsh Pty Ltd, and Allan Walsh (Hornsby) Pty Ltd for company tax purposes. The report of the investigating accountants reveals that the operating profit before taxation of the group for the years 30 June 1961 to 30 June 1972 inclusive as per financial accounts for those years had been understated by $413 ,204. Provision has been made in the financial accounts for taxation penalties of $113,500 which will be payable by the group for this understatement of income and for late lodgement of company tax returns. The amounts, of course, remain to be assessed and the amount is only the assessment as determined by the view of the investigating accountants. The accounts also identify future income tax benefits calculated at current rates of company tax (a) in respect of provisions for long service leave, holiday and sick pay, $13,865; (b) in respect of losses by misappropriation charged in the accounts and not ascertained until after balance date, $31,252; and (c) in respect of taxation losses carried forward at balance date, $32,857: This is a total of $77,974. The companies' entitlement to these benefits is qualified in the accounts by a number of conditions which are set out by the accountants. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The matters with which this Bill and its companion measures deal have been the subject of considerable public and political debate in recent times. In bringing the measures before the Parliament the Government demonstrates once again its clear commitment to do what it can to establish and uphold a fair system of taxation in this country. As Treasurer of the Commonwealth, I have brought before the Parliament a wide range of Bills designed so that those who would seek to escape their fair share of taxation do not succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Government complements its earlier proscription of schemes to evade the payment of legally payable company tax by a Bill that will recover evaded company tax from the principal beneficiaries of earlier evasion of that kind. In doing this we have sought to achieve a reasonable balance between all the various, and often conflicting, interests and considerations that seem to attend the more significant of taxation issues. Our normal and general reluctance to introduce legislation having any retrospective element has, on this ocassion, been tempered by the competing consideration of overall perceptions as to the equity and fairness of our taxation system and the distribution of the tax burden. We are also dealing here with recoupment of tax which was clearly the subject of illegal evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the public is clearly of the view that that tax evaded in the course of so-called bottom-of-the-harbour strips of untaxed company profits should be recovered for public purposes. Vendor shareholders and other former owners of stripped companies ought to be made make good the tax that remains unpaid, and from the evasion of which they have clearly enjoyed a benefit. But, in establishing by this Bill the rules under which accounts are to be settled, the Government has been anxious to ensure that the matter proceeds on a properly measured basis. I believe that the Bill I am presenting observes these principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic measures contained in the Bill were foreshadowed by me in some detail in a full statement made on 25 July 1982 and in a further statement on 17 August last. I made it clear then, and I repeat now, that the measures are designed, and will operate only, to collect evaded company tax. Tax that may have been avoided is not the subject of the legislation. That point needs to be made clear not only so that the ambit of the Bill is properly understood, but also so that some of the wilder claims about the numbers of companies that have been stripped of untaxed profits can be seen as unfounded as they are. Where companies were simply stripped of profits that have borne all the company-including undistributed profits-tax payable on them, there has been no evasion of tax and the legislation will not apply. Nor will it apply to the taxed profits element in the case of a strip of both taxed and untaxed company profits. Only the tax on the untaxed profits is the subject of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me remind the House, with effect from 27 May 1981 when we brought in the new general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, Vendor-shareholders are to be taxed on any profits liberated to them in the course of a dividend strip or other similar strip of company profits . The measures to collect evaded tax are to operate on strips of untaxed profits that were carried out between 1 January 1972 and 4 December 1980 when the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 dealt a decisive blow to such schemes. Just as that legislation applies to arrangements that have a purpose of rendering a company unable to pay its tax, so the present Bill will declare that it is to operate only where there has been an arrangement that had the effect that a company was rendered unable to pay its company tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The other precise tests of the legislation are also of an objective nature, helping to make clear its field of operation, and I now outline them, taking first the simpler forms of company structure. I said in my statement of 25 July that the legislation would apply where all the shares in a company were sold. Scheme promoters needed to have total control of a company before they could effect the strip that was a part of the overall arrangement. However, it was possible for them to do this where less than the entire ownership was acquired and the Bill accordingly, on the basis of company law provisions, makes it a condition for its application that there was a sale of shares carrying more than 90 per cent of the voting power in the target company. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important test is framed so that it is clear that the legislation will apply only where the vendor-shareholder and other former owners actually derived a benefit from the evasion of the company's tax. This is achieved by a provision that requires that the total consideration for the sale of the shares in the company exceeded its net assets as reduced by any actual or contingent company tax liability on income derived up to the time of sale of the shares. To put it another way, the test is one that puts into legal terms the concept that the sale price for the company was such that it was evident that company tax on the amount of then apparent profits would not be paid. A person who pays, say, $90, 000 for shares in a company that has traded for part of the income year and earned $100,000, which is what the company has in the bank, cannot be regarded as in a position to pay the $46,000 company tax payable on a taxable income of $ 100,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The liability of former owners of a company under the legislation will not arise until the company's liability has been established by assessment, rights of objection and appeal against that assessment have either not been exercised or have been exhausted, and tax remains unpaid. That test is obviously as it should be, but, in the course of our detailed preparation of the legislation, we have decided that, although a delay in collection of the evaded tax will be involved, another element should be added. This is that former owners of a company will not be called on to effect recoupment of the company tax under this legislation until after they have had an opportunity to contest the basic assessment of that tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has already issued many notices of assessment in respect of the companies concerned, but due to the fact that some have been returned unclaimed, and to other circumstances, these notices are a less than satisfactory foundation for tax claims on the former owners. As soon as practicable after this legislation is passed, therefore, a copy of the already issued notice of assessment will in each case be sent to a representative vendor -shareholder who will be able to exercise the rights of objection and appeal open to the company. The obligation of former owners to meet any late payment penalty owing by the company will be measured only from the date that would be the due date for payment if the company assessment had been served on the day that the copy is sent. </PARA>
<PARA> I said in my statement of 25 July that we do not want the legislation to apply where the reason for non-payment of company tax is that a company has suffered commercial misadventure in the hands of its new owners, following its sale at a commercially realistic price. To make that clear, the legislation specifies that it will apply only where the company did not, after the sale, carry on the same business as it had carried on beforehand. Where the various threshold tests are all met each vendor-shareholder will, at base, be liable to effect recoupment of his or her share of the evaded tax. That amount will be fixed according to the vendor's share of the total consideration for the sale of shares in the company.</PARA>
<PARA> In noting that the recovery from vendor-shareholders will be of the total amount of the evaded company tax, undiminished by the part of that tax taken as a fee by those who promoted the scheme and stripped the company, I also observe that the special legislation will not make vendors liable for penalty taxes incurred by the company in respect of lodgment of an incorrect return or of late lodgment or of non-lodgment. On review, the Government has accepted the argument that vendors should not have to bear these penalties, which can be accepted as being due more to acts or omissions on the part of those to whom the companies were transferred. The penalty taxes excluded from the scope of the recoupment measures will, however, remain as tax that is legally owing by the companies concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to a discussion of the liability of promoters and other strippers to assist in making good the evasion of tax that has occurred. Our appointment of a Special Prosecutor, and the work that he will carry out, can be expected to make some contribution, but the Government is not content to let it rest there. It is the Government's wish to have legislation that will place a liability on those who were on the post-sale side of these schemes. Provisions to effect some recoupment of unpaid company taxes from these people will either be added to the Bill by an amendment on the floor of the House or made the subject of a further Bill to be considered alongside the present Bill. To return to that Bill, its recoupment obligations will extend to vendor-shareholders in a company who sold shares and thereby, in association with other shareholders concerned, transferred control in yet another company which was stripped of untaxed company profits. A sale of shares in a holding company that carried ownership of a series of subsidiary companies with untaxed profits is an example . Whether a sale of shares took place in one of these more complex situations, or in the simple case I dealt with earlier, some of the vendor-shareholders will have been companies or trusts through which people held ownership of the stripped companies, and there could also have been more lengthy chains of ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> The broad aim of the legislation is to effect a recoupment at the earliest practicable and appropriate stage along a chain of ownership but where, in defined circumstances, that cannot be achieved the Bill has provisions for tracing through, broadly on the basis of rights to capital, the liability from one level to another, so that ultimately it rests on the people who indirectly owned the stripped companies. Persons who at a primary or secondary level are liable to the recoupment tax that is being formally imposed as a technique for recovering the evaded tax will be issued with a notice of assessment setting out the amounts they are each liable to pay. A recipient of such a notice will of course have the usual rights of objection and appeal against a recoupment tax assessment and, if the tax remains unpaid 30 days after the notice is issued, the unpaid amount will there after attract late payment penalty at the rate of 20 per cent per annum. On review, we have concluded that that rate, rather than the earlier-announced rate of 30 per cent would be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with that, a separate Bill that I will shortly introduce will implement the earlier-announced decision to propose a doubling-from 10 per cent to 20 per cent-in the rate of penalty for late payment of income tax. This further Bill will have the effect that late payment penalty begins to accrue as soon as is practicable at the higher rate of 20 per cent in the basic assessments of company tax issued or to be re-issued in respect of the stripped companies concerned. In noting that unpaid undistributed profits tax is within the scope of the recoupment legislation, I observe that in harmony with existing provisions in the income tax law the former owners of a company may arrange instead to pay tax themselves on the same basis as if the company had distributed enough in dividends to escape a liability to undistributed profits tax. Earlier-foreshadowed provisions to guard against divestment of assets in an attempt to frustrate the operation of the recoupment legislation are another feature of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Among further provisions of note are measures to adopt the machinery and collection provisions of the income tax law; to enable the fullest reporting to Parliament of failures to comply with the recoupment legislation; to ensure that , secrecy provisions of the tax law notwithstanding, persons liable to recoupment tax are able to get details of the basis on which their liability was calculated and, to assist them in any personal pursuit of promoters for compensation, of the ways in which their company was stripped; to make appropriate adjustments in a person's liability where other amounts of, or representing, the unpaid company tax are paid; to deal with situations where a stripped company has ceased to exist; and finally, to give the Commissioner of Taxation authority not to pursue liability in particular circumstances, including where a person's liability under the legislation is under $100. These are the broad principles of the Bill which, while it gives effect to a simple enough recoupment concept has, reflecting the difficulty and variety of situations with which it deals, emerged as a somewhat complex piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As is usual with taxation legislation a comprehensive explanatory memorandum giving further and fuller explanations of the Bill and three associated Bills that I will introduce shortly is being made available to honourable members. Part 1 of the memorandum is being circulated today and Part 2, which will be a clause by clause explanation of the Bills, will be made available to honourable members next week. The Government believes that the Parliament will give this package of legislation the speedy approval that it deserves. While we are committed to implementation of the policies that the Bills express, we are of course ready to review particular provisions of them at a more technical level, having regard to any constructive comments that are put to us. With those introductory remarks I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill formally imposes a tax on the taxable amount established by the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill which I have just introduced. That Bill provides the parameters within which vendor-shareholders and other former owners of shares in stripped companies will be called to account for their share of tax evaded by companies with which they were formerly associated. As I explained in introducing that Bill, liability for the recoupment tax will fall initially on the persons who sold their shares, but where it is impracticable or inappropriate to levy the tax at that primary level it will be possible to trace through to more remote links in the ownership chain and levy the tax at levels below the primary level. This Bill imposes on the taxable amount-which in the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill is called the eligible taxable amount-fixed for each former owner a recoupment tax equal to that taxable amount . It is by this means that the evaded company tax is to be recovered. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This third Bill in the legislative package to recover tax illegally evaded in company stripping schemes proposes amendments to several Acts, consequential upon the two Bills I have already introduced. The first amendment is that of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. Decisions under certain Acts are precluded from review through the system of review provided for by that Act. Decisions under the new recoupment tax legislation are also to be excluded from the purview of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. However, a person liable to recoupment tax who receives an assessment in respect of his or her liability will have available full rights or objection and appeal to a Taxation Board or Review or a Supreme Court and ultimately, if the matter warrants it, to the Federal and High Courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Other taxation laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation that provide similar rights to contest liability are also exluded from review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. Amendments of the other Acts-the Pay-roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Act, the Sale Tax Assessment Act (No. 1), the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Act, the Tobacco Charges Assessment Act and the Wool Tax (Administration) Act are of a more technical nature. As a result of amendments made to these Acts in 1980 by the Taxation Debts (Abolition of Crown Priority) Act, a liquidator or receiver of a company is permitted to satisfy secured debts and preferential debts under Commonwealth or State laws before payment of taxation debts. Having made such payments a liquidator or receiver is required to set aside a proportionate part of the remaining assets for payment of income tax and various other taxes payable under the Acts I have referred to. The effect of the remaining consequential amendments is to include in the calculation of the amount a liquidator or receiver of a company must set aside any liability of the company to recoupment tax. I also commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the Bill I have just introduced to recover tax evaded in the course of 'bottom-of-the-harbour' strips of untaxed company profits I mentioned that I would be introducing a further Bill to double the rate of penalty for late payment of income tax. This Bill will achieve that purpose, not just for companies that were stripped of assets but also for all individuals and other companies that are late in paying their income tax. On 10 August 1982 I announced the Government's intention to propose an increase from 10 per cent per annum to 20 per cent per annum in the rate of penalties payable under the various taxation laws for late payment of tax. At the same time I gave some details of the Government's intention to introduce a system for payment of interest on a refund of tax that occurs as a result of a successful objection or appeal by a taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> By this Bill, the income tax law will be amended to increase the rate of late payment penalty for late payment of income tax and related amounts. The increase to 20 per cent will not, however, take effect until two months after this Bill has become law. The new rate of penalty tax provided in this Bill will apply in respect of the late payment of assessed income tax, withholding tax on interest and dividends paid to non-residents of Australia, mining withholding tax and tax instalment deductions made by an employer from salaries or wages paid to employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes a corresponding increase in the rate of additional tax payable where the taxable income of a company has been underestimated and the company has thereby been enabled to pay reduced instalments of company tax. The existing income tax law empowers the Commissioner of Taxation to remit all or part of an amount of late payment penalty where that is judged to be appropriate . Where there is an objection or appeal against an assessment and the Commissioner accepts that the taxpayer has a genuine difference of opinion about his or her tax liability, the present general administrative practice of the Commissioner is, in the exercise of that power to remit, to enter into an arrangement with the taxpayer to remit all late payment penalty in the event that the taxpayer is not successful in his objection or appeal. This arrangement is on the basis that the taxpayer pays one-half of the tax in dispute pending the outcome of the objection or appeal-it has been called a 50-50 arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will re-express the power given to the Commissioner of Taxation to remit late payment penalty, so that this particular approach to the handling of disputed income tax liabilities will not be available in future. The Commissioner will of course continue to be empowered to remit late payment penalty where there are special circumstances, such as adverse business conditions or other factors beyond the control of the taxpayer. Although the remission power is to be altered for the future, existing 50-50 arrangements will be allowed to continue according to their terms. I also make the point that under the legislation we propose that a person who has a genuine dispute about liability will be able to pay to the Commissioner one-half of the disputed tax and obtain an extension of time for payment of the balance on the basis that, if the taxpayer wins the contest, he or she will be paid interest when the 50 per cent is refunded but, if the taxpayer loses, the Commissioner will be entitled to recover the remaining 50 per cent subject to late payment penalty of 20 per cent from the date when the assessment became payable. </PARA>
<PARA> It has not been practicable to include in this Bill the measures necessary to provide for the payment of interest to taxpayers. However, we are committed to these measures and they will be introduced after the forthcoming break in sittings. It also remains the Government's intention to introduce as soon as practicable legislation dealing with late payment penalties and payment of interest in respect of sales tax and other taxes administered by the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention the review that has been going on in recent months of monetary and other penalties contained in the various taxation laws. I intend to introduce further legislation as soon as I can to increase the effectiveness of the other penalty provisions of the taxation laws. Part of the review of penalties has focused on the rate of additional tax payable in cases involving international profit shifting arrangements, where avoidance that would otherwise occur has been eliminated by the new legislation brought in by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not overlooked its undertaking given in the Senate earlier this year that the level of additional tax applicable to such profit shifting arrangements would be reviewed, and the results of that review will be announced shortly. An explanatory memorandum giving technical explanations of provisions of the Bill will be made available to honourable members, and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ML7">Mr McVEIGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated that it is necessary to put into proper perspective some of the irrational statements made by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West). I repeat for his information what I said yesterday. The problem is not unusual in constructions of this kind. The claim that the dam has failed is absolute nonsense and irresponsible in the extreme. This matter has been seized upon by the honourable member for Cunningham to further his emotional anti- uranium cause. I take this opportunity of assuring the House that there is nothing unusual in the problem and that the actions taken will be conventional engineering in large earth and rock dams. I also point out that I have been aware of the matter for some time but due to its relative insignificance have not sought to dramatise, over-emphasise or draw unnecessary attention to it. Interested parties including the Northern Land Council, the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth Government have been kept fully informed by the company through the mechanism of the Alligator Rivers Region Co-ordinating Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It therefore reflects badly on the honourable member for Cunningham to seek such cheap political capital from the matter. Let me say of the problem that since 10.30 on the morning of 8 June when I attended a meeting of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the Co-ordinating Committee in Darwin I have been kept fully informed on a regular basis. This has been done at my request. The Office of the Supervising Scientist has been closely involved and through the agency of the Co-ordinating Committee has taken measures to ensure that the situation is closely monitored and that suitable action is taken to deal with the situation. It is important to point out what Mr West said yesterday. I once again quote from page 1721 of yesterday's Hansard. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have been informed today by the staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service that a major fault exists within the tailings dam at Ranger. </PARA>
<PARA>That information was incorrect; the staff have pulled his little leg. Earlier today the honourable member for Cunningham made further allegations. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It perturbed me greatly to learn this morning from sources within his Department . . . the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Office of the Supervising Scientist that the Minister has now in fact instigated a sort of witch hunt over a mythical letter which he claims was sent to me. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that I have contacted the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to advise him that if officers, members of his service, have passed misleading and incorrect information to the honourable member for Cuningham or any other person then that practice requires attention. I am not, as a Minister, going to allow officers of my Department to pass incorrect information to anyone. I have absolutely no objection whatsoever to the passing of information so long as the information that is passed is correct. As of half an hour ago Professor Ovington advised me that today he has been in contact with many officers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in the Northern Territory. They have advised him that at no stage have they passed information to the honourable member for Cunningham. If he has that information, if he is fair dinkum, let him get up in this Parliament and name the officer who is supposed to have conveyed information to him yesterday. He does not have the intestinal fortitude to do that; he would rather live in dreamland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Yesterday during the debate on the introduction of the Code of Practice on the Management of Radioactive Waste from the Mining and Milling of Radioactive Ores I took the opportunity, it is true, to relay to the House some information that had been passed on to me from informants inside the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and inside the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Just to check the information I rang the Office of the Supervising Scientist. All of the information I received was the same, and it was this: The tailings dam at Ranger had not been constructed down to bedrock as it should have been and that the rising pressure of ground water which rose from underneath the dam was lifting the pressure and at least posing the very grave risk that it would force contaminated water out from under the dam into the very sensitive environment of Kakadu National Park. Furthermore, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) had been in receipt of this information for some two months but had not relayed it to the House. I thought that was quite serious, and I quite legitimately informed the House of that information and gave the Minister an opportunity-in fact, I challenged him-to table the report that I knew he had already received. He has not as yet done so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raised the matter this morning as a personal explanation simply because people within the Minister's own Department had telephoned me saying: 'This Minister has already started a witch hunt. In his paranoia he thinks that we sent you a letter and documents about all this'. Of course they did not. I want to put the record straight. The integrity of the service was intact and officers in that service did not send records to me. I conclude my remarks by saying that there is a potentially grave problem. It has been identified. The project has been in operation for only one year and it is expected to last for some 20 or 30 years. This is a fair example of what we can expect in the future. The Minister should have made a statement about the matter before. We are still waiting on the report from the Supervising Scientist and the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, the Repatriation Legislation Amendment Bill provides for the amendment of the Repatriation Act and associated Acts to give effect to the Government's Budget decisions, to formalise the basis for certain 'act of grace' payments, to extend the liability provision 'arisen out of or attributable to' to members of the forces who do not have the benefit of this liability, and to make certain machinery amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget context, repatriation benefits are to be extended to members of peacekeeping forces who served prior to 2 November 1981; service pension eligibility is to be extended to merchant mariners of Commonwealth and allied countries; disability pension at the 100 per cent general rate is to be restored to veterans who received a pension for pulmonary tuberculosis prior to 2 November 1978; eligibility for double orphan's pension is to be extended; increases are to be made in the amount of income permitted for determination of eligibility for service pension and fringe benefits; disability pension is to be discontinued totally in determining a veteran's elegibility for service pension and fringe benefits; and certain decisions relating to social security beneficiaries are also to apply to repatriation pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Mr Deputy Speaker, the pensions payable for amputations or loss of vision and the levels of the amounts payable for many other benefits including supplementary assistance, also known as rent allowance, are to be increased. The legislation will also be amended to incorporate provision for certain types of payments that have been made on an 'act of grace' basis. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced in the Budget, eligibility for repatriation benefits is to be extended to members of peacekeeping forces who served as representatives of Australia prior to 2 November 1981. Honourable members will recall that the Repatriation Act was amended following the 1981-82 Budget to provide benefits to representatives of this country who served overseas after 2 November 1981 with peacekeeping, observation and monitoring forces raised or organised by the United Nations or other international bodies. These provisions were further extended earlier this year to cover Australian members of the multinational force now serving in Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed by the Bill will provide eligibility for repatriation benefits for defence force personnel who have, since 1948, been involved overseas in peacekeeping and monitoring roles and for the Australian police contingents on Cyprus which have been carrying out a similar role since 1964. The Bill also provides for the extension of what is commonly known as the ' arisen out of or attributable to' provision to members of the forces who participated in conflicts other than World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> Some publicity has been given recently to contentions that Vietnam veterans have been disadvantaged by not having applicable to them the arisen out of or attributable to provision which has been applicable to World War II forces. In practice the provision appears to give little eligibility coverage that is not included by the occurrence and other provisions applicable to these groups. Very few instances have come to attention where eligibility for disability pension would arise because of the application of the arisen out of or attributable to provision apart from the occurrence provision. As a general principle, the Government considers that the same principles of eligibility should apply to all veterans for all conflicts unless there is good reason to introduce specific principles and provisions for particular conflicts or for particular groups of veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended to undertake a review of these provisions as part of the thorough review of all repatriation legislation now about to be undertaken. This review which will be concerned with a wide range of complex provisions and will take some time will apply the principles I have mentioned and be undertaken on the basis that there will be no watering down of existing standards of eligibility. In the short term, the Government has taken the view that the comparatively simple amendment to introduce the arisen out of or attributable to provision to all veterans should be introduced at the first opportunity to amend the legislation. This we are now doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to extend eligibility for service pension to Commonwealth and allied mariners who served in a theatre of war during World War II. The basis of eligibility is similar to that applied under the Repatriation Act to Australian mariners and members of the armed forces of Commonwealth and allied countries. Last year eligibility for service pension was extended to include Australian mariners. The proposed amendment extends the service pension to those living in Australia who served against the enemy or assisted the Allied cause during World War II. I am sure all honourable members are aware of the great hardships suffered by merchant mariners during the war and of the important role they played in the war effort. The Bill includes provisions which exclude any mariner who in any way assisted the enemy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another provision gives effect to the decision of the Government to restore to veterans who were in receipt of a pension prior to November 1978 in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), the 100 per cent general rate, irrespective of the actual assessment of their condition. This will restore them to the position prevailing prior to 2 November 1978 at which time pensions were frozen and reassessed according to actual incapacity. Restoration of the pension will be to a minimum of 100 per cent of the general rate from 6 January 1983. As with other disability pension rates, pension will be increased in line with movements in the consumer price index. These arrangements which do not include retrospective payments have been agreed to by the Federated TB Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that, from 11 November 1982, any disability pension received by a veteran or dependant will be totally disregarded as income when assessing levels of service pension and fringe benefits. This initiative that has been described as historic by the Returned Services League, will, I am sure, be welcomed by all honourable members. The proportion of disability pension disregarded for this purpose at present is 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with social security amendments, the income level used to determine a veteran's eligibility to receive the maximum rate of service pension will be raised from $20 a week to $30 a week for a single pensioner and from $34.50 a week to $50 a week for married pensioners. In addition, the fringe benefits limits will be raised from $40 a week to $54 a week for a single pensioner and from $68 a week to $90 a week for a married couple. These changes which will apply from 11 November this year will assist veterans who receive small increases in their income to retain their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for an increase in the maximum amount of supplementary allowance-that is, rent allowance-payable to a service pensioner from $8 a week to $10 a week from 11 November 1982. Provision has been made in the Bill for increases in many other repatriation benefits to severely disabled veterans and in pensions paid to orphans. They are intended to have effect from 11 November 1982. The increases in benefits are in line with movements in the consumer price index in the twelve-month period since the previous increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The pension paid for amputations or loss of vision, which is payable in addition to the repatriation disability pension, is to be increased by approximately 11 per cent for the various categories of disablement. The rate of attendant's allowance is to be increased from $21.02 a week to $23.30 a week in the case of a veteran who is blind or suffering a cerebro-spinal injury. In the case of a veteran who has had both arms amputated or who is blind and has lost hearing or speech, the allowance is to be increased from $42.05 a week to $46.60 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The present eligibility criteria for a double orphan's pension provide that it can be paid only if a parent veteran's death was due to an accepted war-caused disability or the veteran was at the time of death in receipt of a special rate pension or pension as a double amputee. This requirement will be widened by the Bill and will mean that the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be able to assist the children of veterans who served in a theatre of war but who died from causes not accepted as due to service, by making available to them the double orphan's pension. Other increases affecting veterans announced in the Budget, including increases in the funeral benefit, clothing allowance and recreation transport allowance, will be provided for by amendment of the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the amendment in the Bill which relates to act of grace payments. By way of background I explain that, since 1942, special arrangements have existed for the payment of pensions and benefits to certain persons who were not members of the forces as defined in the Repatriation Act and associated legislation, but who were exposed to the risk of injury or death through their employment in connection with World War II or later conflicts or war-like operations. In the main, these arrangements have applied to certain persons with part time service during World War II, representatives of various philanthropic organisations who were attached to the forces and accredited by the relevant service department and certain Commonwealth employees. The benefits available are largely the same as those applicable under the Repatriation Act to members of the forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The special arrangements I have mentioned do not have legislative authority. Traditionally, the benefits have been conferred as acts of grace but are not in accord with formal act of grace payments under section 34A of the Audit Act. Eligibility will be conferred by amending the definition of member of the forces to include these people. The action taken will also provide them with the appeal rights applicable to members of the forces which they do not have now. I am sure that honourable members will agree that this group of pensioners who provided such valuable service in war should have their rights formally perpetuated by being incorporated into repatriation legislation. This Bill demonstrates in a formal way the Government's continuing concern to ensure that those who have served Australia, our Commonwealth partners, and allies, in war or war-like conflicts can be certain of being adequately compensated for the losses which they have suffered and the sacrifices they have made. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Set out below are the numbers of new claims and claims for new disabilities which have been determined by Repatriation Boards in respect of Special Overseas Service in the years indicated. New claims refer to claims lodged by veterans who have not previously lodged a claim with the Department. New disability claims refer to cases where a veteran with an accepted disability lodges a subsequent claim. The figures do not relate to numbers of veterans.</PARA>
<PARA>Number of new claims and new disability claims</PARA>
<PARA>1.7.1971-30.6.1972  3,242 1.7.1972-30.6.1973  1,798 1.7.1973-30.6.1974  1,110 1. 7.1974-30.6.1975  904 1.7.1975-30.6.1976  793 1.7.1976-30.6.1977  923 1.7.1977- 30.6.1978  707 1.7.1978-30.6.1979  664 1.7.1979-30.6.1980  776 1.7.1980-30.6. 1981  1,092 1.7.1981-30.6.1982  1,228</PARA>
<PARA> Equivalent figures are not available for the period before 1 July 1971. Between 1 July 1965 and 30 June 1971, 9,185 new claims were determined.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Statistics concerning chemical claims have been maintained since Januaray 1980. To 31 August 1982 a total of 1,224 claims had been lodged in which there was some reference by the claimant to exposure to chemicals. Of the total, 991 claims had been determined by Repatriation Boards and the balance, 233, were undetermined as at 31 August 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) According to the figures provided by the State Branches of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, one claim was accepted specifically on that basis. Of the 991 claims determined referred to in (2), 393 were accepted.</PARA>
<PARA> (4), (5) and (6) These questions appear to rest on a misunderstanding of my announcement of 15 February 1982 on revision of the study program. Since early in 1980, in unsuccessful claims or appeal cases, veterans who mentioned a possible link between chemicals and their claimed disability have been advised of review arrangements to apply after study activity was completed. In that advice it was pointed out that the veteran continued to have the right of immediate appeal and that action in this regard would not jeopardise any future review of the claim which might be found necessary as a result of the findings of the study. My predecessor clarified this issue further when he told the House of Representatives on 21 February 1980 that rejected claims would be reviewed if a study revealed a connection between reported disabilities and exposure to herbicides in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Commonwealth Institute of Health (CIH) survey as originally envisaged has been modified, the revised program provides for the conduct of important epidemiological study activity in relation to Vietnam veterans. CIH epidemiological study activity has not terminated; in the absence of study results revealing a connection between disabilities and herbicide exposure in Vietnam, it follows that steps have not been taken to review the claims mentioned. It is open to the veterans concerned to appeal or to lodge a further claim at any time and some have done so.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Details of the revised scientific study program were given in my announcement of 15 February 1982. The announcement was made shortly after the Government had formally decided on the total program. Work which had commenced earlier in order to prepare individual elements of the program for submission for Government approval has contributed to progress made. The two studies for which designs were approved and which are currently proceeding are:</PARA>
<PARA> A case control study of congenital anomalies, commencing with hospital records of malformed and healthy children, which will enable the incidence of major birth defects in Vietnam veterans' children to be compared with the incidence in children of members of the Australian Army in the Vietnam era who did not serve in Vietnam and in children of the community. Completion is expected by the end of 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> A retrospective mortality study which will investigate the causes and incidence of death among Vietnam veterans and a control group of Vietnam-era ex-servicemen who did not serve in Vietnam. Completion is expected by late in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The final reports on the pilot study will be released.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr Fife</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the occurrence to which the honourable member refers. It involved an Air France Airbus which suffered an engine failure when a turbine disc disintegrated during take-off. The take-off was aborted and the aircraft was stopped on the runway after travelling 1,900 metres. There were no injuries but the aircraft suffered substantial damage.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The runway at Sanaa is 3,252 metres long and 2,206 metres above sea level; and (b) My Department does not hold information on the position of buildings relative to the Sanaa runway-nor is it required to do so: the airport is neither a destination nor a designated alternative for any Australian operator.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A TAA Airbus could take-off from Adelaide Runway 05, the more limiting runway, at a weight slightly greater than 159 tonnes under the conditions specified, experience an engine failure at the most critical point and still clear all obstacles in the take-off area by at least 35 feet (10.7 metres), the minimum legal requirement. The height of the aircraft above the ground at a point 400 metres beyond the runway end would not be less than 17 metres in the most adverse case based upon certification performance data but more probably the height would be closer to 26 metres. This latter figure is derived empirically from a series of exercises conducted in the Airbus flight simulator.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article published in the Courier Mail of 12 May 1982 in which the United Nations Environment Program executive director, Dr Mostafa Tolba, said that in the last decade on almost every front there had been marked deterioration in the quality of our shared environment and that the world faced an ecological disaster as final as nuclear war within a couple of decades unless governments take action now.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1886" SPEAKER="McVeigh The Hon D.T." NAMEID="ML7" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="GRIFFITH">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ML7">Mr McVeigh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Media reports of opening speeches at the United Nations Environment Programme Governing Council Session of a Special Character in Nairobi, 10-18 May 1982, such as contained in the newspaper article referred to by the honourable member, have tended to emphasise the more critical environmental problems facing the international community. The following extract from the statement by the Leader of the Australian Delegation to this meeting puts the Australian situation into perspective.</PARA>
<PARA> . . . In considering the environmental achievements and failures since Stockholm and the state of the world environment now, some of our thoughts inevitably turn to our own countries. We reflect on the progress we have achieved. We recognise the problems still outstanding and the efforts still to be made. We hope that our own experiences, faltering as they may have been, may offer some contribution or understanding, in support of our collective efforts to make an environmentally better world for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA> Looking back over the past ten years of environment protection and nature conservation in Australia, some encouraging progress can be reported. Environmental agencies are firmly established in all our governments Federal and State. Sound laws exist and are well administered in all the main fields of pollution control. Extensive areas of parks and reserves have been permanently secured. Much has been done to protect our wildlife on land and in the sea. Environment assessment procedures are applied to major development projects. Our communities are alert to environmental problems and communicate their view freely to governments. Arrangements have been made for collaboration between governments within our country. We derive much benefit as a party to many international environmental agreements and conventions. Looking ahead, we are well advanced with the preparation of a National Conservation Strategy, which has provided a unique opportunity to assess the current state of the whole Australian environment, and to plan effectively for the future.</PARA>
<PARA> Even so, we would not for one moment wish to diminish the challenges that lie ahead of us. In a global perspective Australia's environmental problems may appear small and manageable. But we remain concerned about the fragility of our huge arid lands-with maintaining the productive capacity of our soils, with arresting the decline in trees and forest cover, and with saving our unique flora and fauna from extinction. We are concerned to maintain, and improve where necessary, the quality of our inland and coastal waters. We must improve our arrangements for controlling chemicals in the environment, and improve our land planning and land management practices.</PARA>
<PARA> Our desire in Australia for careful management of our natural and man-made environment is clear. Yet it is no less matched by concern which we share with other countries for the establishment of effective international mechanisms and programs designed to deal resolutely with environmental problems of global as well as local character. In the ten years since the establishment of the Stockholm Action Plan and the creation of UNEP much has been done to give effect to this goal. As we have heard from the Executive Director in recent days, various international conventions have been established, international meetings, workshops and demonstration projects conducted and a wide range of information, monitoring and assessment networks developed.</PARA>
<PARA> A major lesson to be learned from the achievements of international environmental cooperation over the past ten years, is surely that the cause for urgency associated with the Stockholm Conference has not diminished. Some of the recommendations of the Stockholm Plan remain to be fully implemented. Many of the specific environmental problems which achieved prominence in 1972 are still with us. New issues of growing concern have arisen.</PARA>
<PARA> In addressing these issues we recognise the acute difficulties faced by developing countries in providing the necessary resources and in harmonising environmental protection and development. We all share these problems to a greater or lesser extent and have a common perception of the urgent need to resolve them.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention one of the environmental insights which has recently gained widespread recognition in Australia. Until very recent times, there has been a near idyllic balance between population and resources which could be drawn from the land. This balance was no accident. Earlier societies evolved a life style and social customs that allowed people to live in permanent harmony with their environment. The ancient inhabitants of our country had a complete identification, as a people, and as individuals, with the land itself. The life of the people, all other living things and the land use were all seen as part of an inextricably related whole. It was recognised that if the land and its natural resources were harmed or destroyed, the people would suffer likewise.</PARA>
<PARA> We are drawing from this long experience, which no doubt is shared by other early societies, and my delegation hopes that the declaration and resolutions of this special session will record, in some meaningful way, the need for countries of the world consciously to achieve an equilibrium between population, resources and the environment. An equilibrium which will be stable in perpetuity and established at a level where all the people can live in health and dignity while still maintaining viable co-existence with the other forms of life which share this planet with us.</PARA>
<PARA> In this respect the words of President Moi were especially pertinent in drawing attention to the direct relationship between rapidly increasing populations and the environment. I believe we are all becoming more aware that the world's less intensively used areas and resources are small and finite, when viewed in the perspective of all the centuries which lie ahead. These unexpended resources may help provide, at best, a relatively few years of additional time for the countries of the world to each achieve equilibrium between mankind and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Second Report (1981) of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation on the adequacy of legislative and administrative arrangements for environment protection included a recommendation that regular comprehensive reports on the state of and changes in the Australian environment be prepared and tabled in this Parliament. The Government is still examining the Committee's recommendations and its response will be announced in due course.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is characteristic of Government-sponsored films that they seek to portray a positive image of their country and society.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The Library has done so for over 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 34 Embassies and High Commissions have had films handled by the National Film Lending Collection. They are: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, Finland, German Democratic Republic, India , Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Republic, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, United States of America and Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No charges are levied on the Embassies because the arrangement has advantages for both parties. The Embassies receive access to the Film Lending Collection's well-developed distribution system, the Film Lending Collection can thereby substantially extend the size of its collection without cost; and Australian film users have efficient access to a much wider range of films than would be otherwise possible.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The National Library is a non-partisan provider of information. It is not a censor of ideas nor does it identify with particular viewpoints. This applies to films as well as to books or other media. Hence, it has not barred any films because of political or social content, though it has refused to accept films on other grounds, such as insufficient audience appeal or poor technical standard. It also tries to ensure, as far as possible, that multiple viewpoints on major issues are represented.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The Department of Foreign Affairs occasionally circularises Embassies to advise them of the service provided by the National Film Lending Collection. As opportunity arises in day-to-day business, Library staff advise Embassy officials of the service also. However, there is no active canvassing of Embassies by the Library. Normally Embassies take the initiative and make the first approach.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Consultation between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the National Library is not frequent but an awareness is maintained of the possibility of the Library being unduly used as an overt propaganda channel for foreign governments to the potential embarrassment of the Australian Government. No Embassy has yet attempted to do this.</PARA>
