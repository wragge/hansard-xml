The artist, a Mr Alan McDonald, a student at the Canberra College of Advanced Education, had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the first of several different paintings I intend to do to brighten the place up a bit--</PARA>
<PARA>This vile symbol, the most cursed in the history of mankind, is coming off the garage door and it will be coming off today. I believe this is a deliberate outrage, an affront against decency and a despicable act-coming, as the honourable, gallant and distinguished member for Kennedy said, three days before Anzac Day. I am taking immediate legal advice to ascertain my powers to act in this matter. At this very moment the Assistant Secretary of the Legislation and Policy Co-ordination Division in the Department of the Capital Territory, Mr Hedley, and other officers of my Department are waiting on Mr McDonald at his residence formally to direct and require him to remove that symbol forthwith. In addition, I am in conference with the Minister for Administrative Services who is responsible, of course, for the Australian Federal Police. I assure the House and I assure the Australian public that the action necessary will be taken to have this symbol removed.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, I draw attention to the fact that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Sir Colin Woods, has granted approval for a group from the Canberra College of Advanced Education to take part in the Anzac Day march on Sunday in Canberra. Inquiries are under way and if it is ascertained that Mr Alan McDonald is connected with that group from the CCAE, I indicate-the Minister for Administrative Services will confirm this-that appropriate action will be taken with respect to the permission already granted.

<QUESTION PAGE="1733" SPEAKER="Hayden The Hon W.G." NAMEID="RK4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="OXLEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a somewhat more prosaic form I ask a question of the Minister for Administrative Services. I refer to repeated commitments by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Administrative Services that those who give evidence to the joint police task force about the activities of the Nugan Hand group will be given protection and confidentiality. Is he aware of one such person who, as an investigator for the Army in the late 1960s, uncovered a wide spectrum of illegal activities by Nugan Hand and people connected with Nugan Hand, including currency violation, arms trafficking and tax evasion? Is the Minister aware that this person provided a comprehensive report of these activities to the Government early in 1971? As a result of this report is he aware that this person claims to have responded to an official personal request to give detailed evidence about his investigations to members of the task force in Canberra in February last year? Does he know that that person further claims that within 36 hours of co-operating with the task force, information about his evidence was circulating in various quarters in Melbourne? Is he also aware that at the same time, according to this person, a chain of connected events began that had the effect of destroying his livelihood, causing the loss of his house and threatening the physical wellbeing of his family? In the light of these circumstances, will the Prime Minister and the Minister for Administrative Services guarantee that witnesses who come forward to testify on the activities of the Nugan Hand group will be fully protected from any future victimisation, harassment or physical danger?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1733" SPEAKER="Newman The Hon K.E." NAMEID="WM7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BASS" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can only assume that the person about whom the Leader of the Opposition is talking is the person I have in mind. It is very difficult, without knowing whom we are talking about, to be certain. When the Leader of the Opposition made similar allegations on AM yesterday I took the step of writing to the Leader of the Opposition asking him to inform me as to whom he was talking about and particularly to substantiate the claims he made on AM that the Australian Federal Police, by implication, leaked 'like a sieve'. I took that as a very serious allegation. I certainly intend to follow that up to make sure that any evidence that the Leader of the Opposition has is acted upon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I respond completely to the Leader of the Opposition I want to make two points about this continuing debate in Parliament. This debate began when the Leader of the Opposition accused the Deputy Prime Minister of being involved in trying to stop an inquiry into the Nugan Hand group. That was found to be totally false and, worse, we all now know that the Leader of the Opposition used the forms of this House quite improperly to bring that accusation against the Deputy Prime Minister. That is the first point. The second stream of allegations that the Leader of the Opposition made was based on documents that were given to him by an ex-officer named Bailey. The House will recall that I asked the Leader of the Opposition to table those documents in the House, as he strung the thing along for all the political value he could get out of it. I advise the House that all the documents that we finally got out of the Leader of the Opposition had been either with the joint task force investigating Nugan Hand or with the Royal Commissioner.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hayden" NAMEID="RK4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr Hayden</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Except one, but a copy of that document was with the files that we gave to the Royal Commissioner. The point I am making is that the stream of allegations that the Leader of the Opposition brought into this House wasted our time week after week. If he had told us what was on those files and what documents he had we would have been able to tell the Opposition that the matters were already being investigated and that this Government had provided all the relevant files to the two investigations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come now to the gentleman about whom I think the Leader of the Opposition was talking. I can only assume it is the same person because he still has not had the decency to tell me who it is, despite the fact that I have asked him. If we are talking about the same gentleman, it is true that this ex-army officer did come forward to the Australian Federal Police with information concerning Nugan Hand. The Federal Police took it very seriously and invited members of the New South Wales police force who formed the Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking which was investigating Nugan Hand, also to interview this gentleman. This was done. Later in the year, towards the end of 1981, after all those investigations were under way, the gentleman wrote to the Prime Minister and accused the Australian Federal Police of leaking or providing information, I presume to his competitors, which meant that his business was in the hands of creditors. The Government immediately acted on that information. It was passed to me and I immediately had conferences with the Australian Federal Police and my Department .</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the accusation that leakage by the Australian Federal Police caused the disruption or closure of his business, this gentleman, on the advice given him by my Department, was invited to take the matter to the Ombudsman. That is where the matter now is-being investigated by the Ombudsman. All honourable members will recall that the Government introduced that procedure and that this Parliament endorsed the concept that if complaints were made against any police officers the Ombudsman would be there to investigate them impartially and report to the Government. The present situation is that the Australian Federal Police has provided an interim report to the Ombudsman. However, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner is not satisfied with that report and more information is to be provided to the Ombudsman. Therefore, we await the Ombudsman's investigation.</PARA>

It has been informed-and I have been subsequently advised-that the Ombudsman has been in touch with the gentleman concerned and that that gentleman is happy with the way in which the investigation is going.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the feelings of the New South Wales and Victorian housing Ministers on this matter in particular. At the outset I say that obviously they are confused. Defence housing is not a part of welfare housing. It is owned by the Department of Defence and is for the housing of Service personnel and their families. Under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement ( Servicemen) there are arrangements whereby the Minister for Housing and Construction can inform the State housing Ministers that certain houses are surplus to defence requirements. Alternatively, the State housing Ministers can request the Federal Minister for Housing and Construction to give to them houses which they believe are surplus to the requirements of the Defence Department. It is true that occasionally houses that are owned by the Defence Department are left vacant, but there are very good reasons for that. Quite obviously, Service transfers and repostings take place. The houses concerned may not be in the required location and may be unsuitable. The Department of Defence keeps the matter under very close scrutiny. When it is quite obvious that the houses are surplus to requirements, the Department of Defence immediately advises me and I, in turn, notify the State housing Ministers that they are available for the provision of welfare housing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I have stated is true. In cases in which it is not clear to the Department of Defence that houses are required by it, the Department advises me and in many cases I come to an arrangement with the particular State housing Minister to transfer the houses to him temporarily. This presents enormous difficulties. It is quite easy to get people into these houses but it is very difficult indeed to get them out when the Department of Defence requires the houses for defence personnel. To sum up, the Defence Department is responsible for providing accommodation for defence personnel. Notwithstanding the efforts that it has made over the years, in many areas there is a shortage for such personnel and their families. We as a government, inspired by the Minister for Defence, are doing what we can to overcome that lag, but the Defence Department is not responsible for building up welfare housing stocks. The Department of Defence and the Ministry of Housing and Construction cannot be blamed by the States of New South Wales and Victoria for their failing to provide welfare housing in their respective States.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may just go back over the record, it will demonstrate what I have just said. The first thing that happened with the Nugan Hand group was that the Prime Minister, in taking the initiative, extended the terms of reference of the Joint Task Force of Commonwealth-New South Wales police forces to investigate the matter. That was the first thing-a deliberate attempt to make sure that the matter was under investigation. Then we came to the matter of debates in this House. It was pointed out to the Leader of the Opposition that that task force, on our initiative, was investigating the matter, and consistently through the debate that we had on the matter I pointed out two things to the Leader of the Opposition. First of all, there was the Stewart Royal Commission investigating matters that at least related to Nugan Hand. I admitted in debate that I was not certain whether, and the advice I have received was not certain whether, the Stewart Royal Commission could investigate the matter, but the advice I was receiving indicated that on balance it probably could. That was said consistently during the debate. We came to a morning when serious allegations were made afresh by the Leader of the Opposition. What I did was this: I said, 'Let us take the new matters which the Leader of the Opposition has introduced', and I sent them to Mr Justice Stewart myself. The whole Parliament endorsed that action. More than that, at the same time I pointed out that when the Commonwealth set down the Royal Commission in association with the States the terms of reference were such that, if necessary, they could be expanded. The Premiers agreed with that. The Prime Minister agreed with that. That is what we said. To summarise, we had set up a joint task force- Long before the Leader of the Opposition was calling for extended terms of reference for the Stewart Royal Commission, I had informed this House that we were willing to extend the terms of reference and that I and the Government were testing the terms of reference on the information that the Leader of the Opposition had given us. That is the position. It demonstrates our willingness at all times to act. For the Leader of the Opposition to claim that he has had some moral victory is absolutely ridiculous on the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>

Traditionally, Australian Governments have been able to borrow at very fine margins and therefore it is in the interests of Australian taxpayers that we take advantage of the best available advice in respect of individual markets.

<PARA>Dear Neil</PARA>
<PARA>PROPOSED SCHEDULE OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that your Department has recently been collecting information from , inter alia, relevant State and Commonwealth authorities regarding their proposed investment in infrastructure over the next several years, and that publication of such a schedule is envisaged within the next couple of weeks as a supplement to the schedule of ''Major Manufacturing and Mining Investment Projects'' relating to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> My officers have expressed their concern about this project on several occasions, but I understand the attitude of your officers to be that a decision now not to publish would be embarrassing because of undertakings given to the State authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this letter is to convey to you personally my concern about the proposed publication of these estimates. There is, first, the question of the meaning and reliability of such estimates and their potential for misuse. I understand, for example, that not all the States have responded as fully as requested. Additionally, there are doubts about the extent to which the information received from individual authorities has the imprimatur of State Governments and, even where that might be the case, what meaning can be attached to it in advance, in some cases years in advance, of relevant State Budgetary and Loan Council processes. I believe that publication of the schedule would give any estimates therein a degree of credibility and prominence they could not possibly warrant (and should not be assisted in attaining).</PARA>
<PARA> Of even more concern, however, are the potential difficulties which I see publication creating for the Commonwealth in its dealings with the States in the area of infrastructure financing at the forthcoming meetings of the Loan Council in May and June, and beyond. Although Cabinet has not yet completed its consideration of this matter, it is my expectation that the Commonwealth will be seeking at the forthcoming Loan Council meetings a significant re-scheduling of borrowings under projects already approved. In the longer term the pressures building up in the economy-as evidenced most recently by the December quarter National Accounts, released last week-in part as a result of resource developments, underline the point that keeping the infrastructure program within reasonable bounds will be a continuing requirement. I need hardly say that the publication in the next couple of weeks of a schedule of the sort proposed would be anything but helpful from that standpoint. I gather that investment totalling $20.8 billion has found its way into the ''committed'' and ''final feasibility'' categories. In my view, publication of figures of this sort, whatever caveats might be put on them, would be quickly promulgated as a ''benchmark'' of the infrastructure ''task'' facing the States over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA> Your officers have, I believe, also pointed to a demand by private developers for such estimates as a further reason for publication. Frankly, I find it difficult, in view of the nature of the estimates and the various alternatives available (e.g. the Jackson and Associates survey of construction activity already conducted on a consultancy basis for the Department of Housing and Construction) to attach any weight whatsoever to that argument. Indeed, I would have thought that, notwithstanding the fact that there will always be businessmen eager to have the Government do market research for them at the taxpayers' expense, the added information burden on the States and relevant private developers runs quite counter to what the Government has been trying to achieve in the Review of Commonwealth Functions. This is quite apart from the question of what possible value to private developers there could be in estimates which quite clearly, under the pressure of economic events, are not going to be realized. Better, I should have thought, to have no estimates at all than to have such misleading ones as, under those circumstances, these will certainly prove to be.</PARA>
<PARA> I also put it to you, in all frankness, that it seems more than a little ironic that the Department of the Chairman of the Functions Review Committee should be seeking a new role for itself as the collator of information on projected public sector infrastructure expenditures, particularly when relevant information is already available to the Commonwealth through normal Loan Council processes and at a time when the capacity of the Bureau of Statistics to undertake collections in this kind of area is being so tightly circumscribed. There is a strong smell of ''making work'' about it which seems even less attractive in these times than it would in any case.</PARA>
<PARA> For those various reasons, therefore, I would ask that you consider carefully whether the proposed publication should proceed. As you will gather from the foregoing my own strong view is that it should not.</PARA>
<PARA> I should say that we have mentioned this matter to the Treasurer, who has reacted very strongly to the same effect.</PARA>
<PARA> I should also mention that I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Chairman of the Public Service Board for his information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity of looking at the answer that I gave to the honourable gentleman. I have not looked at that answer since I gave it. I will accept that the honourable gentleman correctly recalls to the House what I remarked at the time. It is true that, as a consequence of the correspondence that he refers to between Mr Stone and Mr Currie, there was a difference of opinion between the departments regarding publication of those figures. The question of whether what Mr Stone said in the letter and therefore the views of the Department of the Treasury on the publication of those figures represents an attempt to suppress the release of information is, of course, a question of how one interprets those remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not accept that, every time a department head or a Minister argues that there are reasons why particular information ought not to be made available and that there are disadvantages in that information being made available, that necessarily represents suppression of figures. The response of some members of the Opposition and others in the community to the figures that have been put out repeatedly by this Government regarding resource development has been more to the effect that we have been too anxious to provide the figures. In that context , whatever might be said about revisions of expectations in the resource development area that have occurred in recent months, the fact is that the levels of business fixed investment in Australia are likely this financial year to achieve the target of a 10 per cent to 15 per cent rise in real terms. The level of business investment in Australia now is treble what it was in 1977-78, and if the honourable gentleman will be a little patient there will be a bit more news later today which will give some fairly dramatic evidence of the continuing success of this Government's economic policies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I always thought so; I was taught that at school. As far as I know there has been no change in the situation in the intervening years. Let me deal seriatim with the several questions asked by the honourable member. It would not be possible for fish to come from New Zealand to Tasmania and get the benefit of freight equalisation to get it across the little piece of water between us unless the fish passed through a further manufacturing process. If the honourable member is aware of fish being freighted to Tasmania and gaining the benefit of freight equalisation I ask for further evidence so that action can be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not aware of fish being flown into New Zealand by air. I will have that matter checked. I am aware, though, that there has been a great increase in the value of fish that has come from New Zealand over the past three years. In 1978- 79 $9.2m worth of fish was imported. The amount went up to $14.9m worth of fish the next year and to $19.6m worth in 1980-81. This is a very big increase in the value and volume of fish from New Zealand. Part of this volume of fish is exported by a consortium-as the honourable member mentioned, a Russian-New Zealand consortium- that has been fishing off New Zealand. In the early days that consortium exported a high volume of fish called orange roughy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr NIXON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is its name. I am not going to debate the issue-it is called orange roughy. We took up with New Zealand the question of whether this fish was being landed at an appropriate price or was in fact being dumped. Some sort of voluntary restraint was entered into. At the same time a great deal of shark was being caught off New Zealand and was being put in refrigerated store. I understand that in recent days that product has been released from store and has been sent across to the Australian market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time there has been a very big increase in the Australian catch-an 87 per cent increase-over the last year. All of this has combined to lead to a decline of some 20 per cent in the price on the Australian market from January to March, and the price is still falling. I will look further at the questions raised by the honourable member and see whether I can give him any further information. I do not believe there is a case for dumping in the price paid for the fish from New Zealand, but I will look at the total impact on the Australian industry.</PARA>

I think it could be inferred from that reply that the Thai Government was unaware of the practices to which the honourable gentleman referred. I have now been informed that the Thai Government is aware of violations of the child labour law in Thailand which prohibits the employment of children under 15 years of age and that the Thai Government itself has undertaken a program to publicise the issue. So that, far from there being a need to make representations to the Thai Government on this question, that Government itself has taken steps to deal with violations of Thai law.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-When the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced on Monday, 19 April, that he had accepted the resignations of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) and the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) as Ministers in his Government, in the course of his statement he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Relevant papers will be available to be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) tabled a series of documents on Tuesday, 20 April. Yesterday at Question Time the Prime Minister, in answer to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), said:</PARA>
<PARA> The head of the Department had been asked to provide all files that were relevant to this subject; all files that related to it. That question, as I understand it, was asked more than once. Checks were made in New South Wales because the documents that have been tabled, as I am advised, mostly come from files held in New South Wales rather than head office. Subject to what the Minister may say, it is also my understanding that the files were sent to Canberra so that there could be a double check through head office as to whether there are any additional pieces of paper relevant to the issue. On the advice that has been given to me, all pieces of paper that are relevant to this issue have been tabled in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Prime Minister said yesterday at Question Time. I was quoting then from the Prime Minister's greens, not having seen the final Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> I so indicated to the Prime Minister, on the basis of written advice given to me by the Secretary of my Department, that all documents associated with the importation of a colour television set by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr MacKellar) are contained in the booklet tabled in the House on 20 April, entitled 'Documents relating to the importation of a colour television set by the Honourable M. J. R. MacKellar, M.P.', and dated 20 April 1982 and the associated explanatory memorandum. I have now to tell the House that during the dinner break last night the permanent head of my Department gave me a further document which I wish to table, and will shortly. This is a minute paper dated 4 February 1982 and signed by Mr R. E. Kennedy, Director, Internal Affairs Unit. That document, on its face, does not expressly refer to the issue. It does, however, refer to matters described as 'of vital concern to the departmental administration'. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, this document is relevant and my duty to the House is to table it. The reason the document is relevant is that, upon inquiries having been made of Mr Kennedy, it has been brought to my notice that one of the matters referred to was the matter of a television set brought into Australia by the honourable member for Warringah without payment of duty. I have discussed with the Prime Minister my proposed tabling of this document, and he is likewise of the view that the document should be tabled. It has, of course, always been the Government's position that all relevant documents with respect to this matter should be tabled. I realise that the tabling of this document, like the tabling of the other documents, refers to individuals. However, the paramount duty is of course to this House, and I am obliged to table the document. I table that document. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances I have issued a further instruction to the permanent head of my Department that further searches should be made to ensure that all relevant documents are made available and, of course, subsequently tabled. The Government is determined that all relevant documents will be tabled. Should any further relevant documents be discovered, they will of course be tabled. I should add that I have invited the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) to examine the files to see the originals of the documents and that invitation is still open to him. I discussed with the honourable member for Parramatta certain covering letters which enclosed the papers which were subsequently tabled the other day. Although they do not, of course, take the matter anywhere with respect to substantive issues, nevertheless on a very wide interpretation of relevancy covering letters enclosing papers may be construed by some people as being relevant. Although I have already discussed these with the honourable member for Parramatta and I know that he is not concerned about them, nevertheless I wish, as an abundance of caution, likewise to table those accompanying papers. </PARA>
<PARA> To take the matter even further, one of those accompanying letters was in a different file, and it-the accompanying letter-had itself a notation on it. I think, again as an abundance of caution-although in my view the matter is not taken any further by such a statement-I should table that document, which I have also shown to the honourable member for Parramatta. There is a notation on the bottom of it, and it is for that reason that it might be construed as an additional document, even though a copy of the principal document is already tabled. I table that document. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, the Government's concern, above all, is to table all relevant documents. I have indicated to the honourable member for Parramatta that he is at liberty to look at the originals of the files. There are obviously things such as newspaper cuttings but I wish to give an assurance to you, Mr Speaker, to the honourable member from the Opposition who is responsible for the handling of this matter, and to the House that it is my conviction and belief that I have now tabled, in the exercise of my duty, all papers relevant to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Sinclair)-by leave-agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That this House, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1908, authorises the publication of the minute dated 4 February 1982 from the Director, Internal Affairs Unit, together with the associated papers presented earlier this day by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave -The tabling of this document is another step along the tortuous road that started last October when the then Minister for Health brought a colour television set into Australia. It seems to us to be a travesty of the parliamentary system that it has taken so long for another document to be found. At the start this was a very straightforward problem. Did the Minister bring in a television set? Was it a colour set? Did he make a false declaration? Was duty paid? If not, why not? Did, in fact, the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs know that the television set was a colour set? Perhaps it was an honest mistake and perhaps early along the line the whole thing could have been solved very simply. But then it made the Press. Since then we have seen the Government thrashing about, searching for a credible story, a story acceptable to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) with his oft repeated statements about a high sense of ministerial propriety. We saw the odd spectacle of Ministers locked up for 24 hours, trying to concoct an acceptable statement. There were multiple statements and excessive shreddings. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. Yesterday in the House I asked the Prime Minister whether all the documents had been tabled. the Prime Minister is reported as having said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the head of the department had been asked to provide all relevant files. 'That request was made more than once, and I understand the files were all sent to Canberra so that there could be a double check with head office to see if there were any additional pieces of paper that were relevant to the issue'. </PARA>
<PARA>That was his answer. Yesterday, in the Senate, Senator Grimes asked a question about a report he knew of that had been prepared by Mr Kennedy, the head of the Internal Affairs Bureau, which concerned an interview that he had had with Mr Bennett, the New South Wales President of the Customs Officers Association. So last night, I believe after some searching into the deep, dark recesses of the Department's files, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) suggested to me that he had a paper which he wanted to table. Having looked at it, one could not possibly call it a document; I think a piece of paper is a better term. The Opposition objected to the tabling of this document. We did not think it fulfilled any reasonable purpose, so it was withdrawn. Then, later in the night, the Minister came in and said he intended to table it anyhow but unfortunately it was after 11 o'clock and it could not be tabled. That probably says something more about the inefficiency of this Government. Eventually, this morning, we have this document. The document tabled today achieves exactly what the Opposition feared right from the beginning of the MacKellar affair. It is a cheap attempt to discredit two officers working with the Bureau of Customs-Mr Peter Bennett, the New South Wales President of the Customs Officers Association, who is also a preventive officer in the Bureau, and Mr Robert Spanswick, the national secretary of the same organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has never been accepted that one can ignore revelations or allegations made by individuals simply on the basis of attempting to discredit them personally. That is not accepted in the law. It should not be accepted in the parliamentary sphere. The only test should be: Are the allegations being made by an individual true? Also, the motives for making those allegations are only partly relevant-to the extent that those motives make it unlikely that the individual is telling the truth. The allegations made by Bennett and Spanswick were true. It has now been shown by the resignations of the Ministers that they were. Any attempt now to discredit them is a shonky exercise and totally irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday evidence was produced in the House-it has not been denied-that another officer named Mayhew had been questioned, interrogated and intimidated on three occasions by senior departmental officers trying to shake his belief that the television set which was carried in by Mr MacKellar was in fact a colour television set. He was repeatedly interrogated and attempts made to make him believe that it was a black and white television set because that was the official view of the department. He stuck to the truth. He stuck to what he believed to be the truth. Surely that is an example of the nazi or communist technique of brainwashing people, of re-educating them to believe that something is not what they really do believe. That sort of procedure has brought no credit at all on the department or the Bureau of Customs. The document produced today has no relationship whatever to the MacKellar affair. It refers to an investigation which began on 1 October of last year, nearly a week before Mr MacKellar returned to Australia. However, the document does indicate that internal departmental inquiries were already going on against the two officers from the Customs Officers Association. The document also shows the existence of a number of 'reports'. Specifically, in paragraph 1 of the letter, Mr Kennedy says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Secretary requested that I prepare for him a report of the interview with Bennett. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is that report? The last paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I propose to discuss with Mr Kelly-</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly is the New South Wales Collector of Customs-</PARA>
<PARA> certain other matters . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Where are the records of those discussions? The first paragraph of the document that we have this morning refers to matters of vital concern to the departmental administration. The document that we have had tabled today is not a report on the investigation, or interrogation, at all. It is a report on the people who are being interviewed. It reveals more about the author than it does about the people being interviewed. The document that has been tabled by the Minister is most significant because it reveals how the internal affairs unit deals with anyone whom it regards as recalcitrant. Two honest officers who are critical of the operation are referred to as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Bennett raised a number of issues principally in respect to departmental administration. . . . We did take the opportunity to 'bleed' him of his thinking and aspersions. </PARA>
<PARA>Now what are we to read into that quotation? I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA> We did take the opportunity to 'bleed' him of his thinking and aspersions. </PARA>
<PARA>Does that language not clearly indicate that an attempt was made to convince him that what he was saying was wrong? Mr Kennedy continues:</PARA>
<PARA> It can be accepted that Bennett regards the Minister as being dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA>I guess that is for the nation to decide. The fact that Mr Bennett is still the New South Wales President of the Customs Officers Association, that he is still a working officer within the Customs Bureau and that the two Ministers are now on the back benches might lead one to believe that what he was saying was correct. Mr Bennett is then described as being 'most critical of senior administrative officers and their administrative ability'. Surely no one will cavil about that. From what we have found out about this department and the Customs Bureau in the last week or so surely no one will cavil about his view that he had grave fears about their administrative ability. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Together with his confederate Robert Spanswick he is currently before the Stewart Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at the little phrase, 'his confederate Robert Spanswick'. Surely that is an emotive description of a man who is honestly trying to do his job. Surely the term 'his confederate' is applied to criminals. Is it normally applied to a colleague working alongside him? Should we use the word ' confederate'? Surely that gives us another insight into the sort of document this is. The report states: 'he is currently before the Stewart Royal Commission '. Surely this report from Kennedy was dedicated to discrediting Bennett and Spanswick because they were about to give evidence before the Stewart Royal Commission on the maladministration of the Bureau of Customs. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that this document sheds no light at all on the MacKellar affair. It does indicate, however, a cheap attempt by the Government, an attempt by the Prime Minister-with whom I understand the tabling of this document has been discussed-to discredit two honest officers, two officers who were proven right by the Prime Minister himself when he dismissed the Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I asked the Prime Minister whether any additional documents on the MacKellar affair should be tabled. I think we will eventually get around to calling this the Telegate affair, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister said that all documents had been tabled already. However, I understand that there is a number of additional documents. Specifically, there is at least one more document prepared by Mr Kennedy regarding the MacKellar affair; that is, the document Senator Grimes asked about in the Senate yesterday. The Opposition would certainly like to see that document. Is this the start of a new process-the document-a-day-trick? How long is it going to take us to have all of the documents that are relevant to this case tabled in this Parliament?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says we object because a document was produced. I have clearly outlined that this document merely refers to the people who were interviewed. It is no record of interview. Mr Kennedy is a policeman. He may not be called that in the Department but he is a policeman. He is a former inspector of the Commonwealth police. Any person in Australia knows that any policeman interrogating a person or investigating a matter keeps notes in a diary. Where are the diary notes of the interview? All this document is is Kennedy's opinion of the people he was interviewing. It has no relevance at all. How long will this take? Must we go through a turgid, lingering process of recrimination and repetition before we elicit the tabling of all the documents? We want the lot- the records of interview, the police notes, the whole range of documents relevant to this investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Surely the new Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs must have misgivings about the Department which he is now administering. There is surely evidence of a cover-up. Mr MacKellar claims in all honesty that he offered to pay the duty. Did Mr Moore know that the television set was a colour television set? If he did , why was the duty not paid? This Department is a major revenue collecting department of this Government. Apart from the Australian Taxation Office, it probably collects more than any other agency-somewhere in the vicinity of $7, 000m a year. The Opposition has claimed that there is a need for a judicial inquiry into the whole running of the Bureau of Customs. Surely the events of the last few days have underlined the importance of that. Surely they have underlined the responsibility the Opposition has shown in bringing these facts to light. </PARA>
<PARA> The events of the last few days have really shown how incredibly incompetent this Government is, how incredibly bereft of morality it is. This is a government which is bent on cover-ups. We have a Prime Minister whose credibility is shot to pieces-the first Prime Minister in history who has merited a headline in a newspaper reading: 'Lies, lies, lies'. Kids in playgrounds now when telling lies talk about 'doing a Fraser'. What sort of a leader have we got? What sort of leadership has this country got? It is evident in the maladministration of a major department. The Prime Minister recently spent a good deal of taxpayers' money trying to justify himself in the electorate of Lowe by putting around a letter saying that it was not true. Nobody believed him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, in two respects. The first is that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) said that there was an intention to discredit certain persons, whom he named, by means of tabling this document. There is no intention to discredit anyone. The document was tabled consistent with my obligations to this House. It is my duty to table documents which are relevant to the issues we are canvassing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter is that a suggestion was made by the honourable member for Parramatta which disturbed me somewhat. It was to the effect that the fact that the document was not tabled last night was due to the Government and myself as representing the Government. That is not the case. We were ready, willing and able last night to table the document which is relevant to this matter. An attempt was made by the Opposition-not by the honourable member for Parramatta- to nobble me in the best traditions of the Sydney Australian Labor Party to prevent me from tabling this relevant document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The word 'nobble' is a racecourse expression which means an attempt to prevent somebody from doing his best. Last night I happened to be sitting alongside my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) when this document was shown to him. I said: 'I think it is outrageous to table a document that will malign two officers and has nothing to do with the MacKellar affair whatsoever'. The document maligns them in the terms that they are deemed to be not normal people but people who are apparently interested in their own self-aggrandisement. The document refers particularly to the evidence which they have given before the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. What would the royal commissioner think of these people if he read about this assessment which was made of them by a police officer without any supplementary evidence as to what took place? As my colleague, the honourable member for Parramatta, has said, everything that was complained about in respect of the MacKellar affair was true. But giving a virtual paramedical assessment of their capacity, or adulation of each other, or that of anybody else to give evidence before a royal commission whose inquiry is still part-heard does not help the normal conduct of justice. If a statement were tabled here regarding witnesses before a royal commission, you yourself, Mr Speaker, would be very guarded about whether it was proper to comment on the propriety, ability or otherwise of a witness. That is what this document does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown): 'I don't care whether you table the statement or not, but it is not right to do it' . He said: 'Well, I will go and ask the Prime Minister'. He then went down the corridor, asked the Prime Minister, came back and said: 'Well, I am going to table it'. I said: 'Well, table it. It is your responsibility'. He was not nobbled. He did not know what to do from the point of view of propriety. That is the most important thing. He had to run down the corridor to ask the Prime Minister what to do and he told him to table the document. I do not excuse him for it. He could not do it because of the lateness of time. That was his problem . But his problem of lateness of time was caused by his having to consult again with the Prime Minister. He could always have tabled the document. I would not have objected. </PARA>

I am very reluctant to refer to private conversations. I simply say two things: Firstly, I ask the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith to consult with his two colleagues who were with him-if he can remember who they are-and who were sitting next to him at the time and ask them to recount to him what the conversation was. Secondly, I say without any equivocation whatsoever, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) knows that this is true, he agreed with me that the document was relevant and that there was an obligation to table it. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden)-who I believe has behaved very creditably in this whole matter-has an opinion about this. I suggest, if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is on talking terms with his leader, that he talk to him about it. It was agreed with the Australian Labor Party that this document was relevant, as it clearly is, because it refers to certain matters, and we know that one of the matters was the importation of the colour television set. It is clearly relevant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my part in this whole deal has been painted by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) let me put the facts as I know them. I was given the document and I thought it was a fairly innocuous document, which it is. I also felt that it was only part of a series of documents. As I pointed out, it was only a report on people interviewed and not a report of the interview. I mentioned to the Minister that I was quite happy to have it tabled. I then discussed the matter with my senior colleague, who made no attempt to terrorise me. I do not think anybody would consider the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) to be a person who terrorises anybody, except the Government. He pointed out to me that it was quite unfair to Spanswick and Bennett to have this sort of stuff tabled in the House without the accompanying documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith and I then spoke to the Minister and pointed out to him that we thought it would be better if the document were not tabled. He asked if I had all the copies. I gave him back the two copies. Then he said: 'I will go and consult with the Prime Minister'. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is correct. I back him up. They were his words. He said: 'I will go and consult with the Prime Minister and come back and see you'. He was referring to me. He came back to me later and said: 'We have decided to table it anyhow'. I said: 'Fair enough'. We walked into the House at 11.10 p.m. and it was too late. That is an accurate description of the facts. The other inaccuracy in the Minister's statement occurred when he said that this is perhaps injurious to the Opposition's case. In fact it supports our case. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) recognises that rapid and uncontrolled export oriented resource development is creating major regional dislocations throughout Australia and in particular-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is contributing to the economic decline of regions traditionally dependent on diverse manufacturing industries, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) has led to a severe imbalance in the development of growing regions whereby public funds are channelled into the provision of physical infrastructure for projects of large corporations while community needs are neglected, and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on the Government to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) develop and implement policies for balanced development which take into account the different needs of each of Australia's regions;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) support regional authorities and assist them to create employment and enter into partnership arrangements with private enterprise to attract new economic activity to their regions, and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) promote planning of public investments and co-ordination of government services on a regional basis through the co-operation of Federal, State and local government. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion draws attention to the need for integrated policies for balanced national development which take account of the different needs of each of Australia's regions. It is the kind of motion that one would expect to be supported on both sides of the House. However, in respect of this Government it really is a motion of condemnation on two basic counts. For the first time in Australia's history we have a Federal Government that has no regional development policies. Federal funds for urban and regional development programs have been cut by 90 per cent under this Government. The small allocations in the 1981-82 Budget were made for the winding up of former programs. The growth centre program is now defunct. In April 1981 the Government terminated the Decentralisation Assistance Program and abolished the Decentralisation Advisory Board. At the same time that this Government has been dismantling former regional development programs it has been pursuing policies which are having a dislocating effect on the lives of many people and a disruptive effect on the viability of regional economies. This Government has failed to bring any co- ordination to the process of industrial restructuring that has been occurring over the past six years. </PARA>
<PARA> When this motion was placed on the Notice Paper the Government was in the business of talking up the expectation of a resource boom. Now it is attempting to talk down the prospect of economic growth, to dampen the legitimate expectations of the people for expansionary policies, relief from hardship, reduction of unemployment and decent social services in this country. We in the Opposition were always dubious about the Government's inflated expectations of a resource boom. We saw a large and rapid investment in a few sectors and in a few regions taking shape within an economy that was deliberately held stagnant to support those regions. We expressed concern about the structural impact of that investment in the context of the Government's over-tight monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is becoming clear that the expected boom in resource investment and the subsequent surge in resource exports will not occur at the high levels claimed previously by this Government, particularly at election time. A substantial number of projects have been cancelled, deferred or reduced in scale, and many more still remain in doubt. The fall-off in the expected level of investment and the current problems on Australia's trade balance illustrate one of the dangers we referred to at the time-the vulnerability of an economy heavily dependent on primary product exports and fluctuations in international demands. This points to the validity of Labor's proposed alternative development strategy which includes national co-ordination for the maintenance and strengthening of a viable and diversified manufacturing base. However, we should not now be misled into thinking there are no structural problems to be dealt with in relation to expanded resource sector investments. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard three tables showing expectations of actual capital expenditure in the private and public sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) saw the tables and agreed that leave should be given for their incorporation. The tradition of this House is that documents which are not unparliamentary can be incorporated. The honourable member knows that this is the case. The tables show that substantial investments have already been made. A large proportion of the recent increase in imports reflects this investment. Public funds have been locked into providing the physical infrastructure for the expected private investment. This has happened in every State. The honourable member knows the situation in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of this Government's policies, local and semi-government authorities have had to pay record interest rates. At present the rate is between 15.5 per cent and 15.7 per cent, and it will rise pretty soon to in excess of 16 per cent . Most of the money has been going into this sector and as a result the little people who want to buy a house have been forced out of the money market. That is really what has been happening under this Government. It has happened even though the resources boom has been cut off. We have not had the expansion that has been forecast particularly at election time by this Government. But the public sector has been locked into its commitment to provide infrastructure. As a result housing and other facets of urban living in this country have been placed in a disastrous position. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that there is rapid expansion in a few regions such as the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, Gladstone in Queensland and the north west region of Western Australia. At the same time States such as Tasmania and South Australia and provincial centres such as Ballarat, Geelong and Bendigo in Victoria are experiencing an agonising decline. My colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren), who will also speak in this debate, will talk about the personal problems that are in fact affecting a provincial area such as Ballarat. The expanding regions lack basic social amenities and services. There has not been proper planning to cope with the needs of the additional population for decent housing, health, education and welfare services. There has been no planning to diversify the economies of those regions to ensure employment opportunities for women and for youth. There has been no planning to prevent a drain of skilled tradesmen and professional workers out of established industrial and administrative sectors. There has been no planning to ensure a longer term viability of those regions. At the same time , there has been no planning to regenerate the declining regions. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's economic structure is undergoing far reaching changes as the post- war industrial development strategy of import replacement is being abandoned in favour of export expansion. Concentration of ownership in our agricultural and pastoral industries, increasing import penetration, technological changes and cut backs in public sector activities are combining to reduce employment growth and to erode the viability of some important established regions. Again, my colleague will deal particularly with the region of Ballarat in Victoria. We could also talk about other regions that are affected so badly. In the face of these challenges this Government is not prepared to do anything to prevent the fragmentation and alienation that results. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider some of the initiatives that could be taken to promote a more balanced national development, to strengthen the economies of the threatened regions and to diversify the economies of expanding regions. First, we need a Federal government that will work co-operatively with State, Territory and local governments. By that I mean that public servants in the national government should go out and co-operate with officers at a State and local government level . There needs to be a basis of trust between those three levels of government and an understanding with the private sector. From personal experience I know that public servants who were with the former Department of Urban and Regional Development went out and built up a basis of trust. This spirit of co-operation has to be developed. There has to be an understanding and faith between people working at the grass roots level if we are to develop these regions. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we need a national public inquiry into the problems and possibilities of established provincial cities and country towns. Thirdly, we need to establish a regional development task force to liaise with State and Territory authorities. The task force should investigate the forms of support that could be given to existing regional organisations and, where appropriate, to promote the growth of local and regional development boards. Such boards would need to work in close co-operation with local authorities, business, union and community groups. Regional development programs cannot work if the people in the region are not committed to the proposals and actively involved in shaping the proposals. The boards could undertake a number of initiatives such as research and feasibility studies. They could acquire and develop land for industrial and commercial uses. They could invest in new economic enterprises or operate businesses on their own account. We have to recognise that the problems which are not of local origin cannot be solved by local response alone. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for an integration of the policy initiatives of the Federal and State governments to build on the initiatives of the local people. In other words, there has to be co-operation, a spirit of working together, trust and understanding between the levels of government. We need a national plan for industrial regeneration which will provide our various regions with a vision for renewal. So a fourth initiative would be to change the charter of the Industries Assistance Commission to identify the kinds of industries we could establish in different locations and the kinds of support those industries would require to be established on a viable footing. If we had now the imagination and vision of the Coombs leadership on post-war reconstruction in Australia we would be in a healthier situation and more able to help people in regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to use our powers over foreign investment to achieve a higher degree of technological transfer, industrial research and development, and training programs suitable for decentralised locations. We need to promote downstream processing and fabrication of our natural resources in new locations. We need to support research and development of viable small and medium scale energy industries, such as solar power generation. We need to support the viable co- operative processing of farm produce. We need to encourage the production of crop fuels and to undertake projects to conserve the natural resources of water, soil and forests. We need to upgrade and expand community amenities and services which have an influence on decisions concerning the location of projects requiring investment, which are themselves employment generating and which improve social and cultural opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> A fifth initiative would be to encourage the decentralisation of Australian and State government services and employment to major rural cities. Of course, the Labor Government set up a committee to examine that. From its investigations it found that at least 18,000 too many Commonwealth public servants were located in the central business district of Melbourne. It was feasible for regional and provincial centres such as Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo to absorb some of the 18,000 Commonwealth public servants. That was a rational proposition. It still is a rational, sane proposition. It would give stimulus to those areas. My sixth point is that we need to encourage decentralisation to major rural cities where natural growth occurs. The Albury-Wodonga and Bathurst-Orange growth centres began to take shape under the Labor Government to 1972 to 1975. This could be applied to other areas. For instance, the Minister for Science and Technology ( Mr Thomson), who is sitting at the table, represents an area in northern Queensland. There should be a stimulus to areas such as Cairns and Townsville in Queensland; Geelong, Bendigo and Ballarat in Victoria; and Wagga, Dubbo or Coffs Harbour in New South Wales. These areas really need support. They have been neglected by this Government and no moves have been made towards planning the development of other centres. My seventh point is that we need to ensure that adequate social amenities and services are provided in selected areas of natural resource development. Negotiations should be held with the Northern Territory and the States to see that the costs of provision are fairly shared between the developers and the public authorities. As a guideline for those negotiations the view of the Federal Treasury, as expressed in its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, should be considered. The Treasury had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Industrial infrastructure in remote areas provided wholly by developers, where industrial infrastructure forms part of a State system, as is the case with much of the prospective investment in the aluminium industry, this should not prevent funding of the full cost by developers, through capital contributions, appropriate user charges or a combination of both. </PARA>
<PARA> Developers in remote areas should also contribute to the cost of social infrastructure to reflect the benefits they derive, the higher costs of providing facilities in such areas and the additional risks involved for government in doing so. Where significant expansions of existing social infrastructure are required, for example, at Gladstone and in the Hunter Valley, there are also strong grounds for requiring some capital contributions from developers. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude my remarks on this point: That statement by the Federal Treasury to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources indicates what it believes should be the developers' contribution. If one were to visit an area such as Gladstone one would see what is the social infrastructure of that city. It is a disgrace to this Parliament, the Queensland Government and local government authorities that people in that area have to live under such terrible conditions . What has occurred? The only Government that tried to do something about the social infrastructure was the Labor Government of 1972 to 1975. It included Gladstone in an area improvement program in order to try to improve the social conditions of people living in that area. The intention of the Government, under its new expansion program, is that most of the industries will be located at Boyne Island, which is south-east of Gladstone. The prevailing winds in that area come from the south-east. All the smog created by industry will flow across to where people live in Gladstone. It is sad that people are living under such appalling conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that if we are to defend and protect the interests of people the Australian Government, the State governments and local governments, together with business, must co-operate in the development of this nation. I am pleased that I have moved this motion. I hope that the Government takes some notice of the arguments that I have put forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion Mr Deputy Speaker. As a member from one of the regional areas, I understand the tremendous concern that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) has for this matter. It is interesting to note that the motion we are discussing today first appeared on the Notice Paper on 25 November 1980. That was a time when the nation was still giving some credibility to the claims of a number of Ministers opposite that Australia was on the verge of the greatest mineral boom since the middle of the nineteenth century. The whole thrust of economic theory at that stage was supposed to rest on the growth of unprecedented dimensions in mineral exports. According to this Government's propagandists, the structural changes that would be accelerated by the 'boom' would change the employment configuration but would create new and expanding employment opportunities-the millenium was just around the corner. It appears more like Armageddon than the millenium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many honourable members, particularly on this side of the House, are obviously somewhat more perceptive-either that or they are more concerned with honesty. We did not believe the Government's propaganda, which was either a cheap election exercise or the result of very bad advice. On either account, this Government was then and still is ill-equipped to govern this nation. The boom never eventuated and it was never likely to do so. Yet, there are still members of the Government who persist with the economic policies which they perceived to be appropriate at that time. To a large extent, they are absurdities. There is a certain degree of obscenity in them because they do not take into account the effects of those policies upon people who live in this country and who see their livelihoods disappearing. As I said, even at that time many honourable members, particularly on this side of the House, were extremely sceptical of the claims of the Government. We believed that not only would jobs not be created to compensate for those jobs that would be lost but also the livelihoods of many people would be destroyed. This was particularly applicable in those regions of Australia which have long standing diversified manufacturing industries. I represent one such region. The electorate of Ballarat embraces a number of centres that have a long history of reliance upon manufacturing industry, that have now been threatened by the cries of the free traders and the malaise of the Australian economy. The citizens of Ballarat, Maryborough, Kyneton and Daylesford take particular exception to the lack of concern that the Government has shown towards their plight. They are rapidly becoming aware that it is not only lack of concern but also a lack of competence that is causing it. </PARA>
<PARA> In each of these areas the local citizens have formed organisations to encourage the development of industry already existing in the towns or cities to provide the facilities through which industrial estates for new industries can be created, in order that new industries can be established in the area. In particular, I refer to Maryborough and Ballarat. Both of these centres are concerned to spend their own funds on imaginative schemes to attract new industry and new business to their areas. In particular, I refer to the efforts of the Ballarat Regional Employment Committee, the Ballarat Development Committee, the Ballarat Industrial Consortium and the Maryborough Development Board. I know these organisations well. I know their genuine concern. They will be aware of that fact. They know that we are carrying their message to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of these bodies is representative of a broad cross-section of interests in its centre. They are extremely dedicated to the task of ensuring that in these cities and the region generally the long-established lifestyle of the people living there will be maintained and enhanced. Yet while the Government conducts policies that result in uncertainty and hesitancy in industry, lower morale among all levels, and a continuing deterioration of the employment market, their efforts appear so often to be fruitless. It appals me to think that a region so rich in history, which has contributed so much to Australia, should be threatened by a government which just does not understand its needs.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from a number of contracts with Alcoa of Australia Ltd at Portland, Ballarat has not received the benefits of any growth purported to have occurred in the economy. In fact, the Government's cynical disregard for truth has left businessmen and employees anxious about their future. I am particularly concerned, as the member for Ballarat, because on a regional basis the area that I represent is seriously affected by the state of the economy. In 1976 the percentage of the Ballarat electorate work force engaged in manufacturing industry was 48.4. At the same time, that for Australia was 39.5. We do not have the figures from the latest census, but there is no doubt that the present comparison would be just as dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA> In August-September 1981, a reputable study of youth unemployment was undertaken in Ballarat by students of the Ballarat College of Advanced Education , replicating a study undertaken in Melbourne for the Victorian Employment Committee. The population studied was 780 households. The study identified 296 young people in the age group 15 to 24. Eighty-one of these-27.4 per cent-were unemployed. This figure is much higher than the national average. Under a wider definition of unemployment in that age group, which would include those who would like to work full time, or even part time, those who have returned to school because they have failed to find work, those undertaking industrial learning because they are unable to find work, and those who do not have regular paid jobs beyond five hours per week, the figure would come to 37.2 per cent of the 15 to 24-year-olds. As I said, that study was undertaken in August-September 1981. There are no grounds for believing that the situation is any better today.</PARA>
<PARA> The region of Ballarat encapsulates many of the problems of regions throughout Australia. To some degree it is a microcosm of those regions. So let us not pretend that we can ignore this reality. Let us not forget that this removes the immediate school leaver element, because we are talking about August-September. A similar study in Melbourne, the one on which this study was based, showed unemployment at 14.3 per cent in February to July 1980. Of course, it would be somewhat higher now. But it points out the fact that in a region such as Ballarat and, I would imagine, in many of the other regions, such as Bendigo and Geelong, the situation would be almost as critical. </PARA>
<PARA> An Industries Assistance Commission report, discussion paper No. 3, entitled ' Regional implications of economic change', identified the Central Highlands region as the second most dependent area upon protection for assistance for its manufacturing industry in Australia. The Central Highlands region was second only to Melbourne in the requirement for protection. This is something of which I am particularly conscious, and so are our people in Ballarat. I have not yet encountered any unrealistic businessmen in our region-that is, those who are Luddites or proto-Luddites in disposition, or who do not recognise that gradual change will take place. However, they do recognise that just as someone once said 'There is no such thing as a free lunch', there is also no such thing as free trade. </PARA>
<PARA> All major industrialised and trading nations have devices to ensure the maintenance of adequate standards of living for their people. We are being asked by some of our myopic free traders on the Government side to ignore that reality . I will not ignore that reality, and I will not see the people of Ballarat and similar regions having their livelihoods placed in jeopardy. All major industrialised nations attempt to maintain adequate standards of living for their people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will not be very long before there is a change in that direction, too. I ask only that the Government recognise this. A study commissioned for the Ballarat Regional Employment Committee, through its Ballarat Expands Today and Tomorrow Committee, undertaken by the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures and published in February 1981, identified the following major disadvantages for manufacturing industry in Ballarat. This is something of which the Government can take notice. They included the high charges for telephone calls, the high charges for freight, and distance factors such as access to service and some suppliers. I was impressed by the comment made by my colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) when he indicated that it would be desirable for some of the Commonwealth Government services to be decentralised. Another disadvantage identified was high fuel costs. These are in the areas of communication and transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We want regions of Australia which are currently suffering seriously in the country's economic malaise to be given priority for industrial development. Australia is one of the few countries of the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development which does not have a program for regional economic expansion. Such schemes are strongly supported by governments in Germany, France , the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada. Australia has never given more than token support to decentralisation programs. The Australian Labor Party believes in regional economic development for Australia. Such a program would greatly enhance industrial opportunities in provincial centres such as Ballarat and those areas that the honourable member for Reid has mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this motion I would like to pick out some of the phrases and words used by the mover, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), because I think they highlight the attitude of the Australian Labor Party towards resource development, also its attitude towards the benefits of development. The first part of the motion refers to rapid and uncontrolled export oriented resource development. Notwithstanding that notice of this motion was given on 25 November 1980, I would like in the time available to point out why some of the things expected have not occurred. In particular, I would like to refer to the coal industry and the effect of wage escalations, industrial disputes, strikes and port delays on that developing industry. I will come to that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion says that this uncontrolled export oriented resource development is creating major regional dislocations and that it is contributing to the economic decline of regions. All I can say to the honourable member for Reid and to the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren), who seconded the motion, is that it must be some time since they were in the regions where these major resource developments are taking place. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BJ7">Mr MacKENZIE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member refers to Bathurst-Orange but to my knowledge no major export oriented resource development is taking place in that region. Let us look at some of the new resource development in this country, largely as a result of the policies of this Government and despite the obstructive and delaying tactics of unions and people who are opposed to resource development. For example, what about the Northern Territory? Would the people there agree with the honourable member for Reid? Those people, including Aboriginal land holders, will benefit enormously from the uranium developments happening there. The town of Jabiru is a total new development in the Top End of the Northern Territory. It has had a tremendous spin-off for the city of Darwin as well. My friend the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who represents the Bowen Basin coal fields, represents one of the most exciting developing areas in Australia. It is experiencing massive increases in population and we see not only existing towns, such as Moranbah and Blackwater, getting bigger but also entirely new infrastructures-in fact, whole new towns and settlements-are being established at Middlemount, German Creek, Dysart and other places that I have visited. That has largely been done at the companies' expense. These towns are providing recreational services, health and hospital services and educational services, including the provision of school facilities. I wonder how this sort of motion would be accepted in the Bowen Basin coal fields of Queensland. Look at the north west of Western Australia, the Pilbara region, the areas associated with the North West Shelf development and the new towns of Karratha, Tom Price and Paraburdoo, as well as the massive developments at Port Hedland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion says that rapid resource development is contributing to the economic decline of the regions. How well would that be accepted in those areas? Perhaps the honourable member for Reid is referring to those areas where there is already major industry. He refers to manufacturing industry in his motion. I will very happily come back to the more populated areas where resource developments are taking place. I have one in my own electorate; namely, the area between Lithgow, Wallerawang and Portland. My friend representing the Hunter Valley, the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe), will support me when I say that there are some mammoth developments going on in the Hunter Valley, all to the long term advantage of the residents of that area. They may have some difficulties in the short term, and certainly I recognise those. Let us look at some of those difficulties. When we have a number of resource development projects proceeding rapidly we certainly get some pressure on infrastructure and we certainly get some pressure on wages. Existing businesses have difficulty retaining skilled tradesmen. They move off to the mines in droves, naturally enough; the wages are higher within the mining industry. That causes some temporary dislocation within the area. There is some competition for clerical staff. Local councils have difficulty providing the infrastructure expected. For example, I know that in my own area the Small Arms Factory in Lithgow has great difficulty holding many of its skilled tradesmen because they can go off and earn two or three times as much in the mines. But that is a short term phenomenon, an adjustment that has to be made. Nobody would say that because of that these developments should not take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable members to figures which I find staggering. The average spending capacity increase as a result of the coal mining industry in the Hunter Valley is about $7m; that is, the extra contribution in consumer spending capacity that has come to the valley. In 10 years' time that will move to about $180m. Some extra 9,000 people will be employed in the lower Hunter alone. Some 30 new mines will be developed. Each mine in Queensland costs about $500m. Perhaps the mines in the Hunter Valley will cost less than that, nevertheless the mines will provide tremendously increasing opportunities, particularly for young people. The average age of people employed directly in the coal mining industry is only 28.3 years. Where else in regional economies and in regional centres could young people get those sorts of opportunities?</PARA>
<PARA> I talked to a young man driving a continuous miner last year. He is 22 years of age and earning $700 a week. I do not deny him the right to earn $700 a week; he is working long hours under difficult conditions. I hope the industry can afford to pay that sort of money. Where else can young people have that sort of opportunity? During inspections at Paraburdoo by the Government's resources committee I talked to a couple of unemployed school teachers. They were girls who could not get jobs in Perth but who had the initiative to go up to the Pilbara mines. They asked why they could not drive the big dump trucks and eventually they were given a go. They are now employed as permanent staff, on $ 600 a week. What about the other wages that we see? They are flowing on. Even down the line, some clerical staff can be getting towards $20,000 for what is not much more than a typist's job. One of the problems of the resource industry is that these wage expectations are causing quite a lot of trouble in industrial disputation. My point is that all this benefit flows on to the regional communities. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recently seen in Singleton magnificent new housing estates. With due respect to my friend the honourable member for Paterson, there is no way in the world that Singleton would otherwise have been much more than a rural backwater for years and years to come. Now we see it as one of the most rapidly growing and developing centres, with Muswellbrook and associated towns, in Australia. There is a new civic centre. </PARA>

They have just about crippled the coal industry in that State. I might ask also what Mr Wran is doing in relation to his navy-the 50 or 60 ships off the ports of Newcastle and Port Kembla-Wran's Navy. I will tell the honourable member what the record of the New South Wales Government is. Last year the coal industry of that State managed to increase its coal exports by 1.3 per cent. In contrast, what did Queensland do? It increased its exports by a mere 39 per cent .</PARA></TALK.START>

The power station was started up with South African coal and the utility will no longer look at New South Wales coal. At the moment Japanese buyers are negotiating with New South Wales colliers and have said that they will accept from New South Wales no more in quantity than its industry can guarantee to ship. They are saying: 'We are not interested in what you say you can ship, or in your port capacity. We want to know what you can actually ship. We will accept only the figure for exports last year'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is being sabotaged by the people who stand to benefit most from the industry itself. I would like to mention also some of the benefits of this horrible, uncontrolled, export-oriented resource development causing, according to the honourable member for Reid, major regional dislocations and the economic decline of regions, as it relates to the area of Lithgow, Portland and Wallerawang. The multiplier effect on that area has already been seen. It may well be that in the next 10 years some 8,000 new jobs will be created in that area. That is nearly as many as are projected for the Hunter Valley. The multiplier effect can be conservatively estimated at 1 to 2 1/2 or 1 to 3. Already we have seen a tremendous demand for housing in Lithgow, where house prices have escalated rapidly. We have seen new shopping complexes and additions to the hospital. The Commonwealth Government, which the mover of the motion says has done nothing for the area, has provided special road grants for the development of some of the coal haulage roads. We have seen a bigger and bigger proportion of the Commonwealth tax sharing going to such cities as Lithgow and taking into account the additional pressures and needs that are being placed upon the coal industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us not overlook the contributions that are being made by industry itself, by the coal mine owners. They have to provide up-front payments which vary from $10m to $15m or $20m. Those up-front payments are not eligible for taxation deductibility because they are not devoted to capital development. The coal mine owners are required by the New South Wales Government to put up these sums in order to provide much of the infrastructure. Therefore, we see the coal companies producing much of that infrastructure-cultural and recreational facilities, new swimming pools and so on. Therefore, not only in Queensland are proprietors expected to provide such facilities; it happens in New South Wales also. I believe that if the motion were put before the coal miners of the Hunter Valley or those in my area of the western coal fields they would laugh it out of house and home. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This report covers 16 variations of the city plan and recommends the approval of works valued at $880,000. The Committee, in considering these proposed variations, took evidence from several individuals and community groups, as well as a member of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, during the public hearings held on 22 March 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has decided to withhold approval of two variations but has approved the remaining 14. In the 75th series of variations, the Committee withheld approval for residential development in Florey. It has decided to defer approval of the developments in Florey proposed in this series for the same reason as was advanced previously. Therefore, until the Committee receives adequate information about the new guidelines for the release of land in new residential subdivisions, and a statement setting out the responsibilities of private developers regarding servicing standards and marketing procedures, approval of the proposals is withheld. Further, the Committee believes that a decision on the cycle path at Bruce, variation 2 in the series, cannot be made without further information regarding the necessity for the removal and reconstruction of the cycle path. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always left to the Opposition to raise in this Parliament any matter relating to disarmament. On the last occasion on which this matter was raised, about 17 September of last year, it was again raised as a matter of public importance by the Opposition. There have since been demonstrations, public meetings and marches throughout the length and breadth of this nation, also the world, urging that governments take action to guarantee that there will be no nuclear war, and that existing nuclear weapons will be removed. In the process there has been agitation and a proper submission to governments that there should be a freeze of nuclear weapons. But when we have a look at what action has been taken by the Australian Government we can see that there has been no leadership on this matter at all. I invite honourable members to have a look at the number of Australians who have been actively and intelligently discussing this matter, not just from the point of view of Australia but also from the point of view of the survival of the world. But not one Government Minister has been involved. There has been no enunciation on what the Government wants done to save the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is just a complete blank on the basis that this matter has got nothing to do with this Government in Australia. Why is that so? It is because the Government is bereft of initiative and leadership at all levels. Apparently all it wants to do is sell uranium on the basis that we will get a few dollars for it. This Government could not care less what happens to the uranium; it hopes that everything will be all right. It is known that in the world at present as a result of uranium sales, perhaps ostensibly for peaceful and useful purposes, there has been a diversion into the production of nuclear weapons. The two super -powers, namely the Soviet Union and the United States have, between them, over 40,000 nuclear weapons. These two powers are not on very friendly terms. If either one decided to get involved in nuclear action it would destroy the world. We need only-I emphasise the word 'only'-about one tenth of the weapons which those powers have between them to guarantee that we will all be dead. The Speaker of the United States Congress, Congressman O'Neill, made the point that what we ought to be interested in is the path of life, not the path of catastrophe and annihilation. They are commendable words from a leader of the Democrats in the United States. Do we see that sort of statement made by this Government on this issue? Not at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened recently in the United States on a matter where we do have some influence. Let me make this point very clear. Statements which are made by the Australian Government should be taken notice of in the United States. I acknowledge that statements made by any political party representatives in Australia have no recognition in the Soviet Union. We have no influence there. Russia is just as guilty from the point of view of nuclear weapons and arms build-up as is anybody else. But we are talking about peace and what leadership in this field means. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be commendable if the leader of the Soviet Union said that he wanted a freeze on nuclear weapons and we entered into talks such as SALT-the strategic arms limitations talks-so as to guarantee that weapons are de-escalated, to use Kissinger's terms, or in our terms, removed altogether. But those sorts of talks are not taking place because the policy of the two super-powers has been that they have to get more weapons to deter each other from taking action. That is known as nuclear madness, because there is no guarantee that when the weapons are made somebody else in the heirarchy, whether it be the president of one nation or the other, will not decide to fire. We have no control over that sort of situation. But surely we have immense control from the point of view of what the people in Australia expect the leaders in this nation to say and do. For the leaders of this nation to say in forums right across Australia that they want a guarantee that all nuclear weapons will be removed would be an impressive stance . </PARA>
<PARA> The most impressive stance at the moment has been adopted by the Labor Party and other people in Australia talking about this matter. My colleagues and others have been involved in marches and have been urging that some sense of direction be introduced into international discussions on how to bring about the disarmament of nuclear weapons. I think that sort of action is tremendous, but from the point of view of what is happening about this matter, apart from rhetoric, this Government is completely silent. Nothing has been said over a period of years about what this Government should be urging on the Soviet Union and the United States, France and also other countries which have interests in nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make the point clear that it has been said that anyone who claims that the United States and the Soviet Union are merely building up weapons on the basis of a guarantee that there will be no war must either be working or involved in the manufacture of military products. Nobody with any common sense would say that there will be peace in or safety for the world because the super- powers are getting more weapons which will deter each other from taking action. That is not the way to bring about peace. If one looks at the budgets of both super-powers one can see the enormous amounts of their resources that are being diverted to the acquisition of nuclear weapons. In the United States, because of that diversion of resources and the fact that it is profitable to make weapons that destroy flesh and blood, there is a reaction, as one would expect in any sensible democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent weeks in the United States six States, 31 cities, 257 towns, 160 congressmen and 24 senators have publicly called for a freeze on the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Is that action not to be applauded? Would honourable members not have thought that some members of the Australian Government at any level would have said: 'This is what we should be about'. If people in the United States can call for that sort of intelligent action to be taken, surely something should be done at the Australian level to encourage support for that position. We must stop the United States policy that says: 'Arms transfer can serve as a very constructive instrument in foreign policy'. Arms transfer as a constructive instrument in foreign policy is disastrous, and we all know it. In which country has the transfer of arms, once they have been used, been demonstrated to have been a constructive policy? I ask honourable members to recall what happened in Eritrea where unfortunately Eritreans are now being bombarded with Soviet Union weapons. Let us look at the nonsense in Latin America and the dreadful slaughter of people by weapons which certainly appear to have been manufactured in the United States. Honourable members should have a look at the position in Afghanistan and the Soviet Union's interest in weapons. The Soviet Union is also selling weapons to the Palestine Liberation Organisation. In Israel the United States is selling billions of dollars worth of weapons. It is also selling billions of dollars worth of weapons to the Saudi Arabians. </PARA>
<PARA> Why can there not be leadership in this country whose Ministers say: 'There is a need for greater progress in the United States and in the Soviet Union for SALT negotiations. There is a need for the creation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. There is a need to develop the methods to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons among nations which currently do not have them, that is, to prevent horizontal proliferation. There is a need to study the relationship between disarmament and the developing needs of the poorer countries, and there is a need for the creation of regional arms control arrangments such as the Indian Ocean zone of peace'. </PARA>
<PARA> No body would dispute that sort of initiative and leadership. Do honourable members know that those propostions-a very worthy and great contribution-were made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) not in Australia but in a speech on disarmament to the United Nations in 1978. We on this side of the House fully support them, but nothing has happened since 1978 in support of any one of those five criteria. This Government has not passed any resolutions urging that something be done in this area. In fact the SALT negotiations have not commenced . In fact, as I have said, they have been deliberately delayed because of the present incredible policy of the United States to build up its arms before it has talks on removing the arms. I cannot imagine anything more limited from the point of view of an intelligent look at the world. The Prime Minister said that there is a need for the creation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. That has not happened. France is detonating many nuclear devices on Muroroa in the Pacific, but nothing is done by this Government. Why is France not being taken to the International Court of Justice-as we did and where it was convicted -on the basis that its actions could well be affecting the very lives of all the people and certainly the environment in the Pacific? Why could that not have been done?</PARA>
<PARA> What methods have been adopted to prevent a spread of nuclear weapons? We sell our uranium all over the world and give consent in advance to the reprocessing of the fuel. We are accepting somebody else's point of view. We sell uranium to Finland. It will be enriched and reprocessed in the Soviet Union. What gurantee have we that we can prevent diversion of that fuel? We sell uranium to France on the basis that it will be used for peaceful purposes. But not all French uranium is used for peaceful purposes. France is very active in the sale of armaments. It certainly is a destablising influence in the Pacific region, as I mentioned. Whilst we have 13 world treaties, we have no guarantee of what happens to our fuel. We just let it go. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the thrust of my argument. What leadership in a true democracy be saying. Would it not be talking about the needs of the world? Would it not be saying the very things that the Prime Minister said outside Australia in 1978- that is, that we ought to be talking about the Third World and the needs of the Third World? The World is spending $1m a minute on armaments. Let us consider the needs of the Third World. One fifth of the population of the Third World is illiterate, half is starving and one third is in need of medical attention. A fraction of the money spent on armaments could be diverted to helping the Third World. France is doing nothing about it. France ranks very well in world arms sales. I am not just picking it out; it is not often mentioned. France sold $3.1 billion worth of armaments during 1980. It is running third in the sale of armaments race. </PARA>
<PARA> There is great business for both the super-powers in the sale of arms. What are we to do about it? Surely we could say in this Parliament that we deplore it, that we are against it. If a tank costs $2m surely we can say that that amount of money could provide at least a couple of thousand classrooms for the Third World to meet the needs of, say, 50,000 children. We should look at a report which was published as recently as October last year which studied the relationship between disarmament and the problems of the world. Six per cent of the world's finite resources are being used each year for the making of armaments. The Third World accounted for 75 per cent of all imports of arms during the 1970s. Since 1945 Third World countries collectively have spent an average of $19 billion a year on arms. Incidentally, about a quarter of the Soviet Union's foreign exchange earnings come from arms sales. So we can be balanced in this issue. The conclusions of the report are quite staggering. Between 50 million and 100 million people are now employed in the provision of military goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> The world cannot last unless the leaders of countries, particularly democracies , realise the advantage of peace and, certainly, the horrors of war. The clear indication to our people is that if there were to be another war it would be a nuclear war. It would be a war of destruction of the whole of this universe. Surely when demonstrations and meetings are held and when Parliament holds debates on this issue resolutions can be made and active support can be given to the people who at present are marching throughout the length and breadth of the world urging governments to do something intelligent, to meet and discuss how nuclear weapons can be removed. I wait with bated breath for the Prime Minister to make one speech in Australia on his present views on immediate disarmament in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for this further opportunity to restate, for the benefit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the Parliament, the Government's well- established policy on the vital issue of world nuclear disarmament. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has put forward the proposition that the Government has failed to provide leadership and guidance to the Australian people on this vital issue. Such a proposition, as the Deputy Leader well knows, is absurd. The Australian Government has consistently drawn the dangers of the nuclear arms race to the attention of the people of Australia, the Parliament and the international community. It is equally absurd to suggest that the Government does not strongly support the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament and the negotiation of balanced and verifiable-I stress those two qualifications -measures of arms control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's policy on these crucial issues has been repeatedly and forcefully expressed in all multilateral negotiating and consultative bodies including the committee on disarmament. It is associated with the challenge that the continuing arms race presents to the international community. In June and July of this year this commitment will be futher advanced through Australia's active participation in New York in the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament. I hope to lead the Australian delegation to that important meeting. Notwithstanding the present unfavourable international political climate which adversely affects the negotiation of successful arms control measures, Australia intends to play an active role at the United Nations General Assembly's Special Session on Disarmament, UNSSOD II. UNSSOD II will provide an important opportunity to review progress since the previous United Nations Special Session was held in 1978, to impart fresh impetus to negotiations at present going on, to explore ways in which the present arms control agenda may produce results and , of course, to take stock of and reorder priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in preparing itself for this and other important meetings on this issue, has also actively sought to involve the community at large, particularly non-government organisations with an interest in disarmament issues , in the preparatory process leading up to such meetings. Equally importantly, the Government has also actively participated in and fostered debate on this issue in the Parliament. An important part of this process has been the opportunity provided for debate by the Government's strict adherence to its policy of tabling all nuclear safeguards agreements with customer countries for Australia's uranium. In addition-in contrast to allegations of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-this is the third time in the last six months that this issue has been debated in its own right in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The curbing of the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a primary plank in Australia's policy on disarmament. Australia strongly supports the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty-the NPT-as the corner stone of the international non- proliferation regime. The regime established by the NPT, which includes full scope safeguards administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency over all nuclear installations in non-nuclear weapon states which are parties to the NPT, provides assurances of the peaceful intent of nuclear activities. These assurances are essential to the establishment of the climate of confidence needed for successful co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Australia is concerned that some states are not parties to the NPT. Australia wants to see all states party to the NPT. It is a matter of great concern to Australia that some states may have developed or may be developing programs, including the construction of unsafeguarded facilities, for the development of nuclear devices. Such activities clearly jeopard ise regional and international security. Australia looks to the nuclear weapon states to help contain the spread of nuclear weapons. In this connection Australia sees the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty as a significant step towards setting further restraints on existing nuclear arsenals and barriers to the further spread of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion of a comprehensive test ban-CTB-would make the development of new nuclear weapons and the improvement of existing ones considerably more difficult. This would help strengthen the NPT and lead to the fuller implementaion of that treaty. A widely accepted CTB would act as a restraint on those states which have not accepted the NPT and would help to inhibit the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries. A universally accepted CTB would prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries. Australia is actively pursuing the goal of a comprehensive nuclear test ban. In this connection the Deputy Leader of the Opposition mentioned the French tests in the Pacific. As he would well know, we have constantly protested against these tests , most recently at the South Pacific Forum late last year. We have continued to make known our objections to them. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition mentioned taking this issue to the International Court of Justice. I have to inform him that some time ago France announced that it no longer accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ. The situation now is quite different from when the previous case was taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to refer briefly to the question of chemical weapons. The Australian Government also gives strong support to the early conclusion of a convention to ban these weapons. Existing international instruments on this subject, including the 1925 treaty and the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, do not of themselves completely ban chemical weapons. The need for a comprehensive and verifiable ban has become more pressing in the light of disturbing reports in recent years, and indeed in recent days, that chemical weapons have been used in certain parts of the world. Australia co-sponsored a UNGA resolution in 1980 which set up an impartial investigating team to examine the allegations of the use of chemical weapons in recent conflicts. Substantial progress on nuclear arms reduction and disarmament can take place only if a basis for confidence, trust and mutual respect exists. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, it is a matter of regret that the current international climate is not favourable to the successful negotiation of nuclear arms control agreements. The reason for this is the substantial build-up by the Soviet Union over the last decade of the whole range of its nuclear forces and the instability and anxiety it has created by such actions as its invasion of Afghanistan, its support of Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea and the unrelenting pressure applied by Moscow towards the imposition of martial law in Poland. The Australian Government and the countries of the Western alliance maintain that there is a direct relationship between nuclear arms control and disarmament efforts and the maintenance of international stability and security. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot accept the proposition inherent in Labor Party policy on this issue that different standards of behaviour can be applied to the actions of the East and the West. In a statement to Parliament on 24 March, I stressed that, either inadvertently or deliberately, there are always some people who, while they find it possible to remain silent in the face of huge military efforts on the part of the Soviet Union, raise the cry of war-mongering whenever the West shows any signs of matching that effort. The fact remains that, the United States has reduced or stabilised its military forces over the last decade , the Soviet response has been an unrelenting and threatening build-up in all theatres. Governments cannot be expected to hazard their security, and agreements to disarm have elements of risk in the absence of a basis for confidence and trust. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have suggested that progress towards nuclear disarmament could be achieved by an immediate freeze on the numbers of nuclear weapons held by the Soviet Union and the United States. If such a freeze were to be accepted by both super-powers as leading unambiguously to verifiable reductions of nuclear weapons to equal force levels, this would be a major achievement. However, given the bigger Soviet weapons programs and the huge disparity in the makeup of the arsenals of the two super-powers in favour of the Soviet Union, it is not clear that an across the board freeze in the terms which have been advocated would provide the essential enhancement of security which must underlie any such proposals. A major criticism of some of the freeze proposals that have been advanced is that a mutual freeze by the USA and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics would tend to perpetuate an unequal and therefore unstable military balance. Its effect could be to reward the USSR for a decade of unilateral buildup and to penalise the United States for its restraint in weapons development over the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> This House will be aware that negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on reducing medium range nuclear forces in Europe have been going on since November. On 18 November 1981 President Reagan made clear that the United States was prepared to agree to a zero option outcome. That is, the United States and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation would cancel the planned deployment of Pershing II and Cruise missiles in Western Europe if the Soviet Union would remove the SS4, SS5 and SS20 missiles at present targeted on Western Europe. This United States proposal is supported by the NATO allies and has been particularly emphasised by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. Since the negotiations commenced, the Soviet Union has indicated that its preference is to engage in a propaganda campaign rather than to embark on substantive negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> President Brezhnev's statement on 16 March at the opening of the Soviet Trade Union Congress is the latest example of the Soviet propaganda approach. Specifically, his reported offer to stop any further Soviet production of SS20 missiles would leave no fewer than 300 such missiles, each capable of carrying three nuclear warheads, targetable upon Europe. His suggestion that these weapons systems would be removed from the European section of Soviet territory has no meaning because the missiles could still reach western European targets and, in any case, the vehicles on which they are carried are mobile. In the Government's view, the Soviet Union should address seriously the zero option proposal of the NATO allies. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly stated, this Government's policy on nuclear disarmament is that, first, the nuclear weapons powers must take effective action to limit and reduce their nuclear arsenals. Secondly, there must be an end to nuclear testing in all environments. Thirdly, the international non-proliferation system must be strengthened. This Government is unequivocal in its support for the achievement of these aims. This will represent the cornerstone of Australia's approach at the forthcoming United Nations Special Session on Disarmament in New York in June this year. </PARA>

<PARA> 2. The hut which formed the base for his 1911-1913 Expedition, situated at Commonwealth Bay in Antarctica, is now dilapidated following many years of exposure to the harsh climatic conditions of the Antarctic continent.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The restoration and preservation of Mawson's hut in situ would not only provide a lasting memorial to Sir Douglas Mawson and his colleagues upon the continent where he devoted so much of his efforts, but also be a reminder to all of the significant contribution which Australia has made and is continuing to make towards the exploration and scientific investigation of Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Such restoration and preservation would add to the efforts already made by representatives of our sister-nation New Zealand, resulting in the restoration of other historic buildings in Antarctica. It would also provide a fitting means of celebrating the 70th anniversary of Mawson's epic sledge journey in which his two colleagues gave their lives.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will take such action as it may to ensure the restoration and preservation of the hut formerly occupied by the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 1911-1913 under the leadership of Sir Douglas Mawson.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide, together with authorities available under other legislation, borrowing authority needed to help ensure that calls on the Consolidated Revenue Fund do not exceed amounts legally available to the Fund. Honourable members will be aware that expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot validly exceed moneys ultimately available to the Fund. Thus , for many years, successive governments have introduced legislation for the purposes of funding defence expenditure out of the Loan Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> In my Budget Speech for 1981-82 I announced that the prospective overall Budget deficit for this year was estimated to be $146m. Since the Budget was brought down, the outlook has changed. On current information, total outlays are now estimated to be of the order of one and a half per cent above the Budget estimate. The increase has resulted from larger than expected wage and salary increases, funding for new Government initiatives and inescapable cost and price increases arising since the Budget was prepared. In addition, total receipts are now estimated to be about one per cent below the Budget estimate, largely as a result of shortfalls, caused by industrial disputes, in revenue from the crude oil excise and rejection in another place of the proposed sales tax legislation to broaden the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> The resulting increased Budget deficit has given rise to a possibility that calls on the Consolidated Revenue Fund might exceed moneys legally available to that Fund. Existing legislation permits certain expenditures to be funded either from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund. Funding from the Loan Fund to the maximum extent could, indeed, if there are no untoward developments, avoid the prospect of a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. However, it is not certain that the margin currently available would be sufficient to meet contingencies such as, for example, further industrial action having additional adverse implications on revenue flows and on the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The simplest and traditional means of providing appropriate legislative authority to meet such contingencies is a loan Bill of the type I am now presenting. The Bill includes a specific limit to the amount of any borrowings that may be undertaken. That limit is $300m, which amount the Government considers reasonable to meet contingencies of a kind noted above and which compares favourably with the provision in the Loan Act 1980 of $900m. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

This will involve a further appropriation of $3.7m.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill, which provides for the limited introduction of tuition fees in tertiary education institutions in the States and in the Northern Territory, was passed by the House of Representatives last year but rejected by the Senate. The Bill contains a provision for the Minister to make determinations as to the circumstances in which students should be charged tuition fees or be exempt from such charges. However, this provision is subject to a number of limitations specifically mentioned in the Bill. These include the following. First, students undertaking courses leading to first degree or diplomas cannot be charged fees. Second, the maximum fee is set at $1,000 per annum. Finally, students who have commenced courses before 1982 are to be exempt from fees charges for those courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides, as a condition of recurrent grants, that institutions charge tuition fees in accordance with these arrangements and that they do not charge tuition fees in other circumstances. The Bill provides for recurrent grants scheduled in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981 to be offset by an amount equivalent to the money from tuition fees which those institutions will be required to charge. As it will not now be possible to introduce tuition fees before the beginning of 1983 it is the Government's intention, when this Bill is enacted, to introduce an amending Bill which will provide for fees exemptions for courses commenced before the beginning of 1983 rather than 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> At no time has the Government advocated the restoration of tuition fees for first degree or first diploma qualifications, but it continues to be the Government's view that those who wish to further their studies beyond a reasonable range of basic qualifications should make a contribution towards the cost of tuition. There are substantial benefits which flow to individuals from higher education and the Government believes that the community as a whole should not be expected to meet all of the costs.

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend two Acts-the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1978 and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981. Amendments to the 1978 Act will finalise adjustments to grants for the 1979-1981 triennium and are in respect of increases in the salaries and wages component of recurrent grants. This will involve the provision of a further $53.7m for the recurrent programs of universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education institutions in the States and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the 1981 Act reflect the implementation to date of the Government 's decisions on the consolidation of colleges of advanced education. The Bill includes a transition provision to take account of certain name changes that have occurred as a result of consolidation of colleges of advanced education. On the understanding that consolidation is actively pursued during 1982, the Bill provides funds for 1982 for the Armidale College of Advanced Education, the Newcastle College of Advanced Education, the Milperra College of Advanced Education, State College of Victoria Hawthorn, State College of Victoria Institute of Early Childhood Development and State College of Victoria Melbourne . Funds are also provided to the Wollongong Institute of Education until the end of April when it will amalgamate with the University of Wollongong. I seek leave to incorporate in the Hansard the attached statement outlining the adjustments to the schedules of grants for 1982 for individual univerities and colleges of advanced education arising from these changes. </PARA>

<PARA>Outline of Adjustments to Schedules of Grants for 1982</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 1. The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981 provided funds in accordance with the Government's policy for the rationalisation of advanced education. By the end of 1981 acceptable arrangements had been received for 24 of the 30 colleges proposed for consolidation. Acceptable arrangements for consolidation are still required for:</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA> Milperra College of Advanced Education</PARA>
<PARA> Armidale College of Advanced Education</PARA>
<PARA> Newcastle College of Advanced Education</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria</PARA>
<PARA> SCV Hawthorn</PARA>
<PARA> SCV Institute of Early Childhood Development</PARA>
<PARA> SCV Melbourne</PARA>
<PARA> 2. On the basis that the consolidation of these institutions is actively pursued during 1982, certain adjustments have been made to the schedules of grants. These adjustments will ensure that the six remaining institutions are funded for 1982. There is no provision for their funding as individual institutions after 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The details of the adjustments to the schedules of grants for 1982 are set out below:</PARA>
<PARA> In the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1981, some funds for advanced education purposes were identified as national unallocated monies. This Bill provides funds from the national unallocated monies for 1982 for the following colleges and amounts as specified:</PARA>
<PARA> Milperra College of Advanced Education-$3.027m</PARA>
<PARA> SCV Hawthorn-$5.9m</PARA>
<PARA> SCV Institute of Early Childhood Development-$3.08m</PARA>
<PARA> SCV Melbourne-$14.195m</PARA>
<PARA> The funds provided for 1982 to the University of New England and the University of Newcastle included amounts for the programs conducted by the Armidale College of Advanced Education and the Newcastle College of Advanced Education. This Bill transfers funds from the scheduled 1982 grants for the University of New England and the University of Newcastle to the Armidale and Newcastle Colleges of Advanced Education respectively:</PARA>
<PARA> Armidale College of Advanced Education-$4.97m</PARA>
<PARA> Newcastle College of Advanced Education-$10.13m</PARA>
<PARA> Agreement has been reached that the Wollongong Institute of Education will merge with the University of Wollongong from May 1982. To take account of the situation until then, separate funding for the Institute of $1.333m is provided from the funds originally provided to the University. The Bill also provides for amounts of $200,000 and $129,000 to be transferred to the Western Australian Institute of Technology and the Victorian College of Pharmacy respectively. These transfers implement requests made by the States concerned and in the case of the Victorian College of Pharmacy are to meet costs of administering a Staffing Information Exchange and Staff Placement Service which has been established by the State Government on behalf of colleges of advanced education in Victoria.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a new and comprehensive legislative base for the export inspection and control responsibilities within my portfolio. Under existing arrangements, export inspection powers are drawn from the Customs Act 1901 and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905. This has created a number of administrative and legal weaknesses. Although these could be overcome by amending the existing legislation, the Government has taken the view that the most appropriate long term response is to develop new and separate export inspection legislation which ensures a more efficient and flexible legal framework. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the application of export controls to goods specified in regulations; spells out inspection responsibilities and the authority of inspection staff to carry out these responsibilities; and sets penalties to apply in the case of fraud or deliberate malpractice. Whilst the inspection powers under the Bill are to be exercised by officers of the Department of Primary Industry, the Bill also provides for the Secretary to the Department to authorise carriage of such powers as are appropriate by other people. This is to cover the situation where officers of other Commonwealth and State instrumentalities, and in certain instances people under contract, carry out specific or specialised inspection functions on behalf of the Department of Primary Industry. Powers provided include all those necessary to ensure compliance with the relevant conditions and restrictions. These include appropriate powers of entry and search; powers to detain vehicles, ships or aircraft for this purpose; and powers to seize products within the scope of the controls. </PARA>
<PARA> Side by side with these powers are a range of safeguards to avoid abuses by inspection staff. Entry into premises, other than registered premises, can take place only within the consent of the occupier, or in pursuance of a warrant issued by a Justice of the Peace, who must be convinced of the need for entry. A time limit is to be placed on the currency of warrants. Powers of search of vehicles, ships or aircraft are tied to a requirement that authorised officers produce their identity cards. Similarly, people are not required to assist authorised officers in their duties unless such proof of identity is produced. Provisions are also included imposing a limit on the time seized goods can be held unless proceedings are instituted and also for the release, as appropriate, of such goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Strict penalties are provided for breaches of the conditions of the Bill and associated regulations. Major penalties of $100,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both apply to the exportation of prescribed goods in contravention of specified requirements, for the use of false trade descriptions and for unlawful interference with, or forgery of, official marks. Where appropriate, however, it will be possible to proceed against such offences by summary jurisdiction with lesser maximum penalties of $5,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both. The maximum penalty of $100,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both is the same as that which was approved by Parliament in the 1981 Budget session following the meat substitution issue. Its inclusion in this Bill will ensure that such a penalty applies to all export inspection and control activities under my responsibility. In addition, this Bill widens the coverage of the penalty by making it an offence for false trade descriptions to be applied to documentation, and for registered establishments to have in their possession an official inspection stamp without authorisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also increases the size of the penalty for a range of other offences, such as failure to submit a notice of intention to export, the penalty for which is up from $40 to $2000 or 12 months imprisonment, or both; and failure to provide assistance to, or the obstruction of, inspection staff, the penalty for which is up from $100 to $1,000 or 6 months imprisonment, or both. In the 1981 Budget session a penalty of $100,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both was introduced for false and misleading statements in declarations furnished in respect of meat. This was to ensure that the maximum penalty applied to offences relating to matters such as the exporter, species, age and slaughter dates which were not covered by existing trade description provisions. These are, however, descriptive matters which are more appropriately located under the trade description requirements. The Bill broadens the definition of trade description to encompass such matters and, as mentioned previously, the application of a false trade description has been extended to documentation. Offences against these matters still, therefore, attract a penalty of $100,000 or 5 years imprisonment or both. The false declarations provision in the Bill will cover minor breaches only and the penalty has been set at a level appropriate to this offence. The penalty of $2,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both is the level of penalty generally established in Commonwealth legislation for offences of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two new penalty provisions in the Bill. First, there is a fine of up to $50,000 for breaches of licensing provisions, such as those that exist for woodchips. It will, however, be possible to proceed against such an offence by summary jurisdiction with a maximum penalty of $5,000. Second, there is a penalty of up to $2,000 or 12 months imprisonment or both for providing any authorised officer, including officers of the Department of Primary Industry, with goods prepared or treated at a registered establishment unless the person in whose name the establishment is registered has the written approval of the Secretary of my Department. The issue of authorised officers receiving produce either free or at prices below those available to the general public has been raised several times in evidence before the Royal Commission into the Meat Industry. It is a practice which I have decided must be stopped. Concurrent with the penalties set out in clause 24 of the Bill, which apply to those who offer cheap products, the full force of the provisions of the Public Service Act will apply to Commonwealth staff who accept such products. </PARA>
<PARA> This change in policy will be notified to all establishments and authorised officers. The only conditions under which the Secretary of my Department will approve establishments to sell produce to authorised officers is where they have a discrete and separate facility for selling to the public, where the price to those officers is the same as that available to the general public and where the transaction is backed by a receipt which describes the product, price and the purchase date. This approval will be tied to the annual re-registration process with which all establishments must comply and will be strictly enforced by the compliance unit now being established in the new export inspection service. This Bill is the first fundamental step in providing an appropriate legal basis for export inspection in the 1980s and will be backed by new regulations and a system of ministerial orders which will allow us to respond quickly to changing requirements and conditions. These regulations and orders are now being drafted. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Albury-Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1973. Honourable members will be aware of the assistance that has been provided by this and previous governments for the development of the Albury-Wodonga growth centre, and for some time past the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victoria have been reviewing the financial arrangements under which the growth centre was funded. Early in 1981 it was agreed between the three governments that the States would be relieved of their obligations to repay the loans and to pay interest on the loans provided by the Commonwealth. In lieu of repayments, it was agreed that the Commonwealth would have access to funds generated from development activities. The proposed amendments to this Act will enable the new agreement to be implemented. Special arrangements have already been negotiated with the States in relation to funds provided to them for on- passing to the Albury and Wodonga councils, and the arrangements relating to these funds are not included in the new agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Only some $1.2m was provided for Albury-Wodonga development under this Act. The bulk of the funds for Albury-Wodonga-some $117m-has been advanced under the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1974 which does not require amendment for the new financial arrangements to become effective. The new financial agreement with New South Wales and Victoria will be tabled in the Parliament when it has been executed by the three governments. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House may well judge this proposed legislation, the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill, on the basis that it is introduced by the most disastrous Minister in an increasingly disaster-prone government. With the unerring instinct of a homing missile, he zeros in on those features which have been fundamental to the successful operation of the conciliation and arbitration system and seeks to destroy them at a stroke of his pen. In their place he would erect provisions conceived for political purposes and palpably likely to create further divisions between worker and worker, union and union, unions and employers and, indeed, between employer and employer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill stands as a monument to the incompetence of the Fraser Government in the area of industrial relations. The Bill represents another fanciful scheme by the Government to manipulate industrial relations for the Government's own perceived political advantage. The Bill demonstrates the Government's complete lack of understanding of industrial relations and its inability to introduce sensible and constructive industrial reforms. The Bill has been presented to this Parliament by a man who is undoubtedly the worst Minister for Industrial Relations that this country has ever had. The main provisions of the Bill are a testimony to the abuse by the Government of the consultative processes of the National Labour Consultative Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the fact that Australia has now had the best part of seven years of Fraser Government industrial relations policies. The Government cannot talk about an industrial relations system which reflects the philosophy or the workings of the legislation of anyone but itself. They have been proved to be policies based on ignorance, policies that have produced confrontation between Government, employers and unions, and policies that challenge the traditional industrial dispute settling procedures of the Australian conciliation and arbitration system. We may well ask now, after this long period since the end of 1975: Where have these policies got us?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider some of the Fraser Government's main initiatives in the industrial relations area. We have had the establishment of the Industrial Relations Bureau, a body that has been trenchantly and virtually universally criticised and condemned-certainly by employers and unions alike. We have had the introduction of section 45D of the Trade Practices Act, a section which has demonstrated its potential to cause serious industrial dislocation and which is now largely unused. The Government's effort to make this section workable by the provision in 1979 of a conciliation procedure has been a dismal failure. Not one State government, Liberal or Labor, has introduced the required complementary legislation. The failure of any government to introduce such legislation speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> We go to the new laws relating to deregistration of unions and secret strike ballots. I ask the House to recall the flurry with which this legislation was introduced, respectively, in 1979 and 1981. Here we had parts of the panacea to improve industrial relations-it was said that it was necessary to bring them in- and neither piece of legislation has been used since its introduction in 1979 and 1981. We then go to the new laws relating to the deregistration of unions, which I have mentioned. We also go to the fact that the approach of the NLCC and the approach of the Government to consultation with employers and unions have been the subject of constant complaint by employers and unions. When we consider this point, it is important to remember that neither the Minister nor any other spokesman for the Government attempts to say that the criticisms in regard to lack of consultation spring only from the Australian Council of Trade Unions or the trade unions. The national employer organisations have been openly critical of the way in which this Government has sidestepped the intention and the intended practice of the NLCC. </PARA>
<PARA> In sum, looking at this track record of the legislation which has been introduced and the approach which has been adopted, we find that the Fraser Government, in its approach to industrial relations, has been nothing short of disastrous for this country. The preoccupation with confrontationist policies has led to a deterioration in industrial relations and has meant that opportunities to improve our industrial relations system through constructive reforms have been forgone. In those circumstances it is no wonder that there is disillusionment in the business community with the Government's performance. The loss of confidence reflects a growing awareness in that area that not merely are the policies of this Government not working but, worse than that, they are making the industrial relations scene in this country worse than it would otherwise be. This realisation by employers, unions and communities was elegantly expressed in an editorial in the Melbourne Age of 25 March of this year, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The state of Australia's industrial relations is serious enough to deserve a better approach and a far better Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The main matters in the Bill and the proposal which was abandoned just before the Bill's introduction testify to the Government's incompetence in industrial relations and to the extreme policies that it is pursuing. On the whole, the Government's proposals are ill-conceived, they are against the wishes of employers and unions and they are counter-productive. To be specific, the withdrawal of the power of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to award preference to union members is contrary to one of the basic and most long-standing principles of our conciliation and arbitration system. The attack on union membership will lead to untold industrial trouble. The stand -down proposal is unnecessary, unfair to employees, and is likely-indeed, I would say certain-to lead to more industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole scheme for the encouragement of industry unions is based on a definition of industry. However, there is no indication of what that amounts to in the Bill. In other words, the whole concept is based upon industry, and that apparently is to be left to the question of regulation. The now abandoned proposal with respect to enterprise unions was undoubtedly the most stupid and most widely criticised of the Fraser Government's industrial relations proposals . The business journal Rydges, in the April issue of this year, had this to say about the proposal:</PARA>
<PARA> A charitable interpretation of the enterprise union scheme would see it as some kind of election ploy, a gesture to indicate that the Government does see some role for itself in solving Australia's industrial relations problems. But if one adds it to the object failure of the Industrial Relations Bureau, the only conclusion possible is that Fraser is simply out of his depth in this area. The sooner the industrial relations portfolio is given to someone who, like Mr Tony Street, indicates an intellectual grasp of the difficulties and the limited possibilities for reform of this area, the better it will be for all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>I now look in more detail at some of the specific provisions in the legislation. I turn first to voluntary unionism and preference. A central feature of the Bill is the provisions relating to voluntary unionism, as it is called, and preference to unionists. The Bill withdraws the power of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to grant preference and provides an action for damages for a person who claims to have been discriminated against on the basis of non-membership of a union. These provisions clearly demonstrate that the Government is out of touch with industrial reality. One of the basic policies of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act since its introduction in 1904 has been the encouragement of union membership, mainly through providing for preference to unionist clauses to be inserted into awards in appropriate circumstances. This policy is based on an understanding of the industrial system and the recognition of the valuable role that unions play in the system, and of the importance of the existence of unions to the employers themselves. The policy of the Act and the criteria taken into account by the Commission in deciding whether to insert preference provisions into awards is encapsulated in section 47 (2) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. This provision, with slight additions, has been in the Act since its inception in 1904. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the House to examine closely and dispassionately what it is that this proposed legislation seeks to remove from the Act as it stands. I will refer to section 47 of the Act, particularly to section 47 (2), which is the section concerning the power of the Commission to grant preference to members of organisations. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to listen very closely to what you are being asked to eliminate from the legislation, because the very reading of this section shows the depth of the stupidity and the industrial unreality of what is being proposed by the Government. The Parliament is being asked to eliminate from the Act a provision which essentially has been in the legislation since 1904, when this Parliament first brought in legislation which has endured to this time. Sub-section (1) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission may, by an award, or by an order made on the application of an organization or person bound by an award, direct that preference shall, in relation to such matters, in such manner and subject to such conditions as are specified in the award or order, be given to such organizations or members of organizations as are specified in the award or order. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to look particularly at sub-section (2). It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Whenever, in the opinion of the Commission, it is necessary, for the prevention or settlement of an industrial dispute, for ensuring that effect will be given to the purposes and objectives of an award, for the maintenance of industrial peace or for the welfare of society to direct that preference shall be given to members of organizations as provided by the last preceding sub-section, the Commission shall so direct. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Parliament of this country and successive governments of different persuasions which have had infinitely more touch with the industrial realities of Australia have, for this period of nearly 80 years, said that it should be mandatory upon the Arbitration Commission to grant preference provisions in awards to achieve objectives seen by successive governments as likely to achieve those things which would be in the interests of the community. It has been regarded for nearly 80 years by governments of different political hues as an instrument to be used by the Commission, by the Tribunal, to achieve objectives on behalf of the community. I ask honourable members to think to themselves what those objectives are that have been identified over this period of 80 years as likely to be helped in their achievement by the Commission using this instrument of preference to unionists. I read those provisions again:</PARA>
<PARA> Whenever, in the opinion of the Commission, it is necessary, for the prevention or settlement of an industrial dispute-</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, successive governments over a period of 80 years have perceived that the use of this provision, of awarding a preference clause, may be useful- or necessary, as the legislation says-for the prevention or the settlement of an industrial dispute. That is the first category. The second category is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . for ensuring that effect will be given to the purposes and objectives of an award . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, for 80 years successive governments with people infinitely more attuned to the industrial realities of this country than this Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or his acolyte will ever be have said that this is a relevant and useful instrument for ensuring that effect will be given to the purposes and objectives of an award. I come to the third category. For 80 years successive governments of different political persuasions have seen it as a relevant instrument for doing what? For the maintenance of industrial peace. The fourth category in which successive governments of different political persuasions for 80 years have seen as a relevant instrument is the welfare of society. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the four categories of purposes which, I repeat, for the best part of 80 years successive governments, conservative and Labor, have put to the arbitral tribunal in saying: 'Here is an instrument which you shall use to achieve these laudable fundamental objectives'. So, what do we have? We have the obscenity of a Prime Minister who would be more remarkable than any other Prime Minister in the history of this country for using industrial relations for confrontation rather than bringing people together, who has had no experience of the reality of industrial relations in the cloistered upbringing and experience that he has had, and his acolyte, acknowledged as the most disastrous Minister ever to hold this portfolio, having the temerity, after that 80 years of experience in which successive governments, conservative and Labor have said to the tribunal that it shall use this instrument to achieve these laudable objectives-and it has worked-to say, with their abundance of experience and with the miserable nature of their purposes to pursue political objectives, that the Government will throw out the window all that accumulated experience during which this instrument has been used by the tribunal to achieve those basic objectives-the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, the ensuring that effect will be given to the purposes and objectives of awards, the maintenance of industrial peace and the welfare of society. All that 80 years of experience goes out the window at the behest of this Prime Minister and of this very transient Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner). </PARA>
<PARA> Let us see what has been said in the courts in respect of this so that we can abolish this proposition of equating the provisions for the granting of preference with some concept of compulsory unionism. The High Court has made it quite clear that that is not what these provisions are about. I refer briefly to what has been said in that respect by Mr Justice Menzies of the High Court, as he then was, in 1972, in the Altona Petroleum case. He addressed himself to whether this was a question of compulsory unionism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reading from the Australian Labor Law Reporter, CCH, paragraph 7547. I will check that reference but I think that is correct. Mr Justice Menzies said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding the claims as I do, I reject the contention that either separately or together they constitute not a claim for preference but a claim for monopoly of employment. </PARA>
<PARA>The High Court in the Altona Petroleum case confirmed the judgment of Mr Justice Dixon in the Wallis case. In respect of section 47, Mr Justice Menzies said that it is an exclusive code in relation to the issue of preference. The section is limited to the granting of preference and the section does not authorise the granting of compulsory unionism. Again in this matter we have a series of decisions by the High Court, and successive statements in judgments and decisions by the Arbitration Commission that it is acknowledged that what is being done here is not giving effect to a system of compulsory unionism but using an instrument that has been in place for 80 years to give effect to those basic purposes contained in section 47 sub-section (2), which this proposed legislation asks us to abolish. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of preference to unionists recognises the important role, in the conciliation and arbitration system, of unions in representing the interests of workers in that system. It recognises that the benefits of union action will flow through the award system to members and non-members alike. It recognises the view that those who benefit from the work of unions should contribute to the cost of that work. </PARA>
<PARA> On that point, let me say that all of the emphasis in the speeches of honourable members opposite has been about the rights of individuals not to join unions. Is there not such a thing as obligation? Has not the Australian community a view about people who take the benefits of the outlay and actions of others yet make no contribution thereto? Life is not just a matter of rights; life is a combination of rights and obligations. A person in the work place may stand aside and see his fellow workers put their hands in their pockets to pay their union dues. Out of the actions of the union wages go up or conditions improve. Can we intellectually satisfy ourselves that we have concluded our consideration of the situation by saying: 'That person has a right not to be associated with a union.'? Has he not an obligation? If he is associated with a union, in terms of having his or her hand out to take the wage increase or improvement in conditions of employment gained by it, is there not some obligation to be met by him?</PARA>
<PARA> This does not mean that we are arguing for compulsory unionism. What we are saying in the Labor Party, and in the ACTU, is not that we are in favour of compulsory unionism but rather that the question of union membership is a legitimate industrial issue. What do we say about a person who says 'No, I do not want anything to do with unions' but nevertheless lines up every time with his or her hand out and says 'Yes, I will have every wage increase; I will operate under every improved condition of employment that the trade union movement will get.'? Are we then to say that that person is not being hypocritical? Of course he or she is. Every time they accept a wage increase or improved condition of employment that the union membership has worked to obtain, they are indeed having something to do with that trade union. The only thing that they are not doing is facing up to their obligation to pay to be a member of the union. If such a person does not like the policies of the union he or she can democratically involve himself or herself in it. But let them not try to indulge in the luxury of saying that they are not going to have anything to do with trade unions when in fact, every day of their lives, they are by accepting the wages and conditions obtained for them by the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Our opposition to the Government's proposal signifies a rejection of the naive assumption that a long-standing and basic principle of our industrial system can be overturned by a new set of laws. It is especially naive when there is no significant support for them from employers, unions or the community. Our opposition also signifies that a more intelligent response to the competing factors relating to union membership is to leave the matter in the hands of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and, where necessary, to develop workable reforms through genuine consultation with employers and unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposals would overturn the traditional policy under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It would upset union membership arrangements entered into between employers and unions. Quite obviously, it would limit the ability of the Commission to settle demarcation disputes and, in the words of one employer spokesman, it would lead to untold industrial trouble. In the cause of good industrial relations the Government proposals under this head should be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> I come next to the stand-down provisions. The Bill seeks to extend to employers a direct right to stand down employees who take industrial action, or who cannot be usefully employed as a result of industrial action. The power that the Government proposes to give all employers is one which has previously been conferred only after an independent examination of all of the relevant circumstances has been made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Such an examination has safeguarded the interests of employees, while extending to employers in appropriate circumstances the power to stand down workers who cannot be usefully employed. That is a power to which the ACTU and the Labor Party do not object, but it is one which ought to be exercised within the ambit of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seeks to change this position in a way which is completely unfair to employees and which is likely to be creative of industrial disputes. There would be no hearing before an impartial tribunal prior to employees being stood down. Nor would any appeal be available to employees to challenge the merits of the employer's action. An employer will be able to stand down employees even when the relevant industrial action has been caused by him. For example, that could occur over a safety issue. In those circumstances the arbitrary, autonomous power is given to the employer to stand down workers although subsequent investigation may show that the action of the workers in withdrawing their labour, in their own safety interest, was totally justified. There is no requirement that an employer notify an employee before a stand-down declaration has the effect of disentitling him to wages. The arbitrary nature of the power given to employers will certainly lead to disputation and disaffection. </PARA>
<PARA> The employers' response to the Government's proposal on stand-downs is indicative of their lack of enthusiasm for the new measures and their recognition of its potential for creating industrial problems. The employers wanted an assurance that they could elect to use the existing stand-down powers- or to use the new powers-in a stand-down situation. That right of election has been spelled out in the Bill. It would be in the best interests of all concerned if the stand-down question were left in the hands of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. If employers consider that they need a general stand- down power, nothing would then prevent them from seeking such a power by making an application to the Commission. In the 1950s the metal industry employers made such an application and were successful in having a stand-down provision inserted in the metal industry award. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the question of industry unions. The Bill seeks to encourage industry -based unions by way of amendment of the registration and amalgamation provisions of the Act. Three comments may be made about the Government's proposal with respect to industry unions. Firstly, one basic flaw in the proposal is that it contains no indication of what constitutes an industry for the purpose of encouraging the formation of industry-based unions. This means that the proposal will remain inoperative until a satisfactory definition of ' industry' is devised. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the relaxing of the present unreasonable restrictions in the Act on union amalgamations, on the basis of facilitating amalgamations where they would result in an industry union, will do nothing to assist to reduce the number of unions in Australia. Very few unions will be able to take advantage of such a relaxation. Relaxing the requirements on this basis was rejected by the National Labour Consultative Council in April 1978 as unworkable. If the Government wishes to do something positive in the area of union amalgamations it should implement the NLCC report on amalgamations, as it promised to do before the 1980 elections. Thirdly, the practical effect of the amendments is likely to be to create the means for an increase in the number of unions in Australia rather than a reduction, as new unions seek registration in relation to small developing industries. This will further exacerbate the problems that result from having too many unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I come next to the de-registration provisions. The proposals in the Bill which deal with the consequences of the de-registration of a State-registered union have been considered for several years at meetings of Commonwealth and State Ministers for Labour. The practical problems raised in those meetings about the proposals have been been resolved. However, at the insistence of the Western Australian Government legislation concerning it is being introduced now. This legislation is not directed to any real or pressing industrial issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer briefly to certain other matters before moving the amendment that has been circulated in my name. The Bill inserts new provisions in the Act dealing with financial assistance. There are some problems with these provisions which suggest that they should be reconsidered by the NLCC. The only commendable aspect of the Bill is that which relates to an agreement, which has come out of the NLCC, concerning relatively minor matters dealing with casual vacancies and tenure of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this is bad legislation. It represents a continuation of the disastrous confrontationist policies of the Fraser Government. It does not enjoy the general support of employers or unions. It seeks to make significant changes to our tried and tested conciliation and arbitration system, even though there is no community support for such changes. It is sponsored by a Minister whose inept performance in his portfolio staggers even his critics. The timing of the introduction of the legislation clearly demonstrates that it was an election ploy related to Lowe and Victoria. The Government should have learned some lessons from the results of those elections. Those lessons are clear. They are that the Government should abandon the present industrial relations policies, withdraw the controversial parts of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill and dump the Minister responsible for the Bill. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted after full consultations in the National Labour Consultative Council directed to eliminating from the Bill those provisions clearly calculated to worsen industrial relations in this country'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I was listening to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) I thought, just for a fleeting moment, that for once we were going to get a considered contribution from him. But he soon ran out of substance and had to revert to the usual exhibition of histrionics and personal abuse which have become hallmarks of his contributions to debate in this chamber .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two pieces of legislation that we are debating in this chamber this afternoon, the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill and the Commonwealth Employees (Voluntary Membership of Unions) Bill, are further initiatives of the Fraser Government in dealing with the vexed problem of industrial relations. The impact of industrial relations issues has been demonstrated once again in recent months. The combination of increased industrial disruption, large wage increases and shorter working hours is having a detrimental effect. It is increasing overall labour costs and hence the cost of production in Australian industry. This has been the major domestic factor contributing to the fall off in the performance of the Australian economy and the slow down in employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in the industrial relations sphere within the community that selfishness seems to be most rampant. Demonstrable selfishness is evident to some degree among all parties involved in industrial disputation-employers, employees and union leaders. But it is most dramatically exemplified amongst the militant union leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> Trade unions developed from the need to protect the weak-the employees-from the strong-the employers-in times past when employees often were forced to work in intolerable conditions. But with the growth in numbers and growth in the power of the trade union movement since those early times, the exploited have become the exploiters, if not in the guise of individual employees then certainly in the guise of the union movement as a whole when its role has been abused by some of those militant leaders. Some of the militant leaders seem selfishly hell bent on formenting industrial disputes, often to confirm their own position in union power struggles or because ideologically they are committed to the destruction of our present social and economic system rather than in the pursuit of justifiable wage demands. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless there is a marked change in attitude it will be virtually impossible to prevent unions led by such people from continuing to set a price for their labour well above what the level of productivity in this country can afford. </PARA>
<PARA> Failure to achieve this required change in attitude will ensure that Australia' s economy fails to perform to its optimum. The result of that will be increasing unemployment and Australian industry becoming less competitive in the international economic environment. Of course, that in turn will cause overseas investors and traders to look increasingly askance at Australia as an investment or trading prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> The persistence of this selfish attitude has been demonstrated over the last 12 months or so by the wage grab of 4 per cent in real terms, that is over and above the level of inflation, for the 1980-81 financial year and a serious increase in disputation. Four million working days were lost through industrial disputes in the calendar year 1981, the largest part of that being in the December quarter when days lost through industrial disputation increased by 160 per cent compared with the figure for the December quarter 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the persistence of this unsatisfactory attitude on the part of union militants and, of course, the constitutional constraints on the Federal Government as far as its jurisdiction in industrial matters is concerned, the Fraser Government does have a credible record of performance in this area. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Constitution splits power over industrial relations matters between the Commonwealth and State governments. This has allowed jurisdictional fights and movement by unions between the Federal and State jurisdictions to obtain what the unions see as the best deal, and a multiplicity of unions and therefore the development of demarcation disputes and inter-union power struggles. The Federal Government's activity is also constrained by the absence of enforceable sanctions. The Government needs to rely, firstly, on persuasion and, secondly, on the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which can act only after a dispute exists and that dispute extends beyond the boundaries of one State. So, allowing for these constraints, and notwithstanding that wages hike and increased disputation which I mentioned for 1981, the overall record of the present Government over the last 6 1/2 years in achieving wage constraint and relative industrial peace deserves commendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is especially so when the record is compared with that of the previous Labor Government. In 1974, industrial disputes cost this country 6.3 million working days, and between March 1974 and March 1975 wages increased by 34.7 per cent as against the level of inflation of 17.6 per cent. There was a real increase in wages of nearly 17 per cent, which was way beyond what the economy could afford, and this destroyed business confidence, fuelled inflation and caused soaring unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also remember that that disastrous record was registered when the present honourable member for Wills was concurrently both President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and President of the Australian Labor Party, as a result of which the Labor Party claimed a special relationship with the trade union movement. It has a special relationship all right! Historically the Labor Party is the creature of the trade union movement and it is bound to do its bidding, to the detriment of the wider community. This is clearly demonstrated by the events in 1974 and 1975. The people of Australia should remember this in the light of present attempts by the Labor Party to resurrect its claim of having a special relationship with the trade union movement in order to gain electoral support. The present Government governs for the benefit of the whole of the population and its success in the industrial sphere is demonstrated by that stark comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> The passage of this legislation will further enhance that reputation. It will also allow the creation of an environment more favourable for the necessary change in attitude to which I referred earlier to occur. This legislation is a package relating to three major industrial relations matters and some minor ones . The legislation ensures, firstly that workers are not forced to join a union against their wishes by introducing provisions prohibiting the victimisation of or discrimination against a person who does not wish to belong to a union. The legislation also precludes the granting of preference to unionists. Secondly, the legislation gives employers the right automatically to stand down employees who have no work to perform because of strikes by other workers. This part of the legislation overrides any stand down provisions which may have been written into a particular award. An employer will be able to stand down an employee for any period, including part of a day. Thirdly, the legislation helps smooth the way for the establishment of industry-based unions. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hawke" NAMEID="YD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr Hawke</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is an industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with that. The legislation provides the legislative framework to facilitate the restructuring of unions into fewer industry-based organisations. Thus, through this legislation a start is being made on what will be a difficult and lengthy process leading to the development of industry-based unions in the expectation that this will allow for better communication between employers and employees and reduce the incidence of demarcation disputes. The legislation specifically does not define an industry for the purpose of establishing an industry based union because we are breaking new ground. Therefore, it is far more appropriate that this definition be left to later regulation as the climate for the establishment of industry unions develops and as they work out in practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The three main themes of the legislation are: The protection of the rights of the individual; the provision of a better balance in the powers, rights and duties of employers and employees; and the opening of the door to movement from within the work force so that present union rigidities and monopolies are loosened and structures are created which are more suited to a modern economy and representative negotiations between employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Voluntarism is basic to a liberal society. The notion of the closed shop, compulsion-even coercion-is anathema to a free society. In his remarks the honourable member for Wills talked about obligations as well as freedoms. That seems to be a new discovery for the Australian Labor Party to suddenly talk about obligations. Any obligation should be met voluntarily. It should not be required to be met by legislative decree. All people must be free to exercise their personal choice as to whether they wish to join an organisation, including an industrial organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills talked about encouragement being given to employees to join unions. Certainly, encouragement is one thing but coercion is quite another. In practice the preference to unionists, which he talked about as being removed from the legislation, has almost inevitably resulted in compulsion . The honourable member for Wills claimed that the fact that this legislation regarding preference to unionists has been in operation for 80 years gave it some justification. In fact, retaining this preference clause would exclude in practice those not wishing to join the union movement in general, or a particular union, from obtaining employment in a certain area of work. There are numerous examples over that 80-year period to which the honourable member for Wills referred of the abuse that has been given to the preference provided for union members. He claimed that the legislation has worked. It has not. That is one of the very reasons the Government is introducing a change through this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The stand-down provisions will assist businessmen to minimise the effects of victimisation by unionists in one section of the business, or even in another business, who go on strike, thereby frustrating the productive capacity of other employees, but whose wage costs continue. By standing down those employees the businessman to some extent will be able to protect the financial viability of his business during that period of industrial disruption. It will also more directly bring home to employees the cost to the community at large of industrial disruption. </PARA>
<PARA> The transformation of the union structure from a craft basis to an industry basis will, as I have already mentioned, be a long and slow process. But considerable advantages are to be derived from the more rational structure that will result from industry by industry negotiations, arbitration and fewer demarcation disputes. The sections of this legislation which facilitate the establishment of fewer industry based unions are very welcome. The legislation should provide an environment in which there is more opportunity for more effective direct communication between employers and employees. That is an essential ingredient for better industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Further initiatives are required for a more peaceful industrial relations climate to be assured in the future. Agreements reached by direct negotiation between employers and employees on an industry by industry basis must have enforceable sanctions applying to any party-employers or employees-breaking the agreement. Some of the recent large increases in pay and reduced working hours to some extent have been accepted by employers on the basis that the agreement reached would apply for 12 months; for example, in the case of the metal industry, or even longer-15 months-with regard to the building industry. During that time there is to be no application for further variations in the award and no action taken against individual employers on industrial matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Although a significant reduction in industrial disputes in these industries has occurred since the new agreements have been in operation, disputes have not been eliminated. Indeed, quite outside the spirit of this agreement the Builders Labourers Federation in the last fortnight imposed bans on companies involved in the deregistration proceedings against it. This clearly demonstrates that relying purely on the good will of parties to an agreement will not be sufficient to ensure the fulfilment of that agreement. Therefore, it is essential that substantial and effective sanctions be imposed on those breaking any agreement. The hope that these agreements give for a more stable industrial relations environment will not be fulfilled unless the penalties applying to those breaking the agreement are sufficient to deter such irresponsible action. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area needing attention concerns the concept of comparative wage justice . This is the concept that employees doing the same work for different employers or in different industries should receive the same wages and conditions irrespective of the capacity of that industry or employer to pay. The consequences of this concept are the flow-on and pace-setting effects. This fuels inflation and increases unemployment as employers shed labour in an effort to contain costs. Comparative wage justice had a major impact on the wages explosion of 1974-75, to which I have already referred, as unionists scrambled to restore relativities. There is a very real danger that a similar wages scramble will flow on from the recent generous settlements which have taken place in some sectors of the industry. The economy simply cannot afford this occurrence. Therefore, the concept of comparative wage justice must gradually disappear. </PARA>
<PARA> This is one area where the disciplines of the market must more effectively apply. Certainly, basic pay should be adequate. But beyond that, differences in industries, working conditions, location, demand for labour and, most importantly, profitability could be reflected in differences in remuneration from employer to employer. This is one way of ensuring that resources are devoted to the most productive sectors of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation which we are debating today provides a considerable step forward for industrial relations. As I have mentioned, there is provision for voluntary unionism. That, together with a provision for stand downs and especially for the establishment of industry unions, paves the way for a more rational approach towards industrial matters in the future. As I have indicated, further issues need attention. I have highlighted two of those-the need for effective sanctions to be placed on employers and employees and the gradual removal of the flow-on effect which is based on the concept of comparative wage justice. A more responsible approach will be achieved only from the marked change in attitude to which I referred at the outset. I note that the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) interjects to support that fact also. There must be greater recognition that employers and employees have a common interest in minimising industrial disputes and maximising productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation and the further initiatives which I have suggested provide the framework within which that changed attitude and unity of purpose can be established. If we fail to achieve a sensible and equitable reconciliation of conflicts of interests, which do arise from time to time, and thereby fail to establish the overriding pre-eminence of this unity of purpose in maximising the wealth creation potential of our human and physical resources, inevitably this country will fall further and further behind other countries in its capacity to fulfil the economic and other expectations of its citizens. Therefore, I strongly support this legislation and strongly oppose the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Wills which I find entirely unnecessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment. At best all the amendment could do would be to take the legislation away and, for the first time, endeavour to come to grips with the range of industrial relations problems that bedevil the community at this time. We have just heard 20 minutes of drivel. The honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) did not speak about industrial relations to which this legislation is directed but sought to lay the blame for the economic ills and the mismanagement of the government on the salary and wage earners of this country. This phoney piece of legislation is in fact another piece of huffing and puffing that will go on the industrial relations legislative scrapheap, largely unused, as did legislation relating to secondary boycotts and the Industrial Relations Bureau. What an absolute disaster. The Government is the architect of all this legislation. It is yet another piece of legislation developed by the Government on negative industrial relations policy. It is designed to become more and more tyrannical and oppressive to the organised trade union movement in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main thrust of the Government's policy is to undermine the traditional role of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; that is, the settlement of disputes that extend beyond the limits of State borders and to use its expertise developed over many years to act in the best interests of the parties to a dispute and of the public and industry generally. Despite the efforts of the Federal Government, there is no significant support amongst the employers, unions or in the community for a departure from the present tried and tested system of industrial relations. The legislation, which seeks to amend certain sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, is particularly vicious as it strikes at the very heart of good industrial relations, provokes confrontation and, as I have said before, destroys tried and tested principles. It also promotes the interests of industrial parasites and saboteurs. These amendments follow on from previous legislation of a penal nature-such as that dealing with the Industrial Relations Bureau and the Commonwealth Employees ( Employment Provisions) Act-and they complement the penal clauses of the various awards that provide fines for unions and fines and gaol sentences for workers who breach the award. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides an opportunity for deregistration of unions as a penalty, to the advantage of employers and their cronies. Although disputes will occur in relation to preference to unionists and award coverage for members of deregistered State unions, the Commission will be prevented by this legislation from dealing with them. It will hinder the process of settling disputes through the established disputes settling machinery in the interests of the parties and of the general community. There are several other problems with the provision to prevent the Commission from dealing with disputes involving members of deregistered unions. Deregistration has been shown to be an ineffective sanction and ultimately a self-defeating sanction for the industrial system concerned. Strengthening the sanction as proposed will only encourage unions to remain outside the industrial system with its controls and established dispute prevention and settlement procedures. If that is the case the result will be to provoke industrial disputes, not to endeavour to settle them. Employers will have the right to stand down employees without reference to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. That is a snide way of inflicting a no-pay situation on an employee at the whim of the employer. What a bludgeon that will be in the hands of an employer. Indiscriminate use of it would create absolutely intolerable situations. A declaration could be made and could be held by an employer to be used at his whim. What a devastating effect that would have on an endeavour to resolve an industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The deletion or repeal of preference clauses and the inclusion of the dubious principle of voluntary unionism will also create tremendous difficulties, without providing any link to the settlement procedures, to the proper authority to resolve such disputes. As I have already said, these amendments will protect the well-being of industrial bludgers, scabs and pimps and will provide the modus operandi for agents provocateurs to infiltrate unions and sabotage the organised trade union movement, in the interests of the Government and other reactionary vested interests in the community. I have spent a long time in the trade union movement. The individuals to whom the honourable member for Wills ( Mr Hawke) referred are prepared to take everything and contribute nothing. He rightly referred to them as the individuals who are basically protected by this legislation. They are the individuals, the pimps, who are on the periphery of this whole issue. People who have had any experience of the type of individual to whom I am referring-I am sure also honourable members in the chamber for this debate, some of whom have already left-despise these individuals as much as do other people in the industrial relations area. They have no time for people of that nature. They want to deal with organisations and their members who will contribute to the policy making and the determination of decisions along the way . The Government is seeking to take away the capacity to organise on that basis, to ensure that when people are negotiating issues of an industrial relations nature they talk to all of the people concerned, not just a saboteur who for all sorts of reasons may be there to undermine the negotiations. Enactment of that part of the legislation will be a retrograde step. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me to be spelt out clearly and unequivocally that the arbitration system whereby the gains made by unions and financed by union members flow to members and non-members alike has to be accepted. There is a recognition by many workers that, for them to be effectively represented and protected, all eligible workers should be members of the relevant union. The validity of the conciliation and arbitration system rests on the collective representation of workers through their unions and the preference of employers to deal with an organisation representing the industrial interests of its employees rather than to deal directly with the individual employees. The potential of questions relating to union membership to cause serious and prolonged industrial disputation has been a fact of life ever since I can remember. The arguments that ensue about people not facing up to their responsibilities are ongoing and can be cleared up only by everybody accepting his responsibility in the matter. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) will deal with some of our erstwhile sleazy lawyers in the chamber who, ever since I can remember, have contributed to a union because it has been compulsory to do so. We wonder whether they will be able to escape their obligations to the Law Institute of Victoria or its equivalent in other States. I know my colleague will deal with that aspect very effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject of industry unions has been spelt out clearly and unequivocally by the Donovan Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers Associations in Britain. Surely industrial conditions there compare with those in this country. The Donovan Commission in Britain, where union structures are similar to those in Australia, took a similar view to that expressed by us. The Government, in adopting the procedures and systems that exist in Japan, West Germany and elsewhere which are not relevant to the situation in Australia, is proceeding along the wrong lines. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, recently our friend at the table, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), in his old inimitable style, the previous Minister who held the portfolio and the Government in general double crossed a tripartite conference. At that time they guaranteed to take forward a decision. As the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has explained, they gave an assurance that amendments would be proceeded with, with the support of the employers and the unions, to amend the legislation to ensure that amalgamations could be streamlined, enabling positive steps to be taken, with the co-operation of the unions and the employers, to reduce the number of unions involved. The only way to proceed from that starting point is to ensure that any developments endeavour to improve industrial relations. Participation by those groups should not be restricted to industrial relations matters; there should be consultation on day to day problems. As the honourable member for Wills has spelt out time and again , if discussions on the economy could take place it would be fruitful and would assist in solving the problems that bedevil the Australian community at the present time. The Government has suddenly woken up. A Government announcement has been made by our erstwhile friend at the table. He wants the Australian Council of Trade Unions to produce a paper on the nation. Government members are pretty slow learners. I was a member of a parliamentary committee which inquired into specific learning difficulties. I reckon that the Minister would probably be a case history. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Industrial Relations have just realised that tripartite discussions should take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the Donovan Royal Commission in Britain. Many workers such as craftsmen, clerks and technicians have an obvious interest in combining on an occupational rather than industrial basis, so that they are free to take their transferable skills from job to job while remaining in the same union. In many respects it is an impractical proposition to endeavour to change a situation such as that. It is almost impossible to have craft organisations contained within an industry unless proper guidelines are worked out. There would be more problems than anyone could possibly imagine if we endeavoured to impose industry unions on organisations of craft members whose skills were far and above those of process workers. How do we reach a situation in which we can come to grips with a range of problems by eliminating the representation of those organisations?</PARA>
<PARA> The real decisive objection to industrial unionism for the Donovan Commission was the drastic upheaval in the structure of British unions that would be involved in a move towards industry unions. For this reason the Commission concluded that there should not be a move toward the attainment of industry unionism, as it exists in the Federal Republic of Germany, and that the problems caused by a multiplicity of unions could be considerably eased by encouraging, firstly, mergers between unions; secondly, agreements between unions on matters such as recruiting and negotiation rights; and thirdly, inter-union co- operation on the shop floor. That is what the tripartite meeting indicated. When the matter was referred to the Minister he came up with this conglomeration of rubbish that will resolve absolutely nothing. In fact, the legislation highlights the incompetence of the Minister, who has the inglorious reputation of being the dunce of the most incompetent front bench in the history of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to say. Under those circumstances it is ridiculous to pursue this legislation as it now stands. Of course, the only answer to it is the suggestion of the honourable member for Wills, who proposed that the legislation ought to be taken away, redrafted and referred to the tripartite group that was once dealing with such matters in an endeavour to come here with a composite proposition that would really work in the interests of industrial relations in this country. The legislation is obviously an endeavour to camouflage the incompetence of the Government by blaming wage and salary earners for the Government's failure to solve our economic ills. To say the least, it is an amateurish attempt. The implications of the legislation have never been thought through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A general summation of this issue is that, despite the efforts of the Federal Government, there is no significant support amongst employers, or unions or in the community for a departure from the present tried and tested system of industrial relations. It is poppycock to talk about a system that is simply not going to work. All the aspects of deregistration of unions have been tried. The stand-down clause is there. By any democratic principle, one would have thought that an employer would be forced to go to an independent tribunal, establish his case as he has had to do in the past and then have a stand-down clause inserted in the award if that were necessary. But no, we are not going to do that. We are going to use the back of the axe. We are going to force unions to take a certain course of action and then use that situation to create an atmosphere such as that deliberately created in the Lowe by-election and the Victorian state election. The idea is that the unions will become so incensed that they will stand up and take the Government on. </PARA>
<PARA> One remarkable feature about the anti-union legislation introduced by the Fraser Government is that the legislation, as I have indicated, has had little or no effect. In some ways this is because the legislation has been so extreme or foreign to the accepted ways of conducting industrial relations in Australia that it has found little support from or use by employers and the community. For example, the Industrial Relations Bureau has been condemned by employers and unions alike. Our friend the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who as Minister for Industrial Relations played some part in it, also condemned it for what it was worth. It is the greatest white elephant that ever existed. Under other circumstances the members of the Bureau would be pinched for loitering. They have nothing to do. They provide no useful service in the community and ought to be got rid of. The resources being devoted to them should be channelled into developing more workable industrial relations. So much for the Industrial Relations Bureau! The secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act are largely unused and the harsh deregistration laws and the new provisions relating to secret strike ballots have not been used either. All the huffing and puffing means absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The future of industrial relations in this country is at the crossroads. We are going to have some pearls of wisdom poured into our ears by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), who lives in the lap of luxury.

It is very good to see that the Government is at least attempting by this legislation to overcome some of the problems that exist. I want to take this opportunity to talk about some general issues which I believe relate fairly directly to the legislation which is now before the House. I refer to the situation that exists now in Tasmania. As a Tasmanian I have witnessed in recent years the great harm that has been caused to our economy, to business and to individuals as a direct result of senseless and selfish industrial disputes. I refer in particular to the numerous disputes that have affected the waterfront, which is a vital link between Tasmania and the mainland. Those disputes and disruptions have caused great harm to many businesses in Tasmania, especially on the north-west coast, which is the part of that State I represent. The disputes have cost many jobs, especially the jobs of young people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One would be entitled to believe that some sections of the union movement are out to drag Tasmania down to its knees. Why do not these people wake up and realise that the economy of Tasmania is fragile and cannot stand the sort of pounding which has been received in recent times from strikes brought on by selfish unions? I acknowledge that sometimes these strikes, disputes and stoppages are aggravated by stubborn employers who are not prepared to agree to some reasonable understanding with the unions involved. As I have said, strikes and stoppages are taking a very heavy toll and are costing jobs within the community. Unless these unions, and particularly the officials involved, do something about the situation, understand the harm they are causing and begin to realise that their actions are costing jobs within the community, I do not know where we will finish up. </PARA>
<PARA> We recently had a maritime strike on the north-west coast of Tasmania at a cost to local firms of between $1.5m and $2m. That is money that will never be recovered. This strike is causing job insecurity and job loss in many factories, farms and other businesses in the area. Honourable members may have heard about the strike at the Savage River Mines which is now in its fourth week. With the downward trend in world iron ore prices this strike is placing that enterprise, which employs some 500 people, in real jeopardy. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QK5">Mr GROOM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The employees are seeking a shorter working week and additional money. The problem is that these sorts of disputes so often affect the battler. They affect the ordinary working man. They often affect the person who has been put on most recently. They certainly also adversely affect the prospects of young school leavers of obtaining jobs. So I say to these officials, especially officials who belong to the radical part of the union movement, that it is about time they woke up to themselves. Why do they not get around the community and find out what the community feels about them and the sort of tactics they are adopting at the present time?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not profess to be an expert in this area, as some of my colleagues certainly are. However, I believe there is an obligation on all of us to take an interest in and to try to understand this subject and to assist in finding the answers, if that is at all possible. As I have mentioned, there is no doubt that the union movement has acquired a bad reputation in the mind of the average citizen. This is borne out by all the surveys that have been conducted into that issue. It is important to note that frustration and irritation at unnecessary and pointless industrial disputes is not felt only by employers and people outside the union movement but also particularly by people within the union movement, by ordinary rank and file members of unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Employees become justifiably upset and annoyed especially when powerful small groups within a larger work force adopt the strike weapon as their first option rather than seeking to negotiate a fair result in a sensible and proper manner. It is obvious that many Australian union officials-although I acknowledge that they are probably a minority-are power hungry and use industrial disputation and conflict to advance their own selfish causes, which are sometimes, unfortunately , political causes. They often take the action to feather their own nests in some way or other. Publicity recently was given to evidence put to royal commissions. It is obvious from some of that evidence that certain union officials are doing very nicely indeed out of the system. Many workers see this happening. They have a fair idea of what is going on but they go along with it and they do nothing to stop it because they do not want to be seen as rebels or perhaps do not care very much anyway. This is probably the same sort of apathy that we see in all kinds of organisations-even the apathy we see as far as local councils and even some governments is concerned. But even if individual union members do not want to use the opportunities available to them to influence management I am pleased that at least the Government is making every effort to provide the democratic control of industrial organisations to which their members are entitled. I mention briefly secret ballots, which are proving very effective in many areas and also the opportunity for union members to obtain information about the financial affairs of their unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suggest that all of the blame for the present level of industrial disruption within the community rests solely with those who control unions. Indeed, much of the responsibility falls directly on the shoulders of Australian management. Many managers are, unfortunately, ill equipped to deal effectively with a dispute situation or to handle an industrial relations problem so as to avoid conflict developing in the first place. The skill, ability and understanding of present day middle management-and these are the people who often must deal eyeball to eyeball with union officials and employee representatives on the shop floor-is probably less than it was 20 or 30 years ago. With the growth in the size of government and the professions and the nature of education, the efficient manager of those days is today a university graduate, a school teacher, a public servant or a member of one of the professions. In the United States, Japan and Germany the profession of management is highly regarded and is well rewarded. But in Australia, by contrast, managers have been given a much lower status in the community and their real career earnings are much less than in the professions. This has resulted, regrettably, in a lower quality of management in this country. Top management-I am speaking of people right at the top of companies and organisations within Australia-has tended to leave industrial relations to the so-called industrial relations experts within organisations. Top management has tended to deal more with financial matters, with things like fund raising, project development and so on rather than with this vital area of personal relations. I think that is a bad thing. Those who are trying to negotiate a solution often do not have sufficient authority within their organisation to make decisions or to offer satisfactory solutions or proposals without frequent reference to the more senior people within their organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The kind of legislation we are now debating helps to create an improved overall framework of increased protection for individuals but it does not, of course, of itself create a better industrial climate or good industrial relations. Like many others in this chamber, I am certainly convinced that industrial relations cannot be really improved by legislation itself. It depends almost totally on effective communication between employer and employee in the work place. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill supports the principle of voluntary unionism and the restructuring of unions away from a craft and occupational basis. It also provides to employers the right to stand down employees who cannot be employed usefully as a result of industrial action. The principle of freedom to choose whether or not one wants to join a union has been Liberal Party policy for many years. I am pleased to see that this step is being taken along the road to greater freedom for employees. Whether, in practice, it works effectively and does very much to improve industrial relations is yet to be seen. I know there are some who will say that these measures will threaten the more responsible and moderate unions, and will aid and abet an increase in the membership and power of the more militant unions. But the main point that must be stressed-it is an important principle-is that this legislation provides a choice without applying pressure. Hopefully, responsible people will make responsible choices. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) emphasised the fact that the provisions contained in the Act have been in place for some 80 years. This legislation was first created in 1904. That seems to me to be a classic conservative argument. The honourable member for Wills is saying that because it has been in place for that length of time it is a good thing. I think community feelings and aspirations have changed since 1904. There are many people in the community who do not particularly want to join a union. Why should they not have that choice. There is no doubt that many people who are now members of unions will want to remain members of those unions. They have that choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity to mention a local issue, a matter that has arisen in my own electorate. I think it is relevant to this legislation . It concerns the certificates that are issued to conscientious objectors under section 144A of the Act. I raise this issue with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) for his consideration. I refer to the case of a log truck driver who is self-employed. He was told by the Transport Workers Union that he had to be a member of that union. He did not particularly want to be a member of that union.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QK5">Mr GROOM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was self-employed. He had a genuine conscientious objection on religious grounds. I was satisfied with his objections after being given the relevant information. He also approached the registrar in Tasmania. Clearly the registrar was satisfied that he had a genuine conscientious objection. This person applied for a certificate under section 144A of the Act but his application was rejected. The registrar said that that particular section applied only to employees, that under the legislation only employees can obtain a certificate. The registrar indicated that although this person was a conscientious objector he could not give him a certificate. I think this is a matter which has to be looked at. Quite often the grievance of an employer conscientious objector is just as great as the grievance of an employee conscientious objector. Perhaps the Minister will consider broadening section 144A and other provisions that relate to conscientious objection. Perhaps also he will give consideration to whether the provisions of the Bill before the House might be extended to provide protection for self-employed people or employers who may be employing one or two people and who have been told by some union or other than they have to join that particular union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation also contains proposals to establish, in the long term, industrial-based unions. Clearly-the Minister made this point in his second reading speech-there certainly will not be a sudden transformation of the union movement into industry-based organisations as a direct result of this legislation, but it is a step in the right direction. It is an important step. I believe there is widespread community support for the idea that we should have industry-based unions. I know that some people think that this kind of move could lead to more undemocratic left wing union takeovers and weaken the position of the moderates. That kind of concern has to be considered in the proper context. We need to have a more rational system than exists at present. No one could sensibly argue that what we have at the moment is satisfactory. There is little merit in suggesting that the status quo should be retained. Also , the nature of the more militant unions should change under the influence of others. Rank and file members of a union may join an industry-based union because they will have now increased opportunities to participate actively within their organisations in a democratic manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian union structure was created in the late nineteenth century when industry was largely comprised of many small enterprises. It has changed very much since then. Most people are now employed by large companies or by governments. For example, employment in half the manufacturing industry is accounted for by 200 large firms, with the other half spread over about 30,000 smaller firms. In Japan there are 70,000 unions organised on the basis of one union for each enterprise. In Germany there are only 16 unions, based on membership within a total industry. In Australia, half the unionised work foce belongs to 16 large unions and the other half belong to 280 smaller unions. This creates all kinds of pressures for the unions themselves and also for management . A large scale enterprise often will deal with 10 or more unions at its major operating plants. Some may represent only a few employees but may have great strategic power. They use that power and force a hard bargain. Sometimes they close enterprises. This leads to demarcation disputes and destructive fights between unions. There is great common sense in broadening the base and having industry-based unions. A union is more likely then to recognise that the prosperity of the industry is vital to the prosperity of the union membership and is vital even to the livelihood of union officals. This kind of development in the long term, I believe, should lead to improved co-operation and also to improved productivity. That can benefit those who are employed and also benefit those who are not employed because it will provide a few more jobs within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not see this legislation as confrontationist, as was suggested by the honourable member for Wills. I suppose that this is a matter of philosophy. The honourable member for Wills will always attack any measure that is put forward by this Government. I am convinced that most people in the community support the sort of legislation that the Government is advancing and support the sort of legislation that the Minister has brought forward over a long period. Legislation such as this helps to improve the industrial climate that we have in this country. It is a vital issue and steps must be taken in this field. I believe that this legislation should facilitate a more reasonable and a more constructive approach to industrial relations in this country. Therefore, it deserves the full support of this House. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us get down to this philosophic exercise. That is what we are told it is. I suppose that any government is entitled to enact legislation which it regards as fundamental to its philosophy. However, when dealing with the tendentious issues of industrial relations and the complexities of the operations of our laws dealing with conciliation and arbitration, philosophy alone is not enough to justify critical changes in existing legislation and practice. It is not enough because these changes do not take place in the cloistered atmsphere of a philosophic tutorial at a university. They take place within the framework of an on-going society. They take place against the background of an economy which is in a downturn. They take place as we are confronted with double digit inflation, the highest number of unemployed in our history and the highest interest rates to confront home purchasers and the commercial sector-all this has occurred as a result of this Government's economic philosophy. They take place in a situation in which the average wage and salary earner is battling on a daily basis to maintain his standard of living and in which he is caught up continually in attempts to obtain an increase in his living wage in order to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> I get heartily sick and tired of the situation when honourable members opposite , when dealing with increases in salaries for judges, senior public servants and , indeed, members of Parliament, take as the criterion of movement the general cost of living. It is good enough for the fat cats in our society, but there is something that some honourable members opposite regard as essentially indecent--</PARA>

Not one of them will be saying, 'I think that you are giving me too much money. It ought to be paid on the basis of productivity.' If it were paid on that basis, they would starve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we get in this Government's approach is yet again an exercise in the double standards that permeate continually and flow through the House when honourable members on the Government side talk about the living standards of the average Australian worker and the average Australian trade unionist. The average trade unionist has as much right to his slice of the economic pie as has any other sector of the community. Let us look at the way in which the average worker has been able to improve his living conditions in the history of this nation's development. No one in the House, of whatever view, and no matter how reactionary the attitude of honourable members opposite is, can doubt that the undeniable and indisputable fact in Australian economic development is that the existing living standards of the average worker were not given to him on a plate . They came about as a result of long years of very hard struggle, organised through the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade union movement is part of our whole conciliation and arbitration process. That movement fought long and hard to achieve those conditions. It has cost average unionists million of dollars to produce the legal fabric of entitlements, whether in workers' compensation legislation and its interpretation, long service leave legislation or the basis on which people work under awards. Within the framework of the conciliation and arbitration system there are provisions, which are seldom used, concerning the rights of conscientious objectors. </PARA>
<PARA> If this government were concerned to reduce the level of industrial confrontation in our society, if it were concerned to make our arbitration processes really work, and if it were concerned to listen to the views of not merely the trade union movement but organised employers-there are many organised employer groups which have a much more sophisticated view of how one approaches and solves the problem of industrial relations than we are likely to find within the ranks of this Government-this House could listen with some sympathy and comprehension to amendments that come before it as a result of the processes available to the Government through its capacity to confer with, to consult and to receive the advice of both the organised employer groups and the organised trade union movement in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with just the issue of voluntary unionism. Where in the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations, where in the speeches of the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman) and the honourable member for Braddon, do we see a single reference to the effect: 'Because we have been requested by responsible employer organisations to deal with the question of voluntary unionism, we feel compelled to give their views and to provide an opportunity for reaction to their proposals. That is why we have introduced this legislation'?</PARA>
<PARA> That would not be an unreasonable proposition, but where is it? Does the Minister say, does the honourable member for Braddon say, does the honourable member for Kingston say-indeed, does any spokesman on that side of the House say -that any single responsible employer group in Australia with any experience at all in industrial relations has asked this Government to produce legislation in this form? Of course, one is greeted with silence because honourable members opposite know that when this matter was raised at the most senior level of industrial advice available to the Minister-employers and unions were equally represented on this occasion-and when these proposals were thrown on the table as a result of the philosophy of the Government the employers sat mute and slightly horrified. The employers knew, as the trade union movement knew-as any experienced industrial advocate knows-that this legislation was yet another formula for industrial disaster and industrial confrontation. That is what it will produce. The average Australian wants a lessening in the level of confrontation. No Australian, and no Australian unionist, would not prefer to maintain his standard of living or to negotiate for improved living conditions through an orderly process of conciliation and arbitration rather than by the drag down, knock-out situations which often arise just because of the general way in which our society operates. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why, when we ask ourselves the reasons for this legislation, when we ask ourselves what its purpose is, what groups it is supposed to benefit and who asked for it, that we are greeted with silence and told it is a matter of philosophy. In my view, that is no basis for introducing such legislation. The honourable member for Braddon is entitled to his philosophy, I do not object to that. However, I object to his hypocrisy. We have looked at the question of preference to unionists and unions as contained in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It has been there since 1904. My colleague the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) referred to section 47 of the Act, which is the basis upon which that preference provision can be written into an award, and he pointed out quite properly that it is only exercised by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when it is necessary to prevent an industrial dispute, to secure industrial peace, to secure the effectiveness of an award or to secure the welfare of society. It has been in place since 1904.</PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the Minister or any spokesman on the Government side to indicate a single occasion since 1904 when that provision has been wrongfully used or misused by the Commission. The Government is not taking the power away from the trade union movement; the legislative amendment is designed to take the power away from the Commission. Can it be said that this is an excessive power? Can it be argued that this is a power which has been used wantonly, without justification, by the Commission; that the Commission, when exercising the power , was thoroughly misconceived in regard to its application? We are told in an article in the Australian Trade Union by Mr M. Wright, entitled 'Union Preferences and Closed Shops', that these provisions are not included in all Federal awards. Wright has estimated that only 279 out of some 800 Federal awards contain preference provisions. So, there is no record of wrong use or of excessive use and there is no record of any request from a responsible employer organisation saying that, since it was introduced in 1904, it is time that we changed this provision. What does it come down to? It is a matter of philosophy.</PARA>

<PARA> Non-union members do have rights. No one will argue with that.

I have yet to meet the widow of a non-union member, whose husband has died on the job, who says: ' Look, I do not want to pursue my workers compensation claim because that right was gained as a result of exercises by the trade union movement, by the expenditure of millions of dollars in every workers compensation tribunal in the land and before every appellate court including the Privy Council'. I have yet to meet the non-unionist who says: 'Look, because of my attitude towards trade unions, although I recognise that they won in my industry long service leave entitlements I will not take them'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time in Australian society that we examined the basis of our industrial legal system. We need to understand that the conciliation and arbitration process rests on two principles, that is, that there will be organised employer groups and there will be organised worker groups. The process of conciliation and arbitration can work and can survive only as long as Australian workers are members of unions and those unions are registered under the Act. When one strikes at the fabric of that concept one strikes at the whole process of conciliation and arbitration itself and exposes this community to potentially great industrial turbulence. That is what this legislation is designed to do. It is false and it is hypocritical. It will be rejected by the trade union movement and it is being rejected by responsible employer organisations. If this Government had any sense of decency and honour it would withdraw this legislation now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address attention to something that has not received much attention so far in this debate. I refer to the subject of industry-based unions. We are talking about a variety of complex issues. This is one that I believe to be exceedingly important to the future of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before coming to that question I wish to make one or two points by way of introduction. It is sometimes suggested on the other side that no one on this side has any sympathy whatsoever for trade unions, that no one here has had any direct experience with the trade union movement. For my part, I have always had the view-it is one that I have expressed and propose to express again-that trade unions are a part of the fabric of this country; that they have contributed greatly to the lives of their members and that they will remain a part of the fabric of this country. I add that I have been fortunate enough, as a lawyer-I realise that the very existence of lawyers in these halls arouses in the breasts of some a great feeling of animosity-to act for three of the five largest trade unions in this country. I refer to the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, which is I believe the nation's second largest union, to the Australian Workers Union, which is the oldest union in this country, and to the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. My political views were well known at the time. Indeed, very recently-I have been to court precisely three times since I entered this House-I was asked by the Federated Clerks Union if I would appear for it. I said I would and went back before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in a case in which the union was seeking an award in a particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that I was fortunate enough to meet Mr Dolan, who, on one occasion when he was Vice President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, instructed me in a case on behalf of the Electrical Trades Union of Australia. It was a small, technical case, but all of this adds to one's knowledge, so I regard myself as very fortunate to have had firsthand experience of working with trade union leaders and coming to understand some of the considerable pressures under which they operate, the very great difficulties that they have to encounter- difficulties which in no small measure are contributed to by the very complex system of laws that we have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That having been said, one must acknowledge that one of the problems we face in Australia is the existing structure of the trade union movement. This is no one' s fault. It just happens to be the way in which trade unions have grown over a long period. I believe that view is common to both the Government and the Opposition that industry-based unions would be an improvement-some would say a vast improvement-on what we have at present. Stripped of all political rhetoric, the real differences between the Government and the Opposition on the subject of industry-based unions would appear to be twofold. The first concerns the level of real commitment to the concept of industry-based unions. The second concerns how best to go about putting such unions on the industrial map of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the constitution of the ACTU, which sets out its objectives, one sees that one of those objectives is the socialisation of industry. If one then turns to the methods by which this is to be achieved-this is important because it illustrates the very way in which the ACTU approaches the subject of industry-based unions-one finds that they include:</PARA>
<PARA> The closer organisation of the workers by:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The development of the trade union movement towards an industrial basis</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Amalgamation of unions where practicable to establish one union in each industry or sector. </PARA>
<PARA>The ills of the present system are well known. They were set out by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) in a paper that he delivered recently to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. I have read the paper and much that he said I agree with, although there are points on which we have obvious disagreement. At page 19 of the paper, from which I propose to quote because it describes the present situation, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> Although we also have a smattering of general and industry-based unions, our unions are essentially based on trade or craft divisions. This usually means that more than one union will be functioning in an industry or a company and that a single union will often encompass a number of firms or industries. This has been a constant source of inter-union conflict in the form of demarcation disputes (about which union membership will perform certain work) and jurisdictional wrangles over coverage of workers in a firm or industry. Such needless examples of disputation have often occurred in critical areas of the economy-the most notable recent examples being the dispute between the Builders' Labourers' Federation and the Federated Ironworkers' Association over work carried out on important construction sites, and the membership wrangle between the WWF and other unions operating on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same address, with reference to the legislative proposal-which had not been put in concrete form-foreshadowing industry-based unions, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The encouragement of industrial unions is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed legislation would also mean that amalgamation proposals which do not lead directly to industry-based unions would still be subject to the restrictive provisions currently operating. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an unacceptable approach, since other forms of general union amalgamation may be just as conducive to greater rationality in the industrial structure and improved industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA>What the honourable member did not do was elaborate on what he had in mind. He gave us no clue as to what means were to be adopted, as to how other forms of general amalgamation of existing unions could be just a conducive to a more rational industrial structure. I might suggest two reasons as an explanation of this somewhat uncharacteristic silence on the part of the honourable member. In the first place I ask: What is the real level of commitment of the Opposition to industry-based unions? In this area the Opposition runs headlong into certain facts of political life. The Australian Labor Party, as the only Australian political party that is affiliated with unions, is, by the very fact of that affiliation, limited as to the political action that it can take in matters which affect unions. The ACTU consitution speaks of amalgamations, where practicable, to establish industry unions. It says nothing of establishing industry-based unions by means other than amalgamation. Certainly, it says nothing of employing means that may affect the structure and powers of existing unions. I do not say that in any critical sense but that is simply the position under the constitution of the ACTU as it stands. </PARA>
<PARA> One can understand that, from the Opposition's point of view, actions that might disturb existing unions and the distribution of power within the union movement and the Australian Labor Party could well involve high political risks for members of the party who espoused such actions. Thus, there is first a political reason to be somewhat disinclined to take action that will change the structure of the union movement, for the purpose of achieving a different basis. Secondly, and perhaps more fundamentally, there is the question of the existing structure. As the honourable member must know, amalgamations under the existing structure can only achieve larger unions. They cannot result in any greater rationality of that industrial structure. This, as I say, results from the actual structure of the unions. Let us look at that structure and in particular two areas of it. Let us consider first the number of trade unions and the distribution of membership between them. Let us consider secondly the industry or job coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> We have in Australia-I am quoting the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for December 1980-316 reporting unions with 2,943,900 members. Of that number 14 unions each with 50,000 or more members accounted for 44.2 per cent of total membership; 41 unions with 21,000 or more members accounted for 75.6 per cent of total membership. At the bottom end of the scale, 36 unions with 100 or fewer members accounted for a minuscule 0.1 per cent of total membership. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the industry coverage, that is, the coverage which each union has and in which it can operate? I refer here specifically to federally registered unions. As is known, in the infancy of the union movement what happened was that men and women got together to form a union, and it was usually formed to protect a particular calling, to protect fairly narrowly defined industrial interests. For example, I think the Australian Workers Union was originally formed to protect the rights of shearers and to advance their industrial interests. But with the passage of time, improved communications, a heightened sense of national identity, growth and diversification in traditional industries, the formation of entirely new industries and the proliferation of new technologies, so unions themselves grew and changed. Frequently, a union which was formed to protect clearly defined interests, such as the interests of shearers, would over the years find its industrial coverage greatly enlarged so as to include members in varied, separate and disparate industries scattered throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This can be well illustrated by looking at the constitutional industrial coverage for two unions-the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, the largest union in this country, and the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australia, which has a de facto living together arrangement with the AMWSU. Both of those unions, I understand, intend at some stage in the future to amalgamate. Let me cite the industry coverage of one of those unions, the AMWSU. I summarise what is said in Huntley's excellent book Inside Australia 's Top 100 Unions. The AMWSU itself came out of a number of amalgamations. It has members in all types of engineering, including the steel industry, ship building and repair, rolling stock manufacture, structural steel, the lift industry, air conditioning and ventilation, cannister making, rail and road transport, plastics, space tracking, mining, aircraft and National Roads and Motorists Association road maintenance mechanics. It has members in every industry where there are machines. If one looks at the industrial coverage of the FEDFA, which emerged out of the mining actvities in the late nineteenth century, one finds just as varied a situation. It covers boiler/firemen, various classes of stationary engine drivers including refrigeration, steam and turbine engine drivers, all classes of crane drivers, all classes of earthmoving equipment drivers, oil refinery operatives, locomotive engine drivers in private industry and drivers of heavy equipment in open-cut coal mines and those in other mining activities. </PARA>
<PARA> An amalgamation between those two unions could produce only one thing-a larger union. Could it be seriously suggested that an amalgamation between those two unions would, to use the words of the honourable member for Wills, produce greater rationality in the industrial structure and improve industrial relations ? The answer is that it could not. It could not because of the structural problems that the unions face. And certainly if one looks at the history of the AMWSU over the last few years one would find no reason for thinking that it, as a product of amalgamations, is a union whose structure is conducive to greater industrial peace, and it is industrial peace that we are here concerned with. </PARA>
<PARA> The easy amalgamation of unions-and that is a constant theme of the Opposition- would be more likely to compound existing problems by producing larger unions with even more diverse coverage and make it more difficult in the future to rationalise the structure of Australian trade unions. To use an analogy, if you have a box in which you have an apple and a pear and you add an orange, a cauliflower and a cabbage, you do not get a different fruit; you have a box which has more fruit and vegetables in it. That is a problem with easier amalgamations or with amalgamations which do not take into consideration structural change. </PARA>
<PARA> How then are we to produce a system of industry-based unions? I think there are only two ways. How, for example, can we get an industry-based union for the waterfront industry or the automobile industry? The question of the definition of industry-this has been raised by the honourable member for Wills-is of course sensibly left to regulation because of the complexity of defining the industries or group of industries for the purposes of identification as a single industry such as the waterfront industry or the automobile industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There are really only two ways, as I have said, to produce a system of industry -based unions. The first is by the means proposed in the Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Let me say that at best it will be a slow road . There cannot be any doubt about that. But it does provide a means, which employees can resort to or ignore as they wish, for the formation of industry- based unions. The other means of forming industry-based unions is to use the kind of mechanism which is to be found in section 142A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Broadly stated, that section permits the Commission, if it thinks it is in the public interest to do so, to give a union a right of exclusive representation of employees-exclusive, I emphasise, from the rights of other organisations. As presently framed, section 142A is too narrow to be used to facilitate the formation of industry-based unions. But amendments could be made to it to introduce into the Commission power to form, from existing unions, industry-based unions. It is obvious that such a power would need to be exercised with the greatest of care. It is also obvious that in the exercise of such a power adjustments in a wide range of matters between the unions affected would need to be made, including of course membership and industry coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not underestimate the difficulties that would face the Commission if it were to have the sort of power that I have described-a power which should, of course, be exercisable in the public interest and in the interests of employees; a power to create industry-based unions out of existing unions. But to place that power in the Commission would have the benefit of providing a means for the creation of industry-based unions under the supervision of an independent and impartial body. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me emphasise that no one is to blame for the present state of affairs. But at some stage we have to move towards a restructuring of unions in Australia. It is perfectly ludicrous that we should have the number of unions that we have with the disparity in size, in coverage and in membership-such as a union with 160,000 members as compared with a number of unions with fewer than 100 members. I do not think anyone in this House disputes that statement but unless we start to make a move towards a restructuring of unions-towards greater rationality, towards forming unions to cover an entire industry, which would work against demarcation disputes and probably put an end to them, which would make industry negotiations very much simpler-we are simply postponing for later generations, for later parliaments, the whole problem of the restructuring of the Australian union movement. That is a subject in which we all have a common interest. It is in the common interest of us all to improve the union structure and by that means to put in place a better basis for industrial relations and reduced industrial conflict. We will never have a perfect world but we need to move towards something better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Four honourable members opposite preceded me in this debate. Three of them are lawyers. It is indeed a great honour for me, having a humble working class background, to follow such erudite gentlemen who were not only born to rule but also trained to rule us. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), who introduced the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill, is a barrister. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) is a lawyer. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), who preceded me, is a barrister also. They all belong to a fraternity, a union, a very closed shop-a law institute-which achieved tremendous pay for them. They receive $1,000 a day- not a month or a week but a day. Not only is their pay good but also their conditions are excellent. They ought to know something about unionism. They do not have to dirty their hands. They start work at 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock in the morning and have a two-hour lunch break, with an excellent imported Rhine riesling or Bordeaux red.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Wait until I tell my mates in the factories or on the railways where I used to work how these eminent and learned colleagues of mine wish to tell them, the Australian workers, how to conduct their affairs! When they hear that they will be so honoured and awestruck that they will all resign from their union branches , ask the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to deregister their unions, and send deputations to their bosses to request that they be stood down! I am sure they would do that but for their natural suspicion that the erudite gentlemen opposite are telling them what to do, not in the interest of workers and employees, not in the public interest or the interest of employers, but for some ulterior motive which I will explain in a minute. By now it will be obvious to everybody that whenever this Government is in trouble it resorts to union bashing to divert the attention of the people from its inability to manage the country's economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us serves exactly such a purpose. Of course, whenever the present Minister for Industrial Relations is in trouble-that is more the rule than the exception; he has been in so much trouble lately that we do not know whether he will still be the Minister in a week to two-he comes up with some amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. This Act has been amended over 70 times. This is the sixteenth amendment which has been introduced since this Government has been in office. The number of times that the Fraser Government has amended the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, without succeeding in reducing industrial disputation, proves to us the futility of the Government' s attempts to interfere with the legitimate and traditional practice of conciliation and arbitration. Let us not forget that the real aim of the Fraser Government is to provoke industrial disputes so that it can blame the unions for the economic chaos caused by its policies. The Bill before us is no exception. It is not designed to reduce industrial disputation but to create industrial chaos. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is divided into four sections: Firstly, voluntary unionism; secondly, the stand down of employees; thirdly, the creation of industry unions; and, fourthly, deregistration. There are a couple of minor window dressing amendments dealing with the terms of office of union officials, casual vacancies and financial assistance. Except for these minor items the four major parts of the Bill have the effect of reducing the power of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, of taking matters out of its hands and of introducing anarchy and confrontation into industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I wish to deal with so-called voluntary unionism. The removal of the power of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to award preference is a clear departure from historical encouragement of orderly unionism. Everybody who has had any experience in industrial relations knows well that a modern industrial society cannot exist without the trade unions. Putting this in simple terms, so that even the Minister for Industrial Relations can understand it, if there were no trade unions-no employee organisations-there would be no one with whom the employers could negotiate. The Commission knows, the employers know and the workers know that without trade unions our economic system would not be able to function. The workers and their organisations are as much a part of the capitalist system as are the employers. The smashing of trade unions will not necessarily increase the profits of employers as the simple-minded members opposite presume. On the contrary, it will lead to industrial anarchy and will inflict great losses on employers and employees alike. It is beyond doubt that the workers' organisations contribute to the industrial equilibrium and that the Commission's function is to reduce industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it then that this Minister and this Government wish to discourage unionism and reduce the power of the Commission? The only argument that the Minister and honourable members opposite can produce in relation to this section of the legislation is that they are safeguarding some sacred right of an individual to refuse to join a union. They forget that many more individuals who are members of a union have the same sacred right to refuse to work with a scabbing individual. The Minister wants to defend the right of one individual against the rights of many individuals. He knows very well that if this Bill is passed-I hope that it will not be-the number of industrial disputes will increase. In addition, the Minister proposes to remove the power of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to deal with such disputes and wishes to place such matters in the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Australia. The Minister wants scabs or provacateurs to sue unions or employers, or both, for damages in cases where employers prefer to employ unionists or where unionists, quite frankly, refuse to work with scabs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has talked about redress against employees and unions but he knows that the industrial reality will be that such action will result in prolonged and unsolvable industrial disputes with consequent damage to the nation's economy. After introducing such an inane Bill, it is no wonder that the Minister could not muster more than six votes in his own party. It is true that he received only five votes but I give him six as I know his own vote was commanded elsewhere by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I wonder who are the five members opposite who support this Minister. They are not sitting behind him in this chamber. Let me briefly deal with the other provisions contained in this Bill. The Bill introduces new stand-down provisions in case of strikes or bans. The Minister said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to stand-down will be the decision of the employer according to the circumstances with which he is faced. </PARA>
<PARA>This means that employers will be able to stand down employees at any time during a dispute, even when such dispute has been provoked by management, without referring the matter to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This is also a retrograde step as it removes the Commission from its function of conciliation and enables management to exacerbate, prolong and extend disputes and starve workers into submission. The present Act has adequate provisions whereby employers can apply for stand-down provisions to be inserted into awards . This amendment is unnecessary. It will also provoke disputes and prolong and widen existing ones. It is not acceptable to the trade union movement as it gives complete freedom to employers to stand down workers capriciously. In view of the fact that nearly 50 per cent of industrial disputes is caused by management, it is a paradox to offer the same management the absolute rights of stand-downs. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal, as with the previous one, is not designed to assist speedy resolution of industrial disputes. It is designed to widen them. Government members, when speaking overseas, often point to the fact that our rate of industrial disputes and their duration compare favourably with other industrialised countries; yet back home they resort to union bashing which is their usual political tactic. The Minister for Industrial Relations, when speaking recently to employers, freely admitted that nearly half of industrial disputes are caused by management. If we add to this the number of disputes caused by demands for adherence to safety regulations or protection of workers' health, demarcation disputes, just wage demands and other reasons we find that very few disputes are caused by some insatiable greed by unionists, as the Minister would like the Australian public to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> Now let us look at the third matter that has been introduced-the establishment of industry unions. The honourable member for North Sydney, who preceded me in this debate, spoke at length about this. But he somehow missed one point-that of the historical background of unionism in Australia. We cannot create unions by ministerial edict or by lawyers' suggestions. Creation of unions is an historical process; that was the point that was missed. This part of the legislation seems to be a revised version of the grand idea of the Minister to establish enterprise unions, an inane notion which was aborted before it hit the deck. Judging from the Minister's performance, it will not be long before he is aborted, too-by the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> To get back to industry unions, institutions in our society such as trade unions are not created by Ministers, nor by the member for North Sydney who preceded me, but are the result of historical development. Because Australian trade unions followed the pattern of British trade unions, which developed along the line of craft unions, Australia today has about 300 unions. Even though the honourable member for North Sydney said that the Australian Labor Party or the unions are opposed to upsetting some political balance in the unions, that is not correct. It is obvious that the reduction in the number of unions is desirable. Amalgamation of unions, where there is community of interest, should be facilitated. This is the view of trade unionists. It is the view of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. However, the Bill does not provide for that. It wants to foist on to the trade unions-an institution that grew out of our history and developed on the basis of free association of workers-a structure which is alien to them. I have to repeat that time and again so that even the Minister for Industrial Relations can understand that we cannot by legislation force the Australian trade unions into acceptance of new structures. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not the only thing that is wrong with the Minister's proposal. The new concept of industry unions will not reduce the number of unions. On the contrary, it will create new unions, more unions. In addition it will increase disruptions. It will cut across historical and peaceful development of trade unionism and, of course, it will be unacceptable to the Australian workers. As members opposite are somewhat slow, I reiterate that a reduction in the number of unions in Australia can be achieved only through mergers between unions and voluntary amalgamation of unions where there is a community of interest. This can be brought about only by discussion of membership and free negotiation and not by introduction of new unions by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever there was a recipe for disaster in industrial disputation, this Bill certainly is such a recipe. The Government has yet to learn that industrial relations cannot be managed by the bludgeon of legislation but has to be approached with common sense and with a spirit of conciliation. Of course, this Government and this Minister do not want industrial peace. It would not suit their sinister purposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Their sinister purposes are to create disruption and to divert people's attention away from the Government's inability to manage the economy. That is what the Government wants to achieve and that is what it tried to do in Victoria but the Victorian people gave their answer. In every other field members opposite advocate less government interference and small government yet they want to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act for the seventy-seventh time since 1904. It was previously amended at the rate of once a year, but under the Fraser Government it is being amended three times a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since a number of my coleagues want to speak, I will cut short my remarks. In conclusion, let me illustrate that I am not alone in accusing the Fraser Government of intrusion and interference in the industrial relations field with the aim to create chaos. I quote from a speech by the former Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). At page 2829 of Hansard of 28 May 1981 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Conciliation and Arbitration Act has been amended over 70 times since its enactment in 1904-14 times under the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA>That was last year. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that this represents lack of direction and lack of consensus, over many years on direction over time and the fallibility of legislation. This Act has surely reached saturation point. The cumulative effect of legislation on industrial relations is largely a matter of conjecture and often ill-informed assumption. There is a need for the Act to be simplified into a useful tool for the practitioner in industrial relations-not complicated by further legislation. Proliferation of legislation is, after all, a form of so-called big government that must be reduced. Problems cannot be consigned wholesale for government solution; nor should government unnecessarily intrude. Industrial problems should mainly be resolved by those most involved. Government must create a background by making its views clear and acting only if necessary to reconcile competing interests-including the public interest. Legislation should be undertaken only if it is necessary to ensure the outcome and there is confidence that it will do this and only this.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not an indictment of this Government's record in industrial relations , and an indictment of this incompetent Minister's record, I do not know what is . This Bill is the Minister's swan-song. It is an ugly composition and a song very much out of tune with the community and the electorate. It was no surprise that this Bill was introduced here by the Minister with great enthusiasm some 10 days before the Victorian elections as part of a union-bashing exercise. It is pursued now with somewhat dampened zeal by members opposite who are stunned by the verdict of the Victorian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I advise the honourable gentlemen opposite to stop this cheap gimmick of union bashing and to apply themselves instead to the economic management of this country and to do what they were elected to do and on which they have failed so miserably. No amount of union bashing will detract the attention of the Australian people from the bleak economic conditions brought about by the Fraser Government. It will be in this field that the Fraser Government will be judged by the people, found guilty and removed from office at the next elections, whenever they are held. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the beginning of his contribution to this debate my colleague the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) made the point that the state of industrial relations in Australia today is probably the most difficult matter that this country has to deal with. I fully agree with that conclusion by my colleague. My view is that the state of industrial relations in Australia is perhaps the greatest economic and social scourge with which we have to deal in this country. It is a disgusting commentary, or reflection on all of those people who dare to call themselves practitioners or participants in the industrial relations scene. Anybody-be they honourable members on either side of this House, people outside this House, in industry or unions-who dares to say that the industrial scene in Australia is working well is trying to deceive himself, others around him and people in the community generally. It is a disgusting commentary on this Parliament, on unions and on employers that our country is being torn to pieces because our industrial relations system is simply not working properly. For honourable members on the opposite side of this chamber to claim that the problem is being caused wholly and solely either because of legislation passed by this Government or because of the attitudes of employers or honourable members on this side of the House is to deceive themselves and to try to deceive the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem of industrial relations pervades the whole of our community. If my friends on the opposite side of the chamber wish to contribute in any meaningful way to solving that problem I urge them to extend their minds above party political dogma and to think of Australia instead of thinking of pre-selections within their party. Another point that has come through to me in the course of this debate was spurred on by a comment by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) when he mentioned the legal qualifications of my colleagues the honourable member for Braddon and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). I was reminded of the legal qualifications of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), both of whom have participated in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that one of the main problems with industrial relations in this country at the moment is that industrial policy, industrial relations as such, is being determined by lawyers under the law. That means that industrial relations must of its very nature be a combative process, that there must be gladiators with drawn swords, that at no stage through the industrial relations procedures can there be harmony. The fact that there may be harmony of opinion between employers and employees does not seem to enter into the debate at any stage. Surely the interests of employers must be paralleled with the interests of employees. If a company goes out of business it cannot provide any jobs. If a company is not profitable it cannot provide better pay and conditions for its workers. Obviously, the objectives of both the workers and employers must be common. However, at no stage in the industrial relations procedures under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act-be it in the court, before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, or at any other stage-is that harmony of objectives ever recognised. It is about time it was. But it will not be recognised while the processes of industrial relations are determined by law. Inherent in that process of law is that there must be opposite sides and that the participants and parties under the law must be combative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind my friend from Melbourne that perhaps the best way of resolving our industrial problems at the moment is to create a more harmonious climate between employers and employees. Surely the best place to resolve disputes is at the point where those disputes occur and that is at the work face level. It is not before the Commission; it is not before an arbitrator. It is not worked out third-hand between lawyers who represent different parties. The best way to resolve disputes is between the parties themselves, the employer or his foreman and the people who are working at the shop floor level. That means a more harmonious working relationship between the two parties. Certainly if we had a more harmonious relationship between people at the shop floor level lawyers would not get a quid when they appeared representing people. It would mean that trade union officials have more difficulty in justifying their jobs to their members, but it would certainly mean that people at the work level, employers who are trying to provide jobs, would have a much better climate in which to pursue their objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this respect I must admit that I am critical of large sections of management in Australia. One of the key objectives in providing a climate for better industrial relations is to provide job satisfaction for people at the work level . But that does not seem to occur to very many people in management. I do not criticise the economic management or the fact that accountants can work on calculators; that is their job. However, one of the prime functions of management should be to create a harmonious working climate within their establishments so that a business or enterprise can go about its functions and can provide both the economic and the social satisfactions that are necessary within the community. It is not a combative process. There are common objectives and it is about time we in this Parliament, unionists and management recognised those common objectives and started working towards them rather than working towards those things on which there is disagreement. Let us look at the areas on which we agree and start working towards them. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made those introductory comments, I turn now to the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill, which we are debating today, and more particularly to some of the comments that have been made by earlier speakers in this debate. I remind the House that this Bill contains three major provisions: One seeks to remove from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the right to include preference clauses in awards; the second seeks to provide an easier mechanism for standing down employees who cannot be gainfully employed because of industrial action; and the third seeks to provide an easier mechanism to establish industry based unions. I will reverse the order of those matters. I expect that, from a philosophical point of view, there is no dispute between members of this House about the provision of industry based unions. I fully expect that members of the Opposition, together with the trade union organisation, fully support the concept of industry based unions. I am delighted that we have little dispute on that. The concept of industry based unions is far more preferable in this country to the present process of craft based unions. Obviously, if we can reduce the number of unions and can reduce those areas in which there can be conflict between unions it must go a long way towards minimising the number of industrial disputations in this country. I will not comment further on that because we agree, and I think it is good that we do agree. The mechanism for organising industry based unions and for changing the present structure of craft based unions will be difficult to determine. Certainly it will not be resolved quickly. However it is good that we are agreed and that we will progressively work towards that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now come to some of the more controversial aspects of this legislation which relate to preference clauses. We must recognise that on the matter of removing the option of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to include preference clauses in awards there is very largely a purely philosophical difference of opinion between honourable members on both sides of this House. It seems to me from listening to arguments from the Opposition, that the Opposition is saying that unions should have the right to request from the Arbitration Commission that a preference clause be written into an award because it is the inherent responsibility of a worker to join a union. That seems to me to be the whole basis of the argument. However what that argument excludes is the right of free choice-the right of a person to decide whether he wants to join a union. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument seems to be that if a person wants to work he joins a union but if he does not want to work there is no necessity for him to do so. I cannot agree with that philosophical argument, because a fundamental basis of our whole Western democracy is that people must have a right of free choice and an option under law to pursue their free choice regardless of the field of society or economics involved. When we take away the right of people to exercise a free choice we take away part of our democracy. On that basis I cannot support the arguments of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I was intrigued by some of the arguments presented by the honourable member for Wills. I commend the honourable member for the homework he has done. But he spent much of his time explaining to the House that provision for preference clauses was incorporated in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1904. He argued that because that provision had been in the legislation for almost 80 years it should remain. I must admit that I cannot follow the logic. That argument ignores the fact that times change, that economic circumstances change, that the thinking of people changes and therefore the law should reflect those changes. I am sure that the honourable member for Wills and others on the other side of the chamber would agree that the economic conditions in Australia and the social conditions in Australia are totally different now from what they were in 1904. That may have been an appropriate provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1904. But if circumstances have changed, it should be removed . I quite agree with that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills and, I believe, other Opposition speakers made the point that the removal of this provision from the Conciliation and Arbitration Act would lead to widespread industrial disputation. The logic seems to be that we will have less industrial disputation if we leave that provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Very obviously no account has been taken of the decisions given recently by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to allow the Waterside Workers Federation preference in its award. Already we have been given notice by other unions which represent workers on the waterfront that there will be widespread industrial disputation because that one union has been given a preference clause. If waterfront unions naturally engage in widespread industrial disputation because the Commission has allowed a preference clause in one award-and one logically could expect that this would happen in other areas-how can the claim be made that the removal of this provision will lead to industrial disputation? Obviously the provision will lead to widespread industrial disputation if it remains in the Act and is used by the Commission. I think very obviously our whole democracy, our whole way of life, demands that people should have the right of free choice. They should have the right to exercise that free choice as their conscience determines, not as any overbearing bureaucratic organisation determines they should act. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me briefly comment on the stand-down provisions that have been included in this Bill. I would like to make reference to a comment by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) when introducing this legislation. The Minister, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> If unions are to have, as a basic principle, the right to strike then it is surely not unreasonable for employers to have at their individual disposal, the right to protect their commercial interests in circumstances where they are put at risk by union action. </PARA>
<PARA>I think any logical, thinking person would agree with the Minister's conclusion and not with the Opposition's conclusion on this matter. We are saying that at the moment industrial relations are going to be determined under the process of law. Very obviously, if we have a law, that law has to be fair and impartial to all parties. We cannot have one law for one group of people and a totally different and conflicting law for another group. Such a proposition is illogical and cannot work. The Minister is saying: 'Let us have a law, let us make it simple and let us make it uniform for all people. If we are going to have that law, let us make it impartial so that everybody must comply under that law'. What the Opposition and what the trade union movement are saying is: 'We do not care two hoots what law you have got. We will comply with the law only when it suits us. But at the same time we insist that everbody else under that law must be bound responsible to that law'. That sort of principle cannot operate in Australia or in any other democratic society. It may operate in places where the law can be enforced at the point of a gun. But it will not operate in a free democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House agree that organised workers, through their trade unions, should have the right under a free democracy to withdraw their labour if that is what they democratically choose to do. We support and uphold that principle. At the same time the same privilege must be extended to the employer. If it is not we are not being fair and reasonable. The employer must have the same rights as the employee. If for reasons of industrial disputation people at a workface level decide voluntarily to withdraw their labour for whatever reason they determine by democratic means, that is fair enough. But the employer must have the same right in protecting his interests to stand down other employees who cannot be gainfully employed. It seems to me that the philosophy of the Opposition in this matter is that money paid to employees is in fact not the rightful property of the employer but some sort of public property. That philosophy is wrong, because money to be used for wages is the legal property of the employer. If that money were stolen from the employer the person who stole it could be pursued under criminal law. The Opposition is saying that in some mystical way the employees have a right to the money of the employer whether they work for it or not. That proposition cannot be held up by any logical commonsense argument. Obviously the employer has an obligation to pay his employees for the work that they do. But if they do not work he should have no obligation to pay. That is only logical and commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions which have been introduced by the Minister must be supported by any logical, commonsense, thinking Australian. The provisions are logical and can stand up to commonsense argument. This Parliament should support these measures. I believe that the whole Australian community will do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address myself to two provisions in this legislation. Firstly, I want to deal with the provisions which allegedly allow an employee the right to join or not join a union and remove from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission jurisdiction to award preference to unionists. I also wish to refer to the other area of the Bill which seeks to provide employers with the direct right to stand down employees who allegedly cannot be usefully employed because of the effects of industrial action by other employees of the same employer or, for that matter, any other employer. Clause 6 of this Bill is designed to give the employer the power to stand down workers who, it is claimed, are not able to be usefully employed as a result of industrial action. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) states that he is concerned for the employer whose operation is affected by strike action, who has no power to resort to industrial action and who is affected by industrial action because his wage bill is mounting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) also supported this position. He took it a step further last month when he suggested that the aim of the proposal was the protection of employers who were not involved in industrial disputes but whose financial position was affected by strikes. Are workers who face the possibility of being stood down not seen by the Government as individuals too, individuals whose rights the Government is claiming to protect in other sections of this Bill? What effect does this have on the concept of a better balance of powers and on the rights and duties of employers and employees that the Minister for Industrial Relations is crowing about? Let me answer that question. In this Bill the balance of power is being handed to the employer whose rights to make a profit seem, according to the rationale of this Government, to make him more worthy of protection than the worker. That this is the way this Government interprets individual rights can be confirmed when one asks the question: Who will decide whether workers are able to be usefully employed when a firm is affected by industrial action? This legislation proposes to take the power of determining whether a stand-down clause is justified, in the case of a strike, away from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and to give employers the automatic right to stand down workers as they see fit. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed new section 33B (1) to (12) is the most broadly based power in relation to stand-downs ever handed to employers in this country without recourse to a federal or State court. It provides employers with direct stand- down rights over employees who allegedly cannot be employed usefully because of industrial action. It refers not only to industrial action taken by members of the same union, perhaps working in the same firm, but also to action taken by members of the same union outside that firm and, indeed, by members of any union involved in any industry even remotely linked with the employer in question. Nothing could be more calculated to increase disputation. Workers who are not involved in such a dispute and who take no part in the decision to strike will most bitterly resent being stood down at immediate notice when they are not involved in a strike or have had no part in the decision to take that strike. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill gives the employer power to initiate or provoke industrial disputes at times when a temporary closure of his or her firm would offset inefficiencies in the management of that firm. Employers will have the power to stand down workers for any period, as long as the strike is maintained. Under existing stand-down regulations workers are unable to be stood down for less than one working day. In addition, the existing stand-down clauses in industrial awards will become invalid because they apparently conflict with the terms of this legislation. Furthermore, the Commission will have no future power to insert stand-down clauses in awards. In other words, the body whose name implies that it was established to ensure that industrial disputes are waged and settled fairly is being stripped of the power to prevent employers from imposing short, sharp, shock tactics on workers in terms of removing them from and disrupting their labour for small but important periods. This provision abolishes the ability of that body to protect workers against the tactics of employers whose main aim could be to protect their own profit margins. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does not simply protect innocent individual employers who may be unduly affected by strikes. It is designed also to protect major corporations and to allow them to stand down workers, perhaps to compensate for managerial blunders by temporarily shedding labour. This Bill directly sanctions the persecution of people who may be innocent third parties, while employers are also given power to provoke or to sustain industrial battles to suit their own economic positions or their own industrial relations policies. For the duration of any dispute, the employer has the power under proposed new section 33B automatically to stand down all unionised employees whom the employer claims cannot be usefully employed. In the case of a firm affected by industrial action in another firm these workers can be laid off until normal production is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most insidious aspect of this provision is clear when one asks the question: Is the worker employed by a firm, not engaged in industrial action, but who is stood down, able to claim social security benefits? The answer is yes , provided that the worker is not a member of the same union which is engaged in industrial action. So the workers who may be innocent victims of a dispute, and these automatic stand-down provisions, may be denied sustenance although they have had no part in the original dispute or the decision to go into disputation.</PARA>

<PARA> I turn now to clause 20 which amends section 144A, allegedly to protect the right of an employee to choose to join or not to join a particular union. If this clause in the Bill is passed non-union labour will stand a better chance of receiving fair and equal treatment than unionised labour. It will be an offence to favour unionised labour in any way but, within the terms of this legislation, it is possible for employers to discriminate effectively in favour of non-union labour when employing people. For example, despite the fact that the employer is prevented from discriminating against unionists in his or her employ, the employer can decide to hire only non-union labour; an employer could decide under this Bill to hire only non-union labour and if a union took action or ever threatened action to persuade the employer to hire union members or to persuade the new non-union workers to join the union, that union or its representatives would be in breach of proposed new section 144A. </PARA>

<PARA> I turn to what this Government refuses to consider. Let us examine the major causes of disputes. In reality, that is what the Bill is all about, if the Government says that too much time is being lost by disputation and that employers are losing too much money through having to pay workers who are not gainfully employed as a result of a strike. Obviously this legislation does not relate to any examination of the causes of disputes in an effort to try to eradicate those causes. One of the prime causes of disputation is the current inadequacy of the Government's wage policies. Rather than attacking trade unionists and rather than encouraging scab or non-union labour, this Government should be implementing a national wage or a national adequate and equitable prices and incomes policy. But no, the Government has not done that; nor has it ever considered it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has destroyed centralised wage fixation. It has destroyed wage indexation. Now it professes to join the financial gurus of the Australian Financial Review in professing to believe in collective bargaining. I shall return to that subject shortly. As regards indexation, in late 1975 this Government promised to support wage indexation. Up until early 1981 there were 15 cases and the Government opposed wage indexation 15 times. Of the last 11 cases, the Government went before the court for no increase at all 10 times. To prove the truth of what I am saying, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask that this table of all the indexation cases, the Government's responses, the results and the court' s decisions be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government, having destroyed wage indexation, now advocates collective bargaining. It says that collective bargaining results in fewer wage- related strikes and a more flexible wage structure. Well, it certainly results in a more polarised wage structure, if not a more flexible one. But I do not agree that it results in fewer wage related disputes. Those who advocate collective bargaining in today's economic situation as an alternative to centralised wage fixation and who say in support of that argument that it produces fewer wage-related disputes are not telling the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under centralised collective bargaining between 1965 and 1967, the number of wage and benefit-related disputes, which includes disputes over wages, hours, leave and other benefits, averaged 362 a year. Between 90 per cent and 95 per cent of those disputes were wage-related. In 1968 the number of these disputes rose to 544. In 1969 it rose to 684. By 1970, the figure had more than tripled to 1,228 benefit-related disputes. This was in a situation of non-centralised wage fixation. This level of disputes was maintained at an average of 1,051 between 1971 and 1974. In the turbulent industrial year of 1974, the total number of such disputes was 1,235. But in the following year, when wage indexation was introduced, the number of wage and benefit-related disputes fell to 540. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of wage and benefit-related disputes under wage indexation is far better than that simply under conciliation and arbitration. In 1977 wage and benefits-related disputes totalled 558; in 1978 the figure was 628; in 1979 the figure was 679; and in 1980 the figure was 667. Despite the problems with wage indexation, one can virtually say that chaos resulted after indexation was abolished early last year. For the June quarter of that year, wage and benefit- related disputes totalled 222. For the September quarter, the figure rose to 326 . That is, just under half of the total number of wage and benefit-related disputes for the entire year of 1980 were recorded in one quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> To oppose indexation in the light of this track record seems absurd, but that is what the Government has done. It exemplifies that this Government will extend itself in order to implement the illogical ad hockery that it calls policy. By abolishing wage indexation, the Government destroyed a centralised wages policy. The results of this decision are clear enough, as I have just enunciated. Also, collective bargaining ensures that polarisation occurs, particularly in resource development and construction areas. The workers who are going to gain out of collective bargaining are those who belong to large powerful unions located in the more profitable industries or in construction areas where there is greater capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> This is exemplified by the situation in areas in which highly profitable industries or development projects determine the local economy. For instance, in Singleton, New South Wales, staff at Warkworth Mining Ltd are paid award wages, open-cut allowances and margins for skill, as well as a bonus of $160 a week. This occurs across the plant. Less profitable areas, such as local councils and county councils, cannot hope to hold their labour and compete. The same situation occurs at Morwell in the Latrobe Valley, at Gladstone and in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens when the workers go out to work for power station contractors or coal mines and earn their $500, $600 or $700 a week? Firstly, it means that the local councils and local small employers cannot hold their labour. There is a shortage of skilled labour in those areas. But then inflation occurs. Up go the rents and prices, and the poor workers who have been left behind in those areas, and who are not getting the high wages paid by the contractors and in the coal mines, get the lower wages from the small employers that the Government reckons it is going to protect, and workers in the local councils, which cannot afford to pay, have to pay the high prices and high rents which are occurring in those developing areas. If the Minister for Industrial Relations cannot see that that is resulting from his policy of support for collective bargaining, he should not be the Minister for Industrial Relations-and, of course, he should not be. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that this Government is in a mess. Unemployment is up. Interest rates are up. Inflation is up. The Government has relied on a resource boom to stimulate employment-a boom that never was. Now, because it is in such economic trouble, it seeks to divert the workers of Australia from this economic mess that it has created by trying to create more strikes. Exports are down. Imports are up. The current account is in a horrific mess. Capital is flooding in, and the Government is relying on it because it is like a drug to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very great need for an expansionary economic policy, not for this sort of industrial ad hockery. We need to expand the Budget outlays to create employment and to reduce interest rates. But with these policies, of course, an industrial relations policy of collective bargaining would be disastrous. We can expand the economy, but only if we have a working and equitable prices and incomes policy, a broad ranging wages policy which can centralise wage fixation equitably, which can restructure the tax system and which can implement a social wage, which will include a proper health insurance scheme, proper social security benefits, taxation reform and adequate price control mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of prices and incomes policy that the Australian Labor Party will be able to deliver at the next election in conjunction with an expansion of the economy. We can fix up the mess. We do not have to rely on this sort of ad hoc, dispute-creating, provocative industrial relations policy, which gives employers the right to stand down labour in the name of protecting their own profits and assures the rights of non-unionists to employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee should understand the nature of this proposal. This clause seeks to amend the objects section of the legislation, and to do so in a most unusual fashion in that sub-section (f) of section 2 of the Act is to be deleted. There seeks to be inserted a new provision, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>to safeguard the freedom of persons to choose whether or not to be members of organizations of employees so registered . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The unusual feature about this provision is that it relates only to the membership of organisations of employees. Wherever else reference is made, in the objects section or in the legislation generally, to the membership of organisations, it is so indicated that it is an employee or employer organisation. Here, it is to safeguard the freedom of persons to choose whether or not to be members of organisations of employees so registered. Why is there a distinction in regard to organisations of employees and not organisations of employers? Is it suggested that circumstances do not exist where there may be some coercion of employers to be or not to be members of employer organisations? Clearly the provision is deficient in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill is directed to the question of voluntary unionism ; that is, the right of an individual to join or not to join a union. The problems of the closed shop or coercion to join a union and discrimination or victimisation against a person who does not wish to join a union but nevertheless wishes to work, to carry on his trade, calling or occupation of whatever kind are of a completely different character from the matter of employer membership of an employer organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been surprised at the stand taken by the Opposition with regard to the principle of voluntary unionism because, so far as the Government is concerned, this legislation gives full and complete respect to what is a fundamental right. To draw upon some authority for my proposition I turn to a speech by a member of the Opposition in another place, Senator Gareth Evans. In a paper delivered to the Industrial Relations Society of Victoria on 20 June 1979, published in monograph series No. 9 of that society, Senator Evans said-I invite Opposition members to listen to it:</PARA>
<PARA> It must be accepted that a logical corollary to the undisputed democratic right of free association is the right not to associate. As a matter of first principle, no one should be forced to join any organisation against his or her will. If that right is acknowledged in principle it ought to be capable of enforcement in practice, if necessary by statutory means. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the major premise upon which Senator Evans proceeds to argue the morality of conscientious objection. I do not accept his following arguments, because he then seeks to convert the fundamental freedom of association to a compulsion to join a union, and then to argue for relief from that compulsion by the granting of acknowledgment of conscientious objection. That seems to me to be turning logic on its head. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested also to draw some authority for the proposition that unions in Australia are based on the principle of voluntary association from His Honour Mr Justice Murphy, of the High Court. In the case of the Queen against J. B. Sweeney, ex parte Northwest Exports Pty Ltd, reported in 35 ALR at page 135, His Honour said-I quote from page 150:</PARA>
<PARA> It is open to Parliament to take the view that employers should have no influence on whether or not an employee joins an organisation of employees because this would tend to detract from the voluntary and representative nature of the organisations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that is an accurate statement by Mr Justice Murphy of what this Bill proposes. It takes the view-I am sure that Parliament will pass this legislation and thereby express the same view-that employers should have no influence on whether an employee joins an organisation of employees because that would tend to depart from the voluntary and representative nature of the organisation. I go one step further than His Honour and say that Parliament would take the view that unions likewise should have no influence upon a person by way of discrimination or victimisation, who chooses not to join a union. Indeed, if one needs further support for the fundamental principle of civil liberty, as expressed by Senator Evans, one need only turn to the 1981 Congress statement of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Under the heading 'Human Rights' the following appears:</PARA>
<PARA> Congress pledges its support for the achievement of basic human rights including freedom of assembly and the right of workers to organise free trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA>What we believe we are doing is giving expression to this fundamental civil liberty, the right of the individual to choose to join or not to join a union. I believe that if one asks the population one will find that the bulk supports the expression by this Government, through this legislation, of that fundamental principle. That is what we seek to express by this clause amending the objects provided in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government would have us believe that its concern is for the rights of the individual. That is the whole thrust of the Government's proposition. I propose to refer to the annual report of the Government's own Industrial Relations Bureau to show that adequate provision is already made for those who seek not to join unions. That is only one part of a number of matters that the Government should take into consideration. It should realise that there is no need for what it is proposing. According to the Government's own report for the year 1979-80, under section 144A, which relates to the right to opt out and not belong to a union, the IRB dealt with 27 such complaints and inquiries, out of a total of 410. In the following year, 1980-81, the IRB dealt with 50 such complaints and inquiries, but that was out of a total of 740. According to the report for that year, only 7 per cent of the cases dealt with were individual rights matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the other area in respect of which the Government claims that workers need protection and therefore do not have to join a union. I refer to section 188 of the principal Act. In 1979-80 the number of such complaints and inquiries dealt with by the IRB, the industrial arm set up by the Government, numbered only 23 out of a total of 410. For 1980-81, the figures were 58 out of a total of 740. Again I do not think that in any way, shape or form the Government can justify the fundamental change that it seeks to make to the Act, that of attempting to alter its chief objectives. That is what the Government is really trying to do. That argument cannot be sustained by the Government if it uses the figures from its own Bureau as to the number of problems that occur. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) has said that that is the main thrust of the legislation, that the right of the individual is paramount. I repeat, in regard to two aspects, the section dealing with the right to opt out, to take a conscientious objection, and that which deals with complaints on the part of people who have refused to take part in industrial disputes-ever under the Government's own legislation, which was toughened up to give this kind of scab an out-only the small number of complaints to which I have referred has been made in two years of operation. What the Government is really about is trying to change a system that is based on representation. It is important that we should consider what this Government is about in its attempt to change the chief objects of the Act. In fact, if we spend a little time to consider them, we note that the chief objects of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1904, as set out in section 2, are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to promote goodwill in industry:</PARA>
<PARA>One certainly will not see that emerging from what the Government proposes. The second objective is:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to encourage, and provide means for, conciliation with a view to amicable agreement, thereby preventing and settling industrial disputes;</PARA>
<PARA>We will not see that result either from these propositions. In particular, sub- section (e) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> To encourage the organisation of representative bodies of employers and employees and their registration under this Act;</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the whole Act relates to a system that is based on representation. In order to work under it, employers and employees must be represented by their organisation or association. That is the whole basis of the Act. It deals with good will and encouraging people to join industrial organisations. But the Government would seek to destroy that very concept. I believe the Government, whether it knows it or not, is aware of it or cares, is putting in jeopardy the rights that an employee might well have under an award. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of cases involving individuals, that is, the people that the Government would seek to provide for, who choose not to belong to a union. I put it to the Government and to the Minister that an employee who chose that course would in fact be depriving himself of rights under an award, determination or agreement. There have been a number of cases in which this has clearly been shown to be the situation. Such workers have attempted to appear before the Commission and the Industrial Court to seek to secure the advantages of an award of the Commission. The Court has ruled against them and has said that they have no right to be before the Court or before the Commission. Is this what the Government is about? It is trying to con these workers into this position where they would be denied certain rights? If the Government is going to facilitate and encourage non-unionism, it had better go the whole hog and tell them about the rights that they are going to lose. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1973 there was before the Industrial Court the case of Tziortis v. ACI Australian Glass Manufacturers Co. On the Bench were Spicer, Joske and Smithers. They ruled against the rights of an individual to have the protection of or share in the gains of an agreement that had been made between the secretary of the union and the employer. There have been a number of other similar cases-I can recall being involved in one myself-in which the employer sent a number of employees to the Commission to try to disrupt the claims being put to the Commission by the union on behalf of the workers. The Commission ruled against them and said they could not be heard, that the only people who could be heard were the unions or their agents, and the employers or their agents. They were the people who made the awards, the respondents to the awards, and therefore the workers who were not in the union did not have the right to representation. If the Government is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of workers it should address itself to that proposition. I think it is far more important to point out that the Government is attacking the fundamental principle behind the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, that is, a system based on representation, not one that is prepared to accommodate scabs and people who are not prepared to pay union dues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take a few minutes before the suspension of the sitting for dinner to speak on a couple of grounds against the Government's proposed amendment in clause 3. Firstly, the Government is not in touch with reality today. Secondly, this clause is discriminatory. It is clearly aimed only at employees and it does not relate to employer organisations. When we look at the debate that took place this afternoon at the second reading stage it is not hard to understand that. A couple of the main speakers from the Government side are members of the law institute. I do not think the Government could raise its head if it proposed legislation which gave people power to break the hold that people in those types of unions have. The employer unions, the higher paid areas that support the Government side, are not affected by this Bill. It is strictly aimed at employees. It is another piece of legislation that will only cause problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another reason why this clause should not be supported by the Parliament is that it will not be supported by the people. It is quite clear in the political world today that this Government is not receiving the support of the public for the types of legislation that it is bringing forward. In fact, it is not receiving the support of a solid bloc within its own party. For example, at a meeting held recently one-third of the members of the Government parties voted solidly to express their view that they wanted a change in direction. But this is not a change in direction. This is headlong down the road of disaster. If the Committee wants a clear indication of how much out of touch the Government is with the public and not only with the public but also--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0G4">Mr CUNNINGHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The clause itself is a straightout change to the Act supposedly to safeguard the freedom of persons. What I am saying is that the Government is so far out of touch that the general thrust of the clause is not in the best interests of this country. One only has to look at the report of the president of an organisation in Victoria to see what the general feeling of the people is towards this type of clause and this type of legislation. One only has to look at the President's report to the central council of the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria, not an organisation that is affiliated with the Labor Party but an organisation which is expressing the views of the public about this type of legislation. At annual conference after annual conference it has been making decisions. I would like to read from the President's report of April 1982. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all know that at every annual conference we have had, everyone has been in favour of compulsory membership, yet we have got exactly nowhere with the proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>What that organisation is saying is that it was not able under the Liberal Government of Victoria to achieve the aims which were adopted at its own conferences, that is, compulsory membership. The general feeling in the community today is the same as it is in all organisations. The cost of running organisations today and looking after members is something that has to be shared by everybody right across the board. This type of legislation is clearly designed to allow sections of any organisation, and in this case worker organisations, not employer organisations, to opt out of their responsibilities. Those responsibilities are not imposed on them by law. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has had this in its charter since 1904. It has been used wisely for many years. It has been recognised, as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has said, by many governments over many years. There is no logical reason, except the politics of the situation, why this clause has been brought in. There is no support for it from employer organisations. It does not reflect the view of the public and there can be only one reason for it, and that is that this Government is determined to go headlong into oblivion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only one point to make. We are talking about voluntary unionism as compared with compulsory unionism in law. The whole objection of the Opposition appears to me to demonstrate its supporters' profound doubt that without this provision in the Act the union movement could not attract membership. If that is not the problem, what are honourable members opposite worried about? They should not have a worry. If the unions are so good, the workers will flock to their doors and they will pay the money with pleasure. Let us face it, that is what honourable members opposite are worried about, and nobody knows that better than the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). He offered them their own grocery and clothing store in the middle of Melbourne, but it went broke because the people would not flock there. The problem is exactly that and I put it to the Committee that there are no problems whatsoever with this clause. If the union movement can attract members, it does not need intimidation or compulsion by law. I do not know what honourable members opposite are worried about. If they are convinced that the operations of the trade union movement are so good they should have no problem whatsoever once this piece of legislation is in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few brief comments about these two clauses. Clause 4 proposes the addition to the definition clause of various definitions which relate to the substantive amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Of particular importance are the proposed definitions of ' prescribed business' and 'prescribed corporation' which will apply to the new stand-down and voluntary unionism provisions. As can be seen, the definitions of 'prescribed business' and 'prescribed corporation' attempt to provide as wide as possible constitutional support for the operation of the provisions relating to stand-downs and voluntary unionism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The clear implication here is that the normal constitutional provision-placitum (xxxv.) of section 51 of the Constitution-would not be sufficient to found the expansion of powers in the legislation. Accordingly the clause seeks to draw upon these other possible heads of power to sustain the expansion of the Government's intentions in this regard. I suggest that this raises the question of the likelihood or the possibility of constitutional challenge in that regard to these issues. This is one of the reasons that the national employers have expressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) and to the Government very serious concern about what they are doing here. Obviously if it were upheld that the invocation of these heads of power would sustain the exercise upon which the Government is engaged here, it would follow that this Government, or any government, would on the same basis be able to use those heads of power to legislate directly in the area of wages and conditions of employment. That concern has been expressed to the Minister and to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 introduces a new section 4B into the Act which provides that the Act will not apply to claims or industrial disputes involving preference to unionists or to claims or disputes relating to members of a union that has been deregistered by a State industrial tribunal. The effect of the clause, if it were to become law, would be to deprive the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission of jurisdiction to deal with these matters. I believe that it is appropriate and indeed necessary to put on the record the basis of our fundamental objection to what the Government is proposing here. What it means is that although disputes will continue to occur in relation to preference to unionists and in regard to award coverage for members of deregistered State unions, the Commission will be prevented from dealing with such disputes. This removes a further area of industrial conflict from the jurisdiction of the Federal tribunal, which has a statutory responsibility with respect to the prevention and settlement of disputes. Obviously if this power were taken away from the Commission it would not stop the existence of disputes but it would take away the power of the tribunal to deal with them. In those circumstances there would be nowhere for those disputes to go. The provision would hinder the prevention and settlement of the disputes in the interests of the parties and of the general community through the established dispute settling machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at this clause one will see the classic illustration of the Government creating a position which is not likely to lead to a reduction of disputes. Firstly, more disputes are likely to occur as a result of what the Government is doing. Secondly, and in a sense more importantly, the Government is removing any possible locus of decision for those disputes. How even this Minister could start to explain the sense of that situation-firstly, creating more disputes and then, secondly, removing any place where those disputes can be settled-defies the imagination. I suggest that it is a classic illustration of the basis of this legislation, which is not one which reflects the requirements and the decisions of those involved in the industrial relations field on the side of the employers, the trade unions and other concerned commentators, but reflects-as I and other speakers have said-the continuing intention of this Government to use this whole area of industrial relations for perceived political purposes rather than to make a deliberate and considered approach to it calculated to try to reduce the number of disputes and increase the possibility of the existing machinery dealing with those disputes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have just heard from the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) establishes that, far from people on this side of the chamber being the confrontationists in industrial relations, it is people such as the honourable member for Wills, with the views which they represent, who are the confrontationists. All that he has said with regard to the removal of jurisdiction of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with respect to preference and deregistration of State unions presupposes that he, those behind him and those belonging to the union movement believe it is the right of the union movement consistently to dispute and disrupt the orderly flow of trade and commerce of this nation. We need an institution to settle disputes only when we believe that one or other of the parties involved in labour relations will create disputes. Of course, this is the whole fallacy of the attitude of the union movement to industrial relations in Australia. One sees that through the declared policy of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. They declare in the most unambiguous terms the absolute and untrammelled right to strike and embark upon industrial action. That is the threshold of the creation of industrial disputes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is required in Australia is not a change of attitude by members on this side of the chamber-the Liberal and National Country Party side of the chamber. What is required is a change of attitude within the Labor Party and the union movement as to what is required for peace and good government in industrial relations. If only the the union movement would accept that it has an obligation to the people of Australia to see that the life-blood of the prosperity of Australia-that is, the free flow of trade and commerce of this nation-is important then we would have a much better industrial relations climate. In dealing with clause 4 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill the honourable member for Wills made reference to the use of the corporations power and the trade and commerce power of the Constitution. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE6">Mr VINER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the banking power and the insurance power, where it is necessary to draw on them. I remind the honourable gentleman that the amendments which this Government introduced to the Trade Practices Act, by way of section 45D in particular, were based on the use of the corporations and trade and commerce power. Section 45D is directed to the use of secondary boycotts by the union movement against employers in order to throttle them commercially, to put them under commercial pressure to further what is said to be the legitimate industrial interests of the trade movement. It has been a very important legislative provision which has aided employers when they have been threatened in that way. There have been a number of instances in which companies have resorted in the civil courts of this land, under section 45D, to seek legal remedies against the use by unions of the secondary boycott as an industrial weapon. That has been used, and used effectively. One thing is very clear and that is that the union movement in Australia will do its very best to prevent the courts of this land from showing that unions are subject to the law in the same way as anybody else, whether an individual or a corporate. We believe that the use of the corporations and the trade and commerce power under the Trade Practices Act has been important and to the benefit of this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Likewise, when unions demand the free and untrammelled right to strike or to take industrial action irrespective of the commercial interests of the company concerned, or the personal interests of the employees of that company, it is important to give employers some rights which will equalise both the bargaining position and their position within the industry of this nation. It is quite understandable and quite proper for this Government to have sought to draw on the corporations and the trade and commerce power available to it under the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> The other comment I make is that by clause 5 we have withdrawn from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission jurisdiction to act in certain areas. Of course, notably in the area of preference, we have given legal rights to the individual. The important thing in this situation is for an individual to have a legal remedy available if he is harmed or injured by the industrial action of a union which seeks to discriminate or victimise him because he does not wish to join a union. We have given such persons that legal remedy by giving them access to the Federal Court of Australia to sue for any loss or damage that they may suffer by being denied, for example, the opportunity to work or the opportunity for promotion because of discrimination or victimisation by a union. The answer to the honourable gentleman is that, whilst jurisdiction is withdrawn from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, it is given to the Federal Court of Australia to entertain suits at the hand of an individual who is deliberately harmed or injured in his right to work, right to promotion or right to continue in work when he does not wish to join a union. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), in his remarks regarding this clause, mentioned the interest of the Australian Labor Party in maintaining people's right to work. That is exactly what we are doing in this Parliament. We are trying to get the Minister and his buddies off the Treasury benches so that we can put half a million Australians back to work. That is a principal consideration of the Labor Party. But let us get back to the disputes and the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that is withdrawn by this clause 5. By taking disputes out of the conciliation area and putting them under the jurisdiction of the High Court the Minister intends to create disputes. That in itself would not be so bad because disputes can be resolved so long as they remain in the industrial area. But how will a dispute be resolved when people will maintain their right to withdraw their work and not to work with scabs? The scabs will then go to the High Court, take the matter to a completely different arena, and try to find redress there. An unsolvable dispute will be created. The High Court will not settle industrial disputes in this country. Traditionally industrial disputes are settled not by learned lawyers such as those sitting opposite but by people aware of the realities of the job. Lawyers get thousands of dollars; they do not care. A High Court action by a few scabs and provocateurs placed somewhere to create a strike results in a banquet for lawyers. But thousands and thousands of dollars will be lost in wages and hundreds of thousands of dollars lost in production. That is what this clause will do.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 6 is one of the central features of the proposed legislation. It is one to which, on behalf of the Opposition, I indicate our strongest possible opposition. To put it briefly, clause 6 introduces a new section into the Act, section 33B, which confers very extensive powers on employers to penalise employees taking part in what is described as industrial action or who cannot be usefully employed as a result of industrial action. It is absolutely certain-there can be no question or argument about this-that the proposed new section will give rise to practical and legal problems for employers who seek to make use of it. I remind the Committee of what I said at the second reading stage-that sections of the employers were so strong in their objection to the proposals, and so percipient of the difficulties that could arise, that they insisted with the Government that the existing stand-down provisions in the legislation should remain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is appropriate that I should spend a little more time than I was able to devote at the second reading stage in pointing out the difficulties and the problems associated with the proposals contained in the clause. It is an extreme provision which provides employers who are silly enough to try to use it with very extensive powers to penalise employees. As has been pointed out, it is not tempered with appropriate safeguards for the rights of employees who may be affected. This certainly is likely to lead to industrial disputation about the use of the power. As I pointed out, it is not necessary to bring in this legislation because, under the law as it stands now, there is a power for employers to get stand-downs. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Opposition, and on behalf of the trade union movement, I make it quite clear that we are not saying that there may not be circumstances in which an employer should be entitled to seek a stand-down. They have that right now. It can be done in one of two ways. A general power to stand down has been in the metal industry award for a very long time. Also, there can be a more particular approach by an employer to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It may be that there can be some argument that the Government could have been told that, in respect of those existing powers, where the employer has to go to an independent tribunal and justify his argument for standing down employees-after all, denying people a livelihood is a very significant thing-the experience is that as the law stands now too much delay is involved. If that had been the case, and we had been made aware of it, that would have been a legitimate matter to ask this Parliament to consider. There has not been a scintilla of evidence to suggest that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of dealing with what may be a real position, an entirely provocative and very extreme measure has been introduced. The proposed powers in clause 6 extend beyond so-called stand-down powers. In relation to employees engaged in industrial action, a declaration under section 33B may allow an employer to apply the 'no work as directed no pay' principle. Employees who place a ban on the performance of certain duties, for example, because of safety considerations , but who continue to perform all their other duties, will not be entitled to any wages for the entire period that the ban continues. Of course the result in those circumstances is that an employee may be put in a no pay position almost at the whim of his or her employer. </PARA>
<PARA> I again remind the Committee of the circumstances that I referred to in an earlier debate of what happened in the Latrobe Valley in regard to the Loy Yang situation on 12 February and 20 February. The men stopped work because of a severe industrial accident on two successive occasions. They took the view that the responsibility for those accidents, which caused serious injury to an employee, was the employers who had shown extreme derelection of duty by not abiding by the procedures to which he had previously agreed. The men stopped work because not merely the safety but also the lives of men were involved in this issue. Subsequently their action was shown to be justified by the employer who, in fact, indicated that he had to accept the responsibility. The men who used industrial action in that form were paid for the period involved. That illustrates not merely the absurdity but also the immorality of the situation that has been launched into this House. </PARA>
<PARA> All that is being done is that an employer is being given the power to declare that there is industrial action and he cannot employ people despite the fact that they may have continued to do all their normal work but decline to use some piece of equipment because it was endangering the lives and safety of themselves and their fellow workers. An employer is being given the autonomous right to declare that he is being affected in this way and to deny any pay to his employees who are in that situation. The extreme powers given to employers are not tempered by any reasonable safeguards accorded to employees concerned. For example, there is no provision for hearing before an impartial tribunal such as the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which must be held under the way in which the existing provisions apply. There is no provision for appeal to be taken on the merits of the making of a declaration unilaterally and autonomously by an employer. </PARA>
<PARA> Even where the relevant industrial action was caused by the employer concerned the employer may make full use of the powers under section 34B to protect himself against the consequences of the Action and to penalise his employees. There is no requirement that an employer notify an employee before the declaration has the effect of disentitling the employee to wages. An employee may continue to work, or attend for work, even though by virtue of a declaration of which he has no notice he will not be paid for such work or attendance. There will be scope for challenging the use of section 33B powers in the courts due to the complicated procedures provided under the section. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we have a situation which has worked. Not one scintilla of evidence has been put to this House which shows that those provisions which involve the utilisation of the independent and impartial Arbitration Commission, where the employer can argue his case for a stand down provision, are not working or why, if that is the case, there should not be some improvement in facilitating the exercise in that situation. After all the very guts-if I can put it that way-of what the conciliation and arbitration system is about is that if an employer has a case, or if a worker and a union have a case, let them argue it. In the case of a stand down, if employers cannot usefully engage employees, because of an existing situation, time after time it has been shown that the Commission will grant the case. Here we are opening up a situation where workers would have to take action to defend their safety. The provision can be used by a maverick, malicious or thoughtless employer to bring about a situation where lives will be put at risk without any possibility of a hearing before an impartial tribunal. I suggest on an impartial examination of this matter there can be no justification for this drastic change from a system which has worked reasonably well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe there is a very short but compelling answer to the proposition of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) that the right to stand down must necessarily be subject to the determination of an independent and impartial body. Of course the union movement will not allow itself to be subject to an independent and impartial judgment before it determines that it should strike or embark upon industrial action. Industrial policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, as passed at its 1981 Congress, declares the right of unions and unionists to take industrial action. The policy of the Australian Labor Party is to the same effect. It is a rather hollow argument by the honourabe member for Wills to demand that an employer, who is suffering commercial harm because of the industrial action of others who may not even be employed in that employer's plant, must go to what he calls an independent and impartial body. However the ALP denies positively, unequivocally and consistently that no such control mechanism should be put upon the industrial action of unions. As I have said, the honourable gentleman's argument is hollow and the Government believes that employers of this country should be put in at least as equal a position as we, as a Government, can through the legislation of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's position on this matter could be misunderstood by the general public if it was made aware of the fact that a large number of awards currently have stand down provisions. An earlier speaker referred to the metal industries as being one of the key areas where there are alleged to be industrial problems. There have been stand down provisions in the metal industries award for some considerable time. I think it is important that the provisions be referred to here. They are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Notwithstanding anything elsewhere contained in this clause:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The employer shall have the right to deduct payment for any day the employee cannot be usefully employed because of any strike or through any breakdown in machinery or any stoppage of work by any cause for which the employer cannot reasonably be held responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no doubt that a large section of the public listening to the Government's rantings on this question would not be aware that unions have had to cope with these provisions for a long time. There have been numerous occasions when employers have used these provisions in a very capricious way to turn worker against worker. Workers in one section who make claims in respect of wages or conditions have been virtually blackmailed by employers through the threat of standing down thousands of production workers. This scenario is well known in the car manufacturing industry and is used constantly by employers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get the balance correct. If one were to listen to the current Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) one would think that it was the unions which needed discipline. I suggest that it is the employers who need discipline. This morning the current Minister handed down the twenty-fifth annual report of the President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for the year ended 13 August 1981. It is convenient that the document was handed down today because it is worth reading. The document puts the lie to the rubbish that we have heard here from this Minister and the five, or is it four, henchmen behind him who have attempted to support him. The document contains a table which deals with the notification of disputes under section 25 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. According to that table 1,772 dispute notifications were made to the Commission. We are informed that there were only 27 stand downs. I ask honourable members to compare 27 stand downs with a total of 1,772 dispute notifications. How can the Government suggest that there are great problems in the real industrial world in respect of employers and employees when its own report shows that there were 27 notifications of disputes under the stand down provisions out of a total of 1,772? I suggest that the current Minister and the Government are not serious or genuine. They are merely union bashing, as they have been doing for some considerable time. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to place the seriousness of this problem in perspective. Unions often go into a dispute with an employer over safety issues or accidents. I have had 12 years' practical experience, not on $1,000 a day as a rich lawyer but working in a factory with workers and dealing with these kinds of problems. I have had to go into factories after people have been killed. The Minister thinks this is funny. This Minister is irresponsible because he is totally one eyed anti-union-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the honourable member to be quiet. I ask that you, Mr Chairman, instruct the Minister to cease smiling and laughing humorously about a very serious matter. He still thinks it funny. I will ignore the clown who is currently the Minister and deal with the very serious situation which exists when unions go into a dispute and employers invoke the stand down provisions which currently are found in many awards. Many unions go into a dispute because there has been an accident, often a fatal accident. If this Government is serious about the economy and about trying to get things moving it will deal with this problem in a serious way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to a report in the Australian of 24 March this year which deals with the situation to which I have referred of employers using stand down provisions following a dispute with unions. I will read this not for the benefit of the Minister, who seems to think this matter is humorous, but in the hope that the young people in the public gallery, who may be fortunate enough soon to have a job, will start to realise the kinds of problems that unions and honourable members on this side of the chamber have in trying to protect the interests and health of workers. The article in the Australian states:</PARA>
<PARA> Industrial accidents are costing more than the national defence bill, according to a safety expert. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian president of the National Safety Council, Mr Max Eise, claims that the cost of work injuries will exceed the defence bill of $3,540 million.</PARA>
<PARA> He predicts the national bill for workers' compensation will be as high as $ 5000 million this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> This figure includes workers' compensation premiums paid by employers, claims for loss of production due to work injuries, and medical costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Eise said yesterday: 'There are more than 500,000 serious injuries at work across Australia each year. Ninety per cent of these are avoidable'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the kind of situation that union officials, shop stewards and workers have to face day in, day out. I ask the Minister to take those figures into his thick head if he can. We are talking about half a million workers being seriously injured each year. It costs $5 billion. These are the kinds of issues that cause disputes. I have been in situations in which employers have acted capriciously and used such a situation as an excuse to stand down or threaten to stand down thousands of production workers. An employer takes such action when a small group of tradesmen, perhaps, goes into a dispute because of serious situation in a factory. The company concerned threatens to stand down 1,000 or 2 ,000 workers. One could fill this chamber with headlines and stories from newspapers of threats, in particular by car companies, to stand down 1,000 to 2, 000 workers if a dispute is not resolved. This is the kind of situation we are faced with all the time. I think the Government's argument has been hollow-it has been shown to be hollow. This legislation is merely a further exercise in the Government's union bashing campaign. This action will get it nowhere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support briefly the remarks on this clause made by speakers from this side of the chamber. In many ways, having any sort of conciliation and arbitration Act in this country is something of an anachronism if we are to be compared with equivalent nations. That we can have that system at all depends to a very considerable extent on an acceptance by both sides that the legislation brought in under those various heads of the Constitution is to be applied equitably. If that conviction does not exist there will be one of two results: Either the clauses that are not perceived as equitable by all sides will be totally ignored or those clauses for a period will themselves be the source of very considerable industrial dispute. This is one of the clauses in the Bill to which I think the second of those two possibilities applies. After the second of those two possibilities has applied for a considerable period probably the first will apply. After an experience of utilising this power, after those employers who use it see in the end that what it has created for them is more loss and more trouble than it is worth, probably this power will fall into disuse. Probably it will not have the amount of time that would be required for it to be exercised, as unquestionably it will be one of the things in this Act that will be amended by a Labor government on taking office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the question of equity which has been raised. There is no way that the trade union movement could regard this particular clause as an equitable act and as a contribution to the equity of the arbitration system. The trade union movement must see it as a direct attack upon itself. The clause includes, if one likes, a legalisation of lock-outs. It gives to an employer a unilateral power. There are very few sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which give anybody unilateral powers. This clause will give such power to one side in industrial disputes. It sits on this Bill like a carbuncle and, like a carbuncle , it will be lanced by the Labor Party when we get into office. </PARA>
<PARA> As has already been pointed out by spokesmen on this side of the chamber, ample provision exists in awards and ample access to the Arbitration Court for employers to stand down workers where they have a serious economic need to do so . Those provisions exist in awards-even though there is a considerable degree of objection to the exercise of those awards, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott), who spoke before me in this debate, said-largely because when they have been put into those awards they have evolved as part of a process of bargaining over time between the unions in a particular industry and the management in a particular industry. They have applicability to those industries because through what is essentially an organic process that is not readily subject to law in reality-that is, the system of industrial relations-there has been, if not agreement, at least acquiesence from both sides that both sides can live with the various provisions of those awards until perhaps a distribution of power that occurs naturally within the industry shifts or changes and those sections of the awards are removed. So, they have an acceptability. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an imposition from outside the system. It is an imposition from a body- the Government-which, if it has any value at all in the system of government, should be an essentially harmonising influence. Essentially, any intervention that it makes in a dispute should be constructive intervention. Its laws should be constructive. Its laws should seriously contribute to the harmony of industry . This clause will not do that. This clause will be a provocation. It may well be used in a period when the workers in a particular industry are weak. It will probably cause considerable grief to those employers who use it over a period. When those employers who use it understand that, they will cease to use it and it will become redundant. In the meantime, the general public will have suffered a great deal as a result of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the more objectionable features of the debate up to this stage has been the gratuitous observations of the transient Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) to the Labor Party about the attitude that it should adopt towards industrial relations and the proposals in this legislation in particular. I remind the Minister that he made his second reading speech prior to the Victorian State election. The people of Victoria have certainly had an opportunity to take into account, in their considerations of the political scene, the relative proposals and approach of the Government, the conservative parties, and of the Labor Party on this issue. There could not have been handed down a more decisive verdict than theirs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provisions in clause 7 taken in association with those in clause 20 are basically the most objectionable features of this legislation because they involve a complete turnaround of the fundamental principles that have been involved in the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act since its inception in 1904. The fundamental of the system of conciliation and arbitration has been that it operates upon organisations, not upon idividuals; that is, organisations of employees and organisations of employers. As I pointed out in my speech on the second reading, an essential feature of giving effect to that has been section 47, or its equivalent, since 1904, which has given power and indeed instruction to the Arbitration Court, as it then was, and to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission subsequently, to use the instrument of awarding preference to unionists as a way-one way-of strengthening the organisations which are at the very basis of the operation of the conciliation and arbitration system. As I indicated, that system has operated for almost 80 years, and it is futile in the extreme for a couple of honourable members to get up, as they have done in this debate, and say that the fact that it has been there for 80 years does not mean that it is sacrosanct and that, really, we are being very conservative in asking for something to remain in the Act simply because it has existed for 80 years. That reveals the futility of mind of those who have contributed to the debate from the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Our argument is not that one should retain the provision simply because it has existed for 80 years. Of course, one examines why it has been there, what have been the purposes of its being there, how it has been used, and how it has been interpreted by the Commission and the High Court. When one subjects to examination a provision that has existed for 80 years, and which has recomended itself to governments of different persuasions, and when one asks oneself why it has stayed there and relates one's question to those particular issues, one sees precisely why it has been kept. One would have thought that if the Government comes before this House and says: 'We shall take out a provision which has been there for the best part of 80 years', that one would be provided with some argument as to why that should be done. </PARA>
<PARA> No argument has been put, except the pitiful, plaintive proposition that this move represents Liberal Party philosophy. As I have said, that philosophy had ample chance of being judged by the second most populous State on 3 April, and a very decisive mandate was given to the Labor Party, which, as part of what it was putting to the people of that State, adopted the opposite proposals and the opposite philosophy to that which is embodied in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> One point I make in passing is that what this legislation will do is take away from the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission a very important power in regard to the settlement of a particular sort of dispute, which is acknowledged by everyone who knows anything about industrial relations as being the most pernicious sort of industrial dispute-the demarcation dispute. Everyone who knows anything about the scene knows that the demarcation dispute is the worst sort of dispute. The way in which arbitration tribunals have in the past often dealt with the settlement of such disputes is to award the work to a particular union, which involves, in its essence, the provision of preference to members of a particular union. This provision will make it more difficult. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's action in repealing this section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act indicates what Liberal philosophy has become, more than what it is. It indicates the substantial and substantive move to the extreme right by the Liberal Party throughout the nation. Only when a government has gone beyond the pale in terms of trying to create industrial confrontation will it introduce a clause such as it has introduced to repeal this important section.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As regards the preference that has been given to unionists, we have heard much from the Minister about the consciences of people who do not want to become members of unions. But the fact is that it is the unionists who have been fighting and struggling for better conditions for all workers. What the section does is to recognise that fact in law before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. If one removes that situation, one is basically saying that those people who have fought for the rights of workers, the unionists and the union movement, are to be demoted before the Commission, and that all those people, those who have not participated in the struggle, those who have not been members of a union, are to be treated in exactly the same way before the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> How will this work in practical terms? As the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) mentioned, this section is extremely important in demarcation disputes, because at present the Commission can resolve those disputes by saying that a particular union has preference for a particular type of work. By repealing this section we shall be creating a situation in which any group or association can claim to be the particular union responsible for a particular type of work. We shall create conflicts between workers. This Government wants that, because it wants to create an atmosphere of industrial confrontation in order to have some basis-it has no other basis, in terms of its record-to try to win an election. The people will judge the Government on the basis of its creation of conflict and crisis which will arise as a result of the clause. </PARA>
<PARA> This clause ties up with clause 10, which concerns industry-based unions. I am sure that other honourable members will talk about the absurdity of that. However, one can see how the two clauses relate. With clause 10 we shall get not industry-based unions but a situation in which groups of workers will be confronting other groups of workers, with different groups claiming to represent the rightful owners of a particular type of work. So what will the Arbitration Commission do in these instances? It will not be able to do anything in these instances because by our removing section 47 it will not be able to give preference to particular unions and there will be chaos in the industrial relations scene. The fact is that, as the honourable member for Wills has mentioned, this clause has served us for 80 years. I know that some of the people opposite totally oppose this legislation but they do not have the guts to stand up and be counted. These provisions will create an industrial relations atmosphere the like of which we have never seen in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations has been trying to save his neck by coming up with some provisions which neither the employers nor the unions want. This is one of those clauses that neither group wants. The employers want to know who they are dealing with. When this section is removed different groups of workers, unionised and non-unionised, will be able to go to the court and say: ' We represent this type of work; we are the proper group that you should be dealing with in regard to the awards'. Chaos will be created as a result of this and we totally oppose the abolition of this section. </PARA>

After having listened to some of the pearls that have dropped from the other side I am compelled to make one or two comments. First of all, it would appear that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) finally has come to the realisation that one of the most pernicious problems that plague this country is demarcation disputes in industry. There is no doubt that that is so, and the waterfront situation illustrates it. What is offered in place of that? What has been put up by the Australian Council of Trade Unions? What has been done, for example, to sort out the waterfront? Nothing at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member would well know, amalgamation provisions create things like the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union. If the honourable member does not know that he should not be here and should not be speaking on this subject. Let us put that to one side. One of the things that is just a little troubling to a charitable person like myself, who listens to what has been said by the other side and takes the view that we are all Australians and we all have a common interest in trying to improve things, is that time and again people talk about the union movement. Is there anybody on the other side who is not afraid to speak against what is considered to be the view of the union movement? I freely concede that we err from time to time. Do honourable members opposite not concede that in matters of principle they might err from time to time; that from time to time they have acted out of nothing less than fear of the consequences as a result of the tie to their political affiliations? I give an example of the industrial realities of preference clauses. I do not say that it is always wrong to have a preference clause. I do say that there is a very strong argument against such clauses, based on two principles. First of all, we have the principle of the freedom of choice.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JJ4">Mr SPENDER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an answer to what the honourable member for Willis has in mind. The freedom of choice concerns the philosophy that a person should be entitled to choose who he wants to work for. Why should a person have to be a member of a union if he does not want to be? A person may be in favour of unions or against unions but surely it is fair that he should have an opportunity to decide for himself. Secondly, I give an example relating to the uranium mining industry in the Northern Territory. I doubt very much that honourable members opposite will listen but those who know anything about it will know well what the position is. There was for many years a dispute between two unions, one of which I represented, the Australian Workers Union, about who would be entitled to build the mines and to mine in the Northern Territory. In the end it was a question of whether or not one union should be allowed effective control over mining operations. Do honourable members opposite think that is fair? Do they think that that is the answer to Australian industrial life? Do they think that the right way to go about things is to say: 'Look, fellows, it is a very simple choice; you can decide for yourselves. I emphasise that this is a completely free choice. Either you join us or you don't work'. Is that what the Opposition stands for? If it is, it should put out that message loud and clear to the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>

It can be seen only as a move by the Government to cater for the Lathams of this world. These are the freaks who believe that everyone is out of step except them. These industrial mavericks are usually the very first to put their hand out for wage increases, for more annual leave, sick leave and all of the other benefits gained by unions when they are able to speak with one voice for the workers that they represent. This is truly anti-union legislation. The proposition that the Government is floating regarding the elimination of preference flies in the face of-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point to the current Act and especially the provisions of section 47 , since they deal with the preference clause that the Government intends to delete. Sub-section (3) of that section also deals with another matter that is about to come up-I refer to section 144A-so it is very relevant. Maybe it is a question of these people not wanting to have their position exposed. It cannot be stressed too hard and often that unions have to prove their case before the Commission in order to obtain a preference clause to have unionists or workers united under the one union, or unions, as prescribed by the Commission. In fact, the Act also makes provision for those who have a conscientious belief so they too are covered.</PARA></TALK.START>

What Cawthorne has said flies in the face of the proposition that is being put by the Government. He is a highly respected person. He conducted an independent inquiry over 14 months. He was not appointed by a Labor government. His credentials are impeccable. He has brought down the view that it would be far better for industrial relations and harmony in the work place if in fact the Commission had the power. This is the relevant point: The unions still have to go through the Commission, they have to present their arguments, in front of lawyers who are on $1,000 a day, to prove their case. In those circumstances preference should be available to them. I think it is relevant to this clause. Thank you, Mr Chairman.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak only briefly to clause 10, which concerns the formation of industry-based unions. The question is: What will be the result of this amendment? Will it result in the kind of rational structure which the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) spoke about? It certainly will not. It will result in an increase in the number of unions; that is, of course, if it works at all. I think there is good reason to believe that there is no way in which it can work. It is a totally impractical and absurd proposition. But even if it is able to work it will divide the union movement and create more unions. There will be enormous squabbles. The Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will have to decide questions such as: What is to count as an industry under the Act?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), the Bill defines 'an industry' for the purpose of registration of an industry union as the business, trade, manufacture, undertaking or calling of employers. If honourable members opposite can make sense of that they are better than I am. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had more training in conceptual and linguistic matters than most honourable members opposite have had. I challenge any honourable member to give the Committee a coherent explanation of what an industry is supposed to be. What will happen is that the Commission will be faced with all kinds of complex questions in deciding what is an industry. This clause will have to be read in conjunction with another clause, which is very important. That clause provides that the Commission will determine that in fact it is a majority or a significant majority of members of the union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us suppose, for example, that the steel industry in a particular city wants to be defined as an industry. Is the Commission to consider that as one industry or will it consider the steel industry throughout Australia as one industry? There are no guidelines on this. There is no way of determining whether it is one industry or many industries. What will be the position in respect of the steel industry in the same city? Will the steel industry in the western suburbs of Melbourne count as one industry and the steel industry in the southern suburbs count as another industry? There is absolutely no coherent process whereby the Commission will be able to determine what is an industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government were serious about creating a more rational union structure and an evolutionary process towards more industry-based unions, it would have introduced legislation and it would have followed up that legislation for the general amalgamation of unions, rather than adopting this process which seeks to create new unions by pinching members from different unions and putting them together in such a way that it will create chaos and confusion. What the Minister has done in this provision is to put an onerous burden on the Commission. I am surprised that the lawyers opposite who have read these clauses have not raised the sorts of objections that we have mentioned. They, using their legal minds, have chosen to refer only to certain matters and to ignore other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite obvious from the definition of 'industry' that there will be total confusion. Groups in the community will think that they can set up a union simply because they consider themselves to be an industry under the definition in the Act. They will find they are not an industry. What will be the process that is to be followed in forming such a group in the first place? Are they supposed to go to members of existing unions and say: 'Look, Joe and Fred, you sign this and we will form a new industry union'? Honourable members can see that such a process will create enormous strife and tensions within the union movement. Of course, that is the very intention of the Government. As I mentioned earlier, the Government cannot go to the people on its record. It is seeking to create industrial disruption in order to divide the nation. It will try to blame this on the Australian Labor Party, but we will stand on our record . We oppose these provisions. They will not work and we will be able to say in a few months: 'We told you so'. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members by now will be familiar with the practice of introducing an omnibus miscellaneous amendments Bill during each period of sittings of the Parliament as an expeditious way of making amendments of a non-controversial character to a large number of Acts. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) said in another place on 25 November 1981 that, provided this form of legislation is properly confined to non-controversial matters, it is a convenient way of approaching the situation. That has been the guiding principle in preparing the present Bill. The short title of the Bill has been numbered No. 1 to indicate that a further omnibus Bill will, in the normal course, be introduced later this year in the Budget sittings. The numbering takes up a useful suggestion to this effect made by the Opposition in this House on 17 November 1981, when the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1981 was being debated. Some of the amendments are made by the Bill to correct printing or drafting errors. Others make drafting or other technical amendments. These provisions do not call for particular comment. Other provisions go into matters of sustance in varying degrees. I propose to explain in some detail the nature and effect of those provisions. In addition, a detailed explanatory memorandum covering all the clauses of the Bill has been circulated. </PARA>
<PARA>ACTS INTERPRETATION ACT 1901</PARA>
<PARA> In a statement to the Senate on 26 May 1981, the Attorney-General advised that the Government has decided to give effect to a member of recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances on matters relating to parliamentary disallowance of delegated legislation. The amendments proposed by the Bill to the Acts Interpretation Act give effect to two of those recommendations. One is to ensure that upon the dissolution of the House of Representatives, after a notice of motion for disallowance of a regulation is given in the Senate, the regulation shall be deemed to have been tabled on the first sitting day of the Senate after the dissolution of the House of Representatives. The amendments in paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 4 of the Bill have that effect. The other matter is to provide that on the disallowance of a regulation which repeals, in whole or in part, an earlier regulation the repealed regulation will be revived from and including the date of disallowance of the repealing regulation. This is dealt with by paragraph (c) of clause 4 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) also deals with another matter. In the course of its preparation a question was raised, whether the effect of sub-section 48 (3) of the Acts Interpretation Act upon a failure to lay regulations before each House of Parliament as required by paragraph 48 (1) (c) is to make such regulations void ab initio. If it did, any rights or obligations which accrued under the regulations between the date of making the regulation and the final date for tabling would be lost. The Bill clarifies this situation by amending sub-section 48 (6) to ensure that, upon the voiding of a regulation under sub-section 48 (3) , the regulation is regarded as having been repealed. The provisions of section 50, in relation to the repeal of regulations, would then apply. The principles contained in these amendments have also been applied by this Bill to the tabling of ordinances and other instruments of a legislative character under the following Acts: Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act 1933, Australian Antarctic Territory Act 1954, Christmas Island Act 1958, Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955, Coral Sea Islands Act 1969, Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act 1978, Heard Island and McDonald Islands Act 1953, Norfolk Island Act 1979, and Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention that the Bill applies sections 48, 49 and 50 of the Acts Interpretation Act to rules of court by the High Court, the Federal Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. These amendments are also intended to give effect to the general policy referred to by the Attorney-General in the Senate on 26 May 1981 that there should be uniform application of the provisions of Part XII of the Acts Interpretation Act in relation to the tabling and disallowance of statutory instruments. It is considered that such provisions should also apply in the case of rules of court. The amendments to this effect are contained in clauses 67, 155 and 161 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL ACT 1975</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes a number of changes to the membership structure of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to the provisions governing the mode of operation of the Tribunal. The changes reflect the growing status of the Tribunal and its increasing work load. Many of the changes will give effect to recommendations of the Administrative Review Council and proposals of the President of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal now has jurisdiction to review decisions made under more than 100 statutes. It covers decisions in fields such as social security, immigration, repatriation, Commonwealth employees' compensation, patents, Customs, air navigation, superannuation and export grants. The Tribunal's case load grew from 227 in 1979-80 to 652 in 1980-81 mainly because of additions to its jurisdiction of social security and Commonwealth employees' compensation matters. Its case load is expected to increase substantially in the current financial year. The already increased work load and the further increases expected from the freedom of information legislation have highlighted the need to make changes in the membership structure of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the main purposes of the changes now proposed is to rationalise the membership structure of the Tribunal, having regard to the role played on the Tribunal by judges of the Federal Court of Australia. Although both judges and non-judges may now be appointed as Deputy Presidents, in fact, only judges of the Federal Court have been so appointed. The Act as it stands does not distinguish between the roles of judges and of non-judges. The judges of the Federal Court who have been appointed as Deputy Presidents have played a valuable role, particularly in some areas of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. With the increasing work load of the Tribunal it is necessary to have additional members of Deputy President status but there is, of course, a limit to the extent to which judges of the Federal Court can devote time to sitting on the Tribunal. Consequently, one purpose of the proposed amendments made by clauses 8 , 9 and 40 will be to distinguish those presidential members who are judges from Deputy Presidents who are not judges, and to reserve certain critical powers for presidential members who are judges. At the same time, the Bill recognises the existing practice of appointing a judge of the Federal Court as President of the Tribunal, by requiring that the President shall be a judge of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA> The greater part of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is, in fact, exercised by the senior non-presidential members, either sitting alone or as chairman of panels of the Tribunal. Full time senior members are presently appointed for terms of years only. It is now proposed that full time senior members be appointed to the age of 65 years, to emphasise their independence in performing their functions on the Tribunal. That is clause 10. Further, the role of the senior member in dealing with questions of law requires that he ordinarily have legal qualifications. This is recognised in the amendments made by clause 9. Provision is to be made by clauses 14 and 38 for those members appointed to the Tribunal in future to take an appropriate oath of office, to mark the importance of the jurisdiction they will exercise. The present complete bar on outside employment by full time members of the Tribunal is to be replaced by a provision expressly authorising service with the Defence Force, and permitting other employment to be undertaken with ministerial approval. That is clause 15. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 22 of the Bill makes certain changes regarding statements of reasons under section 28 of the Act. First, the Tribunal is to be empowered to review a refusal by a decision-maker to give a statement of reasons for a decision when requested to do so under section 28 of the Act. The Tribunal is also to be empowered to review the sufficiency of a section 28 statement. Secondly, a number of other changes to section 28 will bring it, so far as appropriate, into line with the equivalent provision in section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. In future, a certificate by the Attorney-General preventing disclosure of certain material in a section 28 statement will not result, as at present, in the whole statement being withheld, but only so much of the statement as is covered by the certificate. The whole statement may be withheld only where omission of the matter covered by the certificate would render the statement false or misleading. The working of the Tribunal will be aided by the provisions giving the President a wider power of delegation (clause 13), authorising a wider class of members to exercise interlocutory powers ( clause 17) and to give procedural directions (clause 26). The agreement of all the parties will no longer be required to the holding of a preliminary conference (clause 27). </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 25 of the Bill will empower the Attorney-General to intervene in proceedings before the Tribunal where the Commonwealth has a special interest in the proceedings and would wish to put argument on relevant matters to the Tribunal. Provision is made for payment by the Commonwealth of any increase in costs attributable to such an intervention. The Act provides for the President of the Tribunal to rule on certain claims by the Attorney-General to privilege in respect of documents and oral evidence. Because this jurisdiction is given at present to the President as such, and not to the Tribunal constituted by the President, the right of appeal to the Federal Court from a decision of the Tribunal does not apply to such a ruling. The effect of clauses 30 and 31 of the Bill will be to vest the power to make such a ruling in the Tribunal which will be required, for this purpose, to be constituted by a judge of the Federal Court . </PARA>
<PARA> It is often convenient for the Tribunal to be able to hand down a decision, with oral reasons for the decision, without the delay involved in the preparation of a written statement. As the Act now stands, it is doubtful whether this may be done, even where a written statement is provided later. Accordingly, clause 33 of the Bill empowers the Tribunal to give either oral or written reasons at the time it hands down a decision. If it does not then give written reasons, it must do so if requested to do so by a party to the proceedings. This provision is designed to avoid delays that now occur in the decision of the Tribunal being available in those cases where it has come to a conclusion at the end of the hearing, but must now delay the handing down of the decision until reasons for the decision have been reduced to writing. The change will be of particular benefit in many social security cases, where an early decision is desirable. The remaining amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act are largely consequential to those I have already mentioned, or make minor changes to facilitate the working of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>AGED PERSONS HOSTELS ACT 1972</PARA>
<PARA> Part IV of the Bill amends the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972, which is to become known as the Aged or Disabled Persons Hostels Act 1972. The key amendment is made by paragraph (a) of clause 45, which amends section 5 of the Act to extend to disabled persons as well as to aged persons. The amendments will enable organisations to accommodate disabled persons in hostels originally approved or constructed with grants under the Act for accommodation of aged persons only. Accordingly, the amendments also provide that where an organisation has made an agreement with the Director-General of Social Services undertaking to continue to use a hostel as a home for aged persons only, the undertaking will be deemed to have been given with respect to continued use of the hostel as a home for persons who are aged or disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments will bring the Act into line with the major legislation in the Government's program to house aged and disabled persons, the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954, which was amended in 1974 to extend its coverage to disabled persons. The amendments will allow organisations greater flexibility in the operation of homes funded under both Acts 'under the one roof' and will materially assist disabled persons in those areas, especially in the country, where the only available form of specialised accommodation is a hostel built with a grant under the Aged Persons Hostels Act. Introduction of these matters of substance also affords an opportunity to make a number of formal amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY SUPREME COURT ACT 1933</PARA>
<PARA> Part VIII of the Bill makes several significant amendments to the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933. First, the designation of the Chief Judge of the Court is changed to 'Chief Justice'. This brings the designation into line with the Supreme Court of all the States and the Northern Territory. Secondly, clause 65 makes it clear that a judge of the Federal Court of Australia who is appointed to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory is not entitled to double salary. His primary salary entitlement will continue to arise from his Federal Court appointment. Provision, however, is made to ensure that, if the Supreme Court entitlements exceed his Federal Court entitlements, he will receive the higher amount and ensures that if the salary or annual allowances to which he would be entitled as a judge of the Court exceeds the salary and annual allowance by which he is remunerated as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia, he shall receive as a judge of the Court, an additional amount by way of salary or annual allowances equal to the excess. </PARA>
<PARA>AMENDMENTS OF THE CO-OPERATIVE COMPANIES AND SECURITIES SCHEME</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by Parts XV, XVI, XXVII and XXXVI relate to the package of legislation which comprises the co-operative companies and securities scheme. On 22 December 1978 the Commonwealth and the six States executed a formal agreement that provided the framework for a co-operative Commonwealth-State scheme for a uniform system of law and administration in relation to company law and the regulation of the securities industry in the six States and the Australian Capital Territory. A copy of the Agreement is set out in the Schedule to the National Companies and Securities Commission Act 1979. Clause 8 (1) (a) of the Agreement provides that the Commonwealth will submit to this Parliament legislation which has been unanimously agreed by the Ministrial Council for Companies and Securities, and shall take such steps as are appropriate to secure the passage of the legislation. The relevant amendments in these Parts have been unanimously approved by the Ministrial Council only after detailed discussion and consideration. Also, the amendments are of a kind considered appropriate for inclusion in the Miscellaneous Amendments Bill. The effect of the particular amendments is set out in detail in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated. I draw attention to the following features. </PARA>
<PARA>COMPANIES ACT 1981</PARA>
<PARA> Under the amendments of the Companies Act made by Part XV of the Bill, the provisions of the Act relating to inspection of registers kept by companies and the availability of copies of these registers will be standardised. See, for example, clause 95. Other amendments result from ongoing work on preparation of the regulations to be made under this Act. Some of the amendments are not intended to change the operation of the principal legislation, but simply to ensure that it does, in fact, operate as originally envisaged. A significant change to the Act is in the area of registration of charges. It had originally been intended that details of charges contained on registers maintained under the pre-existing law would be transferred to the new registers to be maintained under the new priority system. However, because of administrative difficulties in some States relating to the transfer of information on existing charges to the new register, the Ministerial Council has decided to retain the existing registers for a 12-month period at least. This will enable the Ministerial Council to review the provisions relating to the register. For this purpose, a new section 215A is to be inserted in the Act by clause 105 of the Bill. There are also a large number of minor amendments which needed to be made to the Companies Act 1981 before it came into operation. </PARA>
<PARA>COMPANIES (ACQUISITION OF SHARES) ACT 1980</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act are made by Part XVI of the Bill. The time within which the National Companies and Securities Commission may declare an acquisition of shares or other conduct to be unacceptable has been extended from 14 days to 90 days after the acquisition has taken place or specified conduct has been engaged in. The amendment is to be found in clause 132. Once the Commission has made such a declaration, it will be able to make certain orders which are to be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette-see clause 133. These will include orders restraining the disposal or acquistion of an interest in specified shares, restraining the exercise of voting rights, or directing a company not to issue shares to a person who holds shares in it. These orders will generally expire after 30 days, although a person aggrieved by an order will be able to apply to the Supreme Court for its variation or revocation. Furthermore, in exercising its powers under sections 45, 47, 48, 57 and 60 of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act, the Supreme Court will have the power to make interim orders and will be able to make orders without requiring undertakings as to damages-see clause 131.</PARA>
<PARA>SECURITIES INDUSTRY ACT 1980</PARA>
<PARA> Part XXXVI amends the Securities Industry Act. References in sections 4 and 12 of the Act to an acquisition of shares or an acquisition of securities will be clarified by providing that they shall include circumstances where a person is taken to acquire shares in a company for the purposes of the Companies ( Acquisition of Shares) Act-see clauses 208 and 209. Also, in exercising its powers under sections 14, 83, and 147 of the Securities Industry Act, the Supreme Court will have the power to make interim orders and will be able to make orders without requiring undertakings as to damages-see clauses 210, 212 and 213 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>CONSULAR PRIVILIGES AND IMMUNITIES ACT 1972</PARA>
<PARA>DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES ACT 1967</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the amendments made by Parts XVII and XX of the Bill to the consular and diplomatic privileges and immunities legislation is to assist in preventing the misuse of the customs duty exemptions provided by that legislation. Pursuant to the obligations in the two Vienna Conventions on diplomatic and consular relations respectively, Australia accords, by way of that legislation, customs duty exemptions to members of foreign diplomatic missions and consular posts in Australia. It is currently possible for most diplomatic and consular personnel and their families to import into Australia for their personal use motor vehicles free of sales tax and customs duty. Those vehicles may then be sold or otherwise disposed of without the payment of duties or taxes after they have been retained for two years. Luxury vehicles can thus be sold at a considerable profit. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments increase from two to three years the period within which persons entitled to customs exemption under either of the Acts may not dispose of motor vehicles without restriction. The three year period corresponds with the usual period for which foreign diplomatic and consular personnel are posted to Australia. At the same time, the number of vehicles which can be imported free of customs duty by each family under the Acts will be reduced administratively. These measures are consistent with international practice. </PARA>
<PARA>COPYRIGHT ACT 1968</PARA>
<PARA>The amendments to the Copyright Act 168 contained in Part XVIII of the Bill are concerned entirely with the provisions of that Act providing for the Copyright Tribunal. Having regard to the nature of applications currently before the Tribunal and applications expected to be made to it in the near future, the Government has concluded that the existing provisions of the Act requiring members of the Tribunal to possess legal qualifications unduly restrict the range of possible candidates from which members may be appointed. It is felt that the deliberations of the Tribunal could be helped by the presence of members possessing expertise in other occupations relevant to the subject matter of applications before, or likely to be coming before, the Tribunal. Accordingly clause 139 of the Bill broadens the range of qualifications for eligibility for membership. At the same time, by analogy with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, only judges of the Federal Court of Australia are, under the Bill, to be eligible for appointment as President and Deputy President of the Tribunal . In this regard I point out that under the existing provisions of the Copyright Act, the President and Deputy President have more onerous duties than other members. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 144 modifies the provisions of the Act permitting a tribunal to continue hearing an application after one of its members ceases to be available. The Bill will make the authority of the Tribunal to continue in such circumstances dependent on the continued presence of the President or Deputy President on the Tribunal for that hearing. The opportunity has been taken in the Bill to make other amendments to the Copyright Act to substitute new provisions regarding the termination of the appointments of members of the Tribunal, clause 140, the authority of the Deputy President when acting in place of the President, clause 141, and the fixing of the remuneration and allowances of Tribunal members, clause 142. The provisions substituted by the Bill follow the pattern of provisions for similar bodies in other Acts that have been enacted more recently than the provisions of the Copyright Act being replaced. </PARA>
<PARA>PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES ACT 1952</PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are primarily designed to provide a legislative basis for the payment of a Presiding Officer who, though himself no longer a member of the Parliament, continues to perform for a period the statutory functions of the office until the election of a successor. Thus Sir Condor Laucke, though no longer a senator after 30 June 1981, was deemed to be President of the Senate, in accordance with the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965, until 18 August 1981. There was, however, no provision for him to be paid any allowance. In such circumstances an appropriate ex gratia payment has customarily been made . </PARA>
<PARA> It now seems appropriate to put the matter on a proper footing, and at the same time to repeal obsolete provisions of the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952 which relate to allowances now prescribed by the Remuneration Tribunal. The amendments also provide for a situation in which a Chairman of Committees is required, for example by the death of the Presiding Officer, to take over the functions of his office for a time. </PARA>
<PARA>PATENTS ACT 1952</PARA>
<PARA> Part XXXI of the Bill includes provisions which amend the Patents Act 1952 to relax the requirements for patent applicants who wish to make divisional applications. The jurisdiction of courts under a number of provisions in the Patents Act is clarified, and two further classes of decisions under the Act are made subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Part XXXI also introduces a wider regulation making power with respect to the professional conduct of patent attorneys. This is being included at the request of the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>ROYAL COMMISSIONS ACT 1902</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments made by Part XXXIV of the Bill will enable an Australian royal commission to function in a foreign country where appropriate arrangements in that regard have been made with the foreign country. It is envisaged that in some cases a royal commission would take evidence in the foreign country pursuant to its Australian commission and in other cases it would take evidence pursuant to an authority issued to it under the law of the foreign country. See clause 203. The legislation is proposed against the background of discussions between Australia and New Zealand for the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking, conducted by Mr Justice Stewart, to take evidence in New Zealand for the purposes of its inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA>STUDENT ASSISTANCE ACT 1973</PARA>
<PARA> The Student Assistance Act 1973 outlines the broad provisions of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme-TEAS-and the Post-graduate Awards Scheme. The clauses which form Part XXXIV of the Bill will amend the Act to repeal those provisions which are no longer relevant, to make minor changes to facilitate the administration of the two schemes and to make certain changes to the procedures of the Student Assistance Review Tribunals which review decisions of the Department of Education on individual students' entitlements. The proposed amendments do not reflect changes in Government policy and will not restrict entitlement to benefits. As far as the administration of TEAS and the Post- graduate Award Scheme is concerned, the amendments will provide that the Minister for Education may approve part only of a course in addition to the existing authority in relation to a course as a whole, clauses 223 and 226. For example, a course may comprise an academic component which is suitable for approval and periods of employment experience which fall outside the scope of educational assistance. The amendments will also enable regulations to be made which would provide for the payment to persons under TEAS of amounts associated with travel to and from an institution, other than by way of reimbursement of fares, clause 224. </PARA>
<PARA> There are clauses which concern procedures to be followed by Student Assistance Review Tribunals. They will enable an appellant to withdraw a request for review if, for example, in the light of further information the decision being appealed against has been reversed in the appellant's favour, clause 232. An appellant will also be given the option of having his appeal heard by a two member tribunal where, for example, the third member is found to be unavailable on the day the appeal is scheduled to be heard, clause 233. The amendments will provide two further measures which are consistent with the Government's experience with other review bodies and the recommendations of the Bowen Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Duty and Private Interest, and are in the interests of appellants. They will require a Tribunal member to declare any interest he may have in the proceedings under review, clause 233, and will enable the Tribunals to safeguard the confidentiality of certain documents presented and evidence given in respect of a particular hearing, where there is good reason for doing so; clause 236. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to provide a mechanism for Australia to introduce reciprocal countervailing duty measures. Last November, following the countervailing action taken by the United States against Australian lamb exports, the Government announced that Australia would be introducing this amending legislation. Specifically, the amendments will allow Australia to take reciprocal countervailing action in any case where another country applies countervailing duty against Australian exports without applying an injury test or using a concept of a subsidy broader than the concept currently embodied in the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. The United States legislation already contains provisions that have the same effect as the measures proposed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems were created for Australia last year when America threatened countervailing duty action against Australian lamb exports without applying the necessary 'injury test' and adopting a broader definition of a 'subsidy' to that currently contained in the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. The difficulty with America has been overcome for the time being as a result of a bilateral understanding with that country. This understanding was made on the basis of Australia joining the Subsidies and Countervailing Duties Code and, consequently , the 'injury test' is now accorded to Australian exports by the United States. The Government, however, has indicated that it will review its membership of the Code in the light of experience and the option of considering withdrawal from the Code remains open. Accordingly, the decision to join the Code does not negate the adoption of the principle of reciprocity in relation to countervailing duty actions by Australia. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of 14 Bills has as its basic purpose the application of various Australian laws to drilling platforms and rigs which are attached to the continental shelf of Australia. Australia declared its sovereign rights over the Continental Shelf in 1953. This jurisdiction was effectively confirmed by the first United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held in Geneva in 1958. One of the conventions drawn up at this conference related to continental shelves, and Australia is a party to that convention. Australia's sovereignty over the continental shelf is clearly in right of the Commonwealth, as against the States, as was established by the High Court in 1976 in a decision on certain matters relating to the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. The Commonwealth, therefore, has the responsibility to control activities related to the shelf, and this power is relevant to the provisions of these Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition supports all of these Bills. I notice that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) nods in fond accord. The Bills not only represent a necessary extension and clarification of Commonwealth powers, but also provide a sensible basis for the administration of various laws in relation to the peculiar circumstances of off-shore oil and gas drilling. In the past, the objectives of many of the Bills were partly achieved through the existing principal laws, together with the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. One of the requirements of existing law was that all drilling rigs and goods to be supplied to drilling rigs must be first imported to an approved Australian port, before being sent to the drilling sites on the continental shelf. This importation requirement enabled the various customs, quarantine, immigration and taxation laws to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> However, with the opening up to exploration and production activity of the vast but distant North West Shelf section of the continental shelf, and the likelihood that further remote areas will also be explored in the future, it has become impractical to import all rigs and goods to Australian ports before attachment to the shelf. This particularly applies to the giant production platforms for the Woodside project, which will be imported direct from Japan. Accordingly, these Bills provide that an installation may be brought to its operating site, provided prior government approval is obtained. When the installations are attached to the seabed, they will become under the legislation , a part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrival of the installations and its attachment is to be supervised by officers until customs, immigration and quarantine clearance is given. Subsequent to the attachment of the installations, goods to be used on the installation in general will be required to be imported first to an Australian port. However, provision is made in clause 11 of the Off-shore Installations ( Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill for a collector of customs to exempt a ship or aircraft from this requirement. This exemption may be subject to conditions which will ensure that all relevant requirements are met. Exemptions may be desirable in certain circumstances, such as the need to obtain vital items in emergencies from places outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition considers that all of these arrangements seem practical and desirable. We draw attention, however, to certain matters which are of some concern. We hope that these matters will be monitored closely by the responsible departments and the Government. We do not, at this stage, believe that there is a need to amend the provisions in relation to these matters; we merely suggest that they may prove to be areas which could cause difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, there can be no doubt that the potential exists for off-shore platforms and rigs to become a channel for the illegal importation of narcotics and other goods, possibly even for illegal immigration. Surveillance of the installations and movements of ships and aircraft in relation to these installations is clearly an important requirement. Section 59 of the Customs Act provides that ships and aircraft within the 12-mile limit may be required to bring to, or land, for the purposes of boarding. The Bills we are debating tonight seek to extend this power to enable a ship to be directly boarded, but also to enable ships or aircraft which are within 500 metres of an installation to be subject to these requirements. What the Opposition questions is whether a zone defined as 500 metres from the installation is really adequate for the purposes of this legislation. If the installations are to be declared a part of Australia, why does the 12-mile limit not apply? Will the distance of only half a kilometre make such provisions almost impossible to enforce? We are aware that 500 metres is the conventional safety zone around an installation, but why is this relevant to the administration of Customs law?</PARA>
<PARA> The second concern of the Opposition relates to the penalties under the proposed legislation. The penalties by way of fine of only $50,000 for the unauthorised attachment of an installation to the shelf seems inadequate and, more importantly, the fine of $10,000 for failure to meet conditions could, in certain circumstances, be trivial. These penalties are, we recognise, consistent in some degree with those proposed under the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill, which we hope the Government will find the courage to bring on for debate in the near future. It has been listed for a fortnight, I might add. However, we believe that the greater risks attending the peculiar circumstances of these installations, including the greater cost and difficulty associated with exercising control over the movement of persons and goods associated with the installations, suggests that there may be a need and reasonable grounds for more substantial penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Our third concern relates to this Government's abysmal record in relation to Customs control. The inadequacies of the Government in relation to Customs have been highlighted by recent events-by the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and by the report of March 1981 of the task force that inquired into allegations about the Customs service in New South Wales. One of the problems highlighted in these inquiries, which has again come to light in media reports of substantial delays in Customs due to a lack of staff, is the general problem that this Government has not provided adequate staff or equipment to the Bureau of Customs, or for the purposes of coastal surveillance generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The effectiveness of the legislation now before the House relies on adequate resources being provided. We know that deficiencies have been revealed in this respect in the past. The aircraft available for surveillance are too few and too slow. The Australian defence forces are increasingly being oriented towards 'big note' items, such as questionable aircraft carriers and sophisticated interceptor fighters, while resources needed for coastal and maritime surveillance are kept at inadequate levels. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) is particularly concerned about and knowledgeable in this area. Later in this debate I am sure that he will make a few very pertinent points about it. The former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who introduced these Bills, made no mention of the administrative or staffing requirements or of arrangements which would apply to the application of the law to off-shore installations. We in the Opposition make a considerable point of discussing it because we believe that it is at least as important as the enactment of appropriate law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be hoped that the Government will one day learn that it is counter- productive, particularly in a revenue-raising department such as the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, to apply cutbacks and staff ceilings without proper regard for the essential functions of such departments. The present staffing level of this Department in the whole of Western Australia is 390. This is 10.5 per cent of the total of the State Offices. We are talking here about one-third of the Australian coastline and one-third of the sovereign area of Australia. Are these resources adequate? We very much doubt it. Now that off- shore installations are to be included as part of Australia-these will initially affect Western Australia most of all-we would like an indication from the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) of what administrative resources will be made available to give effect to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have indicated that the Opposition supports this package of legislation. I have also expressed our main concerns which relate to its effectiveness in terms of penalties, the geographical area of jurisdiction and the administrative resources and arrangements that are associated with it. There remains one other issue which I wish to explore in my remarks. The former Minister, in his second reading speech, claimed:</PARA>
<PARA> A very important result of applying the Customs laws to these operations will be the legislative protection of the rights of Australian industry to share in the development opportunities to the same extent as now applies in relation to undertakings within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition regards this as of crucial importance. Yesterday my colleague the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), raised as a matter of public importance the problems being experienced in the Australian steel industry. One aspect of this problem has been illustrated in relation to the North West Shelf project where, I understand, Australian steel not only is absent from the platforms produced in Japan but also is not being used for pipeline construction . The North West Shelf project is believed to involve much less in Australian materials and equipment content than is the average for resource development projects. Linking manufacturing to resource development is one of the principal means of spreading the benefits of that development. </PARA>
<PARA> What should be done? As a starting point we should be looking to Canada and the United Kingdom, where planning offices have been established. In Canada, an office of industrial and regional benefits seeks the maximum possible use of planning skills, project development ability, machinery and material supplies from local companies, while in the United Kingdom an off-shore supplies office seeks the same objective in relation to North Sea development. While these planning agencies have been very successful, Australia is suffering a balance of payments deficit due in part to the import of machinery and materials for resource developments. This Government's continued rejection of planning and government intervention is damaging our private sector. Many opportunities for job creation and growth are being lost because insufficient efforts are being made to maximise local involvement in resource development. For example, the metal industries still have sectors working at only 75 per cent of capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the principal features of Labor's economic management will be the establishment of government policy mechanisms which will seek every practicable avenue for local companies to meet the needs of resource projects. The package of Bills we are debating is in many ways characteristic of measures brought by this Government to the Parliament. Because they are drafted by efficient and loyal public servants, the legislation is a sensible and reasonable attempt to meet the needs of the nation. But there are two failings which are the direct responsibility of the Government. Firstly, there is a failure to commit the required resources and staff to ensure that this legislation is put into full effect. That must be a source of frustration to the public servants who have helped to draft this legislation. Secondly, there is an hiatus of policy-a rejection of the necessary clarity of vision and strategic approach needed to achieve all of the objectives of the legislation. I have illustrated this in the case of the role of the Customs Tariff in encouraging Australian participation in the resources sector. In closing, I reiterate that the Opposition supports these Bills. I stress the Oppositions concern that the Government should, at least on this occasion, take them seriously enough to ensure that they are given proper effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although the Opposition does not oppose these Bills, some crucial points need to be made in relation to the matters before us. Some of these points have been raised by my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown). I emphasise in particular the following two paragraphs contained in the speech of the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, which are of importance. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been the Government's longstanding policy that the treatment to be accorded these off-shore activities should be no different, in principle, from the treatment accorded similar resources ventures being undertaken within Australia. The petroleum exploration and recovery activities taking place in Bass Strait and elsewhere around Australia for upwards of 15 years have been governed by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. In that period, the only extension to off-shore activities of Commonwealth law outside the ambit of that Act was the application in 1968 of relevant income tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>There are two points that need to be made about that. First, it is not true that it has been Government policy to treat off-shore installations in the same way as other resources ventures. Preferential treatment was given to the Bass Strait oil producers in a variety of ways. Secondly, if the Government wishes to use the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act as applied to Bass Strait oil to illustrate what may happen to legislation such as this, we shall have to monitor it very tightly in order to ensure that corruption and inefficiency are not rampant on these rigs. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Government's record in relation to Bass Strait has been woeful. This applies particularly to the collection of excise taxes imposed by the Victorian Government and the Federal Government on the oil. In that case the situation was described by the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament-not by the Opposition-as one of negligence, in that up to $100m was lost from revenue. What has happened is that, firstly, the Federal Government relied on officials of the Victorian Government to measure the quantity of oil, but the Victorian Government did not have adequate computer facilities to do so. We had the further stage in which the Victorian officials, not having adequate computer facilities, relied on the measurements of the quantity of oil given to them by Esso Australia Ltd and Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd-the very companies which were paying the excise tax. We had an extraordinary situation.</PARA>
<PARA> An analogy can be drawn here. We have been assured that the provisions of the various Acts will be enforced on these rigs. However the question is: Are we to have a Mickey Mouse form of enforcement similar to that which existed in that case, which resulted in $100m of taxpayers' money being lost? It is extraordinary that the very companies which stood to benefit from the underpayment of the tax were relied upon to measure the amount of oil and to report on the amount of tax to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee urged immediate action in order to rectify the situation. It asked for this action to be carried out as soon as possible. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee understands that following the Direction issued by the Designated Authority on 9 June 1980, a reassessment has been made of the value of petroleum at the well-head for all royalty periods from the commencement of production. The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> officers of the Department of National Development and Energy, and the Auditor- General's Office actively participate in the final verification of royalty calculations which should be completed as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Although that recommendation came six months ago, on the best information available to me no action whatsoever has been taken to ensure that an adequate measuring mechanism has been put into place, so we are faced with a situation that is very similar to that which existed when the Committee began its reports. If this is to be an example of the kind of administration that is to take place with regard to off-shore installations, we are not satisfied. I can assure the House that the Opposition intends to keep a close watch on the Government's procedures for the enforcement of laws in relation to these matters. As the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out, there are dangers in relation to this matter, not only in respect of purely criminal activities, such as the importation of drugs, but also in respect of the contravention of immigration laws and in respect of quarantine matters and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the companies operating these rigs have been given a privileged position by the Government and the Parliament. They have been given this privileged position insofar as they are able to bring in goods, personnel, services and so forth, directly from overseas without going through the normal ports of Australia. That privilege should not be abused. The fact that the Opposition does not oppose the Bill and does not oppose making things easier in terms of the importation of parts, equipment and so forth for these developments gives the lie to the statements that are continually made by the Government that the Labor Party is opposed to resource development and to strategies to support it. We have not opposed these developments in any way. We have acted responsibly in support of whatever measures are necessary to ensure the success of such projects. This does not mean that we believe in allowing a situation in which such companies would be able to escape their responsibilities to the Australian people in terms of taxation and in terms of the pursuance of normal procedures. We believe in the principle that the Government has stated-although I believe that it was not carried out in the case of Bass Strait oil-namely, that all resources projects should be placed on an equal footing and treated alike. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments, especially the North West Shelf project, are of great importance to the future of Australia. My colleague the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) will have more to say about that. I want to emphasise again that our policy on resource development is not to frustrate or to stultify development. We believe that within proper guidelines, with proper Australian participation in projects so that benefits can be distributed to the Australian people as well as to those foreign companies which have brought in capital, resources projects should be allowed to proceed and will be allowed to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parramatta mentioned another important point. It was referred to in the second reading speech. We should be doing all that we can to ensure that the maximum employment and job creation for Australians is taking place as a result of these developments. Sometimes experts, technicians and skilled workers are available in Australia but are not taken from Australian cities to the places concerned. Instead, foreigners are brought in who do not even have Australian resident status in many cases and they are used on these projects. In particular, the immigration provisions ought to be overseen to be sure that they are not abused and that the maximum job opportunities for Australians result from these sorts of projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention the importance of the products-the oil, gas and so on-being processed as much as possible within Australia so as to create industry here, especially in the remote parts of Australia where we need to decentralise our industry to ensure that more people are encouraged to live there and to create a worthwhile social environment. I have talked to people who spend a great deal of time working on oil rigs and similar installations. Life on these rigs is not wonderful. The workers often are isolated from their families and friends and although the companies do what they can to create some kind of social environment, it is severely restricted. Under those conditions we hope that the companies will use the provisions given to them in order to do what they can to make life as good and as bearable as possible for the work force in those remote areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak on this legislation because in large measure it results from Government consideration of problems which will emerge from off-shore developments in Western Australia. If developments on the North West Shelf go ahead they will result in large platforms being brought directly to the site. This contrasts with the initial development in Bass Strait, when basic equipment was brought in to Australia via Australian ports. It is also a possibility that occasionally-not on most occasions, but occasionally-materials and goods will be brought in directly from overseas and will not be processed through Australian ports. To ensure that these installations will not become staging points for the entry of prohibited imports, drugs, exotic diseases or illegal immigrants, a variety of Acts are being amended by these Bills. To a very substantial extent these Bills make the rigs part of Australia's territory. Establishing the procedure for the extension of Australian law off-shore is one thing; having the capacity to ensure that the amendments are enforced is quite another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is to the question of enforcing this legislation that I wish to direct my remarks entirely. One of the problems of enforcing this legislation lies in the legislation itself. A second problem of enforcement lies in the current state of surveillance and enforcement off-shore via the Department of Transport and the Department of Defence. The problem in the legislation is that referred to by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) concerning the limit on the type of activities that can be engaged in by Australian enforcement forces in the 12-mile limit to within 500 metres of the rigs. I suspect that the reason the Government has limited itself to that is that it must be slightly embarrassed, as any government would be, about the fact that it is effectively applying territorial law in an area which is not strictly to be regarded as territorial waters but merely as an exclusive economic zone. Therefore, the Government is acknowledging an acceptable international safety standard of distance around rigs. If that is the case, I can understand why the Government would do that but I do think that the Government ought to test the limits of the applicability of that commonly internationally accepted position. Whilst it may be all right in the North Sea, I suspect there may be problems in Australia in the remote areas with which we are dealing. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the nature of surveillance off-shore, which I will get on to in a minute and the very considerable distance that patrol boats carrying officers capable of enforcing Australian law have to travel, the Government may well need to develop a formula whereby boats that have visited those rigs and remained within the exclusive economic zone where Australia has, nevertheless, special rights, can still be boarded by government enforcement vessels because they will not have the time, under normal circumstances, to intercept any offender if the offender has had any degree of warning at all-if the distance to be imposed on the area of enforcement is only 500 metres. I suspect that we can deal with that problem in a legislative committee. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) might like to flag it in his new experiences and have a thought about it when it is there. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that at the time when the Government correctly seeks to expand the responsibility of the Bureau of Customs via this legislation, it is effectively cutting back aids to enforcement. The Government expands the requirement for surveillance and interception off-shore and then reduces the capacity, or does not expand the capacity, of those given the task to meet this new demand. The new demand for enforcement and surveillance, quite deliberately as a result of this legislation, is going to be considerable off the North West Shelf in Western Australia. This legislation is devised to cover installations in an area where our surveillance and enforcement capabilities have been demonstrated to be defective and most vulnerable. The North West Shelf area, along with the whole of our northern coastline, has been the focus of worried attention by governments since the mid-1970s. The Commonwealth's responsibilities in the area have been greatly expanded by the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. Also, we have become far more aware than we were because we at least have started giving the degree of surveillance of the problem of incursions in the area in which we should be interested. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had near the North West Shelf area several spectacular interceptions of efforts at illegal immigration-including the interception of several citizens of India, dressed like impeccable civil servants under the Raj, who were detained on an island. They made the statement that they had lost their way. I do not know whether they had lost their way to Charing Cross railway station or where they had lost their way to, but apparently that is the excuse they gave. The situation was quite evident. The incident was not isolated but that would have been one of a very few groups intercepted. Likewise, the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs and the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, when reporting on quarantine and on the illegal importation of drugs, in their reports in 1980 were both scathing on the adequacy of arrangements in the north. The Royal Commission painted a picture of almost unlimited access for the would be smuggler. Government measures to meet these problems have been quite inadequate and have been the object of criticism by the Royal Commission and by numerous interested bodies. This has been despite the stepping up of surveillance activities by the Royal Australian Air Force, contracted civilians and increased numbers of Royal Australian Navy assets devoted to the task. </PARA>
<PARA> In its defence report of 1982 the Government emphasised four areas in which it believed the surveillance capacity in that region had been improved. Firstly, mention was made of planned extensions and development of an airfield at Derby. Secondly, new patrol boat bases were to be constructed in Darwin and Cairns. Thirdly, moves to base port and home port vessels at Cockburn Sound were to be speeded up. Fourthly, increased surveillance operations by the Orion aircraft from Edinburgh in South Australia were to take place over the west coast. Left out of the defence report but included in recent election promises, including those made during the last two elections, has been a patrol boat base in the north-west of Western Australia. Patrol boats are absolutely essential to the enforcement of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the surveillance and enforcement capacity of the Government to invoke this legislation, I believe that we see three problem areas. Firstly, despite increased efforts the Royal Commission on Drugs described the effort as inadequate and misdirected. As was pointed out by my colleague the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) in a debate at about this time last year, fishermen in a number of ports in the north-west and off-shore in the north-west set their watches by the RAAF and civilian patrols, so regular are they. The patrols are so timely that any would be smuggler could pinpoint when they would be likely to occur and therefore time his incursion to evade detection. In fact, the RAAF's contribution has been declining. In 1977-78 it was about 3,075 hours of surveillance. In 1978-79 it was 2,385 hours, and in 1979-80 it had dropped to 2,260 hours. Furthermore, the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) has made it quite evident in evading questions from me that defence capital infrastructure in programs in Western Australia are going now to be cut back. That will set back developments in Derby and will put the patrol boat base-I think he believes- permanently on the shelf. </PARA>
<PARA> A second point is that the capacities on the enforcement side are manifestly inadequate. Great play was made four years ago about increasing the number of patrol boats devoted to the enforcement task from seven to nine. Despite that increase the number of patrol boat days spent on patrol was increased from only 1,600 to 1,677 days per annum. Without a patrol boat stationed permanently in the north-west enforcement will be extraordinarily difficult. We are talking about enforcement on the North West Shelf itself. It will be more than 1,000 kilometres from Perth and more than 1,000 kilometres from Darwin. Given the steaming times of patrol boats, that will pose very considerable difficulties if patrol boats are to be relied upon substantially for interception and enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> The third evident point is that there are too many departments involved in the process of surveillance and enforcement. There are already, or will be as a result of this legislation Customs officials involved. Also involved are the Department of Transport and the Department of Defence. We believe that the responsibility should lie purely with the Department of Defence on the one hand and the Bureau of Customs on the other. Now that the Government has added to its difficulties in this area and has sent the Bureau of Customs well and truly off- shore we have reached a point in time at which it may well feel inclined to believe that that rationalisation process ought to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that we have an immense amount invested in the north west, may we have that patrol boat base and a patrol boat, as a matter of emergency? May we also look forward if we are not to have the patrol boat but merely the base, at least to some degree of innovation on the patrol boat question? There are in Western Australia manufacturers who have put forward perfectly adequate types of boats for the surveillance and enforcement that the Customs Bureau might well feel inclined to utilise. Perhaps the use of a group of smaller boats devoted to close in-shore and oil rig work, not necessarily to tasks in more difficult waters, might be appropriate. Such boats are available, incidentally extremely cheaply. Their use is indicated by this particular development and perhaps the Government will develop an interest in that approach. If this legislation suggests nothing else, it suggests how overdue such initiatives now are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is estimated that there are more than three- quarters of a million enterprises in Australia. Of these approximately 93 per cent are small, employing fewer than 10 people and 99 per cent are either small or medium size, employing fewer than 100 people. The top 500 largest enterprises represent only a minute fraction of all enterprises but they employ more than one-third of all those at work. More than two-thirds of Australia's 700,000 small enterprises are to be found in three divisions-agriculture, wholesale and retail trade and construction. But there are significant numbers of small businesses in finance, transport, recreation, manufacturing and community services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we examine the private enterprise sector, small and medium size businesses account for more than 60 per cent of total private employment and a similar 60 per cent of total private sector profits. Therefore small and medium size businesses are very important to this country from an employment and revenue- producing point of view. They provide a vital and flexible base to the economy yet receive very little attention from governments and negligible recognition of their role in the community. Some States have set up small business bureaus and departments of decentralisation to assist. </PARA>
<PARA> Appreciation of small business can be enhanced if time is taken to look for the strength of the sector rather than concentrating on its alleged weaknesses. These strengths include: Specialisation for market penetration, fewer industrial disputes, lower overheads, certain tax concessions, benefits of modern technology, rapid decision-making, and small run production lines to service large business. The disadvantages are: Lack of general business training of owner or manager, lack of mortgage security for fund raising and the myth of inefficiency. This has been the scenario for small business for many years. However, the scene has changed dramatically over the past 12 months. There has been a tremendous rise in costs to small business. For instance, shorter working hours, increased wages, increased light and power, workers' compensation, interest rates, fuel and transport costs have all risen. Small business is experiencing great problems, unable in many instances to pass on the increased costs. Staff have been and will be laid off, increasing the number of unemployed . Small business must not be allowed to wither on the vine as it is the biggest employer of labour in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The needs of small business in Australia which may be satisfied by government action and support have not yet, we believe, been fully accepted as real and fundamental in a sound economy. To date there have been mainly token gestures, many of which could be seen as politically motivated. These gestures have come principally as a result of inflation and the economic pressures which have created havoc with small business in the broad sense. It is imperative, therefore, that government recognition of the significance of small business in Australia be unequivocal and supported by a clear public commitment to give full and separate consideration to the small business sector, both rural and urban, in all investigations and deliberations relating to economic and financial policy, industrial relations and employment issues, trade practices, taxation protection policies, training programs and many areas of legislation and regulation where all business is now subjected to common treatment without due regard to the special needs of differing elements. Our Government and State governments must give this section of the business world careful surveillance and make every effort to arrest a deteriorating situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about rugby league. I specifically want to take issue with a column called 'Curran's Week' that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday 14 April. The article is headed 'Capital Punishment for Rugby League'. In the article the journalist, for want of a better definition, shows complete ignorance of rugby league and total ignorance of Canberra and the Canberra environs. I will discuss just three of the issues raised in this scandalous article. He first of all criticises the rugby league authorities for incorporating the Canberra Raiders team into the first grade rugby league competition this season. I must confess a personal interest in this because I happen to be co-patron of the Canberra Raiders team together with the former member for Grayndler, Mr Fred Daly. In the article the journalist states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The competition is weaker for their presence. </PARA>
<PARA>The 'their' refers to the Canberra Raiders. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Canberra may win a game at home, so to speak, when Queanbeyan is gripped by mid -winter cold: But then, a team of Eskimos could probably do the same, so long as the match was played at the North Pole. </PARA>
<PARA>Since then-that was printed only eight days ago-the Canberra Raiders team has won two matches, one on the very night of that article when it beat a New Zealand South Island team, which included six international players, and then last Sunday when the Raiders won its first major match by beating Newtown 12-11. Newtown, I am delighted to tell those people who are ignorant of the wonderful sport of rugby league, was one of last year's grand finalists. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously Mr Curran has never even bothered to watch the Canberra team play. Even I have seen the Raiders play one game in which it was defeated, but the team was playing Manly which is No. 1 on the rugby league ladder. On that occasion the Raiders gave the Manly team a very good game and held Manly to 23- 13. This man displays total ignorance of the game. I think this article detracts from the great effort that the team has put into improving its players and getting itself ready to compete in first grade rugby league. I must pay a special compliment to the coach of the team, Mr Don Furner. I take issue on the second point in the article in which Mr Curran states:</PARA>
<PARA> The competition is weaker for their presence. </PARA>
<PARA>The competition has in fact been greatly enhanced by the presence of the Canberra Raiders. The team has attracted huge crowds when it has been playing at its home ground. The crowds have numbered 12,000 and 10,000, thus making it among the top teams in attracting crowds to their home ground. This man then takes issue on a third point when he criticises the calling of the team the Canberra Raiders. He states that in fact the members of the team come mainly from Queanbeyan. He says that why the name Canberra was used remains a mystery. He does not understand that in Canberra we attempt to think in regional terms. Most of the rugby league teams in the New South Wales competition do not have people from their home areas. In fact, the backer for the team is the Queanbeyan Leagues Club but 80 per cent of its members are Canberra people. Over 50 per cent of the players are from outside Queanbeyan. The sponsors are the Canberra rugby league clubs and the supporters club is in the Australian Capital Territory Leagues Club. If Curran had watched Canberra play and visited Canberra he would not have written this nonsense. He would perhaps have been more enlightened, like another commentator of rugby league, Ron Casey, who had been very critical of the rugby league authorities in allowing the Canberra Raiders to join but who was prepared to acknowledge that he had made a mistake when, after the Canberra Raiders won so magnificently last Sunday, he sent the team a telegram saying:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was with a great deal of sorrow and anger that I read in the Press that eight extraneous groups had sought permission to take part in the Anzac Day ceremonies in Canberra, the nation's capital. Only three approvals were finally given and an even later development has led to further withdrawals, but I believe that any groups which have the remotest possibility of offending the traditional Anzac Day ceremonies should be excluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no point in my going into what Anzac Day means to ex-servicemen and women because I would probably have no conception. But I know, as one who has ex -service relatives, what I believe Anzac Day is about. I admit that it means different things to different people. The fallacious argument that the celebrations of 25 April glorify war is, I hope, now treated with the contempt it deserves. Anzac Day gives those people who played such a significant part in forging this nation and in shaping world events, many at a great deal of personal sacrifice, a chance to remember their past comrades in the way they wish to and as they have traditionally done since the First World War. I am not arguing that the decision made to allow extra groups to march is against any law . But it is against the traditional Australian adage of giving everyone, particularly those who have most earned it, a fair go. Surely this is what civil liberty is about. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 40 years ago-between April and late October 1941-brigades of the Ninth Division of the Second Australian Imperial Force, along with allied troops, held Tobruk in one of the most memorable feats of arms accomplished by Australia's fighting men. Legend has it that the Axis powers tagged them 'the Rats of Tobruk ', a name that they still wear with pride. From 8 April to 25 October casualties amount to 749 killed, 199 wounded with 604 prisoners taken by the Axis powers. I quote a passage from the Official War History volume on Tobruk and El Alamein written by Bart Maughan. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if the most dreadful burden borne by the defenders was the constant manning of shallow and sun-scorched diggings and weapon-pits in the regularly bombed bullet-raked Salient, in which to stand in daylight was to stand for the last time; these judgments only illustrate that each man had his own job in the conduct of the defence. The spontaneous respect of all arms and services for the performance of the others and loyalty with which they combined were the things that made Tobruk strong in defence and dangerous to its besiegers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Now we find that the local Rats of Tobruk will not be marching in the Anzac Day parade because of the situation that has developed, in, of all places, the nation's capital. I feel that the very fact that those people who choose to interfere with traditional Anzac Day services are going against the wishes of veterans such as the surviving Rats of Tobruk who have done so much for their country should be enough for them to stop and rethink what they are doing. Of course, there were many areas as bad as or worse than Tobruk when we take into account all the battle fields Australians have fought over. This strengthens my case. How any Australian could even tolerate the situation now developing I cannot understand. Perhaps too many of us have forgotten. To quote a wartime phrase to those who have forgotten: 'Wake up, Australia needs you!'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of uranium mining and Aborigines was brought to our attention yesterday with the tabling of the report on the social impact of uranium mining on Aborigines of the Northern Territory, prepared by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. If and when the two new mines at Jabiluka and Koongarra go into production payments to Northern Territory Aborigines by way of mining royalties will be in the vicinity of $28m per annum. Clearly, such an enormous sum of money will have a significant impact on Aborigines in the region. The last section of the report, which is entitled ' Social assessment: A Caution', states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any assessment of the current impact of uranium mining would acknowledge that mining has brought to the Aboriginal people of the Region access to financial resources which provide a basis for a degree of dependence from government funding and presence, and for forward planning across a whole spectrum of interests. </PARA>
<PARA>If uranium mining has managed to achieve this and the benefits have contributed to the advancement, independence and well being of Aborigines, I put it to honourable members that it is totally irresponsible and indeed outright dishonest to use Aborigines as a vehicle for the anti-uranium cause. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been suggestions by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) that Aboriginals have become too dependent on mining against their interests and against the interests of government programs. Surely it is a desirable and positive step if Aborigines can attain independence from government authorities. Let us not fool ourselves. Mining royalties will place Aborigines in a position of being able to decide their own future in a very big way. We should be very suspicious of anyone in the Australian Labor Party or the Government who deliberately seeks to make Aborigines become dependent on them. The point I am making is that Aborigines will have the capacity to make decisions about how money is spent in accordance with their own priorities and not someone elses. </PARA>
<PARA> The report significantly speaks well of the Northern Land Council and its dealings over Jabiluka and Koongarra. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Northern Land Council is going to great pains to identify the traditional owners of the two areas involved and to determine their views and those of other Aboriginal people likely to be affected by the projects. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's confidence in the NLC contrasts sharply with opinions expressed by the Australian Labor Party recently which have sought to portray the NLC as acting in a deceptive, irresponsible and underhand manner when dealing with Pancontinental Mining Ltd and Denison Mines. Cultural change and the impact of television on Aborigines is also referred to. There is no doubt that television will alter the Aboriginal way of life even further, particularly as more children include programs such as Sesame Street and Cop Shop into their daily lives. Policy-makers must be clear where they stand on the issue of cultural change. </PARA>
<PARA> We have three courses of action: Firstly, to formulate policies which will resist cultural change and sustain traditional ways; secondly, to formulate policies which will hasten cultural change and rapidly break down traditional ways; and, thirdly, to allow individuals their own choice about where they want to go in their own time. Personally, I favour the latter. I see no point in adopting the sentimentality of the first proposal or the aggressiveness of the second. The only sensible stance is to allow individuals who make up Aboriginal culture to decide where they wish to go. This is not to say that we, as Australians, should value Aboriginal culture any less but it is, I believe, the only sensible position we can adopt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The velodrome has not been classed as unsafe. Following a number of representations from local cyclists an investigation was commissioned from experts in velodrome design and construction. It was found that the velodrome meets required standards but that the steep transition curves are difficult for novice riders to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is estimated that to modify the transition curves to make the velodrome more readily usable for novice riders would cost $70,000. The Department of the Capital Territory is currently analysing overall requirements for cyclists in the Australian Capital Territory. When these investigations are concluded it will then be decided whether it is appropriate to carry out modifications at the velodrome.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The velodrome was constructed in 1972 at a cost of $78,000. It was initially leased and managed by the A.C.T. Amatuer Cyclists Association. It was handed back to departmental management in 1976. Since then use has been as follows:</PARA>

At the same time the United States has underlined the importance of economic and social reform in El Salvador and has given over $126m in non-military economic aid during the last year. The Australian Government deplores the continuing violence, the human suffering, and the continuing support for the left-wing guerilla groups which have caused the Government of El Salvador to request military assistance from the United States.</PARA>

<PARA> 100 per cent of income $180 and over.</PARA>
<PARA> The income of an employed member of the household over 30 years of age and not a spouse, is taken as that of the breadwinner if it exceeds that of the tenant. For additional residents under 18 years of age no rent is charged but for residents aged 18 to 21 years $5 is added to rent. For residents over 21 years $ 7.50 is added when income is less than $150, $10.00 is added when income is $150 to $250 and $15.00 is added when income exceeds $250.</PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners pay a rent which is determined by the dwelling they occupy if it is a pensioner unit (rent varies from $9 to $10 for single pensioners and from $15 to $17.50 for couples) otherwise single pensioners pay $13.00 (17.4 per cent of income) and married pensioners $22.00 (18.2 per cent of income).</PARA>

<PARA> Family income is assessed as the combined incomes of tenant and spouse plus a proportion of any of the residents' income based on their gross income obtained by applying the rent scale shown above.</PARA>
<PARA> The assessed rebated rent is reduced by $1 per child for all children beyond the second. The earlier formula does not apply to single and married pensioners. Their rental is assessed as 18.8 per cent of the basic pension (at November 1980 ) plus supplementary assistance. Single pensioners pay $13 or $12 if they are not receiving supplementary assistance. The married pensioner rental is $21 and $20 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA> The rebate is calculated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> the gross weekly incomes of the tenant and spouse plus 25 per cent of the weekly income of any other permanent resident up to a maximum at the State minimum wage ($147 per week) comprises the family income.</PARA>
<PARA> The rent payable when income is less than the State minimum wage is 18 per cent of that income.</PARA>
<PARA> The rent payable for family income equal to or in excess of the Tasmanian State minimum wage is determined from a graduated percentage scale which commences with 20 per cent at the minimum wage plus approximately 31 per cent of the difference if family income is higher, up to a maximum of 24.1 per cent of the total income when family income reaches $207.50 per week.</PARA>
<PARA> Single and married pensioners pay 18.1 per cent of the pension but single pensioners in bed-sitting units pay $1.50 less than this amount.</PARA>
<PARA>Northern Territory</PARA>
<PARA> Tenants pay 20 per cent of combined tenant and spouse gross income as rent, on incomes up to and equal to the Northern Territory minimum wage ($149.20). Beyond this level tenants pay 20 per cent of the minimum wage plus 28 per cent of income over that amount. Persons in receipt of age, invalid, widow, service or similar pensions pay 15 per cent of income and those in receipt of a supporting persons benefit pay 18 per cent of income.</PARA>
<PARA> A charge of $5 per week is made in respect of each non-dependent resident of a dwelling 16 years to 20 years of age (inclusive) and $10 per week for non- dependent residents of the dwelling 21 years of age or older. A non-dependent person is defined as one in respect of whom a regular gross income of more than $25 per week can be evidenced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following response to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of energy matters was raised during my discussions with the Italian Minister for Industry, Mr Giovanni Marcora. These included the potential for increased energy exports-especially coal and uranium-to Italy, the possibility for co-operative efforts in the energy area and the scope for Italian investment in Australian resources development. No formal energy co-operation agreements were entered into but the Minister and I agreed that there should be continuing contacts and consultations between Australia and Italy on a range of energy matters.</PARA>
<PARA> A copy of the Press Statement which I issued at the end of my visit to Italy is reproduced below for the information of the honourable member:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Statement by Senator the Honourable Sir John Carrick, KCMG, on his visit to Italy on 11-14 January 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for National Development and Energy, Sir John Carrick, said today that industrialised countries need to continue to press ahead urgently with restructuring their energy economies despite the current relaxed oil market.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister was speaking following discussions with the Italian Minister for Industry, Commerce and Handicrafts, Senator G. Marcora, the Vice Minister for State participation, Sig. D. Giacometti, Ing. F. Corbellini, President of E.N.E. L. and other Government officials during his visit to Italy on 11-14 January.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick said Australia could make a valuable contribution towards Italian plans for shifting away from oil into coal and nuclear power. The Minister said Australia has abundant high quality coal and uranium reserves and was one of the few industrialised countries in the world with the capacity to contribute towards solving the world's energy problems through energy exports. The Minister said Australia reaffirmed its responsibility to help meet the needs of those countries without sufficient energy resources and in so doing contribute towards economic and political stability.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick said that Australia was becoming an important supplier of coal to Italy, supplying about 10 per cent of Italy's coal consumption in 1980. The Minister noted that Italy's energy plan envisages a very significant increase in coal consumption by 1990 and that nuclear power generation would play a larger role in Italy's energy future.</PARA>
<PARA> The outlook for the future expansion of Australian coal exports was promising, particularly in the light of investments by Italian companies in Australian coal ventures. Similarly, Australia was in a good position to supply uranium for Italy's nuclear programme.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Murray Goulburn Co-operative was charged a total of $2.318m in respect of Dairy Industry Stabilization Levy on a product the Company had claimed was milk fat concentrate, but which was established to be unsalted butter and therefore subject to levy.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (a) The fact that the product was unsalted butter was determined by my Department as a result of investigations that had been set in train by my predecessor, the right honourable member for New England. However, determination of the amount of outstanding levy was not calculated until the company, which was disputing the Department's findings, conceded that the product was unsalted butter. This occurred after I became Minister for Primary Industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (b) Section 6(1) of the Dairy Industry Stabilization Act provides for a penalty of 10 per cent per annum for late payment of levy. In the case of Murray Goulburn, a penalty for late payment of $151,760.01 applied. However, a remission of $16,687.67 was granted to the Company in respect of the penalty that had accrued up to February 13, 1980, the date that I formally advised the Company that the product was leviable and that the levy must be paid. This was in accordance with normal practice.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (c) Other decisions which I took on this matter related to the interest allowance paid to Murray Goulburn on the recommendation of the Australian Dairy Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In respect of the disputed product, Murray Goulburn received:</PARA>
<PARA> a storage allowance of-$249,863.15</PARA>
<PARA> a domestic butteroil allowance of-$382,590.65</PARA>
<PARA> an interest allowance of-$163,215.52</PARA>
<PARA> all of which totalled-$795,669.32.</PARA>
<PARA> The product in question was automatically eligible to the storage and domestic butteroil allowance once the Company conceded it was unsalted butter.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) See answer to (1) (b) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Section 22(2) of the Dairy Industry Stabilization Act 1977 provides for a penalty of up to $1,000 to be imposed on conviction of having presented information that is false or misleading in a material particular.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Department did not consider the records and/or returns of Murray Goulburn to be false or misleading. Prosecution under Section 22(2) of the Dairy Industry Stabilization Act 1977 was not, therefore, contemplated. The question in dispute between the Department and the Company was whether or not certain production was leviable under the legislation. Once the Company conceded the product was unsalted butter, it lodged the necessary returns.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I and my family hold a total of 1,244 shares in the Murray Goulburn Co- operative.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware that on 27 February a Rabaul District magistrate's court ordered the forfeiture to the Papua New Guinea Government of the United States fishing vessel Danica, including her equipment and catch of skipjack tuna, after the Captain of the Danica had been found guilty of fishing inside Papua New Guinea's 200 mile zone without a licence. The captain was also fined K500 ($A650).</PARA>
<PARA> The vessel was subsequently repurchased from the Papua New Guinea Government, by the vessel's former owner for a fraction of its value. Since then an agreement has been reached between the Papua New Guinea Government and the American Tunaboat Association allowing access to the Papua New Guinea 200 mile zone for American tuna fishing vessels.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Penalties such as vessel forfeiture also exist under Commonwealth fisheries law for offences of the kind involved in the Papua New Guinea incident. Forfeiture has been imposed on a number of occasions when masters of foreign fishing vessels have been convicted for breaches of our fisheries law.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The master of the Yuan Tsuan was convicted of being in charge of an unlicensed vessel in the Australian fishing zone equipped for the taking of fish . He was fined $3,500 under the Fisheries Act. In addition, the vessel's catch was forfeited. Forfeiture of the vessel was not ordered by the magistrate as he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the catch on board the vessel had been taken in the Australian fishing zone. The master was also fined $200 under the Crimes Act and $100 under the Customs Act.</PARA>
