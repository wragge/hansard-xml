<PARA> That this House censures the Government for its grave failure in the administration of legislation relating to criminal and civil offences against the tax laws resulting in multi-billion dollar frauds against the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday, the Government tabled in this Parliament Interim Report No. 4 Volume 1 of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. In the subsequent period, the Opposition has had the opportunity of considering in detail the implications of that report. The consequence of that is that it is our conviction that we have no choice but to move a censure against the Government. It is clear from the information disclosed in that report that the responsibility for incompetence in administration goes well beyond those people who are dealt with directly by the Royal Commission's report . In the final result, it is quite apparent that there has been a serious irresponsibility in the discharge of ministerial duties by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). Because of their association with the Government through Cabinet in the discharge of their responsibilities, the Government must finally accept responsibility in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put one thing on the record clearly from the start. Insofar as this report or any previous or succeeding reports of this Royal Commission disclose activities by members of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union which are criminal activities, which are offences against the civil law of this land, we sincerely trust that the full force of the law will fall upon those people without delay. We waste no time in seeking in any way to justify behaviour which we would find and do find, to the extent that it has been reported so far, totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I commence by referring to what obviously will be the main thrust of the defence of the Government in seeking to protect the indolent behaviour of both the Treasurer and the Attorney-General in this matter. There is no doubt that reference will be made to section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act-the secrecy provisions, as they are referred to-as a justification for that dilatoriness on the part of those two ministerial gentlemen. Mr Costigan, the Royal Commissioner, very properly points out that, to the extent that that section has been interpreted as a secrecy section, it has been interpreted too narrowly. It certainly is a privacy section but not a secrecy section. But even on a tough literal interpretation of the wording of that section it is quite clear that information of a general nature which becomes available to the Australian Taxation Office in the course of matters related to a particular person is not prohibited from being conveyed to the responsible Minister. Sub- section (5A) of that section, which refers to prohibition, states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of sub-sections (2) and (5) . . . an officer or person shall be deemed to have communicated such information to another person in contravention of those sub-sections if he communicates that information to any Minister, or to any Minister of the Crown of a State. </PARA>
<PARA>That is fine. But the sub-section refers to information concerning the affairs of any other person, as a direct quote. In other words, given the extent to which the Taxation Office, in the course of its investigations, established general behaviour in the community designed to flout-criminally flout-the law and the extent to which opinions with general application became available to the Taxation Office which clearly evidenced that existing law could be applied, and applied effectively in such cases, that information could quite clearly be conveyed to the Attorney-General and to the Treasurer and, of course, passed on to the Government. Insofar as those general matters arise-it is on the basis of a serious dereliction of duty on the part of both the Treasurer and the Attorney -General in respect of those general matters- there is no defence for the Treasurer, the Attorney-General or the Government in trying to hide behind the veil of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Superficially, it would seem from the rather bland statement delivered in this Parliament yesterday by a rather bland Minister that the Government had undertaken action in response to the findings of Commissioner Costigan- superficially. Certainly the establishment of a national crimes commission has reared its head again. Certainly there is the proposal for a special prosecutor and a task force to investigate those matters disclosed by Commissioner Costigan to establish what evidence is necessary now to proceed in the courts. Certainly two lower level officers of a very incompetent office of the Crown Solicitor's Division have been suspended and, admittedly, there is to be an external examination of that office in Western Australia and a review of the office. </PARA>
<PARA> Those and some other matters are attended to. But the report goes well beyond that. The incompetence or, indeed, probably much worse than that went right to the top of the Crown Solicitor's Division in the period attended to by this report, and that period was the period during which tax evasion sky-rocketed in this country. I ask honourable members to dwell on those words for a few seconds -tax evasion, not tax avoidance. Tax evasion has always been a criminal offence. Tax avoidance is the practice someone adopts to get around the spirit of a law when there are gaps in the drafting of that law. But tax evasion is activity undertaken consciously to avoid legal responsibility under particular laws; that is, a criminal offence. That is what this reports talks about. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it ought to go on record also that the disclosures of these matters in relation to tax evasion are not the core of what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was seeking to pursue when he set up this Royal Commission. He was off on a fishing trip against the Painters and Dockers Union. He had a shotgun aimed at the union and it blew up in his face. The only reason these matters are now being reported to the Parliament, to the people of this country, is that Commissioner Costigan in his investigations established that it would be necessary to go far beyond the skimpy and limited terms of reference that the Government had given him. The terms were limited to an inquiry as to whether the union or its members had engaged in illegal activities in relation to shipping or any naval establishment. It has gone well beyond that. It has become a royal commission of inquiry into aspects of tax evasion in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister is a belated and frankly reluctant convert to sheeting home responsibility on this matter. I ask honourable members to recall the 1980 election when the Treasurer and the Prime Minister heaped scorn on the Australian Labor Party, and those like us who are morally outraged, when we denounced the tax evasion and tax avoidance which was going on in this country. The Treasurer now has the gall to stand up on any public platform he can grab and declare that his Government, and he as Treasurer, have done more to combat tax avoidance and evasion than any previous government. I have to confess-my colleagues will agree with me-that they have had more opportunity to do more than any previous government because there has been more tax evasion and tax avoidance under their Government than any other government in the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer and his colleagues are exposed by this report, as they were exposed by the McCabe-Lafranchi report, as sham fighters when it comes to this matter. How fair dinkum is the Treasurer when he stands here, or on any public platform that is prepared to bear the weight of his hypocrisy, and says that his Government will apply fierce action where tax avoidance and tax evasion are concerned? It took him two and a half years from when he was aware that there was need for action in relation to tax evasion and avoidance until the introduction of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. Four years ago the Treasurer said that he would act against the underground economy. He only did it in this Budget with public pressure. Four years ago he said that he would act against overseas tax havens which were ripping off Australian taxpayers on a massive scale and he still has not done anything. How much credibility has he got when, seeking to rebut the McCabe-Lafranchi report which exposed all of the hypocrisy and dilatoriness of this Government on this issue, he resorted to this sort of claim? He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, strong public attitudes towards tax avoidance were not yet evident at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>That was 1978. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is clearly important to recognise the considerably different state of public opinion towards tax avoidance than existed at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words the Government was not prepared to do anything until the public forced it to. In a statement in relation to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes he says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there are only five identified cases of post-3 December 1980 company strips (none of them in Victoria), with no more than a possibility that others may exist. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to page 89 of the Costigan report which states that there are 121 cases after the period the Treasurer is talking about. That is how fair dinkum he is. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of ministerial responsibility revolves around this issue: Did the Ministers know and ought they to have known? On any reasonable interpretation of the implications of Costigan's report one concludes, in relation to the first, that the Ministers certainly should have known if they were competent, if they diligently discharged their duties, and therefore one expects that they did know . If they did not know, in relation to the second matter, they were extraordinarily reckless where their duties were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> To discuss that matter we have to put it in a sequential framework and one refers to the developments which are outlined in the report. Todman, a senior investigator in Western Australia with the Taxation Office, carried out what is described in quite generous and respectful professional terms by Costigan as an investigation which, as I said, established in relation to one promoter-I stress that it was one promoter alone; that is all that Costigan was looking at in this report-that certain tax evasion measures were proliferating. Todman at that point in 1975 was suspicious of the Crown Solicitor's Office in Western Australia. It was a suspicion on behalf of the Taxation Office which, by the nature of responsible, concerned bureaucrats, would have been conveyed to his seniors in the Taxation Office. As a consequence of that-we are not given the reasons for this suspicion although they are abundantly clear from reading between the lines as we go through the report-in January 1975 a Queen's Counsel named Brinsden, who is now a judge of the Supreme Court in Western Australia, declared two things: Firstly, that existing legal provisions in criminal and civil law were adequate to proceed against this particular promoter and those associates of his involved in these tax evasion measures and, secondly, that there was sufficient evidence to anticipate a conviction. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1975 the decision was given to proceed with the prosecution and thereafter the process became embalmed. In 1976 a second opinion, from a Sydney silk, was provided. Subsequently, in that year a very competently compiled police report was presented pointing out, as did the second Queen's Counsel's opinion, that what Brinsden had declared was correct. The police report established, in terms glowingly described by Costigan which reflected the competence of that report, that there was sufficient evidence to proceed and expect a conviction. As I said before, the case became embalmed. It became embalmed for two to three years. This was in spite of the fact that Brinsden took the precaution of sending his opinion direct to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Western Australia and to the Commissioner of Taxation here in Canberra. So within the Taxation Office at the highest level people were already informed of this opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Office identified this as a test case. It represented an extra large fraud. Let me refer to the dimensions of the fraud which went on under the dilatoriness of this Government. If we accept in current day terms that tax evasion-putting avoidance to one side-is in excess of $3,000m a year and if these practices went on because of the lassitudinal responses of the Government in the past five to seven years, we are looking at a fraud perpetrated against Australian taxpayers of the order of $10,000m to $15,000m. That is the order of the fraud which has been tolerated and accommodated by the incompetence, the reckless irresponsibility, of these two Ministers and the Government. The Taxation Office sought to have the case given priority. Page 40 of Costigan's report pointed out that the amount to be collected in any other case was a pittance compared with this case. In 1978 the Crown Solicitor was made aware by the Taxation Office of all of these circumstances. In 1979 the Crown Solicitor's Office in Canberra became alarmed and then suddenly became frozen over by the Perth stone walling. All of this was taking place with the people at the highest order in the Taxation Office and at the highest level in the Crown Solicitor's Office being aware of all of these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I refuse to believe-from my experience as a Minister and more particularly when these things were happening in 1978, 1979 and 1980 when tax avoidance and tax evasion were being made major issues of controversy in this country by the Opposition attacking this conservative Government-that any responsible Minister would fail to explore in all of its ramifications, in all of its finest details, firstly, the capability of applying existing law effectively against offenders in this area, and, secondly, if there was a defectiveness what action should be taken and taken properly. As part and parcel of that sort of initiative I would expect any responsible officer to ask: What opinions do we have? What is existing law? What is case law in these matters?</PARA>
<PARA> The senior law officer of the land is the Attorney-General. He is, in his own right, a highly qualified and formerly practising lawyer. His responsibility is not to be a paper shuffler, not to accept the oral reassurances of people in his Department; for in the final result the responsibility for the interpretation of laws in these matters rests with him. He accepts the penalties that flow from incompetence or inadequate attention being given to those responsibilities. He, in his own right and by his qualifications, should have explored all of those provisions of existing laws and explored the implications of all those available legal opinions. He should, by his own experience, know that the generalists in his Department-it is obvious from this report that they are in too many cases vastly underqualified and inexperienced for the job they have-cannot provide him with the sort of conviction in opinions that a specialist at the Bar can provide . </PARA>
<PARA> In all those circumstances there is something very smelly indeed going on for the Treasurer and the Attorney-General to argue that they were not aware of the strange set of complications which was under way. The Taxation Office in fact felt that there was something very smelly involved in all of this. Let me quote from page 67 of Costigan's report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Legal Officers in the Taxation Office who generally could not understand why the existing law was not being used to redress the situation. </PARA>
<PARA>He was saying that legal officers in the Taxation Office were, at the very least , sceptical of the reluctance to apply existing laws in respect of those matters which were the subject of his report. That is a very interesting quotation because it is at odds with the statement of the Treasurer in his 27 June 1982 Press release responding to and seeking to discredit the McCabe-Lafranchi report . In relation to that matter he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Taxation Office did not simply ask for advice and receive it-having received unfavourable advice it pressed the matter with its legal advisers,--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, in its own Office-</PARA>
<PARA>only to have that advice confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA>There, on the evidence of what Costigan says, is the evidence that that statement is not truthful. The legal advisers within the Taxation Office believed clearly, on the explicit statements of Costigan, that existing law was more than adequate with which to proceed against this promoter and his associates. More than that, they had available to them not only their own legal department to interpret the law but also the opinion of Brinsden at least. </PARA>
<PARA> But I think that parenthetically we ought to recognise one other factor. In all of Costigan's report what is abundantly clear is simply this: For all of the obfuscation, the foot dragging, the tactics designed to deflect a proper course of justice in this matter at various levels within the bureaucracy and the Crown Solicitor's Office, none of the people involved in those deflecting activities ever challenged the applicability of existing law. To the extent that they sought to deflect they sought to do so solely on the basis that sufficient evidence was not available. All I can say is that we must have in the Treasurer and the Attorney-General two of the most incurious Ministers we have ever seen in government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> When the issue of tax avoidance and evasion has reached white heat in this country, which it has progressively through 1978, 1979 and 1980, and when the Taxation Office and the Crown Solicitor's Office have before them senior counsel 's opinions-not just one or two but many-to the effect that existing law can be applied and that in specific cases there is sufficient evidence to proceed with every reasonable expectation of a conviction being obtained, does anyone believe that when consultation takes place between the Attorney-General and his law officers and between the Treasurer and his taxation people, they do not say to those Ministers: 'Look, we have had these opinions from senior sources. They tell us that in fact we can proceed. There is something funny going on there in the distant reaches of this vast continent and we are exploring this'? Surely there is a responsibility upon the Attorney-General to explore, in all their ramifications, the varying opinions before him, even the shonky ones from the outpost in Perth and, if he is not satisfied, if he is unconvinced, to obtain independent judgment from outside the bureaucracy, from the practising Bar. </PARA>
<PARA> No one will be convinced that these Ministers discharged their responsibilities properly. We all know and the Australian public knows that this Government is a sham fighter when it comes to the issue of tax evasion and tax avoidance. The Treasurer postures in the Parliament, trying to demolish the credibility of the McCabe-Lafranchi report and saying that tax avoidance is now a dead issue. The McCabe-Lafranchi report stated, as the opinions available to the Government did, not only that existing laws were sufficient to sheet home responsibility but also that in Victoria companies were still being registered at the rate of 35, 000 a year or fifty to sixty a week. The Government must be in a perpetual sleep . There is a vast range of existing laws. There is case law which goes back to the eighteenth century and which quite clearly is applicable in these matters. It has been oulined in Costigan's report and referred to in the McCabe-Lafranchi report. Surely that knowledge of law is not beyond the wit and wisdom of the Public Service. Surely the Attorney-General, as our first law officer in the land, and the Treasurer himself, as a qualified solicitor, would not remain incurious when these basic principles, practices and provisions of the law are so widely and well known. Surely these matters would have been brought before their attention in the course of discussion in relation to what changes should take place in the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, on the basis of the McCabe-Lafranchi report and Costigan's latest report there is no need for a change of law. There is no need for retrospectivity at all. All we need is a bit of guts and determination from the Government to get the crooks who are ripping off. Let us look at the long list of opinions, most of which are quoted in the Costigan report. There is the Brinsden Q.C. opinion in 1975. There is an unnamed Sydney silk's opinion in 1976 . There are the opinions of Ormiston and Spry in 1978. There is the opinion of Traill Q.C. in 1978. There is a 1978 opinion which my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has quoted from several times in this House. On top of that, there is the opinion of the legal department of the Taxation Office and there is also the very competently presented report of senior investigator Todman. They are all saying the same thing and they are saying it very positively. The Government could have acted if it had wanted to act. Finally, there is the police report which makes it clear that the Government could have approached the prospect of proceedings with confidence that they would be successful. I refuse to believe that our bureaucracy and the Taxation Office are so reckless to their responsibilities that they would never have discussed any of these crucial matters with the Treasurer in the course of discussing the weaknesses in the law that he saw. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me make a couple of other relevant points. This report refers to one promoter only operating through Perth. What of the other promoters in other capital cities? What of the promoters in the bailiwick of the Treasurer, Sydney and Melbourne? They are innumerable. On page 2 of this report Costigan says that he has in transit a semi-trailer load and a container load of papers relevant to these matters. It is quite obvious that more opinions are available from eminent counsel than I have quoted. I have outlined six, in addition to one from the legal section of the Taxation Office. The fact is that a massive tax rort has been going on for ages. </PARA>
<PARA> Pages 90 and 91 of this report make it clear that the evidence should have been quite patently apparent to the Treasurer. They show that, although company registrations were sky-rocketing, the tax paid was diminishing while the proportion of tax being paid by income earners was sky-rocketing. My colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has made that a key thrust in debate in this House on many occasions. The conclusion is obvious: The Government, by its irresponsibility, has shifted a major share or load of the tax burden on to wage and salary earners so that these tax thieves, these tax cheats, can rip off at the expense of the rest of the community. The Treasurer and the Attorney-General have been reckless to their responsibilities. They should have known. Quite frankly, from my experience with people in the Taxation Office, I believe the Treasurer would have known. Perhaps more than that: On being briefed on these matters and being committed to them, the Treasurer and the Attorney-General have to convince Cabinet. If they convince Cabinet after discussing all of these matters, which is the proper way, the Cabinet also is irresponsible to its duty because it has failed to address itself to this plethora of opinion and existing law that could have sheeted home responsibility . Let not the Prime Minister seek to wriggle his way out of this. In 1972 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>But if a major blunder occurred in a department, of real importance to Australia , and if the Minister were unaware of it, the Minister should accept responsibility for the mistakes of his department and offer to resign. </PARA>
<PARA>That goes beyond the principle of ministerial responsibility that I enunciate. But the principle I enunciate has been seriously breached by both the Treasurer and the Attorney-General with the backing of the Government. The Government deserves to be censured and condemned for the way it has allowed a $10,000m to $ 15,000m fraud to go on for so long. </PARA>

The Government rejects this motion by the Opposition because it is falsely based. It comes from the mouth of somebody who, when he was Treasurer of this country, failed to close the notorious Curran loophole, which was, after all, as most students of the growth of the tax avoidance industry in this country know, the spur to the development of tax avoidance in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

At all times the Government has been prepared to allow the findings in the Costigan report to fall where they may and to see that those recommended for prosecution are so recommended without fear or favour. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has based much of his criticism of me and of my colleague the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack) on the proposition that at all material times we knew what was going on. That is the charge that has been made by the Leader of the Opposition. He repeated it and he even drew on his own experience when he was Treasurer of this country. If he recalls that experience he will know the nature of the administrative responsibilities of the Australian Taxation Office under the Income Tax Assessment Act. He will know the nature of the secrecy provisions of the Act. He will know the great and proper importance attached by the officers of the Australian Taxation Office to the preservation of confidentiality and secrecy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say without any equivocation that I have the highest personal regard for the integrity and the zeal of the officers of the Australian Taxation Office. They have been the subject of criticism and vilification and I do not resile one bit from some of the things that I said in reply to the McCabe-Lafranchi report. But that respect and that regard should not blind us to facts. It ought not to blind the Leader of the Opposition to the very simple fact that the premise of his own argument contradicts his principal claim. He is saying that we knew all the time what was going on, yet one of the major findings in the Costigan report is that the Income Tax Assessment Act is so structured that we cannot find out what is going on. I find the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition to be a very remarkable one. On page 95 of the Costigan report it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth . . . should be able to gain full access to taxation information so that he can see the extent to which the revenue of the Commonwealth may be being affected by fiscal policy or by the depredations of thieves and rogues. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the finding of Costigan himself. He wrote those words because he believed that the present structure of the Act did not enable that full and proper information to be obtained. Now, there are things about the secrecy provisions of the Act that I do not want to see changed and that no responsible democratic government would want to see changed. I do not want to see a situation where the Treasurer of this country, whoever he may be, has access to individuals' personal taxation files. So the principal charge of the Leader of the Opposition-that is, that I either knew or I ought to have known-is not just contradicted by me or contradicted by the Attorney-General; it is contradicted by Costigan himself. One of his principal findings was that the situation has to be changed so that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth shall be able to gain full access to taxation information, so that he can see the extent to which the revenue of the Commonwealth may be being affected by fiscal policy or by the depredations of thieves and rogues. What Costigan is saying here-if the plain, ordinary English language means anything-is that as things stand at present that facility is not available. Therefore, I find it rather strange that the Leader of the Opposition should base his criticism of me, should base his call for my resignation, on a report that contradicts his basic premise. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go back to the facts and the circumstances of this very, very unhappy matter-a matter of which we have not, as yet, seen the end. Let me remind the House of what I said when I introduced the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act in December 1970. On that occasion I said that the Government had decided to introduce that legislation because the advice that had been given to the Government by the Crown Solicitor, by the First Parliamentary Counsel and I think also the Attorney-General's Department, was to the effect that the existing law was not adequate to enable a successful prosecution to be brought. The nub of much of this debate is that Costigan says that that legal advice was wrong. That is what he says; he says it was wrong. Costigan is saying that the legal advice tendered to the Government by the Crown Solicitor, by the Attorney- General's Department and by the First Parliamentary Counsel in December 1980 and in the months leading up to the presentation of that Bill was wrong. I would have to say that events may well prove Mr Costigan wrong because until such time as the validity of prosecutions under the pre-1980 law is tested by the courts of this country, who is to know whether Mr Costigan is wrong? Who is to know that at the end of the day the highest court in this country will not, in fact, say: 'Mr Costigan, you were wrong. The advice tendered to the Government in December 1980 was correct and in fact it was only through the legislation passed in December 1980 that an effective end was brought to these particular schemes'. The future will in fact demonstrate whether that is the case. The only other thing that I want to say to this House on that particular subject is that whatever may be people's views about whether Costigan was right, the Crown Solicitor was right or the Solicitor-General was right, that particular legislation well and truly brought those practices to an end and was in fact a very, very effective piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I would like also to take the House back to 1978. I say to the House quite categorically that the first occasion that I knew that there was any contact between the Taxation Office and the Crown Solicitor's Office on this case was a three or four-line reference in a minute sent to me by the Commissioner of Taxation in May of 1978. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> In making this suggestion I mention that my officers have been pressing the Crown Solicitor to investigate whether prosecution action could be taken under the Crimes Act or the Companies Act against people involved in two cases of ' straw company' evasion. Despite the possibility that such prosecutions may be able to be launched I think that the specific taxation offence of the kind indicated should exist. </PARA>
<PARA>The specific taxation offence of which he was speaking was contained in his recommendation to me in May 1978, which I indicated in my reply to the McCabe- Lafranchi report, that there should be introduced into the criminal law of this country what ultimately became the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. That was the first occasion. I do not mind saying to this House that that was an indication that was given to me. I say to the House and to those who have had experience of ministerial responsibility: Do those words indicate on their face that there has been a five-year period of frustration and delay between the Crown Solicitor and the Australian Taxation Office? Do those words on their face justify the charge that has been made against me by the Leader of the Opposition? The fact is that when the McCabe-Lafranchi report was filed in the Victorian Parliament, and I requested from the Australian Taxation Office a detailed commentary on the allegations contained in that report, there was made known to me for the first time-as indeed proved to be the case with the Attorney-General-the detail of the correspondence, the delay and the frustration and all of the things that have been criticised in the Costigan report. Those were made known for the first time by the Australian Taxation Office in the advice that it gave to me to enable the preparation of a reply to the McCabe-Lafranchi report. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not sought to disguise the chapter of events which flowed from the advice that was given to me and to the Government in 1978 that a criminal sanction of the kind embodied in the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act might be required. A period of 2 1/2 years then elapsed. I will tell the Leader of the Opposition and, with respect, Mr Costigan that one of the reasons why that period elapsed was that there were people in the Government who wondered whether this piece of legislation was necessary, which, of course, is the very argument that the Leader of the Opposition has used. In the final part of his remarks the Leader of the Opposition indicated that there was no need for that piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that in 1978 attitudes about tax avoidance in this country were indeed different. The Leader of the Opposition ought to go back through his own Question Time folder and the Question Time folder of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) to find out how many times they raised the subject of tax avoidance in this Parliament. The fact is that the Australian Labor Party jumped on to the bandwagon of fighting tax avoidance when this Government decided in 1978 that enough was enough and something had to be done to protect the revenue of this country and the interests of the ordinary citizens of this country. I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the Parliament that I absolutely and completely reject the allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech to the effect that I knew or indeed ought to have known the circumstances that are described in the report of the Royal Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that I want to say to the Leader of the Opposition and to this House is that despite his invective, criticism and contrived outrage I will not have the Leader of the Opposition impugn the record of this Government in fighting tax avoidance in this country. The Leader of the Opposition can go on. He ought to remind himself that in December 1974 his colleague Frank Crean said that the Curran loophole would be closed. It was one of the most extraordinary loopholes that had ever been opened up in our tax law. Yet Frank Crean did nothing about it, Jim Cairns did nothing about it and the Hayden Government did nothing about it. This Government closed that loophole down. This Government, through the campaign that it started in 1978, began to turn the tide. This Government, more than anybody else in the community, has been responsible for hardening community attitudes, for turning the tide, for instilling into the community a much greater sense of outrage and a much greater sense of opposition to tax evasion and tax avoidance practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition says that I announced some taxation changes affecting international tax havens some years ago and that I did not go ahead with them. I presume that the Leader of the Opposition is referring to the proposals I announced a few years ago to introduce a foreign tax credit system. I will tell the Leader of the Opposition and the House why the Government did not go ahead with that proposal. We did not abandon it at the behest of tax evaders; we abandoned it at the behest of many Australian companies that were able to establish to my satisfaction and to the Government's satisfaction that, if that system were introduced, it would do irreparable damage to the investment prospects and opportunities of many Australian companies in South East Asia. That happens to be a very desirable and thoroughly laudable objective. Of course the Leader of the Opposition does not fully understand the circumstances of that matter. His claim that the Government decided to back off from that proposal out of deference to tax evaders and tax avoiders was in fact wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me summarise my response to the Leader of the Opposition in three ways. Firstly, I reject his allegations against me. I reject his claim that I should resign my ministry. I reject his claim that I knew or ought to have known of the circumstances detailed in the Costigan report regarding the process that went on between the Taxation Office and the Crown Solicitor and which is set out in such detail in that report. I remind the Leader of the Opposition and the House that it lies at the heart of his charge against the Government and me that in fact I should have known what was going on; yet the very document on which the Leader of the Opposition has based his claim states that what is wrong with the system is that I cannot find out. I can only say to the Leader of the Opposition that there is a fundamental flaw, fallacy and contradiction in an argument based upon the findings of this Royal Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the House is that the response to this report by the Government has been full and effective. It will be prosecuted with the utmost vigour. Those guilty under the criminal laws that applied at the time will be brought to justice, and indeed the Government will continue with the legislation that it has announced and will be effective in collecting much of the taxation that has been evaded during this period. The third thing that I say to the Leader of the Opposition is that it is by no means certain-we may not know for some years-whether the legal opinions so freely delivered by Mr Costigan in this report will in fact prove to be correct. It will be up to the courts finally to determine whether in fact his legal opinion of the circumstances, or indeed the legal opinion provided to the Government in December 1980, is correct. I believe that this Government has acted with effectiveness, honour and propriety in this situation and I reject the motion of the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, we have just heard a defence against failure. I want to make it clear that every word uttered by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) admitted failure and confirmed what he had already said; that is: 'Of course public opinion was not concerned about this matter. Why should I be?' This is an indictment of the Government. We are not singling out the Treasurer or the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). All honourable members opposite are involved because they have had a lack of interest in the matter as it affects public revenue. Ministerial responsibility, I remind honourable members, does not concern the question of what one knew; it concerns the question of what one ought to have known. The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) is sitting on the back bench now not because of any personal responsibility but because of a failure to get his Department to administer what he should have done. He paid the penalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an axiom of Westminster government that it is no excuse if one cannot perform one's duty and tries to avoid the blame, as the Treasurer has done, by saying that one did not know and was not entitled to know.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would appreciate a little bit of silence. We discovered this loss of revenue virtually by accident; it was discovered by the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The Painters and Dockers Union did not get this revenue. We still have not found out which people got the revenue. Who got the money? Never mind the hit men as they are just the criminals who were involved in getting rid of the evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at the graphs in the Costigan report one will see that a tremendous burden was being placed on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers because the Government was not collecting revenue from the sources which it knows have kept it to themselves. Graph 1 shows that all the taxpayers in Australia have had to subsidise these crooks because an incompetent government could not find out how to collect the revenue. If one looks at Graph 2 one will see that the contributions of companies have been decreasing. This flies in the face of all statistics. This is the reason why the Treasurer and the Government should have known what it was all about. It is a matter of record that the statistics published by the Taxation Commissioner show that the taxable income of individuals increased from $25 billion in 1973-74 to $65 billion in 1979-80. A 300 per cent increase in revenue has come from individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Would not the Treasurer have known of that? Would he not have known that there had been a tremendous increase in the amount of money paid by individuals? He ought to have had a look at other statistics from the Taxation Commissioner-the number of non-taxable private companies. They escalated by 30,000-odd in about five years. Why did we have such a mushrooming growth in the number of non- taxable companies? Would not that have been known? It is a matter of record. Let us look at the taxable income of resident and non-resident private companies. It rose only slightly. Would not one have thought that that would have been of some significance?</PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the annual returns that are lodged with the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission one will see an enormous percentage increase in the number of registrations. In 1976 there was a 48 per cent increase in company registrations, but when one looks at the documents filed by those people who had to comply with the requirements one sees an increase of only 3.5 per cent. How could one get a 48 per cent increase in registrations and an increase of only 3 per cent in the registered particulars of these companies and not be put on notice that something was amiss? That is the real issue. The Government stands indicted for that. It should have known the position. The evidence was there. </PARA>
<PARA> What did the Treasurer say today? He said: 'I see or hear no evil. Even though they are all crook, I do not want to know about it because section 16 of the Act says that I am not entitled to know'. That is utter rubbish! Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act states that the Treasurer is not entitled to know about the position of individuals. He is expected to know about the position concerning the administration of his Department. Section 16 of the Act enables a number of people to get information, whether they be in Papua New Guinea or in any other department. Let us not be hoodwinked by this nonsense that section 16 says that he cannot tell us what is the position. With the Treasurer's permission, many people can obtain information under section 16. Why could not the Treasurer find out about the very elementary situation concerning what had happened to the revenue? That is the point. Mr Costigan stated that there is real danger to the community by the loss of proper ministerial supervision. This is about the loss of proper ministerial supervision. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the scenario concerning the Costigan report. There has been an enormous number of legal opinions. My leader has detailed them. I will go over them again. In 1975 Mr Brinsden, Q.C., stated that the promoter and others should be charged under the Crimes Act and they should also be subjected to civil proceedings. Nothing was done. Page 36 of the report states that the same counsel had also expressed the view, after a request from the Taxation Commissioner's Office in Canberra, that section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act constituted no hindrance to the prosecution. In August 1975 the Commissioner of Taxation advised the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth that it had been decided that action under section 86 of the Crimes Act should be commenced as soon as possible. Nothing was done. Early in 1976 a senior counsel of the Sydney Bar stated that a similar scheme should be attacked by criminal prosecution for conspiracy. In November 1976 a Federal Police report submitted that sufficient documentary evidence was available to prove the conspirators came to an agreement to effect the financial purposes by unlawful means. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1978 the legal opinion from a Queen's Counsel in Victoria clearly indicated that there was conspiracy. It clearly indicated that any transfer of shares pursuant to that conspiracy would be set aside. The Treasurer admitted yesterday that he had knowledge of that opinion as well. There is the evidence going back over the years. Who will be blamed for this? The Government exempts itself and says: 'Well, have a look at the wretched people we have in the various departments'. That is what this means. The Government says: 'They are crooks. They are corrupt'. But who got the money? They did not. I do not know whether the Government will ever investigate them. It might not be a bad idea to have a look at some of their assets and liabilities; one might find that they got some commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at those people. There seems to be some small nexus over in Perth. There were Mr Gleedman, Mr O'Sullivan Snr, Mr O'Sullivan Jnr, Mr Massie and Mr Bercove. Does it not strike one that there is something wrong when the whole concentration of this activity appears to be in Perth? Would one not realise that Canberra knew about it, as it did because it had the legal opinions? Canberra would be administering the Perth office and know what was happening in the various States. Is it not a fact that every matter carried out in a State Crown Solicitor's Office has to be signalled also to the Canberra office? Why is it then that Government members all try to distance themselves from this matter simply because Perth happens to be a couple of thousand miles away and the Government is exempt because of the provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act? Costigan does not exempt the Government. He makes it very clear that there was some sort of lack of communication-that is the easiest way to say it. It was very clearly put on record that legal evidence was available to the Department. Evidence certainly was available to the Crown Solicitor's Office as to what the position was. When we look at this connection in Perth and go back to some of the other issues that flowed from the McCabe-Lafranchi report we see a couple of interesting aspects that relate to Perth. There is a scenario where these people were all guilty; I make the point that they were only the tools of the criminals-the Government has not yet got the real criminals. The criminals are not in the Ship Painters and Dockers Union. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make this point: I say that the real criminals are not the painters and dockers; they are the hit men, the commission agents. Government members know that. They know that the legal opinions that the Government has got said that the Government should be prosecuting those who were guilty of the conspiracy to defraud. The Government has not done that. Why are Government members so anxious to rush for cover to exempt themselves when all they are doing is trying to say to five or six individuals in Perth: 'Well, you must be to blame'? The evidence is that they had phone calls from others. We notice that Mrs Bercove sent documents to an address that could not be located. It was the Commission's responsibility to uncover this evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us come to the point of the McCabe-Lafranchi report. We have had all the discussion about the details of that report. Let us come to the point of discussing some of the details in the McCabe-Lafranchi report. We come to the matter of a group called Corser Homes Pty Ltd. Mr Sydney Corser is very prominent in the Liberal Party. He is the immediate past president of the Party' s finance committee-a most appropriate title. What happened with the disposal of Corser Homes which figures in the McCabe-Lafranchi report? Sydney Corser, another director and the company secretary resigned from Corser Homes on 29 April 1977. The company was sold to the Maher organisation when its name was changed to Keirad Pty Ltd and new directors were appointed. Details of that disposal are on pages 203 and 204 of the McCabe-Lafranchi report. The books and records of the Keirad company went to the bottom of the harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> Documents lodged in the Supreme Court by the appointed liquidator showed that the company had assets of $3.9m and owed unsecured creditors $1.3m. The latter amount mainly comprised unpaid income tax and undistributed profits tax. The liquidator's statements show also that the Taxation Office paid out more than $ 60,000 to Price Waterhouse Associates Pty in fees to the liquidator but has not recovered any money. What about that? We went through the nonsense of appointing the liquidator and we did not get anywhere. Mr Corser, who happens to live in Western Australia, I think might know Mr Gleedman, Mr O'Sullivan Snr, Mr O' Sullivan Jnr, Mr Massie, Mr Bercove and the rest. One would not expect that they were exempt from his knowledge. Honourable members opposite might say there is no evidence. I said I think he might know them because he seemed to have a very charmed life. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will have another go. The second case is Treamog Pty Ltd. Mr Denis Byrne Horgan is the current chairman of the Western Australian Liberal Party finance committee. He also holds many government positions. There are the disposal aspects of Treamog Pty Ltd. In December 1976 shares in Treamog were purchased by a dealer. The director and secretaries, including Horgan, resigned at the end of 1976. But following the purchase by the dealer new directors, including Mr Brian Maher, were appointed. They were replaced on the final sale. The appendices of the McCabe-Lafranchi report show that tax liability of more than $2m could not be collected after the shares in Treamog were sold. Horgan said: 'I am an innocent party'. However, this flies in the face of the McCabe- Lafranchi report which found that all these companies except for two-he was not in those-were purchased from vendors desiring to minimise or avoid the amount of tax payable. That is a crime. There is evidence to prove it. So why is not the Government prosecuting these people, when the legal opinions clearly show it can ? The opinion in the case in England in 1974 called Scott's case clearly showed that if a person wants to defraud the nation of economic benefit he certainly faces a prima facie charge of conspiracy. So why not face up to the facts about what is happening in Western Australia? Are we running tax avoidance measures for the benefit of the Western Australian Liberal Party? Is this the way the Government is running it? Does the Government not really understand that its Attorney-General comes from that area as well? What is it that the Government is trying to cover up? It knows the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government did not waste any time in the Greek conspiracy case. The Government spent $20m with its Attorney-General not being able to get one conviction. The evidence clearly shows now that when the prosecutions were launched against the Greeks there was no prima facie case against them. The Government paid an informer called Nakis $200,000 and gave him a royal pardon. Where does the Government get its sense of justice? What about those people who lost part of their lives because of the Government and its Attorney-General prosecuting and hounding them on the basis of a conspiracy? The Government has lost $6 billion in this matter and it has done nothing about it because all the people concerned are in the Liberal Party. That is the reason. The Government is not fit to govern. It is crook. There is no doubt about that. These factors are within its knowledge. The Government knows that. Is it not impossible to try to tell the people of Australia that the Government could not be expected to know and that it did not know anything about it?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me make this point: The Treasurer makes the plea that he was on the job all the time. Honourable members should have a look at the insulting Press statements he issued in October 1980. Speaking about the Labor Party, in October 1980 he said: 'Hayden and Willis are grandstanding'. Just so that I do not get left out, in the same month he also said that Hawke and Bowen were making extraordinary predictions that the loss of revenue was $1 billion to $3 billion. Our figures were well below the real figure. The Treasurer was saying: 'What utter rubbish'. There are his Press statements. What about it? The amount is at least $6 billion. The Treasurer should not be in the job. He is a lawyer. He knows the position. He ought to understand what the position is. Honourable members should have a look at section 16 and at the many people who can get the evidence. The Treasurer comes in here today with some mealy-mouthed defence saying that he cannot be expected to know. The issue is very clear. The public has paid through the nose for this and will continue to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Prime Minister, through you, Mr Speaker, that there is no need for retrospective legislation. He should look at the four legal opinions within his own knowledge and clearly prosecute those criminals now. He should not exempt them because they are members of the Liberal Party. He should make it very clear that the poor unfortunates, the fall guys in Western Australia, certainly should be punished, and he should look at their assets. I will bet that they have obtained their assets in many cases from sources that are not legitimate. We are also mindful that there are two other volumes of the report which we do not have . I understand that what is happening in Australia is front page news in New York today. I understand that those two volumes relate to crime not only within Australia but also outside Australia in which Australia was involved. They could relate to arms dealing or heroin trafficking. </PARA>

There have been questions on notice relating to whether there were foreign exchange transactions through the Reserve Bank. We seem to be getting a lot of publicity in the United States today. I understand that the amount of money, even though it was substantial, was merely the base on which to get into a massive international operation. The Government has a duty to this nation not to hide anything else by saying that it will pass some retrospective legislation. It owes a duty to the nation to prosecute these people immediately. This will guarantee-they are obviously guilty because they still have the money-that they will begin to disgorge all the ramifications. This matter is not just limited to the well known Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. It relates to those who masterminded the whole scheme, got the money and did not pay the tax. It does not cover only the Treasurer and the Attorney-General. It means that the Government has failed miserably-ostensibly because it has obviously been misled by the Western Australian Crown Solicitor's Office.

If that were not so, I suspect that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) would be one of the very first people to say that the civil liberties of individuals were being trampled upon. Whilst we in this Parliament want to get rid of tax avoiders and tax evaders and the people who participated in these schemes, we need to do it by due process of law. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) ended his remarks by indicating that we had responded to the Costigan report with effectiveness, with honour and with propriety. I am quite certain that the verdict of this Parliament and the verdict through the years will be that those words were fully and totally justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition sought to suggest that, in spite of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Treasurer in particular and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) should have been informed of the details of what was happening. The Treasurer drew attention to paragraph 132 of chapter 3 of the report. I draw attention also to paragraph 10 of chapter 3 which says in very plain terms that the people holding those offices would not have known of the matters that Mr Costigan revealed in his report. So that there can be no doubt about it, I will read the whole paragraph. The Royal Commissioner stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 3.10 It is necessary, before I proceed further, to draw the attention of those who may read this Report to the circumstance that the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act apply with equal force to the Ministers who have charge of the enforcement of the law in this area. I refer in particular to persons holding the office of Treasurer, and of Attorney General. The events to which I am referring took place over a period of 10 years. It will be recalled that during that time there had been a number of incumbents of both those high offices of the State. All of them have been denied access to the detailed information which has now been provided to me, and which has identified the situation described in this Report. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the plain and obvious statement of the Royal Commissioner. There is no point in the Deputy Leader of the Opposition trying to suggest that that is not so-that the Treasurer would nevertheless have been told. Had this Treasurer been told, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), when he was Treasurer, would also have been told. He would have been sitting on guilt for six, seven or eight years. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants to indict this Treasurer on that ground, he indicts his own leader in the process. I would have thought that there were grounds of interest for all members of the Parliament to accept the Royal Commissioner's report and advice on that point and to put the matter aside . </PARA>
<PARA> Because of great concern in the Government and in the community, the Costigan Royal Commission was established on the initiative of this Government with the support of the Victorian Government. There was a public demand for facts. What has come out of the Royal Commission and what has not been published in the reports to which I referred a few moments ago fully justify the appointment of Mr Costigan as Royal Commissioner. The findings that he has come to are important and those in this part of the report have been acted upon with great effect. The matters covered in the report in relation to the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, tax avoiders, the Crown Solicitor's Office and the Australian Taxation Office are obviously matters of the utmost concern. The Government has demonstrated that by the actions that it has taken. To have this kind of situation revealed and to have it existing in the Crown Solicitor's Office, above all the great departments of state, is something which I suggest must be of enormous concern to all honourable members in this House. This is at the heart of the protection of the law. It is at the heart of the upholding of our system of justice. To find Mr Costigan revealing this kind of situation within the Crown Solicitor's Office must give us very great cause for concern. The situation to which Mr Costigan draws attention and which he describes as one of inaction and incompetence is obviously inexcusable. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues, as we know, date back to 1973. It is also worth recording, as the Treasurer did, that the genesis of much tax avoidance was the lack of action in relation to the Curran scheme by Mr Crean and Mr Hayden when they were Treasurers. That gave the initial boost to this industry and let people believe that they could get away with ripping off the rest of society. The Labor record- this needs to be put on record-is one of having done nothing in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I believe that we must all be grateful to the Royal Commission for having given substantial guidance on matters of great importance. As a result of that and as a result of the statement by the Attorney-General yesterday, strong, determined and rapid Government action has been taken. The Government is addressing with more vigour than ever before in Australia's history the basis of crime and anti-social behaviour within Australian society. There has been total support from this Federal Government for Mr Costigan in what he has been doing and for Mr Justice Stewart and his royal commission. The powers of the Costigan Royal Commission were widened when that appeared to be necessary. The secrecy provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act were modified quite specifically to assist Mr Costigan, going against decades of practice and precedent, because we knew that the matters were very serious ones indeed. But we should not forget the other activities in which the Government is involved. I refer to the Williams report, the Stewart report, the Woodward reports, the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking and the proposal for the National Crimes Commission, which will shortly be placed by the Attorney-General before the State Attorneys-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government places the highest importance on the establishment of a Crimes Commission, not just to act as a study group to make reports and references to people but, as I indicated yesterday, to participate also in the preparation of cases for prosecution. I think sometimes there is a misunderstanding in the wider world of the nature and responsibilities of a royal commission in some of these matters. The purpose of royal commissions is to draw the attention of government and other authorities to matters of great significance within the community, but their task has not been to prepare a case for prosecution. People sometimes wonder why prosecution does not immediately follow the tabling of a report. It is because the case has to be prepared for prosecution, evidence has to be collected and it has to satisfy the normal provisions of the law before it can get into the courts. Very often after a royal commissioner's report substantial work needs to be done before prosecutions can be laid. One of the distinguishing features of the Crimes Commission is that it will not be a study group just to make reports. It will be a body that will also participate in the action. I believe and hope that that will have the support of this whole Parliament when the relevant legislation ultimately comes forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The House needs to be reminded that action has been taken by this Government on 26 occasions through over 20 pieces of legislation against over 50 schemes of tax avoidance and tax evasion. I think it is worth recording the appropriateness of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980, which established criminal penalties , including gaol sentences, for the first time in this arena. We need to remind the House of the impact and the effectiveness of the new Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act in preventing this industry from flourishing. I think we also need to remind the House again of the determination of the Government to act if there should be any indication that Part IVA is not adequate for the task for which it is intended. If there is any suggestion that the promoters of tax avoidance schemes can step around or outside the provisions of Part IVA, the Government obviously stands ready to act with speed and efficiency to prevent that from happening. The fact that 1982-83 is the first year for a considerable number of years when the Commissioner of Taxation has felt it not necessary to adjust the revenue for tax avoidance is a significant mark of the success of the legislation which the Treasurer has pioneered and guided through this Parliament . </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed new legislation against the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes will be presented to this Parliament. I know that there can be arguments about whether new legislation is necessary, but because of the nature of the schemes in question I do not particularly mind if the offenders are caught by old legislation as well as by new legislation. If it makes for greater security in catching people who have been involved in these particular processes, then so be it. Let me again draw attention to an opinion of the Crown Solicitor that was given at the end of September 1980. In paragraph 3.85 of Mr Costigan's report he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The information contained in your memorandum is substantially the same as that available when dealing with your memorandum of 9 March 1979 concerning this company. As you have noticed the advice then given was that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of conspiracy to defraud . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>That is one part of the legal advice that was coming forward and which was being operated on within departments at that time. As in so many things there can be conflicting legal advice, but whatever the case of that may be the Government intends to put the situation in relation to these schemes totally beyond doubt. Legislation will be introduced and will be enforced with all the strength, vigour and determination of which this Government and the law enforcement agencies are capable. </PARA>

If the honourable gentleman seeks to run them into one and give them the same author, then it is he who will be misleading this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the Government has taken rapid and effective action in response to this report and the measures will be applied swiftly. Let me run through the actions that are in fact being taken as a result of this report: The Perth Office was investigated by a divisional manager, two officers are suspended, and action is being taken under the Public Service Act. The President of the Law Council of Australia or his nominee will examine the Perth Office, its relationship with the Head Office in Canberra, its relationship with client departments, whichever those departments may be, and if that examination shows the need for further widening of the terms of reference of that examination then they will be so widened. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to the fact, but only in passing, that there was a joint management review of the Crown Solicitor's Office in 1979 and 1980. It is regrettable that in the event there were still substantial problems flowing in spite of the efforts of that management review. The Public Service Board is again examining the staffing and adequacy of facilities available to the Crown Solicitor's Office. A particular counsel has been appointed to assist in advancing prosecutions in particular cases. His brief will be to advise on the evidence and to draw charges. A special prosecutor, assisted by a special task force of lawyers, tax officers and police, is being established to pursue prosecutions in relation to the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Whatever additional staff and resources are needed for this task force will be provided. We seek the support of the States in the work of this task force. I am delighted to know that the Victorian Government has already offered its support. The Royal Commissioner also suggested that there be a further examination of the secrecy provisions, section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and suggested that there be certain additional powers for royal commissions in relation to search warrants and the compulsion of witnesses. These matters are being examined as a matter of urgency and the Government will announce its decisions in relation to them as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commissioner has pointed out that it will not be possible to finish his task by 31 December. If the Victorian Government is willing, the Commonwealth obviously will be prepared to extend the time available to the Royal Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to something which has had very little publicity up to the moment because I think it might in part have been misunderstood. The Attorney- General made it clear in his statement that we are prepared to establish a second task force for other general prosecutions in relation to the workings and findings of the Royal Commissioner. The Attorney has also said that he would like to discuss that matter with the Royal Commissioner before the task force is established. That can be done very speedily because quite obviously there is a wealth of detail and information available to the Royal Commissioner. If he could point that task force in certain directions it would obviously reveal the cases most likely to be fruitful in terms of successful prosecutions in the quickest possible time. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope very much that there can be that kind of co-operation with the Royal Commission. The Government will establish that second task force as a matter of urgency. It would have responsibility for prosecutions. This indicates that the Government is determined to match the resources that are needed against the importance of white collar organised crime. We will not allow this nation to be ripped off as it has been in New South Wales and in other places as a result of the extension of organised crime over recent years. I have already referred to our determination in relation to the national crimes commission. I hope that all the States will stand ready to join with us in that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for the Royal Commission has been highlighted by this report and indeed by other reports which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has in his charge. The nature of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union-the reason for the original establishment of the inquiry-may well have been overshadowed by the substance of this debate and of this Interim Report No. 4, Volume 1. I think it worth while referring to some of the matters in the Royal Commissioner's report relating to the painters and dockers. He speaks of 15 murders and 23 attempted murders between 1970 and 1979. He refers to attempts to steal $2m. He refers to armed robberies and to a statement by Gordon, the Federal Secretary, who said: 'We catch and kill our own'. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Australians would believe that that kind of statement could never have been made within this country but it is the norm for the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Mr Costigan, the Royal Commissioner, states that in Victoria the union is under the control of hardened criminals. He goes on to say that in this way the painters and dockers have assumed for themselves a position outside the law and have maintained that position by violence. We will be seeking to do everything we can to co-operate with the Victorian Government and the Victoria Police, which authorities are most charged to redress that situation because that is within the normal province of police work and law enforcement activities of the States. I hope very much that the Premier of Victoria will be just as avid in his pursuit of those aspects as we have been in relation to tax avoidance and the problems revealed in relation to the Crown Solicitor's Office. There has been much value in the Costigan Commission. The investigations and revelations are vastly disturbing to Australians and to this Government. Within our areas of responsibility we are acting with vigour, with strength and with all the swiftness of which we are capable to put matters right. I look to the Victorian Government to take the same kind of positive action against an organisation which, through the normal processes of the union movement, is affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union reveals a bizarre episode of negligence stretching right back to the earliest days of this Government. We are not talking about the niceties of the due processes of law as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would have it; we are talking about the $ 6 billion which has been defrauded from tax revenue. That fraud has meant that the honest taxpayers in this country have each been denied $1,000. How many taxpayers out in the country would like that additional $1,000? How many of the pensioners in this country living on dog food would like part of that $6 billion ? How many houses could be built with that $6,000m? How many aged persons' places could be provided for? That is what we are talking about. We are talking about the negligence of this Government from the day it took office which has directly resulted in the taxpayers being denied and defrauded of $6 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister now says that we have to pursue the due processes of law. The due processes of law were commenced in Perth in 1975. The police, the Crown Solicitor's Office and the taxation inspectors were involved. They all recommended that action be taken according to the due processes of law. But from the day that this Government took office that process came to a grinding halt. The Prime Minister says that the Government, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) knew nothing about it. He says that the reason they knew nothing about it was the so-called secrecy provisions of the taxation law. The secrecy provisions say that the Minister is not entitled to know and is not entitled to inquire about the details of the persons who are under investigation. It does not say that the Minister cannot be informed or cannot inquire about the general circumstances of prosecutions which might be contemplated by the officers of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> We still do not know the details of the cases which Costigan has revealed. We still do not know which companies were under contemplation for prosecution. Costigan himself has abided by these secrecy provisions. So we are no further advanced. Yet, thanks to Costigan, the people of Australia and this Parliament now know what the Treasurer and the Attorney-General almost certainly knew way back in 1976, 1977 and 1978. Nothing has changed. The secrecy provisions have not been revoked; they still exist. The Treasurer would have been entitled to inquire about and would almost certainly have been informed by his officers of the general conduct of those prosecutions which were under contemplation at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> If we take the Prime Minister's point to its logical conclusion we would not know a damn thing about any tax avoidance in this country even now. Yet the Government wants to pride itself on the action that it has taken, not because it has known of the individual circumstances of tax avoidance and evasion but because it now knows belatedly of the general circumstances. That information was available to the Government way back in 1976 when this Government first came to office. Yet this Government, acting under the pressure of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, ensured that those actions came to a grinding halt. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not necessary for the Government to be advised of these impending prosecutions through its officers; it would have been told by the people who were about to be prosecuted. In the newspapers of the last few weeks advertisements scream protest at this Government about the action that it is proposing in relation to the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Do honourable members think for a moment that the influential members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia who knew that they were about to be prosecuted, if Todman and Brinsden had their way, were not applying a little bit of gentle pressure to Liberal Party politicians in this place? Let us have a look at who those people were. Let us see who were the influential members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. They were not only influential members of the Liberal Party but also active participants in these schemes. Syd Corser got away with $0.89m which was destined for the revenue. Denis Horgan got away with $0.75m which was destined for the Federal revenue. As has already been said by my colleagues, they were the consecutive chairmen of the Liberal Party's finance committee; very important people in the scheme of things in the Liberal Party. They were the bag men and they were also crooks. They knew what was at stake. They knew how important it was to raise the money to support the Liberal Party to try to keep the Labor Party out because it was only when they had the Liberal Party in office in Canberra that they could twist the arms of Ministers in this Government and ensure that the prosecution which would inevitably have been aimed at them in the end would not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this fellow O'Sullivan who works in the Crown Solicitor's Office . He worked on Mr Martyr's campaign; he is an active campaigner for the Liberal Party. Do honourable members think he would not have known who Horgan or Corser were? Do honourable members think he had good reason for sitting on those files? Do honourable members think his colleagues did not have good reason for sticking the incriminating evidence in the bottom drawer of their desks where it gathered dust for seven years until Costigan, and Costigan's persistence, ensured that that file was brought out? The revelations in that file have uncovered the incompetence and the link which takes this tax avoidance right to the corrupt heart of the Liberal Party in Colin Street, West Perth. That is where it all comes from; that is what it is all about. Who are the people Corser and Horgan could have leaned on? First of all there is Durack himself-the Attorney-General, a Western Australian. He is not a favoured son of the hierarchy of Western Australia, that is for sure. He survived his preselection by only one vote because he was opposed by another crook-by Crichton-Browne, the former president of the party--</PARA>

Honourable members cannont tell be that he was not applying pressure and preselection threats to Durack in relation to this matter. That is why Durack did nothing and pretends not to know. That is why Durack sat on the file and did nothing about it. Then there is Viner, the Minister for Defence Support who would be only too happy to get his grubby hands in any deal that was passing by. He was in the Ministry for the whole of this period and in the Cabinet in recent times. Honourable members cannot tell me he did not know what was going on or that he was not interested in protecting his mates and indeed the organisation of which he was a captive in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then we come to Garland, his excellency Sir Ransley Victor Garland, now in London. What a disgrace! He was one of the members of the Government as well. He not only had to resign his ministry at one stage because he was caught trying to bribe someone in the Australian Capital Territory in relation to an election but also he is involved up to his neck in tax avoidance. If the honourable members look at the McCabe-Lafranchi report they will see that the same people whom Garland was engaging to wind up his companies in order to asset strip those companies-the same solicitors and accountants-were involved in the Treamog Ltd operation. The same addresses in Melbourne kept bobbing up, and all this was at a time when Garland was getting very edgy about his continued presence in this place back in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> On 10 September 1980 I asked Mr Garland what had happened and what were the curious circumstances surrounding the winding up of his companies-the transfer of ownership of those companies to some of the very same people whom Corser and Horgan involved in their tax dodging exercises. He said I was trying only to denigrate him and that I was only reflecting on his reputation. It was not more than two months later that he was out of this House. But Fraser, the Prime Minister, obviously got to him and said: 'What is all this about? Are you up to your neck in tax avoidance too?' Garland said yes, he was. The Prime Minister said: 'You had better go to London. We will have to have a by-election for your seat'. Good heavens, did that not set the hares running in Western Australia? The crooks and the others in the Western Australian Liberal Party each wanted their own to get up as the candidate for Curtin. The crooks won and we now have Allan Rocher in this House. </PARA>

As a result of trying to protect influential people in the Liberal Party in Western Australia, Perth became a tax dodgers' haven and, worse than that, the reputation of the entire Perth business community has been dragged through the mud in order to protect a few favoured friends of the Liberal Party. Perth was reeling last night and this morning under the revelations included in the Costigan report. Perth has become a notorious place for tax dodging, for criminal activities and for crookery in high places. Let us look at some of the people involved. Syd Corser has been appointed to State government instrumentalities for years; if fact he was such a terific chairman of the finance committee that they named him an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1978. That is how good he was an that is how important it was to protect him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at Horgan. Horgan continues not only to sit on boards controlled by this Government but also was appointed to the latest one as recently as February 1982 when he was appointed to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He is a member of the Australian Industry Development Corporation, Aussat Pty Ltd, the Australian-Japan Foundation, the Australian Manufacturing Council, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Advisory Council and the Project Australia Committee. That is terrific, is it not? The Project Australia Committee tries to give Australia a better reputation, a better sense of self respect, a better sense of propriety and honour, and one of its members is a crook from the Liberal Party and, unfortunately, also happens to be a crook from Western Australia. That is what is involved. The Government is under no illusion about Horgan's activities. It has known ever since the McCabe-Lafranchi report about Horgan being up to his neck in this sort of activity, yet he has continued to be a member of all those public bodies, enjoying presumably, the confidence of the Treasurer, the Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown), the Prime Minister and a gaggle of other Ministers who have continued to turn a blind eye to his continuing activities. It is not as though he does not get anything out of it; he gets $90 a day every time he travels on the Government's behalf. He also gets $30,000 a year by way of fees of one kind or another. This is no great sacrifice; he is not only into the Australian Taxation Office for $ 750,000 but also continues to get $30,000 for his apparent public service to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members do not have to take my word for the extent to which the Liberal Party in Western Australia is into tax avoidance. Senator Withers is a long-standing representative in this Parliament from Western Australia. Senator Withers said that he would not be surprised if all of his parliamentary colleagues were involved in tax dodging. He said he was not involved in it but he would not be surprised if all the others were. He is a fairly authoritative source, I should have thought, and Senator Withers says that his colleagues are the ones involved in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at who is organising this campaign to oppose the bottom-of-the- harbour legislation-none other than W. W. Mitchell. It is true that W. W. Mitchell, apart from being a senior adviser to the former Court Government and a continuing senior adviser to the O'Connor Government, ripped off the public purse for consultancy fees one way or another often over the past 10 years or so . But I doubt whether W. W. Mitchell is wealthy enough to fund the sort of advertisements which have appeared in the Melbourne Age and all other national newspapers. I would not be at all surprised if Mr Horgan were a very generous donor to the campaign to oppose this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question that this campaign, which is now being orchestrated out of Victoria Avenue in Perth with Liberal Party money and with Liberal Party support, is designed to protect those influential members of the Liberal Party who are in danger of being caught, who are in danger-God spare us- of having to pay the tax which they should have paid six or seven years ago. That is what they are grizzling about. It is a tax liability that they knew they had. It is a tax liability which they organised themselves out of. Now they are squealing because the legislation that is proposed will catch up with them at last. It goes right to the head of the Liberal Party in Western Australia because O'Connor-the Premier of Western Australia-has expressed his opposition to the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister can talk all he likes about getting co-operation from the States in relation to one of the million task forces he is intending to set up. He will not get too much co-operation from the Premier of Western Australia in relation to task forces, crimes commissions or anything else because Ray O' Connor has too many friends to look after and he will not co-operate with anybody who has those people in their sights. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to pretend that this situation is only occurring in Western Australia. It is partly fortuitous that the Costigan Commission stumbled across what is going on in Western Australia. We are talking about the activities of one Perth-based promoter. Of course Horgan was unlucky enough to get caught up in the McCabe-Lafranchi report only because his company was, unhappily, registered in Victoria. Otherwise no one would have ever known. We in Western Australia are a bit like the painters and dockers. We are not all that bright. We do not think for a moment that we could be bright enough to be masterminding all this crookery. If it is going on in Western Australia-in little old Perth- one can bet one's bottom dollar that it is going on at 100 miles an hour in Sydney and Melbourne and other places. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen here is just the western tip of the iceberg, a huge iceberg which has defrauded the taxpayers of this country of about $6 billion. We do not want to hear any more about task forces or crimes commissions. We are interested in getting that money back and in getting those crooks who did not pay it right into jail where they belong. That is the issue that is involved here and that is the reason why no action has been taken. The people who have been involved have been Liberal Party friends; they have been very influential. Honourable members do not think for one moment that they would resort to these screaming headlines that we see in advertisements in recent days if the Liberal Party had not been able to keep them at bay for all these years. Of course it has kept the Attorney -General, the Treasurer and the Minister for Defence Support-the only one who was caught was Garland and he had to go to London-at bay to protect their friends. What is needed now is a bit of dedication and an end to the negligence. That is absolutely true. There is only one party which does not have any friends to protect in relation to tax avoidance and that is the Labor Party. It will only be the Labor Party which gets back the $6 billion and which gets the crooks behind bars. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only question here is the question that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has put to the House in the course of his speech. That is this: The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) knew of the failure to institute proceedings to recover tax money and the failure to institute prosecutions. Upon that proposition he has staked his parliamentary reputation. He has done this by asserting his own personal belief that the details of failures within the Departments would have been known to the Attorney-General and the Treasurer. So we can put to one side some of the things that have been said by his minions. I would not worry about that squalid object, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), and what he has said to the House. There is very little that needs to be said about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) save for the fact that he would not follow his own leader because he knew that there was no substance to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are not here concerned with what the law is or whether Mr Costigan is right or wrong. We are not here concerned with whether prosecutions should have taken place or will take place. Of course anyone who has broken a law should be prosecuted. Of course if those people who have been identified in Mr Costigan's report on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union have broken the law they should be prosecuted. This Government has set up a task force for the purpose of making sure, amongst other things, that that has been done. As I say we are concerned only with this one question because that is the way in which the Leader of the Opposition has put it and that is the way in which he places his parliamentary reputation on the line. He would have the people of this country-not just members of parliament-believe that the Attorney- General and the Treasurer were parties to what could only be described as a cover-up. That is a disgraceful assertion; it is a groundless assertion: And he knows it. The Leader of the Opposition could point to no part of Mr Costigan's report or to any other material whatsoever to support in the least that assertion. </PARA>
<PARA> To start off with let us have a look at the time frame. The Leader of the Opposition said: 'This is absolutely outrageous. You knew about it. You would have been told about these things'. When did these bottom-of-the-harbour schemes start? It was first established in 1973 that these schemes were in operation. That was when they were first detected. When did the investigations come to fruition? That was in 1974. Who was in power then and what did those in power know? Nothing, of course, for the very good reason that they would not be told about the details of particular prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> If one has any doubt about that, let us go to page 27 of Mr Costigan's report where he refers to investigations made by the Senior Investigation Officer of the Australian Taxation Office in Perth and to the fact that his investigations reached fruition in mid-1974 by which time he had interviewed most of the participants. What did he find? He found the stripping operations that Mr Costigan examined; proceedings were taken; and judgment was entered. Costigan reports:</PARA>
<PARA> Upon the issue of the taxation assessments for a later period of time, the amount of taxation not paid was in excess of $300,000. </PARA>
<PARA>So that was all known and it was known at the time of the Labor Government. In Christmas 1974, Mr Brinsden gave his opinion. He gave a further opinion in June 1975 and in August 1975, the position was set up for a test case. Does the Leader of the Opposition, who then if I recall correctly was the Treasurer of this country, assert that he knew anything about this important test case? Of course not! Why did he not know anything about it? He did not know because as he knows very well in ordinary practice that sort of detail would not be brought to his attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the report. The report in no place supports the assertion that has been made by the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Indeed the Deputy Leader would not face up to the proposition of supporting his leader. Honourable members may recall that he used the expression : 'Why distance yourself?' That is an expression that could have been applied, with great accuracy, to what he was doing because he was distancing himself from his leader and his leader's assertions against the Treasurer and against the Attorney-General. He knows it and everybody else in this House knows it. Why did he do that? Because he is frank enough and honest enough to know that there was no possible basis in what was being said by the Leader of the Opposition against the Treasurer and the Attorney-General. I suppose that even the members of the Opposition would realise that for the Treasurer and the Attorney-General to know of this grave failure to prosecute somebody must have told them the underlying facts. If one looks at the report on pages 61 and 62 one will find what Mr Costigan had to say on a point of central importance. What was that point? It was the failure in his view of the Canberra office to supervise adequately what was taking place elsewhere. Let me direct honourable members' attention to what was said. On page 61 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that, at this point, I should indicate my conclusions as to the manner in which Mr O'Sullivan handled this matter and then turn to how this matter was finally disposed of by the Crown Solicitor's Office. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Costigan then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The conduct of the matter by the Canberra Office of the Crown Solicitor's Office cannot escape criticism either. </PARA>
<PARA>What was his finding upon that matter? It appears at page 62. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of proper supervision at either the Head Office of the Crown Solicitor , or at the Deputy's Office, leaves me without any confidence that Mr Bercove-</PARA>
<PARA>We all remember who Mr Bercove was-</PARA>
<PARA>could not have done as he pleased without fear of detection. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 62 Mr Costigan speaks of the lack of proper supervision. That is the essence of the complaint made by him against the senior officers in the Office. If there was a lack of proper supervision and if, because of the lack of supervision, senior officers down the line did not know what was happening, how could those senior officers ever be in a position to tell the Attorney-General or the Treasurer anything at all? The answer, of course, is that they could not.</PARA>
<PARA> If one wanted to sum up the position one could say that the demonstrable dishonesty of the case that is sought to be made against the Attorney-General and the Treasurer is established in three ways, and established beyond doubt to any reasonable or fair-minded person. I exclude all members of the Opposition for that purpose. First of all, there is the failure to point to any evidence in Mr Costigan's report. Does anybody think that if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Fremantle or the Leader of the Opposition could find anything at all in that report to hang an assertion on they would not have referred us to it? After all, they have probably done little else in the last 24 hours but comb through the report looking for things to say. What do we hear? We hear in the main squalid, disgusting and unsubstantiated assertions made against people outside this House by people who should know better and whose conduct-I refer in particular to the honourable member for Fremantle-is a disgrace to this House. The honourable member should never have been here in the first place. That is the first point. That demolishes the case. There was an utter failure to refer to anything in that wide-ranging and very frankly and very candidly expressed report. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, let us go to the positive finding in the report that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) referred to. I will give it just a little bit more emphasis. It is to be found on page 24 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary, before I proceed further, to draw the attention of those who may read this Report to the circumstance that the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act apply with equal force to the Ministers who have charge of the enforcement of the law in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>That, I interpolate, was the burden of one of Mr Costigan's major complaints against the Income Tax Assessment Act. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer in particular to persons holding the office of Treasurer, and of Attorney-General. The events to which I am referring took place over a period of 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that for three of those years the Australian Labor Party was in government. I for one do not suggest that any Minister of the Labor Party had knowledge of any of the matters referred to in that report. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> It will be recalled that during that time there had been a number of incumbents of both those high offices of the State. All of them have been denied access to the detailed information which has now been provided to me, and which has identified the situation described in this Report. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: All of them have been denied that detailed information. It would be hard to find a more positive and a more demonstrably exonerating finding than that. We will hear nothing in answer to that finding from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is, as honourable members will be aware and as has been referred to, in the taxation Act a variety of provisions concerning secrecy. One of the matters which concerned Mr Costigan very greatly and to which he has referred is the need to amend the law. Why is it necessary in his view to amend the law? Because of what the Act says and how the Act is administered. I have just referred to a positive finding which establishes beyond any doubt that the Treasurer and the Attorney-General did not know and could not have known the circumstances which have been revealed in this report. On that point Mr Costigan makes his views crystal clear on page 95. Part of this page has been quoted; I will quote some other parts. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of the secrecy provisions is the part preventing the Minister of the Crown from exercising supervisory powers over the administration of his department. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Costigan thinks that is wrong. He thinks the law needs to be amended. He thinks that the Act should be changed in ways which are radical in terms of the traditional manner of looking at the secrecy provisions. Whether his views are right or wrong as to what should be done is neither here nor there. He is making a positive finding there as to how the Act has operated. After reviewing the way in which the Act operates he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, it is my firm proposal and strong recommendation that the secrecy provisions be lifted so as to allow full access to all information held by the Taxation Office to the Treasurer and where appropriate to the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA>Those parts of the report make it perfectly plain that the Treasurer and the Attorney-General not only did not know of the matters that form the basis of this so-called censure motion but also could not have known of those matters. They could not have known because of the way the law stood and how the law was interpreted, administered and applied. Nobody will come to this House and say that the law has been applied, that the secrecy provisions of the Taxation Office have been applied, in any other way. Anyone who has the least personal understanding of how the Taxation Office operates, anyone who has appeared or who has advised the Commissioner of Taxation, will know of the very high level of secrecy which the Commissioner of Taxation imposes on the administration of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion is no more than an attempt to vilify a number of individuals on a transparently false basis. I challenge any member of the Opposition to come forward and to refer to any part of Mr Costigan's report which supports the censure motion. If they cannot find it after exhaustive investigations we can be certain that it has not been established-that the evidence is not there and that the facts are not there. I challenge any member of the Opposition to come forward and to refer to any part of the report which supports the censure motion . Such a part is not there and each member of the Opposition knows it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. The honourable member was not interrupted. He should just wait and he will get his serve. Before I do that, let me, by way of setting, quote to the House what the right honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Prime Minister, said in the House in July 1975:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ten per cent or even fifty per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this parliament and the Australian people as a downright lie. The half truth; and the partial answer, and the skipping over of the full facts are a misleading of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>If we have seen anything at all in this debate it is certainly the skipping over of the full facts. In terms of the judgment of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in July 1975 that constitutes a misleading of this House. I suggest that this Government, in terms of this censure motion, has no moral right to occupy or any administrative justification for occupying for another day the Treasury benches of this country. Let us go straight to the heart of this matter. We are censuring the Government. We are saying that the Government should resign. In terms of making the accusation that the Government has reached the point where resignation is necessary, it is essential to relate that to the issue before the House. Under seven years of this Government what have we, as Australians, witnessed? What has been the justification put forward by the apologists for this Government for those things which have happened?</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, let us see, in fact, what has happened. Against all the promises that were made at the end of 1975 we have a rate of unemployment which has increased by 50 per cent. But what is most disastrous and most relevant to this motion is the fact that we have had the spread of poverty in this country-the doubling of poverty-to the extent that more than two million of our fellow Australians now live in identifiable poverty. That is what has happened. What has been the justification given by this Government for tolerating the emergence of two million people living in poverty? It has been this and simply this: That the Government has done all that it possibly can. It says that it has acquired all the financial capacity to do things for the underprivileged of this country that it possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this report, which is the basis of the censure motion, now reveal in response to that justification which has been put forward by the Government? The very essence of what this report shows is that if this Government had been about its business and if the Ministers directly involved in the relevant departments had been responsible and had discharged their responsibilities, there would have been available to this Government, during its life, an amount in excess of $10 billion. It is quite clear that if the Government, through its Ministers, had done its job properly we could have eliminated absolutely financial poverty in this country. That is what is at the guts of this censure motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The report shows that the dereliction of duty which has been engaged in by those Ministers and which has been endorsed by this Government is such that it has brought about that situation in Australia in which we have two million of our fellow Australians living in poverty. Alternatively, if the laws had been properly applied and the revenue of the Commonwealth had been assumed in the way that it should have been, that poverty could have been eliminated. There could not be any more substantial justification for a censure motion of this Government, which has been put forward by the Opposition, than what is involved in this matter. Clearly, the censure motion shows that if these Ministers and the Government had done what they should have done we could have eliminated poverty in this country. There could be no greater justification for a motion of this kind than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look in more detail at the substantiation which is available on this matter. Before I do that let me make it quite clear, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) did in passing-he obviously could not spend much time upon it because he had to go over a great many matters-in respect of the substance of this report which deals with the trade union in issue, that the Opposition takes exactly the same view in respect of what is revealed in regard to that union and its members who have been engaged in criminal activity which warrants prosecution as it does in respect of those who have been engaged in tax evasion and other criminal activities associated with it. I suggest that it is a matter of some regret that the Government, in introducing this report, could find only vigorous language to use to direct against the unions. In the statement of the Minister for Communications and Minister Assisting the Attorney -General (Mr N.A. Brown) is a reference which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Volume 1 deals with the Commission's knowledge and findings on some aspects of the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, its members and persons associated with them. It describes a history of violence-</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to note this part particularly-</PARA>
<PARA>and the ruthless means by which members of the Union have arrogated to themselves a position outside the law. </PARA>
<PARA>To the extent that union members have done that and to the extent that their officials have been involved in it, the course of the law should be pursued. But is it not a matter of enormous pity that the Minister, in introducing this matter, and the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the other members speaking on behalf of the Government today, could not have mounted some of the same enthusiasm of language in talking about the tax evaders and those sustaining them in a way in which those people-to quote the Minister-'have arrogated to themselves a position outside the law'?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us come to the guts of the only defence which has been put forward to the charges that have been advanced by the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the other speakers on this side of the House. There is a pathetic attempt, echoed by the last speaker the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), that really it is all to be excused on the basis of that little section in the Income Tax Assessment Act- section 16. The last speaker has challenged us by asking: 'If you look at the report can you find anything at all in it which will overcome that sort of defence which you have put forward? If honourable members opposite had had the intelligence and the perspicacity but, more importantly, the desire to read the report they certainly could have found the answer to the question they put forward. They only had to go to the preceding paragraph and I direct their attention to it. The Prime Minister quoted from paragraph 3.10. It is best that it be put entirely in its context. This is the paragraph which the last speaker wanted us to go to. The paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary, before I proceed further, to draw the attention of those who may read this Report to the circumstance that the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act apply with equal force to the Ministers who have charge of the enforcement of the law in this area. I refer in particular-</PARA>
<PARA>Said Commissioner Costigan-</PARA>
<PARA> to persons holding the office of Treasurer, and of Attorney General. The events to which I am referring took place over a period of 10 years. it will be recalled that during that time there had been a number of incumbents of both of those high offices of the State. All of them have been denied access to the detailed information which has now been provided to me, and which has identified the situation described in this Report. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the only defence which has been put forward by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and other speakers in regard to this situation. But if honourable members look at the preceding paragraph and read that sensibly they can see that that demolishes the argument which the Government seeks to found upon paragraph 3.10. What did the Commissioner say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am subject to a duty to investigate into matters such as these and to report upon them. I cannot properly discharge that duty without setting out in detail the facts upon which my conclusions are based. Yet I am restricted by the operation of Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act so as to set out those facts in such a manner that no person can reasonably identify the taxpayer concerned. Accordingly, although I set out the facts in detail, together with dates and places, I have refrained from identifying the taxpayer or the tax promoter. </PARA>
<PARA>There is the answer to the Government's question. The Commissioner says that the operation of section 16 is confining and restricting him in the same way, presumably, as section 16 operated in May 1978 when the Commissioner of Taxation , it is said, first acquainted the Treasurer with details of about these things. Section 16 was operating then. It is operating now in respect of the Royal Commissioner. Section 16 is concerned with any significant details about the individual concerned. But there is no way in the world in which in 1978 the existence of section 16 prevented the dimensions of what was occurring being brought to the attention of the Treasurer. There is no way that the operation of section 16 has prevented the Royal Commissioner setting out the dimensions of the loss of revenue to this day. I remind the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the honourable member for North Sydney that he did that in his third interim report before section 16 has been subsequently amended. In other words, the fact that section 16, directed towards stopping the provision of details in respect of an individual, existed did not preclude the Treasurer himself being approached on this matter at least as early as may 1978. It did not in its unamended form prevent the Royal Commissioner exposing last year and before the dimensions of what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no way in which any intelligent person can say that when the Attorney- General and the Treasurer were approached, as they were, with suggestions as to the dimensions of the problem existing they were not in a position to form a judgment that investigations had been taking place which showed the dimension of the problem and that they were not informed of the inquiries that were taking place within the Attorney-General's Department and the Solicitor-General's Department. One must come to one of two conclusions-either they were told about the inquiries that originated back in 1973-74 and the recommendations that had been made by Brinsden and the other Queen's Counsel or, if they were not informed, they were so grossly incompetent that their resignations should be required on the basis of incompetence. One has to have it one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot imagine in terms of the report that the Ministers responsible did not have the competence to be alerted by what was said to them at least as early as May 1978. Either they were told or, if they were not told, they failed in terms of the competence one requires of Ministers dealing with a situation which is not peripheral. Has $1m or $2m been lost? At least $10m has been lost to Commonwealth revenue. And the Government wants to say to this House and the people of Australia: 'Well, I am sorry'. This has been going on. The Treasurer concedes that the matter was raised in May 1978. But the Government wants this House and this country to say, 'Well, that is something that we will cop because they did not know and if they did not know there is no question of their competence being an issue'. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is also raised of whether, in fact, there was some way in which the Australian Labor Party could be criticised because nothing was done in the period when it was in office. Let us refer to the report on this matter. We can dispose of this question very quickly. It arises under the heading on page 33 of the report 'The Lamentable History of Non-Prosecution'. The only point in the Royal Commissioner's report at which there is reference to action being taken is in the period when the Labor Government was in office. Page 36 of the report refers to the second opinion of Mr Brinsden, Q.C. He had already given one opinion in 1974 and he was asked for another. Honourable members should remember what this Queen's Counsel had said. I read from paragraph 3.27:</PARA>
<PARA> He delivered his opinion between Christmas and the New Year. </PARA>
<PARA>This was at the end of 1974. The paragraph continues:</PARA>
<PARA> His firm advice was that the promoter and two others should be charged with a breach of Section 86 (e) of the Crimes Act, and that they should be subjected to certain civil proceedings which I will describe later. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 3.29 refers to the second opinion which Mr Brinsden gave in June 1975. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> He expressed the view that Section 16 of the Income Tax Act constituted no hindrance to the prosecution. His opinion was transmitted to Canberra to the Commissioner of Taxation a month later. Three weeks later the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth was instructed: '. . . it has been decided that action under section 86 of the Crimes Act . . . should be commenced against (the three men) as soon as possible'. </PARA>
<PARA>Action was in fact initiated and authorisation given in the period when the Labor Government was in office, because in the next few words the Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was August 1975. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in the whole of this report the only time when action has been indicated by the Royal Commissioner as having been taken and authorised was in the period of the labor Government. It is the period since to which the words: ' The Lamentable History of Non-Prosecution' are applied. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the opinion from Brinsden, Q.C. He went on to become a supreme court judge. As my Deputy Leader and Leader have indicated, we have the opinions from senior counsel. The only things against those opinions in this whole process were clearly the opinions and obfusction of people whose integrity-I will not name them; they have already been named-has been brought absolutely into question, the officers in Perth who made sure that the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes were not brought to justice by adopting a bottom-of-the-drawer approach. Knowledge of those schemes was put away in the bottom of the drawer. At no point has there been any attempt on the part of the Treasurer, the Attorney-General or the Prime Minister in his speech here today to justify any competent Minister, who within his department had unqualified advice from senior counsel whose competence could not be called into question and against which advice the only thing that existed was some obfuscation from a junior, a public servant in the office in Perth, not accepting the principles of the Westminster system. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us as we come to the later stages of this debate ask ourselves what they are. Are the principles of the Westminster system those which were referred to in 1972 by the gentleman who is now the Prime Minister. He said then that if there is any blunder in the department concerned the system requires that the Minister should accept the responsibility and tender his resignation. Did he mean that then or did he not? Does the Government now say that it is appropriate for a party to have one set of principles when it is in Opposition but not to apply them when it is in Government? Quite clearly, in 1972 Mr Fraser held the view that if there was a blunder in a department the Minister should tender his resignation. Is it a question of definition? Do we have to spend much time suggesting that the loss of $10 billion-the acquisition of which could have eliminated poverty in this country-and the refusal to collect it when there was advice from senior counsel to do so was not a blunder? Does that not qualify as the type of situation which the Prime Minister said demanded the offering of the resignation of the Minister in question? Have we not the situation the Prime Minister talked about in July of 1975 when he said that the skipping over of the full facts are a misleading of the Parliament? It simply is not good enough for the Treasurer to say in this House 'Yes, I did know from May of 1978; I did get some indication that there was a case for prosecution' and to come up with the lame excuse that the reason something was not done was that there was a view amongst some members of the Government to the effect that new legislation was not needed to remedy the situation. By any view what has come out in the fourth interim report of the Costigan Royal Commission, which was set up to chase the unions but which has now brought the Government to a situation where it should resign, is that both the Ministers in question should tender their resignations and the Government should resign.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the words of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) there is no indication whatsoever in the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and on certain tax matters that there is any implication for any Minister of the Crown. The honourable member for Wills has clearly enunciated the restrictions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and he has clearly presented the case for why a Treasurer or an Attorney-General does not have access to the facts to which he claimed they should have access. By linking Mr Costigan with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and saying that they are of equal standing, have the same competence, the same powers and the same access to information, he has completely misrepresented the powers of the Royal Commissioner. Members of the House and all associated with this matter see that that is a completely fallacious argument. There is no way in which a royal commissioner seeking information and given special powers by the Parliament and the Government can be linked with a Minister; nor can it be said that the Royal Commissioner has the same powers as a Treasurer on matters of secrecy or as an Attorney-General on matters which have been dealt with by the Crown Solicitor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us extend the argument advanced by the honourable member for Wills and seek to establish in our own minds whether it would be proper for the Treasurer to have detailed and precise information on the tax matters of any individual. I can imagine a Treasurer, without the ethics or commitment to the task that the present Treasurer has, vilifying and abusing individuals sitting in the chamber, using information that had been provided under the circumstances that the honourable member for Wills proposes, under the circumstances that the honourable member for Wills maintains apply at this moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wills should not misrepresent his own argument. He has misrepresented the case of Costigan and the Treasurer, the Honourable John Howard. It seems to me that no person in this place seriously advances the argument that a Treasurer or an Attorney-General should know the details of cases that are before the Crown or facts about the income of and income tax paid by individuals. Is that the argument that the honourable member for Wills is advancing? It seems to me that he argued, on the one hand, that there should be some discrete relationship between the Commissioner of Taxation and the Treasurer and, on the other hand, that there has been knowledge, that there must be knowledge and that knowledge is desirable. That is not factual. He knows it is not factual. His arguments are fallacious. Neither the Treasurer nor the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has been connected by this report in any way with the actions of their departments and the officers who are responsible for them. They cannot be so linked, nor have they been so linked by the Royal Commissioner. Certainly there has been a massive case of negligence, a sorry story of misapplication; and perhaps some criminal or untoward activity is hinted at in Western Australia. These matters have to be investigated. They must be nailed, and the individuals who are or were public servants must be brought to book.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us assess this matter and examine exactly where it began. The lamentable story began in early 1973, as the Royal Commissioner said. By mid-1974 the investigation officer, Mr Todman, decided that he would seek legal advice. He sought that legal advice. Not only did he advise the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Western Australia, the head of the Taxation Office there, but also he advised the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Western Australia. That was in September 1974. However, having advised those people during the term of the Labor Government, having advised the senior officers of the two departments involved of his concern, further information was sought and Mr Brinsden was required to prepare an opinion for the Deputy Crown Solicitor. This he did over Christmas 1974. But in May and June he was required to give further information. The report of the Royal Commissioner states:</PARA>
<PARA> A request was made for further opinion from counsel on that matter, to which he immediately attended and delivered his opinion on 25 June 1975, within three weeks of the brief being delivered . . . Three weeks later the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth was instructed: . . . 'it has been decided that action under section 86 of the Crimes Act . . . should be commenced against (the three men)' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was in June 1975. Later on, however, if we become aware of matters that were proceeding at the same time, it became obvious that not only were the officials in Perth advised of these matters but also the Commissioner of Taxation and the Crown Solicitor in Canberra were made aware of them. In mid- 1975, six months before the fall of the Labor Government, these facts were known in Canberra by the utmost senior officials of those departments. No action followed. Nothing was done by those officials. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine who the Ministers of the day were. I will tell the House who the Ministers responsible for this incompetence were. In 1973 when this matter first became known the Treasurer was Frank Crean. Later it was James Ford Cairns. Later again in 1975 it was William George Hayden. In fact for six months the senior officers of the Taxation Office and the Attorney-General's Department knew about these matters. Nothing was done. Why was nothing done? Why were those Treasurers not advised? I use against the honourable member for Wills the same arguments that he used against the current Treasurer. The simple fact is that they were not advised because they are not entitled to be advised. The provisions of the Act under which the Crown Solicitor works are such that they are not advised. Why was Hayden not advised?</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Attorney-General of the day. When this matter began Lionel Keith Murphy was Attorney-General. He was not advised. Why did he not take action? The second Attorney-General was Keppel Earl Enderby, Q.C. I am advised that Mr Enderby, when he was Attorney-General or Minister for Industry and Commerce, made the enlightening statement that exports come from abroad! What a delightful statement! There is no responsibility on these men that I have named nor is there any responsibility on the Treasurer or the Attorney-General. There is not responsibility on them; and Costigan says there is not. He hints not one bit at it nor does he indicate that there is a responsibility for a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion of censure is a fallacious motion. What has happened during this period? I consider that the Royal Commissioner, during the period of his investigation, dealt not only with tax matters but also with matters from which the Australian Labor Party seeks to divert us. He dealt with matters of great importance for the behaviour of senior officials within one of the union movements in Australia. They are matters with which I consider the Labor Party does not want to deal. They concern the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. This motion is a smokescreen by the Australian Labor Party to divert attention from one of those bodies which are affiliated with it, and which contributes to its funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I have extracted, in a fairly concise way and to the best of my ability, information from the balance sheets of various unions and have tried to assign their affiliation funds and political funds, as the unions prescribe and allocate them to the Australian Labor Party. Let us take the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union. it is interesting to note that in 1979 it paid out to the Australian Labor Party a mere $77 000 in one fund and $192 000 in another fund. The following year it made payments of $116 000 and $224 000. I can provide similiar figures for the Builders Labourers Federation, the Transport Workers Union of Australia and the Federated Storeman and Packers Union of Australia. How much has the Labor Party collected from the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union? How much has the Labor Party been able to benefit from the activities of this group of thugs and criminals who are responsible for killings, robbery, the circumstances of the Station Hotel and all those other matters enunciated by Mr Costigan? What has the Labor Party done to rid itself of these people? What has the union movement done to rid itself of these people? Is there any rule within the Australian Labor Party that no one with a criminal record can be associated with it? There is not. Is there a rule within any union movement in Australia that people with criminal records cannot hold office? There is not. If there is not, why is there not?</PARA>
<PARA> Today we are debating the proposition that by some sheer shred of chance a Treasurer or an Attorney-General may have known of certain facts. I have demonstrated that, if they knew of such facts, previous Attorneys-General and previous Treasurers must have known of the same facts. Yet the Australian Labor Party continues to associate and to identify itself with people such as members of the Federated Ship and Painters and Dockers Union. I refer to the basis of the association of the Australian Labor Party with the union movement and the way in which it may be modified by changes that have been made to the platform of the Australian Labor Party. Those changes seek to move unions outside and above the law. The Australian Labor Party wishes to deal with unions as if they have only the rights set out within the Conciliation and Arbitration Act with no civil responsibilities placed on them. The Platform Constitution and Rules of the Australian Labor Party booklet states:</PARA>
<PARA> A Labor Government will recognise the right of workers to bargain collectively (which) 'entails the right to take industrial action without pains and penalties being directed against unions for the exercise of that right'. </PARA>
<PARA> A Labor Government is committed to the following objectives:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . The recognition of rights of unions to regulate their own affairs in a democratic way free from Government and judicial interference. </PARA>
<PARA>There are other changes to the platform of the Australian Labor Party. A Labor Government would: Exempt unions from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act; encourage the membership of registered organisations through the provision of preference for unionists; and recognise that the legitimate role of the trade unions is not limited to legally defined industrial matters. The Platform Constitution and Rules booklet states:</PARA>
<PARA> All contracts made by the Australian Government would be required to provide for preference to unionists. </PARA>
<PARA>Other matters are dealt with in the report but the final one which I wish to identify is the repeal of penalties for industrial action against arbitral decisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and a prohibition on the insertion of bans clauses. That, in toto, comes from the party which today is talking about matters contained in the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I wonder just where the morality of this motion is. First of all the ALP accepts payments from an organisation that can best be described as criminal-criminal in intent, criminal in activity and criminal in every aspect of its operations. It takes funds from that union and from other unions the individual members of which are before courts on similar matters. The Australian Labor Party, taking funds from criminals who, as reported by the Royal Commissioner, have involved themselves in murder, robbery, extortion and many other criminal actions, has now prepared a platform which says: 'Not only will we support and give regard to the union movement in Australia but also we will give unions preference so that the normal provisions of common law will not apply to them'. The Labor Party would move the unions beyond the realms of normal law. It has proposed within its platform to deal with unions in a manner different from the manner in which they would deal with ordinary citizens of Australia. In those circumstances the Australian Labor Party commits itself not only to take funds from but also to supply support to and to give a free reign to the activities of criminals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regard the motion before the House as an incredibly poor one if the Opposition wishes to distract attention from the other matters dealt with in the Costigan report. They are dealt with in the report and those sections of the report will be read and understood by the Australian community. The Australian community will not identify this report with a Treasurer or an Attorney-General. If that were the case, it would have to identify this report with a number of office holders, a number of Treasurers and a number of Attorneys-General. It will not do that because it understands that there is no way that Mr William George Hayden knew in 1975 that certain matters were going on in Western Australia or in other places. It would not connect the activities of Mr Keppel Enderby as Attorney-General with the affairs of Western Australia. The Australian community will not connect the activities of Mr John Howard with the affairs in Perth, nor will it connect the activities of the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, with the affairs in Western Australia. If the public did it for one, it would do it for the lot. That is what I say. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition that I put to the House is that the Australian Labor Party, by its close association with the union movement and by its commitment to and control from, the union movement, is committed to drawing a smokescreen across the most serious matters dealt with in this report. I venture to suggest that the Victorian Government will do the same thing. The Victorian Government will seek to run from the implications of this report. To ensure that the House understands what the Royal Commissioner said and what the Government has done, I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA> I have taken evidence from the Taxation Office as to the magnitude of the problem. Until the mid-1970s the Taxation Office had not been confronted with large scale fraud practised upon the revenue, or if it had, it had not been aware of it. It became aware of it in the mid-1970s. It then set about establishing an office in Canberra to monitor the matter and make a response to it. There were great difficulties in detecting the particular frauds. Information came to the Officer after the frauds had been committed, the promoters were secretive, documents were destroyed, company records were not filed with Corporate Affairs Office. False names and false addresses of common criminals skilled in the hiding of information were used. Nonetheless the Office took steps and made efforts. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite those difficulties, the Taxation Office pursued the matter. In regard to the need for a task force, a task force which the Government has established, Mr Costigan states:</PARA>
<PARA> My final recommendation is that a Task Force be formed consisting of counsel, solicitors, investigators and administrative staff to act on behalf of the Commonwealth and the several states in the criminal and civil actions available to punish those who have perpetrated the fraud, and to recover the revenue lost.</PARA>
<PARA>That has been done. The prosecutor has been appointed and announced and the task force has been formed. Immediately on the receipt of this report action has followed. The proposition brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) is fallacious. It is not credible and in fact shows the wish to distract from the real contents of the Royal Commission's report. </PARA>

Firstly, he tried to suggest that the Australian Labor Party was tainted by the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Let me make it quite clear, as previous speakers have done, that we deplore and condemn the activities of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union which have been spelt out in this report and preceding reports by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. We most certainly reject and repudiate that kind of activity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The absurd suggestion was made by the honourable member for Mitchell that Labor Ministers were just as much to blame as are any current Ministers or any Liberal or National Country Party Ministers for any of the matters to which attention has been drawn in the Costigan report. This is utterly and absurdly ridiculous. It is quite clear on a reading of the Costigan report that the case was proceeding reasonably well-certainly it was proceeding without undue delay- while the Labor Government was in office. Indeed, it was not until August 1975, as is quite clear in the face of the document, that the case got into the hands of Mr Gleedman in Western Australia and seemed to come to a dead halt. Until August 1975 the case was progressing reasonably well. It was at that time that we came to the delays and prevarications which meant that nothing was done for years and years. Labor was out of office just two or three months later. It is absurd to suggest that the Labor Government was responsible in some way for the delays in the prosecutions or for the prosecutions which have not occurred in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me draw attention to the context of this debate because it has been going on for a while. We are debating a motion of censure of the Government for its grave failure in the administration of legislation relating to criminal and civil offences against the tax laws, resulting in multi-billion dollar frauds against the Commonwealth. This is brought before the House in the context of a report which exposes, once again, an enormous tax avoidance fraud that is going on in this country. This is, of course, not the first time that we have had evidence of tax avoidance and evasion. This Government has presided over the most alarming and incredible explosion of tax avoidance and evasion to occur in the history of this nation. That is the full context in which this debate has come before the House. In that period we have seen an unparalleled explosion in tax cheating in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Some things have been done about tax avoidance, but virtually nothing has been done about tax evasion. In the last report of the Commissioner of Taxation there is recognition that the number of identified tax avoiders was 26 times higher than that for the last year of the Labor Government. The Government has brought in various pieces of legislation against tax avoidance. In fact, since 1978 it has brought in 22 pieces of such legislation covering over 50 avoidance schemes. The Taxation Office has uncovered about 100 tax avoidance schemes whilst this Government has been in office and only 50 have been legislated against. All this has involved closing the door after the tax avoider has bolted because all of it has applied from the date on which the pronouncements were made by the Treasurer (Mr Howard). In only one case-the Curran case-was any restrospectivity involved, and then it was only slight. That a tax avoidance explosion has occurred under this Government is undoubted. The legislative attempts by this Government to prevent it have been basically futile. Professor Mathews of the Australian National University has estimated that the tax avoidance loss is in the order of $3,000m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned the Curran scheme. The Treasurer said today in his contribution to this debate that the Labor Party had failed to close off the Curran scheme. It is certainly true that in December 1974 the then Treasurer, Frank Crean, announced an intention by the Government to legislate against it but did not do so in 1975. We accept that. The year 1975 was a pretty torrid year for the Labor Party. But in 1976, 1977 and until the middle of 1978 the Liberals did nothing either. So if we are to be condemned for not doing anything in one year-a year when our Government was under great strain through the actions of the then Opposition-how about the next two years in which no such strain existed? This Government did absolutely nothing for two and a half years. During that time that scheme got under way and all the massive losses occurred in those years, not in the last year of office of the Labor Government. Let us get it straight: The delays in respect of the Curran scheme are much more attributable to the present Government than they are to the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards tax evasion, which is what this debate is basically about, we have had estimates about the extent of the tax loss through tax evasion at present. Both the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd have estimated that the cash economy in this country is now running at about 10 per cent of the total recorded economy. That indicates a tax loss of about $3,000m a year through the cash economy. The Government has done virtually nothing about that. What has it done? It announced in 1978 an intention to legislate against the cash economy in the building industry but, after a few screams, it backed off and abandoned that legislation. Subsequently we have had only one other piece of legislation; namely, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. It was introduced at the end of 1980 when, most belatedly, the Treasurer finally got round to doing something about closing off the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. This scheme, as we now know, has been running since 1973. It took us only seven years to close off that scheme!</PARA>
<PARA> A lot of this debate is about how culpable the Government is in waiting so long to take any action at all. I believe it is important to make the point here that there are only two examples of this Government taking any action against tax evasion. In the first instance it announced its intention and backed off and in the other it introduced legislation in December 1980, but most belatedly. Since then we have had an announcement of an intention to do something else but we have not yet seen that legislation. I guess we will soon see the legislation if the Government does not cave in to the pressures which are being placed upon it.</PARA>
<PARA> There is one other point I would like to make on tax evasion: that is, that the Government in this Budget is saying that it will take some action against tax evasion. At the same time it is promoting the cash economy. It is a remarkable irony that in the one Budget the Government is doing those two things. The action against the cash economy has to be offset against the fact that it is introducing a tax on banking transactions. There is no doubt whatever that a tax on banking transactions will be a great encouragement to the cash economy. It will encourage people not to do their transactions through the banks because that would incur a tax. So there is now a dramatic tax incentive for people to undertake their activities outside the banking system. That most certainly will be a great encouragement to the cash economy and to tax evasion in this country. The Government's supposed concern about this matter as expressed in the Budget is undone by another action undertaken in this same Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on this point about the past actions of this Government, I mention quickly the foreign tax credit scheme which was mentioned earlier in this debate . The Treasurer mentioned in his speech that he had decided not to go ahead with that legislation because it would have been damaging to the Australian economy. When he was introducing that legislation in this House he had this to say as recorded in the Hansard of June 1978:</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that major elements of the foreign source income of Australians are not taxable in Australia seriously prejudices the equity of the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said when he introduced the legislation, but he soon forgot about the serious prejudice of the equity of the tax system when the pressures came on him and he decided that it was not in the interests of the Australian economy. But all this is minor compared to what has now come to light; a history of gross failure to act on the most amazing and widespread tax-cheating scheme of them all-the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. The full ramifications of this scheme and the Government's grossly inadequate response to it would never have come to light if it were not for two reports. Of course those reports are the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer claimed in this debate that these reports were both commissioned by Liberal governments. That is true. The McCabe-Lafranchi report was commissioned by the Victorian Liberal Government and the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union report was commissioned by the Victorian Liberal Government and the present Federal Government. It is relevant also to bear in mind that the previous Liberal Thompson Government sat on the McCabe-Lafranchi report for six months. It clearly had no intention of making that report public. It got the damn thing at the end of last year. When the Labor Government came to power in May of this year it made that report public. If a Labor Government had not been elected we still would not know about the findings of McCabe-Lafranchi and we still would not know about the details of the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme as it occurred in the Victorian context. I presume that we would have known something about that by now from Mr Costigan. We certainly would not have known the enormous ramifications of it that we now know through the McCabe-Lafranchi report. The previous Liberal Government in Victoria quite clearly was sitting on that report, hiding the ramifications of tax evasion in order to protect its friends. No other conclusion can be drawn.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union the last thing that either this Government or the Thompson Government expected when they set up that Royal Commission was that these kinds of findings would come to light. They thought they were setting up something to nail the Australian Labor Party. But of course that is not what has happened. They are now hoist on their own petard. These reports have revealed that the Government has dragged the anchor appallingly in regard to taking any action against the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The evidence of delay and neglect is overwhelming. Given the issues at stake the Government deserves the declaration by this House of no confidence. Particularly is this so given that when action was finally very belatedly taken in December 1980 by the passage of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act to close off this scheme, the Government made no attempt to collect the tax that had been evaded up to that time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation where legislation was brought in, as I mentioned, in December 1980 to close off the scheme. The Government knew that the scheme had been going on for years and years. It must have known by then of the enormous ramifications of this scheme but it made not one skerrick of an attempt then to collect all of the revenue which had been lost through that scheme up until that point of time. We believe that the Government is utterly culpable for that. It has taken some action in that regard now but only because the McCabe-Lafranchi report came out and forced it into that action. Had there been no McCabe- Lafranchi report the Treasurer of this nation would not have announced the subsequent legislation in an attempt to get that revenue back-revenue which he now calculates as running at something in the order of $450m. The Government brought in that legislation in December 1980 knowing that that revenue loss was at stake. It did not do a damn thing about trying to ensure that it was got back for the public revenue. We believe that that alone justifies the terms of the censure motion which has been moved before this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer said in his defence that the secrecy provisions exempt him from blame; that the use of existing criminal and civil law may not have worked; and that when this scheme first came to light public attitudes about tax avoidance were not strong. I will just briefly deal with these three points of defence which the Treasurer has thrown up in debate today. We believe it is nonsense to say that the secrecy provisions preclude him from knowing what is going on. They prevent disclosure of names or specific details of schemes but they do not prevent the Treasurer from being informed of the general details of the schemes and of their extremely serious nature. Of course the evidence is that he was so informed. Indeed he admitted it in debate here today. In the comments that he made on the McCabe-Lafranchi report in June of this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA> When the Commissioner of Taxation first raised with me in May 1978 the prospect that criminal penalties might need to be introduced in order to deal with these practices, they were still being documented and the full extent of their use was not yet know. </PARA>
<PARA>So he admitted then that the Commissioner of Taxation told him in mid-1978 about these schemes. He did not know exactly how far they had gone but he knew that they were there, that they were serious, and that he may well have had to contemplate criminal penalties. He knew at least at that time. One presumes that he was also told then about all of the other inquiries that had been going on, about using the existing law and about all of the opinions that were around. I have referred to this in the debate. I said earlier that one could proceed with prosecutions under existing law. But even if he were in some doubt about that he still did absolutely nothing for 2 1/2 years except to cogitate on whether he could use existing law. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the Government, and the Treasurer in particular, are thoroughly culpable for that kind of action. To say that the secrecy provisions are in some way a defence is an utter absurdity. The Treasurer knew about the scheme. He knew it was serious. He did nothing for 2 1/2 years. Of course he may even have known before May 1978. Accepting that that is the first point at which he became aware then at least the 2 1/2 years delay is undeniable. Of course he had a duty to demand that everything possible be done to close off this scheme. If he did not do so-he did not-then clearly he was negligent. If he were being led up the garden path regarding the use of existing criminal and civil law to tackle these schemes he should have brought in this legislation well before December 1980. He should have made it retrospective. Of course he did none of that. He did nothing for 2 1/2 years. The reason he gave for this in his statement on the McCabe- Lafranchi report was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . strong public attitudes towards tax avoidance were not yet evident at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>What a pathetic and lousy excuse to say: 'We knew that this scheme was serious. There was a big tax loss. We were not quite sure what to do about it. We decided to do nothing really because strong public attitudes towards avoidance were not evident at that time'. In other words, the Government would do nothing unless it was forced into it. It is being forced into it by two reports-the McCabe- Lafranchi report, which a Liberal Government tried to hide, and the Costigan report, which neither Government can hide. That is what has forced the Government into taking the action which it has taken. If it had been left to the Government then it would have done nothing except to take the action which was taken in December 1980 when the loss of revenue through that scheme became so hot that it knew that it had to stop it at some point. But it would have done nothing more than that if it had not been forced to do so by the publication of those reports. The Government would have relied on the fact that the public would not have been incensed about it because they would not have known about it . When the public became incensed, as they rightly were by the McCabe-Lafranchi report, then the Government decided that it had to do something more. That is when it announced the retrospective legislation to ensure that it got back that revenue. That is what has led to further action in respect of the recommendations of the Costigan report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer argued that the use of the existing criminal or civil law may not have been successful. What a lousy argument that is. That is a nonsense argument . He should have gone ahead and used it whether or not he was sure it would work . He should have gone ahead and used the criminal and civil law that was there when he had opinions available to him saying that he could use that law. Then in order to be doubly sure-because he could not be absolutely sure, as he rightly said, that that would work-he should have brought in legislation against it in 1978 when he knew about the scheme. He should have used both tacks in 1978, not December 1980. He should have used the existing law which Commissioner Costigan says was quite clearly usable and, secondly, if he was unsure about whether it would work, brought in legislation to ensure that he had the point covered anyway. That is what he should have done. He did neither of those things. He forgot about it for 2 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is the matter of the responsibility of Ministers under the Westminster system whether they knew or not. In our view they and the Government as a whole knew enough to be held thoroughly responsible for the delays in this regard. Even if they did not know, under the Westminster system they have an obligation to resign if actions in their department are such that a scandal is created and someone should take the blame. They should be men enough to stand up and say: 'We should have known about this. We should take the blame'. That is the Westminster system, and they should live by it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member that I will still try very hard indeed to defend him. All the evidence is there on which it is easy to defend him. I believe he could present an unanswerable case indeed if he were here. Not only do I defend the Attorney-General cheerfully and willingly but also I defend him on the basis of the facts as we know them and on the basis of the arguments that have been put by both sides in this debate. The first thing that should be made perfectly clear in defence of the Attorney-General is that, leaving aside all the matters that we are concerned with in this debate, the Attorney-General has been and still is a good Attorney-General and has made very substantial contributions to the reform of the law in this country. That should not be forgotten or overlooked. The Attorney-General has been responsible for law reform of a very substantial measure. Let us understand that and accept it as a fair and reasonable basis from which to start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the issue that arises in this debate so far as the Attorney-General is concerned is whether he is guilty of any impropriety by virtue of his knowledge of or involvement in the matters that have been canvassed in this debate. The answer that one must come to, looking at the whole of the evidence and listening to all the arguments, is that the Attorney-General has nothing to answer for whatsoever. No ground whatsoever has been made out as to why he should resign or as to why it could be said that he is guilty of any impropriety in this matter. It is said, as I apprehend the arguments of the Australian Labor Party, that the Attorney-General had some knowledge of the matters which have quite rightly been criticised by Mr Costigan in his report. If he had knowledge of these matters, he must have had that knowledge directly, indirectly or on some other presumed basis. In other words, it is said that he either knew what was going on-in which case he should resign or stands condemned-or it can be assumed that he had some sort of implied knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at those propositions briefly. There is no evidence whatsoever-not a scintilla or a syllable of evidence-to suggest that the Attorney-General knew personally or directly of any of the matters deserving of reproof or criticism which have come to light in this matter. Let me give an example of direct knowledge so far as a Minister is concerned. I refer to an old case relating to the very field we are concerned with; namely, taxation. This case has been mentioned before in this debate and it concerns a former Treasurer, Mr Crean. This matter became popularly known as Curran's case. It was in fact, not to put too fine a point on it, a tax avoidance scheme, and it became famous. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Treasurer, Mr Crean, had direct knowledge of that matter. That can be easily established because he made at least one public statement which I recall reading in which he indicated perfectly clearly that he was aware of it. He knew the tax avoidance scheme existed and was being practised. He knew his colleagues in the Ministry at that time likewise knew about it. He made personal statements about it and had direct knowledge of it. His colleagues, from the Prime Minister to the most humble Minister in his Government at that time, must be fixed with direct and personal knowledge of that tax avoidance scheme. What was the response? The Government took no action whatsoever, despite the fact that it had direct and personal knowledge of that tax avoidance scheme. I mention that case because it is an example of direct knowledge on the part of a Minister. Let me repeat the point very briefly: There is no evidence whatsoever- not a syllable of evidence-to suggest that the Attorney-General knew personally or had direct knowledge by any other means of any of those matters that stand condemned and which have been criticised in the Costigan report or raised in the debate here today. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is the case it can be said against the Attorney-General by way of criticism only that he had some sort of implied knowledge, that we can presume that he had some sort of knowledge-not direct but indirect. There again the case against him fails. Indeed, not only does the case against him fail but also I will establish very shortly that the Attorney-General is one of the very few people involved in this matter who in fact took positive action. I will refer to that matter in a moment. But is it said-I apprehend that it is said by the Labor Party-that the Attorney-General can be presumed to have known of the unseemly matters that have been the subject of criticism in the Costigan report? The important thing to understand is that the Attorney-General, the Treasurer and indeed any Minister labours in these circumstances under a very severe restriction, and that is the restriction contained in section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the provision known as the secrecy provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has said-I suppose it is entitled to raise the argument-that this is no defence and that it is no excuse to say that a secrecy provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act prevents Ministers having personal knowledge of these matters. I say to the Opposition that it explains very substantially indeed the limitations that any Minister labours under. I will not read again the two extracts from the Costigan report in which the Royal Commissioner makes the point that a Minister labours under a very severe disadvantage because of the secrecy provisions. I will not take the time of the House by repeating those passages. Let me simply record for the record that they are paragraphs 3.10 and 3.132. I hope that every fair-minded person who wants to make a judgment about the Attorney-General will read what Mr Costigan stated. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go on to say, in reply to members of the Opposition who say in effect that this is no defence and no excuse, that the secrecy provision relates to the taxation affairs of a person. What were being investigated and what were being handled in a very leisurely and slack manner in the Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth were the taxation affairs of a person-one company. It would have been completely wrong and completely contrary to the law for public servants to run to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) or to the Attorney-General saying: 'Let us tell you about the scandalous state of affairs we have discovered concerning the taxation affairs of a person who happens to be a company'. That would be contrary to the law of this Commonwealth, contrary to the well established practice and contrary , I hope, to what every citizen would expect to be the case. Taxation affairs above all are a matter between the citizen and the independent Commissioner of Taxation. They are not and should not be matters of political investigation and political pursuit. I set that context very clearly. It is important and it does make it perfectly plain that there is a very severe limitation on the knowledge which comes to a Minister, the Attorney-General or the Treasurer in any taxation matter. Also this is highlighted by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. I make the further point that the Government is giving an undertaking that it will look with the utmost speed to see whether it is necessary to amend that provision of the income tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say that the Attorney-General-this is the substantial defence that I want to put on his behalf-is one of the very few people involved in this matter who has taken personal, positive, direct and prompt action. Quite apart from the question of whether he has a good defence, in fact he is in a very strong position because he took the initiative himself before this matter became a matter of public notoriety. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell honourable members when the Attorney-General first took action in this matter. I make it plain, beyond any doubt, that it was before the Costigan report was presented to the Government. It was before the two witnesses-O' Sullivan and Bercove-gave evidence before the Costigan Royal Commission. The Attorney-General was not slack; he was not slow or off the mark. He took positive action even before people gave evidence before the Costigan Royal Commission, that is, even before the facts which are now a matter of notoriety became known. I hope that if any Opposition speakers follow me in this debate they will at least give the Attorney-General credit for that. He took action. For the record, I point out that the Attorney-General became aware of the case in the Perth office after the McCabe-Lafranchi report from Victoria was published on 27 May. What did the Attorney-General do then, remembering that this was before Bercove and O'Sullivan had given evidence, before Mr Costigan had made his criticisms and before Mr Costigan had given his report to us? Did he sit and do nothing? Of course not! He took positive and prompt action, and he did so immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of June the Attorney-General sought advice from the Solicitor- General about the opinion which had been given concerning the bottom-of-the- harbour case in Perth. He took action even before Mr Costigan knew of the unseemly matters that are now the subject of debate in this House. Frankly I think the Attorney-General has a very good defence. For the record I will read a statement into Hansard and then I will conclude my remarks. The Attorney-General is entitled to have this in Hansard and he is entitled to have it on the public record in his defence. First of all, I give credit to the journalist who asked what was, so far as I am concerned, the only relevant question in the whole debate, from beginning to end. The journalist, who asked the question yesterday at Senator Durack's Press conference, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator, when was the first time you became aware of Mr Brinsden's recommendation to proceed with the prosecution . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In other words the journalist asked the Attorney-General: 'When did you first know about all this unseemly business?: It is set out in the record. I will not take the time to read it all out but I will read part of what the Attorney- General said in reply. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We first became aware-you've put two questions there-the first question is when did I become aware of the fact that there was an opinion given to the Perth office on the facts as given-and of course you have to bear in mind that facts have got to be proved. But on those facts if they were proved that that would amount to a conspiracy to defraud, and there was law available for that, I first became aware--</PARA>
<PARA>This is the important part-</PARA>
<PARA>of that after the McCabe-Lafranchi Report was tabled and it was then that the Treasurer and I decided that we should obtain the opinion of the Solicitor- General on those facts. </PARA>
<PARA>Long before Mr Costigan had probably even heard of Mr Bercove or O'Sullivan, before they had given evidence, before Costigan knew of the unseemly matters that he has now dug up and before the report had come to the Government, the Attorney-General used his initiative to pursue those matters and to get that opinion from the Solicitor-General. Not only does the Attorney-General have a very good defence but also he comes out of this whole matter with very great credit indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw attention firstly to what we are debating, and that is the censure of the Government for its failure in the administration of legislation relating to criminal and civil offences against the tax laws. Before dealing with the matter in detail I want to refer briefly to what the Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown) said in defence of the Attorney- General (Senator Durack). He indicated that the Attorney-General became aware of certain matters after the McCabe-Lafranchi report. He sought advice on them and took action immediately. The main matter that we are talking about today is the failure of this Government, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer before him, the present Attorney-General and Attorneys-General before him to take any action in relation to cases which have now been referred to as bottom-of-the- harbour cases or the stripping of companies which first became known to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation early in 1973. We are talking about a long while ago. I will refer later to a statement, historically on that, by the present Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard nothing today, other than excuses, about why no real action has been taken against the practices referred to in the McCabe-Lafranchi report, particularly prior to the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of 1980. The Treasurer repeatedly uses the excuse-he did it again today-that there was no way that action could have been taken prior to that legislation in 1980. That is just not true and has no basis from a legal point of view. Purely for political motives the attitude adopted by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, and his predecessor, Sir Phillip Lynch has been that it was convenient for this Government to adopt that view, thereby allowing white collar criminals to defraud the Commonwealth of revenue. That practice has now become the hallmark of this Government. It has gone on for years and years, and we have heard nothing but excuses from both the Treasurer and his predecessor about why action was not taken. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the true position? Legal opinions were in the possession of the Treasurer which showed clearly that prosecutions could have been undertaken before the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of 1980. The facts are that there was an opinion given to the Government by a Melbourne Q.C. in 1978. That opinion was dealt with in some detail by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the debate today. In effect, that opinion advised the Government that if a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth were established there would be a strong possibility that the agreement, the subject of that conspiracy, would be, in fact, a nullity ; that is, there would be no transfer of shares at all. The opinion stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In that situation and from a practical view-point the Commissioner would probably look to the vendor to recover the lost income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1978. What happened? Absolutely nothing happened. This Government took no action at all against people who were defrauding the Commonwealth of massive amounts of money. By November 1980 the Treasurer had two more opinions, one from Mr N. M. Forsyth which spelt out that calculated and fraudulent tax evasion was already a grave criminal offence. The opinion cited section 231 (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 86 (1) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and section 124 (1) and (3) of the Companies Act. These were only examples. The opinion stated also that other sections of the Companies Act, Bankruptcy Act and State crimes Acts and common law offences could have been used against calculated and fraudulent evasion of tax. The opinion further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> How it can be said that they-</PARA>
<PARA>Referring to the sections-</PARA>
<PARA>are inadequate when they have not even been tested in such a situation, I find rather surprising. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the crucial point. The Treasurer and the Attorney-General and people representing the Attorney-General, the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen)- whoever it may be-can all go on about the fact that they needed the legislation in 1980 before they could do anything. But the fact of the matter is that they did not try to do anything. That was the point made in that opinion given to the Treasurer as early as November 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The second opinion that he received was in 1980 where, in fact, Mr Forsyth, Q.C ., said that very thing when referring to the sections: How they could be said to be inadequate when they have not even been tested in such a situation is rather surprising. That view was further supported in a joint opinion again given to the Treasurer by Mr G. L. Davies, Q.C., and Mr D. G. Russell. At that stage the Treasurer had in his possession three opinions that we know about which said that people could be prosecuted for conspiracy and for offences under the Crimes Act. How many other opinions he had we do not know. We know that he had at least three. That was the position when, on 26 November 1980, the Treasurer introduced into this House the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill. Despite legal opinions in the possession of the Treasurer no action had been taken by the Government prior to that date. Today the Treasurer came in here and repeated this pathetic excuse for lack of action by this Government. The truth is that he was not prepared to have a go. The Government lacked the will to get after these people who were defrauding the tax revenue of this country to the disadvantage of the wage and salary earners paying their tax regularly week after week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He might have knowledge that we did not have. The honourable member for Port Adelaide has referred to another eminent legal mind! After that slight diversion I ask: How can the Treasurer reject legal opinions when not one person was prosecuted? He must be the one who possesses all legal knowledge. The matter was not tested because this Government was running dead on the issue allowing wage and salary earners to pay the burden of crushing taxation while tax avoiders and evaders continued to defraud the Commonwealth of revenue. The attitude that is adopted by the Government and by the Australian Taxation Office in respect of failing to prosecute people involved in multi-billion dollar frauds is very different from the attitude that it adopts to people who may, for some reason, find it difficult to pay tax. Then the Government will move in straight away; writs are issued; the Government bankrupts the whole lot; they are pursued to the end of the earth. It is a lovely double standard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another indication of that approach is an answer to a question on 20 April this year in the Senate. Senator Grimes asked the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) how many prosecutions occurred for offences under the Social Services Act in 1980-81. The answer by Senator Chaney was 1,299. That is an indication of what the Government is like when it is dealing with aged pensioners, invalid pensioners, widowed pensioners, unemployment beneficiaries, sickness beneficiaries, special beneficiaries and all other recipients of benefits under that legislation. The Government is quite prepared to have a go there. But it comes in here and says: 'Oh, well, there is no basis under which we can proceed until we pass legislation'. Let us see what happened when the Government did pass the legislation. The fact is that the Government has only two alternatives here: Either the Treasurer knew what was going on and did nothing or he should have known and did nothing. In both cases the Treasurer should, in fact, resign. Let us go back to 26 November when the Treasurer came into this House--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bourchier" NAMEID="037">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was that the honourable member for Bendigo? Let us go back to 26 November when the Treasurer came into this House with his much-vaunted legislation-the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill 1980. The reason for that legislation was the claim by the Treasurer that without it the Government could not act against those defrauding the Commonwealth of revenue. That claim was nonsense then, as it is now. As I have outlined today the legal advice which was given to the Government was totally ignored by it because it wanted to protect certain people. The honourable member for Fremantle pointed that out earlier today too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened since the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill was passed by this House? That legislation was going to solve all the problems. That legislation, according to the Treasurer, was the legislation which would fix it all up. It is now more than 20 months since that legislation was passed and still there has been not one prosecution. The Treasurer claims, without any justification, that he could not act prior to that Bill being passed. What is the excuse now? After 20 months the tax avoidance industry is still flourishing but this Government has not launched one prosecution. The attitude of the Government and in particular the Treasurer on this crucial issue was demonstrated by the reaction of the Treasurer to the McCabe-Lafranchi report. The Treasurer's first response was to brand it as a political stunt. As late as 29 May last, he was still claiming that, prior to the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, there was no effective measure whereby he could prosecute the people involved in this sort of scheme. He was still peddling that desperate defence of his Government's hopeless record of inactivity today in this Parliament. He seems to be determined to continue to push it. </PARA>
<PARA> On 4 June, to comment again on the McCabe-Lafranchi report, we saw the attitude of the Treasurer demonstrated again. The Treasurer said on that day that he could not explain why no attempt was made to put at least a sample of the companies into liquidation. If such action had been taken the liquidator would have had far wider powers than exist under the Income Tax Assessment Act. This Government failed not only to prosecute either prior to or after the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act but also to take normal steps to recover the money defrauded by those associated with the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Only one of the 923 companies involved in the McCabe-Lafranchi report was put into liquidation. This Government not only stood by and allowed the Commonwealth of Australia to be subjected to grotesque tax avoidance schemes but also, having watched the money disappear, has not taken the basic action required to recover it. Let your friends take it and then make sure they keep it is the philosophy of this disgraced government on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we heard the Treasurer seeking refuge in section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I will deal with that. If that section is the problem, it is time the secrecy provisions were reviewed. The Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union has demonstrated that access to tax records enabled it to expose criminal offences. That in itself is a strong case that, subject to supervision by requiring applications to the courts, access to tax files should be allowed for other law enforcement agencies. In any event, surely we are not expected to believe that that section requires the Treasurer to shut his eyes to massive frauds on Commonwealth revenue. Personal details of individual persons must be protected. But section 16 is not an excuse for the Treasurer to pretend that he was the member of an exclusive club of about four people who did not know what was going on-that is, massive tax avoidance. The anti-secrecy provisions of the Act did not prevent the Costigan Royal Commission opening up the facts of that massive fraud. On the issue of secrecy, page 94 of Volume I of Interim Report No. 4 of the Costigan Royal Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA>I am of the view that the secrecy provisions of Section 16 cannot be justified; whereas their replacement by provisions that ensure true privacy of the information may be. The absolute bar should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>Further in that report, at page 95, the Royal Commissioner deals with the second part of the secrecy provision. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The second aspect of the secrecy provisions is the part preventing the Minister of the Crown from exercising supervisory powers over the administration of his department. </PARA>
<PARA>At that stage the Commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA>No doubt it was initially thought that if a Minister had access to the Taxation records of individuals he may be tempted to use them for political purposes. I believe that that is quite unlikely to occur, but I have no doubt that appropriate protections against such possible clause could be inserted into the Income Tax Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the argument which is being used here today about the secrecy provisions being the reason that action was not taken is, in fact, absolute nonsense. In relation to that, I would also like to refer to the statement of the Treasurer. On 27 June, in statement No. 103, the Treasurer dealt with this issue of company stripping. In the statement he indicated that a case of company stripping first came to the attention of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation early in 1973. He then dealt with the investigation which took place. He went on to say that the Deputy Commissioner received an opinion in January 1975 to the effect that on the material presented grounds existed for prosecution under section 67 of the Companies Act and section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that proceedings could be instituted under section 367B of the Companies Act . Here is somebody else giving an opinion to the Treasurer in relation to this matter which he has chosen, again, to ignore. As I have said he thinks they are all wrong and he is the only one who is right. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Having checked that secrecy provisions would not operate as a barrier to prosecution, in August 1975, the Commissioner authorised the Deputy Crown Solicitor to take the necessary steps towards action under the indicated sections of the Crimes Act and the Companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA>It is absolute nonsense for the Treasurer to be coming in here today and saying- and for other members opposite to be pretending-that section 16 is an excuse for them not to take action in relation to the matters we are discussing today. In concluding I come back to a crucial point and that is the finding of the Costigan Royal Commission that the schemes referred to could have been prosecuted under the law that existed prior to the passing of the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act in 1980. Today the Treasurer, Mr Howard, cast some doubts on that opinion of Mr Costigan. We are now expected to believe that all the legal opinions, including Mr Costigan's, are wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the House has been discussing very grave issues. In my judgment they represent as grave a collection of issues as I have heard examined in my time in this House. That being the case, I would like to approach this debate by stating what I would apprehend to be the basic philosophy of all men and women of good will. The first is that one can never hold a society together unless one lays down and prescribes that certain canons of conduct will be observed. I have no sympathy whatsoever for those who believe that they can go their own wilful way and do whatever pleases them. I find myself at one with the view that men cannot enjoy the benefits of a civil and an uncivil society. If one wants to enjoy what advantages are offered by an uncivil society there is a price to be paid by that society and by people who commit the wrong-doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe, and I have done so all of my life, that those who treat others unfairly are entitled to get their just deserts. I believe that those who indulge in improper and illegal practices deserve to meet with all of the sanctions of the law. I believe that those who break the law expose themselves to the penalty of the law. I believe that illegality is not to be tolerated. This may seem trite or humdrum to the majority of people but I believe it must be stated because it represents what I believe to be fundamental to the conduct and maintenance of any ordered and civil society. I am not aware of any system of jurisprudence that runs away from that. I am not aware of any politico-socio system that runs away from that-from the Plato, Aquinas or Austinian view of jurisprudence. Unless there is respect for order and unless the law is observed one will have breakdown of the society. </PARA>
<PARA> Grave charges have been discussed here today. They are allegations. I put emphasis on that because this goes to the maintenance of our society. The allegations involve fraud against the Crown, the Government and the people. The allegations involve resort to taxation evasion on a massive scale. This matter involves allegations of threats to individuals and allegations of murder, corruption and wickedness in high places. That would represent as grave a collection of issues as any civilised parliament could gaze upon and take into its thinking. That is the first basic principle that I lay down. If the Opposition is to present any indictment against the Government it will need to observe that that is the way which I hold and which I believe all of my colleagues hold and every person in this Parliament basically holds. </PARA>
<PARA> The second limb of philosophy that I want to examine is the role of the civil service. Allegations have been made against the civil service which would represent incompetence and negligence on a hitherto undiscovered scale. I have a very old fashioned view of the civil service. I believe that it must be responsive to the decree and determination of government and parliament. I believe that it has a duty to advise governments and Ministers. I believe it has a duty to caution, to warn and to counsel. But the towering duty of the civil service at the end of the day it is to obey the decision and the determination of government and parliament. The Public Service in a very real sense is a buckle between parliament and the will of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Royal Commision's report because in that report are the allegations involving corruption, fraud, tax evasion, incompetence and negligence. They are all there. The report represents the findings of a commissioner under no obligation whatsoever to proceed in the manner in which a court making a finding which would sheet home fraud and conspiracy charges would proceed. He proceeds on an entirely different basis. I am not conscious of having met any of the people who have been mentioned in the report or in the course of this debate. I speak from the basis of complete neutrality. There is a presumption. It is a very old one but it is a very precious one and all of us who sit in the House are under the plainest obligation to heed and respect it because, if we allow it to be diminished in any shape or form, we will turn back the clock centuries. It is the presumption of innocence. Whatever findings Mr Costigan of Queen's Counsel may make in this report, if any of the gentlemen or ladies involved in it appeared in a criminal court they would stand in the dock and have the presumption of innocence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to upset my friend the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), but I listened to him, I thought, in complete silence. I am not seeking any indulgence from him but I am talking about grave matters. I want to discuss them as impartially as I possibly can. Mr Costigan has presided as a royal commissioner but he is observing, as I say, a completely different role from that of a judge or those sitting upon a jury. I refer the House to a very famous case-I trust that the lawyers will recall it-in which this matter was considered, that is, McGuinness against the Attorney-General of Victoria in 1940 . Chief Justice Latham-this is the principle I want the House to acknowledge- said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Crown has no prerogative power of establishing new courts and if it were attempted to confer upon a Royal Commission by order in council, or by any means short of a statute, the powers of a court . . . there is, in my opinion, no doubt that the commission would be unlawful in the sense that the attempt would fail. </PARA>
<PARA>The case was a consideration of an allegation of bribery of members of parliament so we may say that it could tax and concern us all. If a member of parliament is charged with bribery the commissioner may make a finding against him of bribery but when the man goes into the dock there is the presumption of innocence. Throughout the whole of that trial there is the presumption of innocence. I say to the House that not one word of this report would be admissible in a court of evidence. Mr Costigan turns to precisely that point in his report towards the end of his finding on this chapter. On page 100 he states :</PARA>
<PARA>I have not, in making this recommendation, adopted the procedure made available to me by the terms of reference to recommend specific prosecutions in this matter. There are several reasons why I have not done that: (a) in order to do it, I am required by the terms of reference to make such recommendations on the basis of admissible evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>The royal commissioner may make a finding based on hearsay piled upon hearsay. I do not know and I do not greatly care. But the Attorney-General is not at liberty to go on a frolic of his own no matter what the evidence given to or the findings of a royal commissioner may be. The Attorney-General of any State, and certainly of this country, stands quite differently from any member of the Cabinet. He is the pater patrial of the country and if he launches a prosecution he must launch it on admissible evidence that will stand up in a court. I join with honourable members on both sides of the House in stating that if there has been any culpability, all of the resources of the judicial process of this country can and should be invoked. I appeal to all honourable members to take some heed of the presumption of innocence. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon I listened to what I would describe as a conspicuously unpleasant speech by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), the new found Robespierre. It is very easy to name people in the Parliament. I wonder whether the honourable gentleman would be prepared to go outside the Parliament and make the same speech. That is one test of the honourable gentleman's sense of determination in this matter. Let me give him another. Why does he not ask each of his colleagues within the Australian Labor Party to donate $100 to enable the honourable gentleman to launch a private prosecution against the people he named in the Parliament today? Of course there is no presumption of innocence with the honourable gentleman. It is a presumption of guilt all the way through. Our law was not created on that basis, it has not been defended on that basis and it will certainly not be maintained on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of the House what I thought was a very cogent argument put by my friend the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) this afternoon. He said: 'Well, if you want to impeach us you had better have a look at your own behaviour on the way'. This afternoon several honourable gentlemen opposite have tried to dismiss that by saying: 'Oh, but you know it was mentioned to us. We were the ones who took action'. The honourable member for Wills said: 'We got an opinion from Mr Brinsden'. He is now Mr Justice Brinsden of the Supreme Court of South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Facts have never greatly troubled the honourable gentleman. There was the opinion. It was given in 1974. The only explanation for no action being taken came from another honourable gentleman opposite who said: 'Well, we had other distractions in 1974'. As it happens the people of this country vindicated the action taken in 1975 on two occasions. Let the honourable gentleman put that in his pipe and smoke it. On page 27 the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This scheme was first detected in a widespread manner by the Australian Taxation office in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same page the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1973-74 the scheme appears to have been of relatively small proportions compared to later years. That may reflect merely a lack of knowledge of its full extent. As early as 1975 some 250 instances . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This is the year. On page 33 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Australian Taxation Office in Perth detected the operation of these schemes as early as 1973 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Page 35 refers to the opinion sought from the then Mr Brinsden. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately a brief was delivered to counsel. He was Mr Brinsden, Q.C., now Mr Justice Brinsden of the Western Australian Supreme Court. </PARA>
<PARA>I have referred to that because I thought that I would vindicate the honourable member for Wills on at least one occasion. If we turn to page 68 we find illustrations of the growth of Mr Todman's investigation. Finally, I draw the attention of the House to what was said by the Royal Commissioner at pages 79 and 87 of the report. What is the proposition? If honourable members opposite are going to inculpate Ministers on this side of the House what about their dereliction of duty in the years 1973-75? If we take this matter seriously-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to the honourable member for Wills that there is an old Chinese saying: 'You can always tell when you are out in front when the mob are throwing stones'. If the honourable member for Wills takes this view, why does he not put down in this House an address calling for the removal of Mr Justice Murphy, because he was the Attorney-General of the day? This point was made by the honourable member for Mitchell, and it was a very valid point indeed. I turn now to the observation made by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) concerning section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. During this debate no mention has been made of what Mr Costigan said on page 10 of his report, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my third Interim Report I recommended that Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended so as to allow this Commission access to records held by the Australian Taxation Office. That recommendation was considered by Government and Section 16 was amended so as to allow me conditional access. </PARA>
<PARA>The final objection that Mr Costigan makes about section 16 is to the effect that although he acknowledges the help that it has been to him and says that he has found it very valuable, he goes on to make the point that it does not enable him to fulfil all of his duties. He makes the following objection:</PARA>
<PARA> I have raised these matters because although the access provided to me has indeed been valuable, it has become apparent that there are limitations on that access which do seriously impede the usefulness of it. To remove these restrictions would not in my view be contrary to the public interest. Indeed I would say positively that it would be to the publc interest if some of the information I am acquiring from the Taxation office could be ventilated publicly . </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make the point that from 1973 until the time when the Act was amended that difficulty was there. Costigan is still of the opinion that the difficulty remains although in a quietened form. He refers to and cites a stream of cases to the effect that, irrespective of that amendment, prosecutions could well have been launched. That is his opinion. I suppose one could get an opinion to the contrary. It is a very valid point to consider whether there should be a strengthening of section 16 as amended. That is a case that can be put to the Treasurer (Mr Howard). It should be put on its merits, not on the basis of saying: 'Well, we knew all along'. Other people were exposed to the limitations of section 16-Mr Frank Crean, Dr Cairns, Sir Phillip Lynch--</PARA>

<TITLE>Proposed Student Loans Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Restrict Access to Education. People from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts. These people, if they enrol, will be forced to amass loan debts. Richer students do not face this handicap.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Undermine the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. TEAS should cover the basic living costs of students. Currently the scheme only assists 38% of full- time students and the maximum level of TEAS is a mere $49.67. Government statements indicate TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Disadvantage Women. Women students would be disadvantaged by a loans scheme as they have a lesser ability to repay loan debts, because on average women earn less and have a higher unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Disadvantage Mature-Age Students. Usually mature age students forgo income to study and already have large financial commitments. They could not return to study if it meant incurring substantial debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Distort Educational Choices. Mounting loan debts would force students into studying shorter courses or not continuing with post-graduate study.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Result in Massive Attrition Rates. Students will attempt to undertake extensive part-time work or overload courses to minimise their loans. Increased failure rates will result forcing students to ''drop-out'' rather than continuing study and increase their debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Cause Administrative and Financial Difficulties. Overseas experience shows high default rates will occur on student loans. Government money will be channelled away from TEAS to paying off banks. The government will also bear the administrative burden of pursuing defaulters.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the proposed student loans scheme will have disastrous effects on tertiary education, which we believe benefits the whole community, not just the individual student.</PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives will reject the introduction of a student loans scheme. And your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever humbly pray.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1982 is the first tax Bill for this new session. It deals with seven matters relating to the Income Tax Assessment Act, none of which is very controversial and none of which the Opposition opposes. As well as futher amendments relating to tax avoidance schemes, which I will turn to shortly, the Bill exempts from tax certain foreign pensions related to war time persecution; extends the gift deductibility provisions of the Act; makes further amendments to the secrecy provisions of section 16-a matter which has been the focus of discussion this afternoon; extends tax exemption to the income of the Phosphate Mining Co. of Christmas Island Ltd; proposes amendments to Division 7 tax arrangements for private companies; and exempts from tax profits made on the sale or redemption of securities purchased or acquired at a discount before 30 June of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of these provisions need little explanation. The Phosphate Mining Co. of Christmas Island Ltd is an Australian Government-owned and controlled company which was set up in June 1981 to replace, by agreement with New Zealand, the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission as the body responsible for phosphate mining on the island. The Commission is exempt from tax, as is all activity on Christmas Island. The purpose of this legislation is to transfer to the new company exemption which applied to the Commission. As regards the exemption from tax of certain pensions, section 23 (k) (c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act currently exempts pensions paid by a State of the Federal German Republic as compensation to victims of national socialist persecution. This Bill proposes to extend exemptions provided by that section to give general exception to pensions , annuities and allowances paid under foreign law that are related to or take into account enemy persecution during the Second World War or disability arising from participation in a resistance movement against enemy forces during that war . Both of these measures, are, of course, totally acceptable to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of the amendments proposed is that where the Commissioner of Taxation is satisfied that tax avoidance is not involved payment of dividends by way of an issue of shares or debentures will be taken into account in determining sufficient distribution for Division 7 tax purposes. In addition, section 78 of the Act which provides tax deductibility for gifts to a wide range of institutions will be extended to authorise deductions for gifts to the Connellan Airways Trust, the Queensland Cultural Centre Trust, Polish relief appeals and relief appeals established in response to the cyclone disaster in Tonga and the Falkland Islands dispute. Again neither of these sets of amendments is opposed. It is interesting to note, however, that although these measures were announced well before the Budget, no estimates have been provided in the Budget for the likely cost to revenue which each will bring about. That of course is not new. This point further illustrates the need to adopt a taxation expenditure budget such as is widely used overseas and has been proposed by the Opposition to monitor the cost to revenue of all forms of concessions provided through the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, since coming in to office, has provided an extensive array of tax concessions to various groups in the community and has been very reluctant to provide full information as to the cost of such concessions. A series of questions on notice which I put to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) last year indicated that the Australian Taxation Office is capable of costing fewer than 50 per cent of the tax concessions contained in the Income Tax Assessment Act. This situation is quite unacceptable and taxpayers deserve to know just who is benefiting from assistance provided through the tax system in the same way as detailed information is provided with regard to direct expenditure programs. In the Budget Papers we have an enormous amount of detail about the cost of all sorts of expenditures but, on the tax concession side, a lot of them remain hidden even though each year more information is provided than in the previous year. We applaud that development but say it should go much further to the point of having a taxation expenditure budget. </PARA>
<PARA> A further provision of the Act proposes amendments to section 16 relating to the secrecy provision of the Act. Section 16 provides strict prohibitions against divulging taxation information except to authorised recipients of such information as set out in the Act. One of these authorised recipients is the Commonwealth Statistician who can be provided with taxation information relating to the names and addresses of employers and the nature of the industry in which that person is involved for use in relation to employment statistics. This amendment proposes to extend these existing provisions in two ways: Firstly, to allow this information to be used by the statistician for statistical purposes and, secondly, to authorise the provision of additional employment information, specifically the number of male and female employees for pay-as-you-earn purposes. Labor strongly supports the secrecy provisions of the Act and is concerned to ensure that they are not unnecessarily eroded. We do however support amendments to this section, where they are strongly justified. This was shown by our support earlier this year from amendments arising from recommendations made by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union to enhance the effectiveness of crime detection and prosecution. In this light we will give the closest consideration to further recommendations regarding this provision arising out of yesterday's tabled report of the royal commission. The current amendment before the House is a minor one aimed at ensuring a more efficient collection of comprehensive employment statistics. We do not oppose this provision. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that one of the more important sections of this Bill is yet another amendment relating to measures directed against tax avoidance. The Treasurer claimed in the Budget that tax avoidance in Australia is now dead. Accordingly, the Budget makes no allowance this year for revenue losses resulting from tax avoidance. That of course is in stark contrast to previous Budgets. Last year's Budget, for example, made a specific allowance of $300m for revenue shortfalls attributable to tax avoidance. The Budget before last allowed for revenue losses of $290m. These figures were gross underestimates of the likely revenue losses resulting from tax avoidance in each year. More realistic estimates of the magnitude of tax avoidance put revenue losses at around $3,000m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's most noted taxation authority, Professor Mathews from the Australian National University, has developed a method of estimating tax avoidance losses by comparing the total tax shares paid by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers and non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, that is, those persons with incomes from property, business and dividends. Using Professor Mathews' technique, revenue losses due to tax avoidance during 1981-82 were around $3,300m. Figures of that magnitude are supported by Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association. It is absolutely absurd that the treasurer can declare that tax avoidance has virtually overnight changed from being an industry of massive proportions to being virtually non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA> On what does the Treasurer base these claims? It would seem that he is relying on three major pieces of legislation which have been introduced by the Government in the last two years. These are the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, which of course has been very much before the House in this afternoon's discussions, the new general anti-avoidance section, part IVA, which was introduced in the middle of last year and finally the re-written section 136 against transfer pricing practices which was introduced earlier this year. While these provisions have a potentially wide impact, they have yet to be tested. It is quite ridiculous that measures which were touted with such fanfare by the Treasurer at the time have been in existence for such a considerable period without being put to the test. It is obvious that there has been ample time to arrange a test case for these provisions, but the Government seems totally unwilling to subject these provisions to the scrutiny of the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time when these provisions were introduced, the Australian Labor Party, while strongly supporting their intent, was concerned that major deficiencies existed in each of them which could potentially lead to their reading down by the courts. In addition, prominent tax lawyers also pointed out major defects in the legislation. Because the Government has yet to use any of these measures, it is possible only to assume that it shares the same doubts about their effectiveness. While these provisions in their current form may provide some deterrent to tax avoidance, it is certainly not possible to say that they have spelt the end of the tax avoidance industry. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a press report earlier this month-it is pretty recent stuff- revealed that the Federal Taxation Office has identified 100 tax avoidance schemes used by high income earners in the past five years. The report goes on to state that only about half of these schemes have been legislated against. This is absolutely right. There have been about 50 schemes legislated against in the last five years. While officials believe that the general anti-avoidance section may cover some of the others, they are concerned about some of the schemes which are still being used. Furthermore, the report goes on to say that it is too early to identify new schemes used by taxpayers in the year just ended . The Treasurer reinforced the impression created by this report when he would not give an assurance in the Parliament last week that it would not be faced with further massive and complex pieces of legislation dealing with even more tax avoidance schemes. It is obvious from that that he is not confident about the effectiveness of his own measures regarding tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> From the information that I have gathered it seems that the use of blatant and artificial paper schemes may be declining. That is not to say that such schemes are dead, but simply that more extremely blatant varieties have given way to more sophisticated attempts to disguise tax avoidance with some degree of commercial rationale. A major area of concern, however, is the proliferation of tax shelters which use concessions provided by the Act in a way in which they were not intended so as to minimise or defer tax, often indefinitely. Such shelters cover a wide variety of activities, such as boat building, breeding racehorses and agriculture to oil exploration and, more recently, film production. The Government must bear the responsibility for much of the revenue losses resulting from this form of tax avoidance because in the first place it provided the concessions which are being abused. Such concessions must be strictly monitored to ensure that they are not misused for tax avoidance purposes. In addition, there is a major concern within the Taxation Office at the wide use of overseas tax havens to avoid tax. This form of tax avoidance relies on the abuse of section 23 (q), which basically says that Australian individuals and companies who earn income overseas can, in most cases, bring their income back into Australia free of tax provided that it is taxed overseas no matter how low the tax rate which is applied overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> This provision acts as an incentive to shift income which would otherwise be taxed in Australia to tax havens overseas where it is taxed at a very low rate before being brought back into this country. The anti-transfer pricing provisions adopted earlier this year have had little impact on this practice. It is essential that a system of foreign tax credits requiring Australians with foreign source income to pay tax at full rates in Australia with credit for any tax paid overseas be introduced to prevent such abuses. Furthermore, there is a wide variety of tax avoidance structures being openly utilised in Australia with the full consent of the present Government. Particularly notable in this area is the use of internal superannuation funds and trusts which provide lucrative tax avoidance avenues for high income earners. In these circumstances, for the Treasurer to talk about tax avoidance being dead is nothing short of ridiculous. Only a comprehensive set of policies, such as those recently released publicly by the Opposition centering on fully retrospective legislation against tax avoidance schemes, an effective general anti-avoidance provision, specific action against schemes condoned by this Government and other strong measures, would be capable of ensuring that tax avoidance in Australia is stopped once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax avoidance measures proposed by this Bill involve further extension of legislation introduced as far back as September 1978 against expenditure recoupment type tax avoidance schemes. These schemes generally seek a deduction for some payment under an arrangement whereby the taxpayer or associate obtains some form of compensating benefit which effectively recoups the initial outgoing . Since the original legislation in 1978 there have been several further amendments dealing with particular variations of this scheme, the latest involving exploitation of tax concessions for shares in afforestation and petroleum exploration companies, which will be outlawed back to the original date of the legislation in 1978. We do not oppose that amendment. However, this measure clearly illustrates the ineffective nature of this Government's policy against tax avoidance simply by the fact that the Treasurer has been forced to legislate continuously since 1978 against new variants on the old schemes. Surely it is time for a new approach to combating tax avoidance to put an end to this dog chasing its own tail picture of the Government's inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The final amendment which I propose to deal with relates to the sale or redemption of discounted securities. This year the Taxation Office, apparently for the first time, included with its instructions for filling out income tax returns the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Profits derived from the redemption at par of securities issued or acquired at a discount, are regarded as being in the nature of interest. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, profits made on the redemption of discounted Commonwealth bonds and other securities were to be taxable. Honourable members will be very much aware that this statement provoked a storm of protest. For a long period it seems that it has been accepted practice that profits made on the redemption of such securities are capital profits and thus non-taxable. It seems that the Taxation Office has never advised investors in this way but has in the past simply failed to follow through this issue and actively enforce the tax laws by taxing such profits. According to the Taxation Office the statement in this year 's instructions on tax returns did not represent a change in interpretation of the provisions of the tax Act or reflect any changes in the law. Rather the statement was made to highlight the fact that such gains were taxable. It is obvious that the Taxation Office has become concerned at the large number of investors purchasing such securities in order to make what they thought were tax -free capital gains. </PARA>
<PARA> In a period of rapidly rising interest rates such as we have had in Australia over recent years the market price for such securities falls in order to maintain an attractive rate of return and consequently the profit on redemption, which is the difference between the face value of the coupon and the market price at which it was purchased, increases offering greater profit to the investor. In this situation the Taxation Office has forseen prospective large losses to revenue from this source unless quick action is taken. In a period of more stable interest rates, profits on such securities obviously would be less and thus the Taxation Office apparently has not been concerned in the past to ensure that such profits are fully taxed. As we understand it, for a long period most investment advisers have advised clients that returns on these securities are not taxable. Government stock prospectus also failed to state that profits made on redemption are taxable. When all these facts are considered it is possible to see where confusion has arisen. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I should illustrate in more detail the problem which has arisen. Let us take, for example, the situation of Commonwealth bonds due to mature in, say, May 1989 at their face value of $100 which had been selling for, say $74. These bonds pay $9.70 per anum interest and when redeemed in 1989 are worth $100. Up to now it has been generally accepted in the investing community that the $9.70 interest each year is taxable but the $26 extra received in 1989 is tax-free capital. It is easy to see how such bonds are attractive to persons nearing retirement who want to minimise their income for pension purposes but preserve the value of their capital against inflation. When the Taxation Office announced its move in this area there was a reaction from the investing public who had bought such securities on the understanding that the profit was tax free. The Treasurer then overruled the Taxation Office and declared that such profits would not be taxable in the 1981-82 income year but would be taxable from 30 June onwards. To give effect to the Treasurer's statement it has been necessary to specifically exempt such profits from tax for the period in question. </PARA>
<PARA> This exemption does not apply to profits made by dealers or traders in securities and profits under section 26AAA which relates to the 12-month capital gains provision, section 26c which relates to certain non-interest-bearing Commonwealth Securities and stock, or section 26 (a) which relates to profit- making undertakings or schemes involving the use of such securities. These sections effectively ensure that persons using such securities on a large scale as a major source of income will be subjected to tax. From 30 June this year all profits arising in this way will be assessable either under those sections-the capital gains sections-or under section 25, which generally brings to account all sources of assessable income. As with all other measures contained in this Bill the Labor Party supports this amendment on the grounds that it seems reasonable to make the exemption provided for by the Treasurer up until the end of the last financial year. But from now, of course, all such profits will be taxable, and rightly so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the Australian Labor Party is not opposing the bulk of the measures contained in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4). I stress that I think the bulk of the measures are non- controversial. The disclosure of information to the Australian Statistician obviously is a matter which is widely supported. The exemption of the Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island Ltd obviously is acceptable. The exemption regarding foreign pensions related to war time persecution clearly is a matter which is supported by the House. I am glad to hear that the provision regarding the sale of securities purchased at a discount is supported by the Australian Labor Party. It is reasonable for the Government to make the appropriate change in this matter because there was widespread expectation, as pointed out by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), that there would be the capacity for this capital profit in terms of the difference between the discounted price and the redemption price. The expectation was that this capital profit would be free of income tax. Those people who bought in expectation of that tax-free gain are now to be protected. In future, of course, this protection will not exist. At least people will be aware of the rules of the game.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a sense, that is the essential difference between the approach of this Government and that of the Opposition to taxation. Under our system we take the view that it is right and proper to know what the rules of the game really are, and that the rules should not be changed after the game has been part played. The Australian Labor Party takes a totally different view. The honourable member for Gellibrand made these points very forcefully. He said, for example, that it is time to take a new approach, that it is not good enough for the Government to be forced to legislate on new variations in respect of tax-avoidance arrangements since 1978 and that the Labor Party supports the introduction of fully retrospective legislation in order to cope with tax avoidance problems. In other words, the Opposition's dedicated commitment is to changing the rules after people have entered into arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear the honourable member for Gellibrand restating that position very forcefully tonight. It demonstrates a dramatic difference between the two parties on this matter. To make illegal something that was legal at the time is a matter which I think should exercise our minds and concern everone who is interested in the rule of law. There have been allegations that the Federal Government is looking at plans for retrospective recoupment in respect of bottom -of-the-harbour schemes and funds which at the time were not regarded as taxable but which are now regarded by the Commisioner of Taxation as recoupable. That is regarded by many people as retrospective legislation. I seek to distinguish very clearly, for the benefit of the Opposition, between a generally retrospective approach as outlined tonight by the honourable member for Gellibrand and the sort of approach which the Federal Government supports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's approach is very simple. It takes the view that if one does something which is legal at the time it cannot be made illegal. The reason that the Government supports recoupment-it is a subject about which there is some disagreement in the community at the moment-is that the recoupment relates to schemes which always were illegal. There has never been any suggestion that bottom-of-the-harbour schemes ever were legal. There has never been any suggestion that they do not offend the Crimes Acts or Companies Acts in the various States, including the Commonwealth Act. There is no doubt that if one's concern is recoupment there is no benefit in seeking recoupment from promoters who undertook these frauds because the promoters did not end up with the benefit . The people who ended up with the benefit were the people who sold the company structures to them and who did not enter into fraud or do anything illegal. This is the dilemma that any government in this situation must face. The people who received the benefit were not the people who perpetrated the fraud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem the Government faces is simply this: The people who benefited from the fraud were not those who perpetrated it. Therefore, if the object of the Government is to seek recoupment of that money, there is no benefit in attacking the promoters in regard to recoupment. There may well be personal satisfaction involved, and the Government is pursuing that matter in order to ensure that there can be no view in the community that those who perpetrate frauds on the revenue can get away scot-free. However, the essence of the difference between the Opposition's position and our position is this: We take the view that we have a right to seek recoupment of money that has been fraudulently obtained even though the persons who got the benefit were not involved in a fraud. The Opposition takes the view that it can change the rules after the event. They assert that a legal act can magically be transformed into an illegal one after the event. It is like driving down a road at 80 kilometres per hour because that is the speed limit and suddenly finding after the event that one has been arrested because the speed limit was reduced to 60 kilometres per hour after one started one's journey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a sensible and rational basis for distinguishing between the Opposition's approach to overall retrospectivity in tax matters-it raised this matter again tonight-and the Government's strong view that it has an entitlement to recoup money that was returned to vendors who may well have been innocent but who received the benefit of a fraud. </PARA>

<PARA> I was intrigued to hear various members of the Opposition allege that the buyer of the watch was somehow guilty and that the people who in fact sold companies are viciously guilty of a conspiracy or some other crime when in fact they sold in the understanding that that sale was legal and proper. It seems to me that the Opposition, by its attitude in this afternoon's debate, accused the people involved in selling these companies of criminal behaviour. That attitude seems to me to pervade the Opposition's attitude to tax measures. There was nothing illegal in what the vendors did. This Government does not suggest there was anything illegal; it is simply saying that the proceeds of fraud, which may well have innocently flowed to these people, should be recouped. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no nexus between recoupment and fault. There is no nexus between recoupment and criminality, and yet the Labor Party seeks to draw that nexus. The Labor Party has accused people in this House and used their names in this House. It has accused them of criminality when what they did did not offend against any law. That is the approach of the Labor Party. We will find the names -if this approach continues-of innocent people, who have done things that were quite lawful, dragged through the mud by the Opposition, as they were this afternoon, if the Opposition gets on to the Treasury benches. Opposition members have said that they will make this sort of legislation totally retrospective. They will make this sort of legislation totally retrospective. They will make illegal what was legal and will damage the public position of people, whether or not those people did something that was quite proper at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government takes the view that those who did something improper and illegal should face that problem and that those who did things which were legal at the time should not be affronted by that kind of legislation. The reason I stress this point tonight is that it is bad enough that the honourable member for Gellibrand maintains the proposition that totally retrospective legislation should be introduced. Honourable members heard in this afternoon's debate how Opposition members used personal abuse of people involved, personal abuse of people who did nothing wrong, who did nothing illegal, whose every action may well have been required of them by their obligation to their shareholders to do what is best in the shareholder's interest. It underlined the nature of the Opposition's attitude. People who did nothing illegal were blackguarded in this House by honourable members opposite who seek to extend that proposition across the whole range of taxation revenue. They seek to make every tax law totally retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Opposition that in the first place it is grandstanding. Part IVA, which was introduced by this Government, renders that window-dressing activity by the Opposition totally meaningless because it is effective just as the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 is totally effective. The fact that there have been no prosecutions under the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act does not mean, of course, that it is not effective; it only means that it is very effective indeed . I suggest to the Opposition that there is the reality of protection against tax fraud now not only because this Government has introduced so much effective legislation but also because of the changed approach-the honourable member for Gellibrand has acknowledged this-of the High Court of Australia to various legislation matters which have come before it. It does seem that the new High Court takes a less legalistic view of many of the legislative matters involved in the taxation arena. </PARA>
<PARA> A combination of the effective determined action by this Government, including criminal sanctions for the first time ever in the taxation area, backed up of course by a less legalistic approach from the High Court, has rendered, as the leading practitioners say, the tax avoidance industry totally destroyed. As I said the other night, tax avoidance is dead. It is nonsensical for members of the Opposition to pretend that it is still alive and well when they can produce no evidence whatsoever that this is the case. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage)-the well-known expert on everything and a producer of evidence on nothing-knows that tax avoidance is still going on! He in his usual wisdom, is incapable of supplying any evidence whatsoever. Not only is he incapable of providing evidence but also he wilfully, knowing there is no evidence, mischievously presents to the House that he has such evidence. That is basically mischievous; that is a corruption of the task of a member of parliament. If any honourable member opposite has any evidence that these new laws are being evaded , that tax is being evaded, he has a duty-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rather surprising that anyone on the Government side of the House would have suggested to Opposition members that they need to produce evidence that the tax avoidance industry is still thriving in this country within a week in which the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union report was tabled and within a year in which the McCabe-Lafranchi report, I think pretty convincingly, demonstrated to any objective member of the public that not only is that industry thriving but also it is an industry which involves a drain on government revenue of billions and billions of dollars. I do not think the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), in terms of the kind of posturing we have just heard, will convince anyone at all. I have been almost shocked by the kind of performance that we have had from such an experienced member. The honourable member for Moreton (Sir James Killen) this afternoon adopted a high moral tone about order, justice and all that stuff. One recognises that he is part of a government which has presided over the greatest corruption in the area of taxation that this country has ever witnessed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I want to refer briefly to clause 5 of the Income Tax Assessment Bill ( No. 4) which proposes to amend the principal Act to insert a new section 23J to exempt from income tax profits made on the sale or redemption of debt securities acquired at a discount on or before 30 June 1982, subject to certain exemptions. I am sorry that the honourable member for Macarthur has shown such little interest in the debate and has now left the chamber because what I want to say goes ultimately to the question of retrospectivity that he seemed to be so concerned about. The proposed new section is to be inserted because the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has been persuaded, by political pressure, not to back the Commissioner of Taxation in enforcing the existing tax laws as they should apply to government securities. Earlier this year the Taxation Commissioner publicly affirmed the view that profits arising from the sale or redemption at par of securities issued or acquired at a discount are assessable income. In doing so the Commissioner was simply drawing attention-I underline this-to the existence of existing law and the intention of the Commissioner to enforce that law. The relevant sections of the tax law are section 26AAA, which taxes profits arising from sale of property within 12 months, section 26C, which taxes gains made on the sale of Commonwealth securities that do not bear interest, and paragraph 26 (a) which includes in assessable income profits arising from the sale of property acquired for the purpose of making a profit or from carrying on or carrying out a profit-making undertaking or scheme. Whilst these amendments to the legislation make it clear that these laws will always be applied to the sale or redemption of securities from 30 June 1982 there is present in proposed new section 23J (1) a clause which would make exempt from tax profits made on redemption or sale of any securities acquired at a discount on or before 30 June 1982 other than profits made by traders or dealers and profits to which section 26AAA, section 26C or paragraph 26 (a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act apply. </PARA>
<PARA> I question proposed new section 23J for a number of reasons to which I now refer. If the Government is to suggest, as it says, that it wishes to deal with the cancer of tax avoidance in the community it needs at least to insist on the law, as it currently exists, strictly applying. Of course, laws such as that contained in paragraph 26 (a) are crucial laws in relation to dealing with the question of tax avoidance. In the particular instance before the House concerning the sale or redemption of securities the Taxation Commissioner clearly has not been applying the law as it currently exists. The obligation on the Government should be to ensure that the law is strictly applied to those people who have been acting on the presupposition that the Government is weak on implementation of existing law at least in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case we have a situation whereby the Government's rapid response to pressure has not been in favour of the Commissioner, that is, the Government has not acted certainly to strengthen the hand of the Commissioner in terms of what has happened at least prior to June 1982. Rather this Government has acted in what it believes to be the interest of small investors. However, in my reading of what occurred it was not so much the small investors who placed pressure on the Government as the people involved in selling securities such as those associated with stock exchanges-sharebrokers and so on. They, in fact, no doubt were themselves under criticism because it turned out that they had been giving advice to small investors and, no doubt, as well to large scale investors that the capital gain involved at the securities point of maturation would not be subject to tax. In my view it is not so much the pressure of small investors that has resulted in this amending legislation but rather the fact that rather larger interests associated with security markets made it very clear to the Treasurer that, at least prior to June 1982, they were not prepared to wear this kind of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I just draw several conclusions from what has happened in this case. Firstly, one has to ask the question, given that the Government has needed to bring in this amending legislation, how strong its commitment will be in this area. I guess that one has to assume that seeing the Government has gone to the trouble of introducing the amendment there will be at least a greater degree of seriousness about the application of tax on capital gains and securities than there has been at least in the past. Secondly, I think the proposed new section is of some interest in terms of the matter raised by the honourable member for Macarthur, that is, the principle of retrospectivity. The Treasurer has indicated that he is prepared to legislate retrospectively to outlaw schemes which are clearly designed to avoid tax, such as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. He has argued that if it is necessary to legislate to cover such schemes he is prepared to do so. But here we have a case in which legislation is on the books, that is, the law has existed, but it has, in fact, not been enforced. The Treasurer has now clearly indicated that he is prepared to legislate retrospectively to ensure that people do not pay tax which they are required to pay or which they should have paid under existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go on about this very much longer. What we have is a case where people were really required quite clearly under the Act to pay certain tax . That has been the case; that has been the law. We have, in effect, the Treasurer legislating retrospectively to relieve people of that quite clear legal obligation. Of course, it can be argued, and is argued by the Government, that people were not aware of their obligation. I guess that the Opposition, in not opposing this amendment, has had to take that into account. One might ask the question: Was it not the responsibility of the Government to ensure that people acquiring property-in this case bonds and securities-were made aware of what their commitments were in terms of the law particularly in relation to tax? I think this illustrates the fact that a double morality has been operating in terms of the Government. There has been a morality which operates in terms of the interests of those who have capital, those who have been looked after by this Government; there is another morality where the Government suggests that all the problems of this country go back to the selfishness and the avarice of ordinary wage and salary earners constantly seeking, so the Government would argue, greater and greater wage claims. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is interested at all in trying to get some understanding in terms of the trade union movement it will have to develop a very different record in relation to its preparedness to ensure that people with capital pay their fair share of tax. I think that in a small way clause 5 of this Bill illustrates the flexibility at least, of the Government in that respect. Admittedly, it has got to the point where the Government is now going to enforce taxation in relation to securities. But it has been prepared also to bow to pressure so that that tax will be applied only after June 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I desire to enter into this debate on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4) very quickly in respect of the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that it was the Government's intention to extend an existing exemption of pensions paid from the Federal Republic of Germany to Australian residents in compensation for Nazi persecution. The Opposition welcomes extension to that provision. My concern in this debate is to point out that anomaly which exists in this debate in respect of a very limited group of Australian citizens. I understand the basis for this section being placed in the Income Tax Assessment Act in the first place was the international agreement whereby victims of Nazi persecution who were receiving compensation from the Federal Republic of Germany received those payments by way of compensation and were, therefore, exempt from the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Clearly, I suspect that one of the reasons for that was that it was not possible for the Federal Government of Germany to make lump sum payments as restitution to the victims of Nazi atrocities. That would have obviously bankrupted the Republic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For years many of these people have been receiving these sums by way of compensation for hardship and suffering often beyond human contemplation. I have a large number of these people in my electorate, many of them of Jewish origin. What has occurred indicates the anomaly that exists in the intention of this Parliament. Clearly we have a situation in which the Government today is extending this provision. What has happened, in fact, is that people have come to Australia and have settled. They may have come from concentration camps. While they have been working and receiving these additional sums by way of compensation they have been income tax exempt. Many of them, often as a result of the hardships which they have suffered, find that they are unable to continue work and have to seek the social service entitlements. That is where the anomaly arises. Whilst income by way of compensation is exempt for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) takes it into account in assessing the entitlements to social service benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is time that anomaly, which does in a small number of cases cause very practical hardship, should be closely examined by the Government. It seems to me to be clearly absurd to say that a payment is made which ought to be, for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act, exempt because it is seen as compensation. That is the view of the Treasurer. While a person is working and receives the compensation it is exempt but when that person has to cease work and rely on a social service entitlement it affects fringe benefits. It does not matter, in the case of an old age pensioner, whether a pensioner is over 70 years of age. It still affects fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate there is a number of cases. I have taken up this matter as has Senator Missen in the Senate. We have exchanged correspondence and opinions which we have received from the Department of Social Security. This matter is clearly an anomaly which is working an injustice and which ought to be rectified because we are dealing with a special group of people in our community. They are a declining group. Because of their age, they are not an expanding group. I can understand the Minister for Social Security saying: 'Given the tightening economic circumstances, I do not want to make a grant which is obviously going to go to a group that is going to enlarge'. It seems to me-there is certainly a number of cases which I and Senator Missen from Victoria have received-that real hardship is being effected on individual citizens because they are now in receipt of these compensation payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if it is the view of this House and it is the view of the Treasurer that these payments ought to be exempt for the purposes of income tax, equally, they ought to be exempt by the Minister for Social Security when he is considering the entitlements that these elderly citizens receive. I commend that view to the Treasurer and to the Government. I hope that, between the passage of this legislation in this House and its consideration in the Senate, the Minister for Social Security will use the occasion to bring his viewpoint into line with the viewpoint of the Treasurer. It is an anomaly. It is working an injustice in a number of cases and those injustices ought to be rectified. I draw that matter to the attention of the Treasurer, the attention of the Minister for Social Security and to the attention of the Government in the hope that on this occasion we can rectify what is clearly the expressed intention and view of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are discussing the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1982. I address my remarks to only a couple of items that are involved with the number of amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act that are involved in this Bill. In the first instance I echo the thoughts of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) on foreign pensions relating to war time persecution. I have pursued the claims of two of my constituents, Mrs Levy and Mrs Nittilo, for a number of years in relation to this circumstance. They wrote to my predecessor, Frank Stewart, in 1975 concerning the restitution payment they were receiving. Unfortunately, the then Minister for Social Security advised them that the income that they were receiving was accountable for taxation purposes and they were denied fringe benefits for their pension. It seemed to me as it did to my predecessor that, whilst they were being paid compensation for their imprisonment during the war, it was most ironic and unjust that, because of that compensation, they were refused fringe benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1980, the then Minister for Social Security who is now the Minister, Senator Chaney, reiterated the previous advice that Frank Stewart had received but indicated that the matter was under review by his Department and by the Government. Unfortunately, a timely change has taken two years to effect. But even though it has taken that long I congratulate the Government on making that decision. I would say only that because such a minuscule amount of revenue was involved the Government could have been a little more charitable and made that legislation retrospective. It would have saved many people a lot of the cost they have outlaid because of the ruination of their health due to the ravages of others. </PARA>
<PARA> Another item to which I address myself is the proposal in this Bill to grant tax deductibility to organisations that collect funds for overseas disasters. I was pleased to see that in the Budget last year the Government, after a lot of prodding, gave tax deductibility to donations to World Vision of Australia which carries out a most exemplary program of assistance to people in the Third World. The Government, in the amendments made to this Bill, seems to making a number of provisions for those people who were affected by the Falkland Islands war. As most of those people were the familes or relations of professional soldiers it seems somewhat ironic that that is being done when the Government only now, after a number of years of war in Lebanon, is willing to provide tax deductibility for funds given to provide relief for refugees in Lebanon. I would have thought that, if the Government was so moved by the ravages of war that it would so quickly provide assistance to those people who were affected by the altercation in the Falkland Islands, because of the ravages that have occurred in Lebanon-the Lebanese community in Australia is a very large group in the Australian population-the Government should have decided before now to provide the same tax deductibility for payments to appeals for refugee assistance in Lebanon and other parts of the Third World. But, as I have said, with regard to the amendment that affects foreign pensions restitution, maybe a little bit late is better than nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I also address my remarks tonight to the matter of tax evasion which has been canvassed at length in this Parliament today. The only remarks I make on the general matter of tax evasion is that it is ironic that under this Government the only real growth industry has been the tax evasion industry. We have had some rather remarkable people lobbying Government members of parliament in recent weeks about the retrospectivity laws that the Government intends to introduce. One such remarkable person is Mrs Millie Phillips, that well-known exploiter of mining proposals and the old aged in Australia. She saw fit today to take sufficient umbrage with the Government's approach to send a telegram to all Government members telling them that the party she had supported all her life was now starting to lose her favour because it was at last starting to wake up to tax 'avoision'-I should say, tax avoidance. I suppose I have fallen into the trap of amalgamating the two words as other speakers in this Parliament have today. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, I do not find all that much difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance. As a person who has spent all his working life paying pay-as-you-earn tax, I think there is no real way that those people who pay pay-as-you-earn tax can get involved in either of those types of tax manipulations. I think that the sooner tax evasion and avoidance are stamped out the better it will be for the great bulk of Australians who are contributing to the cost of running this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the main I address my remarks tonight to what strikes me as some peculiar things that are occuring in the Australian Taxation Office in Sydney in particular as they affect the migrant community in my electorate. In the last few weeks, some considerable space has been given in the media to the concept of discounting of group certificates. I must say that matter was foreign to me until last week when a number of people from the migrant community in my electorate brought it to my attention. They brought to my attention the iniquity that is worked on a number of people by the practice of group certificate discounting. One of the greatest perpetrators of this scheme in Sydney is a Mr Dekanic of a company called Dekanic Accountancy Pty Ltd of 305 King Street, Newtown. Mr Dekanic is not new to this area. In fact, this has been a matter of scandal in the Australian Taxation Office in Sydney and the migrant community of Sydney for some three years. It is a matter that has been known to the bureaucracy for some time. It is common knowledge in tax circles and in the migrant community. The Commissioner of Taxation decided to take action only after the matter was revealed in the media and the New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mr Whelan, took action in the New South Wales Parliament yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for members of this Parliament, who are responsible for the oversight of the tax laws, to understand what Mr Dekanic does. He preys on new migrants to Australia and a number of people in this country who are still illegal immigrants and who have little knowledge of English or the Australian bureaucracy. The people he preys upon are mainly those from the Pacific Islands of Samoa, Tonga and Fiji and members of the Yugoslav community in Sydney. The most despicable part of his operation is that to these people he asserts that he is an official government representative. I suppose that to the extent that he is a registered tax agent he can say that he has some fifth or sixth hand connection with the Australian Government but he asserts to these people that he is the Government's representative. That is abhorrent to me as a member of the Australian Parliament who represents most of these people. </PARA>
<PARA> This gentlemen asks people to sign a standard Form S taxation return. That form has been pre-typed. He has hundreds of these forms typed and gets people to sign them. Not only do they sign that form in a number of places but also they sign an assignment form. I will go further into what that assignment form does in a few moments. It is interesting that the Taxation Office has not got on to the fraud that has been perpetrated before now. This gentlemen presents thousands of Form S taxation returns to the Australian Taxation Office in Sydney every year. It strikes me that the fact that all these forms are the same and are all rote typed in his office should have woken people to the fact that something crooked is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> This man, in my view, is one of the worst thieves in the area adjacent to my electorate. He preys on people who do not know their rights. On the Form S taxation returns he alleges that all these people are members of the Australian Workers Union. They are not but he claims a taxation deduction for them. He provides the forms and asks people to sign them. All the details are typed on a typewriter in his office. If the taxation authorities get the police to check the typewriter they will know that that is so. He asserts that these people have all made donations to the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, the Police Boys Club and the Smith Family. It is ironic that all these institutions are listed in the same order on thousands of forms. It is most improbable that all those new migrants and illegal immigrants would have donated to those four charities in one year. However, that improbability has not struck the people in the Taxation Office in Sydney. They have done nothing about the matter until now. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dekanic then asks people to assign to him their tax rebate cheques. People sign a simple form that allows him to place their cheques from the Taxation Office into his Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd account. After they have signed all these forms he tells them that he is the official Government agent, that he has fixed everything up for them with the Government and they do not need to wait for three or four months to get their refunds. He opens his drawer and gives them $100 or $200 cash. What these people forgo are tax refunds of hundreds of dollars to which they are entitled. In the New South Wales Parliament yesterday Mr Whelan presented a statutory declaration from one of his and my constituents that showed that Mr Dekanic had turned over to him a tax refund cheque worth $385 for which he paid the taxpayer $250. He received $135. That is not bad for filling in a standard Form S tax return. Most reputable accountants and tax agents would ask for $25 or $30. Mr Dekanic has admitted in the Sydney Press that this happens. He sees nothing wrong with it. Obviously the Taxation Office in New South Wales saw nothing wrong with it. It has only now started to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The practice of discounting group certificates at present is legal. It strikes me that the one thing that should not be legal is this sort of practice. It is disgusting. The law should be amended to make it illegal for a taxpayer to assign his rebate cheque to a tax agent or his agent. The Government should do something about it urgently. This man is involved not only in these legal but quasi-illegal activities, but also in the illegal activity of laundering stolen group certificates. The Taxation Office has had at least one example of a group certificate being presented by this man on behalf of an alleged client and a genuine duplicate group certificate being presented later to the Taxation Office on behalf of a client who had a statutory declaration to say that he had lost his group certificate or had it stolen. How does this man manage to collect these things? Obviously, there are forgeries of signatures. This practice must be stopped. It is theft and corruption practised against people who are least able to help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> One must ask oneself why nothing has been done. How could this iniquitous process go on for three years with nothing being done? Even if the practice is legal, why has the man not had his licence as a tax agent revoked? The legislation as it exists now would allow that to occur. Nothing has been done. This begs the question that the man has been protected somewhere along the line. As the investigation being conducted into the matter now is by extremely junior officers in the Department who are not as competent as others in their jobs, it seems that a great cover-up is about to be perpetrated on the theft by this man from migrants whom I represent in the Parliament and from other people who do not know their rights under the Australian taxation laws. To my mind, the most damning evidence against this man is his statement to the Sydney Press yesterday . Mr Dekanic, the man who has thieved from these migrants, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Why don't they-</PARA>
<PARA>He means the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>legislate what we-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, tax agents-</PARA>
<PARA>should do? That is the same as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes: They just make a fuss to cover up their own laziness. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to know tonight whose laziness is being covered up. Who are the corrupt people in this operation? Why has this man not had his tax agent's licence revoked? Why has he not been prosecuted? Why is he allowed to continue to defraud thousands of my constituents and people in the migrant community in Sydney? Week in week out he thieves from these people while he purports to be the official representative of the Australian Government. To my mind it is time that the Taxation Office gave some explanation of why nothing has been done. This is one of the worst frauds perpetrated against people who do not know their own rights that I have seen in the years I have been in the Parliament. It needs to be cleared up. The Government needs to ensure that it cannot occur again by changing the law so that tax agents cannot have assigned to them the tax refund cheques of unwitting taxpayers. To take from the mouths of people who are on low incomes what is justly theirs from the Australian Government is, as the New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs said, a heinous crime. It is a crime that the Taxation Office has allowed to occur. For at least three years it has known that it has gone on. Something has to be done. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh), who is at the table tonight, should bring this matter to the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Government should take action quick smart. In the next few weeks in this Parliament I would like to hear an explanation of how this has occurred. I will be raising this matter in the adjournment debate and during Question Time with the Treasurer to find out what has happened with this investigation and why this man is still allowed to practise as a tax agent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate on the Budget was interrupted last night I was about to deal with the causes of inflation. I point out, as I have done previously, that our level of inflation is higher than that of any of our trading partners and is rising, despite the promises of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1975, 1977 and 1980 that he would bring it down. On the contrary, it is going up. I will outline just a few of the many causes of inflation in this country-causes which the Government does not wish to acknowledge. They include: The increases in petrol prices; that is, the world parity pricing system which the Government introduced and the increase of 1c a litre in this Budget; the increases in health charges in this and previous Budgets; and high interest rates which, of course, affect everything. Interest rates at these levels affect local government rates because local governments have to borrow at very much higher rates. They affect electricity charges for the generation of electricity by the State electricity commissions and the county councils which have to raise their funds on a very much higher interest rate market. They affect telephone charges and prices of all goods. A manufacturer or businessman providing a service and working on an overdraft, with interest rates rising by 3 per cent, has two alternatives: To go broke or to increase his prices. It is as simple as that. Accordingly, that has quite an impact. One could go on and on about the causes of inflation, particularly because this Government generates inflation simply by the policies it follows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also make the point that this is a give and take Budget. Revenue from taxes comprises over 25 per cent of the gross domestic product in this year's Budget. This is approximately the same figure as in last year's Budget which had the highest figure for tax collections of any year to that date. In other words, there has been no reduction whatsoever in the level of taxes being collected. For this reason I submit that the Budget is a fraud in that it gives benefits with one hand and takes with the other. It takes through increased indirect taxes. Whenever there is an election, it will be a repeat performance of 1977. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his Budget gave various benefits, tax reductions in particular, before the election and when the election was over the next Budget took all those tax reductions back. That is the type of political morality of this Government. It set this precedent in 1977. It set the precedent then and it will carry out again. The people should beware and be aware of the intentions of the Government. As I said, the Prime Minister is politically completely dishonest in his approach to these matters. For that reason he will once again perpetuate this confidence trick of giving something before an election and taking it all back after an election, with the result that the people are worse off than they were before. In addition to that, the Prime Minister is quite psychotic in his fear that the Australian Labor Party may refuse to pass the Budget in the Senate. One must understand this man's mind to realise that that is precisely what he would do were he in our position. He was the architect of the refusal of Supply in 1974. He was the principal architect of the refusal of Supply in 1975. In the last election campaign in 1980 he stated that he would do the same again. No wonder the man has a conscience. He is quite psychotic. </PARA>

He was one of the people who supported bringing on these constitutional crises. He was one of the people who benefited from it. In other words, the Prime Minister would bring on another constitutional crisis and is, therefor, quite psychotic in his belief that, as he would do that, so would the Labor Party. There is no chance that the Labor Party would do that. It is a party of conscience and principle. As stated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) last night, there is no chance of that happening. Yet the Prime Minister is psychotic about this issue because he would do precisely that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the short time available I want to deal with the introduction of the tax of up to $1 on cheques of $5,000. The banks have been screaming. They are rather quiet at the moment. I have an idea that there are some negotiations going on with the Government. Many people with whom I come into contact have been using cheque accounts. They are now saying that they will close those cheque accounts and deal with building societies. This Government was supposedly trying to help the banks, which have been suffering fairly severely from the onslaught of the building societies, yet it introduces a measure such as this. Obviously, it has not been thought through and is, therefore, a perfect example of the ad hockery which occurred in the preparation of this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Costigan report on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union makes it appear that there is another $6,000m around in uncollected taxes. Perhaps the Government should recast the Budget completely. The Budget has a deficit of $1,600m. If the Government could collect the $6,000m it could have a surplus of $4,400m. The Costigan report is one which could have been expected in view of the history of this Government. It must be remembered that the Prime Minister himself, with the Nareen Pastoral Co. and this interwoven group of companies including Fraser Properties Pty Ltd, engaged in tax avoidance. Therefore, he set the example for the rest of the community. That is why there has been this massive growth in tax avoidance under this Government . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Budget is very timely. It recognises the hardship that exists in the community, it is realistic about the recession and it tries to cushion the blow for those who are hardest hit, especially those on fixed incomes, the pensioners and the unemployed. It is a family Budget, and that can be seen by its tax measures, family allowances and housing assistance. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) last night did nothing short of insult our intelligence. He exposed the complete lack of an Australian Labor Party policy in this area. He had a great time insulting people . All he really tried to do was to get into the Clancy column in the National Times, the Quotes of the Week in the Bulletin and Column 8 of the Sydney Morning Herald. He did not say anything of substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What should he have done? He should have given the ALP alternative, what we can expect if ever the ALP gets into government. But he gave no such thing-no policies. His speech was completely void of suggestions. He gave no remedies for unemployment, no ideas on inflation and no solutions to high interest rates, and he revealed no desire to help home buyers. Obviously the ALP does not want to give relief to pensioners; it wants only to see its words in print. The ALP is happier giving insults than finding solutions to economic problems. It is at times like this that I wish the proceedings of Parliament were broadcast in the Northern Territory. The best advantage that I could gain electorally in the Northern Territory would be for the people of the Territory to listen to the sort of tripe that the Leader of the Opposition put over last night. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some specific measures in this Budget that relate to my electorate. I shall talk first about the funding for the Northern Territory Government. This year the figure for State-type services in the Northern Territory is $731m, representing an increase of 18 per cent. It is the highest commitment ever given and it demonstrates very clearly what the Fraser Government thinks of self- government and the confidence that it has in the future of the Northern Territory. At the same time it is a Budget that recognises our special problems, those that are induced by isolation. It recognises very humanely and compassionately the particular problems of Aboriginal communities throughout the Northern Territory. The grant for State-type services is $5,500 a head. This strong financial support is needed because we have a historical problem. We need to overcome the disadvantages and the past neglect. These issues were all clearly recognised by the memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth Government and the Northern Territory Government. That sets out the continuing financial support which is needed to provide, firstly, for proper transport and communications; secondly, for a soundly based economy; and thirdly, for Aboriginal advancement. Overall the level of funding reflects the growth of population in the Northern Territory at a time when nowhere else in Australia can claim the same sort of growth. It reflects the growth in the Northern Territory economy which can be equalled nowhere else in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> An interesting aspect to note relating to the revenue that has been passed to the Northern Territory Government as compensation is the increase in the uranium royalties. This year they are to be increased by 190 per cent to $3.4m. That is paralleled by the growth of the industry in the Northern Territory. It will continue to increase in importance with the new mines that have come on stream. I refer to Pan-Continental at Jabiluka and, eventually, Koongarra. Uranium royalties will improve as the price of uranium picks up. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the ALP to offer in this regard? Its last conference was an absolute sell out. ALP spokesmen right around Australia and in the Northern Territory are saying that under a Labor Government no new mines will open in the Northern Territory. Does that offer any form of security or assistance to Territorians? Does it offer any form of advancement to the Aboriginals who will gain from the mining royalties that will eventuate from our policies? The spokesmen are completely and utterly bereft in their support for Northern Territory industry. They want to pull the rug from underneath the uranium industry of the Northern Territory. At least this Commonwealth Government recognises the industry's importance and sticks with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the area of taxation. In my electorate 39,000 taxpayers will benefit from this Budget. I am pleased and happy to stand up to say that. In particular, it will help over 3,000 taxpayers who recently crept into the 46 per cent tax bracket. The tax relief was necessary and welcomed by many families in the Northern Territory, given the high cost of living, the high rents and housing costs and the expensive transport costs. The spouse rebate was an issue of concern. I had many electoral representations over this matter. We should not penalise one income families. This year, of course, the increase of $200 in the rebate moves towards eliminating the anomaly involved. Zone allowances in the Northern Territory are important to our taxpayers. They remove some of the inequities but unfortunately they were not increased this year along with the other tax advantages, and that is a disappointment. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome particularly the moves to end the double taxation on dividends. On the broad scene, currently 2 per cent of domestic savings in Australia are invested through stock exchanges. Traditionally they have not been lucrative enough for the small investor and the taxation aspect previously was obviously abused. The move this year should provide encouragement for the small investor to invest. The increases in the family allowances will affect over 20,000 families in my electorate. They represent a sensible step in line with cost of living adjustments. The family income supplement deserves credit because it is aimed at low income earners with children, those who need compassion and care. The payment of $10 is not insignificant to those people and it will provide real assistance over and above income and family allowances. It is an innovative benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> There is sense in many other areas of the welfare budget. I refer to the pension increases. This year 7,600 pensioners in my electorate will benefit. Their tax systems will be adjusted. The tax threshold has been increased to $4, 595. That ensures that pensioners will not be taxed despite all the fear- mongering that was put around in the year by the Opposition. It protects the small savings of pensioners this year. Those who have a liberalised income will be able to benefit, to take real advantage. The pensioner rebate is a new idea that ensures that many of those in this area, with the extra $250, now have extra advantages. The permissible savings have been increased; the tests for fringe benefits have been eased. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the measures for pensioners but I appreciate that they will not solve all the problems of pensioners, particularly those who live in high cost areas in the Territory. They do not get zone allowances except on their small additional incomes; they do not get district allowances as do most wage earners. Therefore, I think that the rebate should be tied to the taxation rebate system for zone allowances and increased proportionately. The interest rate relief this year has done more to promote home ownership under this Government than any other measures in this Budget, and it is in addition to the policies that were announced in March. It is not just up to the Commonwealth to look at this area. I believe that the State and local governments also should act more deliberately in the area of housing. The Northern Territory Government has given an excellent example with its concessional interest based home loan scheme and the States would do well to follow this example. State and local governments can also assist in the housing arena by keeping down costs for home buyers and builders in the areas of stamp duty, transfer costs on land purchases and a whole range of similar areas. The March housing policy was aimed at first home buyers and was a welcome new policy. This year the Budget is aimed at all home buyers with an interest problem. The problem in the Northern Territory is not with people just buying their first home. Many of them have come in because of development reasons from interstate and may not be buying their first home; it may be a second or a later home. Yet they have difficulties because the cost of an average three-bedroom home is about $80,000. So the benefits that they will attract this year, if they qualify for a loan of $60,000, will be sensible and fair. If they have taken out a loan of $50,000 at 14 per cent they will qualify for over $14 per week in rebate. It will also provide an additional advantage to the Northern Territory housing industry. This is important in Darwin where a satellite suburb at Palmerston is about to take off. The rebate will be of tremendous advantage there. </PARA>
<PARA> The area of transport is always a contentious issue for the Northern Territory because of its geographical location, its long distances and the peculiar problems that it must face. We must continue to be able to provide proper road, rail, shipping and aerodrome networks. This Budget moves in that direction because it addresses all four areas in the Northern Territory. The Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program is innovative and courageous. It is practical and tangible and it will mean a lot more than all the flag waving, band playing celebrations that may happen in other places. It is important for the Northern Territory where road transport is vital. The major highways in the Territory badly need upgrading. It is also important to improve many approaches, previously Northern Territory highways, which are locked in on their approach routes interstate. Substantial stretches of the adjoining highways in Western Australian and Queensland are not sealed and very little of the road from Port Augusta to the Northern Territory border is sealed. The trips are often hazardous and difficult. Under this program these roads will be sealed on an integrated bitumen road network. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) has already set out the specific advantages of these upgrading programs in all areas. Additionally, it will facilitate travel for tourist purposes, enable local government to upgrade roads and expand the opportunities for commerce, assist in the development of our natural resources and mean a more efficient freight service to many areas. There are many indirect social benefits, such as reducing the road toll, savings in fuel consumption and providing employment. I agree with the establishment of a trust account for the levy money so that it will not be caught up. The money has been specially designated, it has been put aside and it is easy to see where the benefits will go; unlike what Wran has done in New South Wales in imposing a levy of 5c because the State is broke. He has had to put it into the coffers, not in the roads. The levy will benefit the Northern Territory. If the levy had been imposed last year on the consumption rates it would have yielded to Treasury about $1m, but the program announced by the Minister for the coming financial year shows that the Northern Territory stands to get $4.6m from the bicentennial roads program in addition to the program already agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> Shipping coastal subsidies have been maintained and increased and this will keep freight costs down. The Alice Springs to Darwin railway commitment has been reinforced with over $3m provided to continue the survey work. I only hope that the problems associated with Aboriginal sites can be resolved in the forthcoming year so that construction can start and deadlines can be met. Judging from past performance on the Tarcoola to Alice Springs railway this will be possible. The upgrading of the Gove Airport is a welcome announcement. Jets will be able to land with a greater frequency. This will greatly assist a much isolated community. I note that Darwin is listed on the civil works program but did not specifically gain funding this year for its new domestic terminal program. That certainly needs urgent action. The work is badly needed and it must be done at a time when the defence review is going on with all defence requirements in the Top End. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disturbed about the Customs duty excise on diesel because it will have an impact on the tourist arena. It is necessary that those isolated communities which are fuelling their own power should be able to enjoy concessions from that rebate. I hope they will be put in place and agreed at an early date. In the communications area it is pleasing to note the extension of the high frequency inland radio service. This will benefit pastoral and Aboriginal communities. It is part of a program to upgrade communications in remote areas. The remote area television program is to be completed this year. When that is linked also with the progress for the domestic satellite, I believe and I can say quite confidently we will see an interesting and a positive revolution in Aboriginal communities between 1986 and 1990 when television will be beamed in to all of those communities and they will be able to upgrade their general education and take advantage of many things in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dix report on the Australian Broadcasting Commission highlighted the neglected areas in the past in the ABC area. I am hopeful that at a very early time we will be able to rectify the imbalance that comes through many of the ABC areas. The pastoral industry will be relieved of the debt that has been hanging over its head with the brucellosis and tuberculosis campaign. That was an unfair burden on cattlemen. The eradication is always difficult and costly in the Territory because of lack of fences and other problems, but the uncertainty in the meat industry is certainly something we did not need at that time. If the debt had had to be met it would have caused major difficulties. Our rural industries are tight enough with droughts in southern areas and high costs in remote areas. They do not want things like that to make it more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal affairs always continue to be a major concern in my electorate. Approximately a quarter of the population lives in Aboriginal communities and relates to Aboriginal communities. It is very pleasing to note that this Budget continues to be a major concern of this Government. Aboriginal advancement programs total $163.8m which is an increase of 12.4 per cent. The Aboriginal Development Commission which has undertaken many great and innovative programs throughout the Territory has got $59m. Additional expenditures affect many Aboriginal communities in the fields of health, education, employment and social security. The Minister has announced major allocations in all of these areas for the Territory. In addition community management programs get a lot of extra money to complete the work on sewerage and on power in a number of communities. The Minister has also given priority to alcohol rehabilitation which affects so many people in those communities. </PARA>
<PARA> One area in the Aboriginal arena that I would like to highlight is that Aboriginal communities currently have to deal with at least 16 agencies to gain their financial funding. I think this is confusing and far too bureaucratic. There needs to be a reduction in the number of agencies-but not the programs and or the financing-to simplify the liaison and the challenge. Any community would be bewildered if it had to deal with 16 different funding channels. This problem is compounded in Aboriginal communities. I would like to see the funds in the administrative programs redirected to far more constructive programs. This Budget is a great Budget for the Northern Territory. It has some problems but overall it is also a very great Budget for Australia. </PARA>

I think that most people who have had a good look at the Budget will agree with me when I say that the Budget does not even pick up the casualties of the Government's own economic policies which it has pursued for the last seven years. In the seven years of its existence, the Government has created an economic crisis equal to that of the 1930s. This level of unemployment which is unprecedented since the Great Depression has reached or even exceeded 6 per cent and is predicted by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech to reach 8 per cent in the near future. A week after his Budget Speech, the Treasurer admitted that unemployment would be higher than his forecast of 8 per cent. We all know that in a couple of months there will be at least 10 per cent of people unemployed. Some sources predict that the level of unemployment will reach 14 per cent early next year- unless we get rid of Fraser Government in the meantime.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the day when the Budget was announced, the Melbourne Sun displayed the headline: 'Fraud-A Family Budget'. But up go the prices of beer, petrol and cigarettes. I wish to quote from the Australian Financial Review-not the Labor Star. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget predicts higher inflation, higher interest rates and higher unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister stated that it was a family Budget. What a hypocrite! He well knows that as a result of his policies every family has higher and higher mortgage repayments on their homes, that the real value of family incomes is being eroded by increasing inflation and that an increasing number of Australian families will depend on social security payments as more and more breadwinners lose their jobs as a result of this 'surrender' or 'do nothing' Budget. A Family Budget indeed! How honourable members opposite can parrot their leader without blushing is beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the promised handouts or, as the Melbourne Age editorial calls them, the largely illusory vote-catching concessions. In return for higher sales tax, higher taxes on cigarettes, beer and petrol, higher pharmaceutical charges and health insurance costs, the Treasurer offered a very modest easing in personal income tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amount of $1,500m will not be coming from new wage earners as according to the Treasurer there will not be any addition to our work force. On the contrary, according to the Treasurer's own admission, there will be more unemployed. Despite his own estimates which aim to collect more income tax this year than last year, the Treasurer insists that he is giving tax cuts. Of course he forgot to mention that the cuts are only illusory and not in real terms as inflation erodes their value. According to the Treasurer's own rubbery figures, he expects to collect $400 to $500 more this year than last year from every wage and salary earner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us see what the Australian Financial Review had to say about the so-called tax cuts offered by the Treasurer. I quote from page 9 of the Australian Financial Review dated 18 August 1982 where it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The other political problem lies in what could be called the '1977 Factor': the extent which voters will believe that the handouts they are to get now will not be removed or reduced if the Government is re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977 the last 'rubbery' Budget, personal taxes were cut, a 'fistful of dollars' election campaign was fought in December and in the following August Budget an income tax surcharge, retrospective to the beginning of the year, was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>No wonder my constituents in Hotham are ringing my office. They are not asking what benefits they will receive from the Budget but for how long they will receive them. To take into account the Prime Minister's past record, it would not be hard to guess what my answer would be. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to be too harsh in my criticism. I pay tribute where tribute is due. There is also good news in the Budget. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) happily announced that a new telescope will be built. This would probably give employment to a couple of astronomers by the year 1990 or by the turn of the century. This certainly will not solve our unemployment problems but, on the other hand, since the telescope will be able to look 10 billion years in the past to enable us to discern the origins of the philosophy of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we do not need a telescope to see that honourable gentlemen opposite are still living in the last century, nor do we need a telescope to discover that the Budget is a blunder of astronomical proportions and that it will disintegrate in a few months' time because it is based on rubbery estimates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to outline some of the difficulties being expeienced by small business owners at the Ginninderra Village complex, an historic and unique tourist attraction on the outskirts of Canberra. Problems have arisen because the new owner of the premises has raised tenants' rents by more than 300 per cent. Naturally, the small businesses involved oppose such massive increases and have attempted to put their case for a fairer deal. Negotiations with the new owners proved unsatisfactory and no progress was made. Discussions with the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) also failed to achieve a fairer deal for the tenants. Despite repeated attempts to resolve the situation, the tenants feel cheated and disappointed by the Minister's apparent lack of concern for their predicament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister did ask the Department of the Capital Territory to arrange for an arbiter to determine fair rents earlier this year. Despite the fact that it could reasonably be assumed that the tenants were significant parties in this dispute, the tenants were not consulted during the arbitration procedure which was carried out by a valuer in conjunction with the Department and the new owner . The result of the so-called arbitration was rent increases of more than 300 per cent. No reasons were given nor were there any comparisons with other similar types of property. </PARA>
<PARA> To add insult to injury tenants were then presented with a bill for $641, half the cost of the arbitration, even though at no stage were they given the opportunity to put their case. Understandably, the tenants are very angry. It appears that the Government is condoning profiteering from public land. In this case the land rent paid by the owner each year is $3,200. This allows the owner to receive $14,000 per annum from current rent paid by tenants and at least $35, 000 per year if the massive rental increases are forced on the tenants. The situation of these tenants highlights the need for an effective business leases tribunal. I hope the Minister for the Capital Territory will assure us very soon that we will fully investigate this problem and will explain to us how the business leases tribunal would operate. He has discussed the possibility of establishing this tribunal for years and we still see no evidence that such a tribunal is to be established. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken on many previous occasions about the difficulties of small business people in relation to the major shopping centres in Canberra, most of which are controlled by Lend Lease Corporation Ltd. All of these cases highlight the problems that small business people face when natural justice is denied to them and no independent avenues of appeal are available. A spokesperson for the Ginninderra Village traders summed up the situation well by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks a lot about small business, but when it comes to the crunch it obviously doesn't give a damn. It has allowed massive rent increases which not only force the businesses out of operation but deny more than 200 craftspeople-including some from Tasmania--</PARA>
<PARA>For the interest of the Minister for the Capital Territory-</PARA>
<PARA>an outlet. </PARA>
<PARA> It shows the Liberal Party doesn't care about the people it claims to represent -the ordinary small business person. If it won't do anything to help them in the ACT where it has total control what hope do Australians in other places have?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that concerns me is that I now have in my hands proof that a health fund, Medibank, which is losing money in nearly every State of Australia, is offering to people who work for certain banks or companies special deals that are not available to the general public. I regard this as discriminatory and also as contravening the report in the Australian Financial Review of 30 December 1981 that the Government had warned health funds about discounting. Medibank stated that all waiting periods will be waived if people join Medibank-even the 12-month qualifying period for major dental work-that the known expense rule will not be applied; and that the 9-month obstetrics rule will not be applied.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity tonight to draw the attention of the House to what I consider to be a harsh decision of the Department of Veterans' Affairs in relation to a constituent of mine, Mr Alan Ashmore. As a Vietnam veteran in receipt of a disability pension, Mr Ashmore has had nearly two years of frustrating correspondence with the Department in relation to claims for medical costs with, I regret to say, the Department and, finally, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) declining to make any reimbursement to Mr Ashmore. Honourable members will be aware that a number or research studies have been made both here and in the United States of America which have indicated a possible link between illnesses suffered by Vietnam war veterans and the war in Vietnam. A number of Australian war veterans, of whom Mr Ashmore is one, have been considerably worried about any possible link with their own disabilities and their exposure to toxic chemicals in Vietnam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the past three years Vietnam veterans have been blocked by the Federal Government at every attempt to obtain information about any exposure of Vietnam veterans to harmful quantities of toxic herbicides. As the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia has stated, veterans have a right to all the available information on the use of toxic chemicals in Vietnam as well as a right to an expert assessment of the effects of their exposure to them. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment is at present inquiring into the possible effects of the exposure of toxic chemicals on Vietnam veterans and is expecting to present its report shortly. However, the Association is calling for a royal commission and I support such a call because I agree with the Association that this is the only way of ensuring an independent investigation of the matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Having set the background to Mr Ashmore's dispute with the Department of Veterans' Affairs I will now deal with the details of his case. Mr Ashmore, having decided with his wife that they would like to commence a family also decided that it would be wise for him to undergo sperm tests to uncover any possible abnormalities in view of the possible link between birth defects and chemical poisoning. This view was also supported by their medical practitioner. Mr and Mrs Ashmore were also advised by their local practitioner that Mrs Ashmore's pregnancy should be monitored in case of possible abnormalities. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the tests would not have been necessary had Mr Ashmore not served in Vietnam, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs refused to accept any liability on behalf of the Government and sheltered behind the claim that no legislative provisions existed to reimburse Mr and Mrs Ashmore for their medical costs. The rejection of Mr Ashmore's second claim was, in my view, even more inequitable than the rejection of the first claim. Mr Ashmore suffers from a severe form of dermatitis, called neurodermatitis, which is a skin disorder which causes him considerable discomfort. Because of the severity of the condition Mr Ashmore's local repatriation doctor referred him to a skin specialist. The subsequent treatment was only marginally effective and so the repatriation doctor finally referred him to a naturopath. The Department of Veterans' Affairs, supported subsequently by the Minister, declined to reimburse Mr Ashmore for the $200 cost of his treatment by the naturopath. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the grounds for the decision of the Department that its policy is to pay for treatment only by recognised and established ancillary medical services and that those services do not include naturopathic services to be very bad grounds. I understand that the Department has been guided in its decisions by the views of the Australian Medical Association which does not encourage the use of alternative forms of therapy. I do not accept, nor would many people in the community, that the view of the AMA represents a consensus opinion of the medical profession as to what treatment is worth while. Many people in the community benefit from what is often described as unconventional forms of medical treatment. I question the impartiality of the AMA in such matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMA is one of the most conservative professional bodies in our community whose closed shop practices appear to be designed wholly to protect the remuneration of their members rather than encourage the practice of medicine for the benefit of sick people. The result of the refusal by the Minister to even consider changing the policy of his Department in relation to alternative medicine sources means that Mr Ashmore will no doubt have to resort to the considerably more expensive treatment of a skin specialist, at the expense of the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ashmore has asked me to pursue this matter on his behalf and although I have appealed to the Minister he has not accepted the grounds of my appeal. My last resort is to bring the circumstances of Mr Ashmore's case to the attention of the House. The legacy of the Vietnam war will linger with us for many years to come but the Minister and his Department should at least introduce policies which show that the Government has some sympathy with those Vietnam veterans who are presently suffering from medical complaints which they contracted during the war. At the moment Vietnam veterans are justifiably feeling that they are being neglected and ignored by a government which has no understanding of their problems and can offer them no hope for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to draw the attention of the House to the drought that is affecting New South Wales in particular and of course my electorate along with the neighbouring electorate of Eden-Monaro and many others . This matter was raised in this House at Question Time yesterday and on a previous occasion. On both those occasions comment was made about the role of the New South Wales Government in providing assistance. There is no doubt that the New South Wales Government has falsely alleged that there has been a lack of support by the Federal Government in endeavours to provide relief to those farmers who are drought affected. In this context I think it is worth while pointing out exactly what the facts are about the Federal Government's assistance to drought relief in this nation. The last major drought that affected New South Wales was regrettably only a couple of years ago. In the 1980 -81 financial year the Federal Government demonstrated, with money, the extent of its support for the farmers of that State when conditions had become seriously adverse. It is against the background of that demonstration of support that the statements made by the New South Wales Government and the New South Wales Minister responsible are utterly disgraceful. They are a further attempt to play politics with the livelihoods of the farmers of that State who are suffering severely as a result of their second major drought in three seasons.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (a) Excludes the cost of emergency assistance provided by the Defence Forces. Amounts shown are payments made in each financial year less refunds made within the same financial year; refunds made in subsequent years are deducted in the year in which they are received. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Payments for Natural Disaster Relief are not designed to provide assistance on a disaster-by-disaster basis, but rather to assist States in meeting the costs of relief measures when they exceed a State's assessed annual financial capacity. This Table is derived from States advice on their expenditure by type of disaster and apportioning. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Mr BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. This table clearly shows that in 1980-81, which was the last year when there was a major drought in New South Wales, the Federal Government provided $43.6m for natural disaster relief but the great bulk of that-$42.4m-was specifically for drought aid. It is interesting to note that the New South Wales Government has claimed that in that year it made payments of $67 .8m for natural disaster relief. It omitted to state the fact that two-thirds of those payments were specific drought relief payments made by the State only because they were paid by the Commonwealth Government to the State for distribution to those farmers. When there is trouble in New South Wales, when there is trouble in any State in the rural communities, it is the Federal Government that provides the real relief. In other words in 1980-81, when there was a drought in New South Wales which severely affected the farmers in that State, the Federal Government, through its specific drought assistance, provided almost two-thirds of the total help to that State. The New South Wales Government knows that. It knows that those arrangements persist to this day. Yet State Government Ministers are pretending, falsely and maliciously to the farmers of New South Wales, that they are unable to provide adequate assistance because the Federal Government is not providing adequate funding. Have honourable members ever heard such deceptive bunkum?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course the interesting thing is that not only is the system which existed in 1980-81 persisting-that is that once the States reach a moderate target level the Federal Government provides $3 for every $1 that is provided by the States- but also in addition to that the Federal Government has ensured that the States will not run out of money for this purpose this year and has provided an advance payment of $10m. I am assured by farming organisations that the rate of application for relief at the moment is so slow that there is no way this $10m will be used up in the near future. In effect the Federal Government is meeting the great bulk of the cost even before the minimum level required to be paid by the State, before Federal assistance is triggered in normal terms, has been met. The State Government is not meeting its responsibilities to the farmers of New South Wales in this drought. The State Government has deceptively misled the farmers to suggest that the Federal Government is not providing assistance. As is usual we will provide the bulk of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a number of years I was a member of a State legislature and every six months the question of the need for a second airport for Sydney was raised. Unfortunately now that I am a member of this House, I find that the question of a second airport seems to be a re-submit at six monthly intervals also. This issue is far too serious to be just brought before the House or trailed out by the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) every six months . It is important that Sydney obtain a second airport and it is essential that the Government, at this stage, announce the site for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is appalling that so many people in the outer areas of Sydney, so many young couples who are buying homes, have their properties at risk because some large site must be set aside for a second airport. The danger to the heavily populated residential areas of Sydney is enormous. We have aircraft flying over day and night on the north-south flight path. It is a complete danger to people living underneath the flight path; it is a danger to children in schools; it is a danger to hospitals and other institutions. Yet this Government will do nothing about the second airport for Sydney. It is a matter not of noise, not of pollution; it is a matter of danger and public safety. After all, that is surely one of the reasons why we are all in this House-to legislate in the interest of public safety and public health. Public safety is in jeopardy while we have a major airport located in the middle of the largest city in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I well remember the Parramatta by-election in July 1973 and the furore that the suggestion of an airport at Galston created. I believe that has frightened subsequent governments and led them to play act with this issue of a second airport in Sydney. Thousands of people are involved. Thousands of jobs are involved. The location of the airport must be announced now-not put off for another year-because it is a long term project. There is a need for service corridors. There is a need for rail services to be provided and for roads to be built. All of these services will be paid for by the Commonwealth Government. Not one penny of State money will go into the airport yet the Minister in the House and in the newspapers has made statements the there must be an agreement with the State Government. This is absolute rubbish. The New South Wales Government said this when it withdrew from the Major Airport Needs of Sydney study. It said that the whole issue was in the hands of the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Government had to take the odium and the responsibility for deciding the site for Sydney's second airport. The whole thing has become a charade. It is hurting tourism in this nation. However, we cannot expect much from this Government because this is the insensitive Government that introduced the $20 departure tax. Nevertheless, it is the issue of public safety that I wish to raise tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a member of another parliament in February 1980 when the plane to Temora crashed. There were 12 passengers killed. Many of us thought that the member for Temora in the State House was a passenger. The accident occurred on a Thursday night after the House rose. It was a tragedy. We were only thankful that the member had missed that plane. The indifference of this Government, the procrastinating nature of the Government and the lack of real concern and real planning are threats to country people. The Government regards planning as a dirty word. Yet it is country people who are suffering. It was country people returning to the bush with their families who were killed in that tragic plane crash when the Beech Super King crashed at Sydney Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) said, had we had an airport with a skirt around the runway there would have been ample room for that plane having difficulty taking off to land. It could not land; it hit the rocks and all the passengers and all the crew were killed. This is the reality of Sydney's airport. It is too small. Yet the Minister is flying a kite about a stubby runway, another runway out into Botany Bay. All the expense is, of course , in dredging the bay. I draw this matter to the attention of the House because I believe it is a matter of public safety that this Government must grapple with . Australia is becoming a farce overseas. Tourists are stranded because of the curfew at Sydney Airport. Yet a stubby runway at Sydney Airport would bring more flights not only over my electorate but also over the electorate of Barton and the suburbs of Hunters Hill, Artarmon and the North Shore-all of these suburbs represented by Government members. I think that the House and the nation will eventually condemn this Government for its inaction on the matter of a second airport in Sydney. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before a Budget is presented there are many allegations about what is to be in the Budget. There is a lot of so-called informed comment from people, particularly in the Press gallery, who regard themselves as experts in this area. I point out that among the many forecasts that were made before this Budget there was one that lump sum superannuation benefits were to be taxed in some way by the Government. What I wish to do tonight is simply to dramatise to the House and to those people who made these allegations that that was total nonsense. Lump sum superannuation benefits have not been changed in any way in the Federal Budget. I think the people who spread that kind of rumour should be aware of that. The allegations that there would be changes in the taxation treatment of lump sum superannuation benefits have, in fact, for the second time in a row been proved false in this Budget. I stressed some time ago that the Budget would not make any such changes. Of course, it did not set a limit-despite these politically inspired rumours, I suggest-on the level of superannuation benefit that may be paid in the form of a lump sum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will remember that during the 1980 election campaign the Government indicated that it had no intention of altering the present taxation arrangements for lump sum superannuation benefits. Despite those assurances there have been continual rumours-politically inspired-that there would be a change. At that time a commitment was made that the Government would not change these rules during the life of the present Parliament. This remains the situation. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in fact asserted this only a little while ago. Yet we found many people prepared to go into print saying that there would be such changes. I recognise that some administrative arrangements have been changed for some small business superannuation funds which were being used for tax avoidance reasons. As the House knows, no government has been more assiduous than this Government in closing such loopholes. As a result the Commissioner of Taxation altered the arrangements to overcome the unintended exploitation of the superannuation provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act relating to small business superannuation funds. These arrangements became operational from 1 July this year. Details were announced last May. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be restated that not only were there no changes to lump sum superannuation tax treatment in the last Budget but also there will be no change in the taxation treatment of lump sum superannuation, at least during the term of the current Parliament. I do not know how many more times that has to be said before honourable members opposite and members of the Press corps gallery will act on this matter responsibly so that they do not terrorise some people into early retirement. I point out that some people were so unnerved by these false rumours that they left their employment before they should have, so diminishing the amount of benefit they would get on retirement. This was because of these pre-Budget rumours. It seems to me to be most unfortunate that people who spread this sort of rumour for political purposes are unaware of the real consequences they have on people approaching retirement who may well-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (7) The Government's invitation of 12 August 1981 for Shell to discuss with the Foreign Investment Review Board the possibility of introducing 25 per cent Australian equity into its overall Australian operations was made in the context of the Governments consideration of certain proposals by Shell for the acquisition of substantial interests in resource development proposals, against the background of Shell's extensive involvement in Australian natural resources and the importance the Government places on achieving a high level of Australian equity in this area.

Gosper of Shell on 17 September 1981, the Government has accepted Shell's assessment that it is not commercially opportune at the present time for Shell to introduce Australian equity into its overall Australian operations.

<PARA> The trading banks at present apply a range of charges and fees in respect of customers' transactions, although certain customers, for example non-profit organisations, are generally exempt. The most common fees and charges are cheque account-keeping fees related to the number of debit and credit items over a specified period, usually a quarter. Rebates of the fees are normally allowed when the balance of the account does not fall below a specified minimum. Charges are also levied by banks on other transactions including, for example, those involving overseas payments. Such charges are designed to recoup, in part or in full, the cost to the bank of providing the relevant service to the customer. The form and structure of the various charges differ between banks.</PARA>
<PARA> There are no charges on deposits to and withdrawals from savings banks' customers' accounts (except where an additional service is provided, such as issue of a bank cheque).</PARA>

<PARA> (1) With reference to my repeated requests to urgently review the conditions under which technical knowledge is transferred to Australia and the need for such transfers to be one of the guidelines upon which the Foreign Investment Review Board makes its assessment on foreign investment in this country, is it a fact that the Foreign Investment Review Board has at last noted this criterion by its statement in its latest report that it has been concerned to ensure that the arrangements for the provision and ownership of technology secure the maximum transfer of technology to Australians on reasonable terms and conditions .</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Did he give approval on 28 February 1982 under his Government's foreign investment guidelines for the future development of oil shale deposits at Rundle near Gladstone, Queensland subject to environmental clearance, and did he state that the Government considers that the proposal conforms with its policy objective of providing maximum opportunities for Australian participation in the extraction and processing of Australia's mineral resources.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Foreign investment proposals are examined under the Government's foreign investment policy on the basis of various criteria to assess whether they are in accord with Australia's national interest in terms of economic and other benefits. Where applicable, technology aspects of individual proposals are considered so as to assess whether the introduction of new technology would result in economic benefits to Australia. In considering this matter, regard is had to whether Australian investors would also be able to gain access to the relevant technology by entering commercial arrangements to purchase or lease it from overseas sources. In addition, proposals are examined to ascertain whether arrangements for the undertaking of research and development, and royalty, licensing and patent arrangements are in accord with Australia's interests.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Foreign Investment Review Board's 1981 annual report, technology transfer was referred to in relation to synthetic fuel projects. While the technology for converting raw materials into liquid fuels has been in existence for a long time, its refinement to suit the conversion of particular resource deposits on a commercial basis is not yet developed. Accordingly, the question of access for Australian investors to the relevant technological developments has been a major factor in examining major synthetic fuel projects between foreign and Australian interests.</PARA>
<PARA> The Board has therefore been concerned that, while keeping in mind the commercial circumstances involved, the technology arrangements between the parties should secure the maximum long term transfer of technology to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2), (3) and (4) The proposals for synthetic fuel projects so far considered by the Government under its foreign investment policy are as follows:</PARA>

<PARA> (a) exact participation in the project to be negotiated at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA> I have previously announced that, subject to consideration under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the proposals for possible future development of both the Rundle shale oil project and the Gelliondale coal liquefaction project will be given favourable consideration under the Government's foreign investment policy. Both proposals conform with the Government's policy objective of providing maximum opportunities for significant Australian participation in the extraction and processing of Australia's mineral resources.</PARA>
<PARA> Following examination by the Board of the proposed arrangements for technology associated with the Rundle project the Government considered that access would be provided to the participating Australian companies. In its consideration the Government has taken into account that technology arising from the project will be jointly owned by the participants, and the Australian partners will have access to other technology from the Esso group for use at Rundle and in other projects.</PARA>
<PARA> The conditions on technology transfer imposed for the Gelliondale project require the parties to submit to the Board for examination any technical agreements between the parties and the providers of any technology (whether related corporations or not). It is envisaged that once Arco has met its initial expenditure commitments to earn its interest in the venture, new technology arising from the project will be the joint property of the participants, while the Australian participants will have appropriate access to other technology provided by the Arco group.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Nippon project, construction of the pilot plant has been approved under the foreign investment policy against the background of arrangements for co-operation on energy research and development between Australia and Japan. The Victorian and Australian authorities will have access to the technology. Should the project proceed beyond the pilot plant stage, the Government has required that Australians be offered 50 per cent equity and that they be afforded access to the technology arising from the pilot plant on reasonable terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> To date, proposals relating to the Condor and Mitsui-CSR projects have been considered under the foreign investment policy only up to the feasibility study stage. Should proposals eventuate for the development of these projects to the demonstration or full commercial stage they will require separate examination by the Board for recommendatoin to the Government. At that time, the Board will seek from the parties the arrangements for the ownership of technology arising from the project, and for the transfer of other technology to the project.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In relation to other mineral resources, the Government has recently re- affirmed its guidelines for at least 50 per cent Australian equity and control in new mining developments (other than for new uranium projects where the objective is 75 per cent Australian equity and Australian control). In addition, the Government has decided that, in the case of new devleopments in the minerals processing industry, it wishes to ensure that maximum opportunities are made available for significant Australian participation in ownership and control. In considering individual cases, the Government will seek to arrive at an appropriate level of Australian equity participation to meet this objective, in consultation with the parties. In this process recognition will continue to be given to the needs of such projects for relatively large amounts of capital, and in some cases for new or advanced technology not at present available from domestic sources, and to other special aspects which could affect the feasibility of Australian participation in a venture.</PARA>
<PARA> Matters relating to technology are not normally an issue in proposals relating to minerals extraction where the technology is already widely disseminated within the industry. However, where the technology involved may not always be generally available, for example in the petroleum industry and in minerals processing, access to the technology by the Australian participants is closely examined by the Board in its assessment of the net economic benefits to Australia. The Board seeks to ensure, wherever appropriate and commercially practicable, that the agreements and the arrangements involved in such projects provide scope for the Australian investors to have access to the technology, so as to encourage dissemination of the technology within Australia over the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA> Through the Foreign Investment Review Board, the Government has also drawn the attention of foreign investors to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises with which Australia has associated itself and which the Government wishes foreign interests operating in Australia to observe. Under the OECD Guidelines, multinational enterprises should contribute to the development of scientific and technological capacities of the countries in which they operate, including as far as appropriate the establishment and improvement in host countries of their capacity to innovate. They should also permit the rapid diffusion of technologies having regard to the protection of property rights, and transfer technology on reasonable terms and conditions.</PARA>

Since that time there has been no general change in the design of currency on issue, and there is no present proposal to issue new series of coins. However, production of the round 50 cent silver coin was limited to the 1966 issue. This coin was replaced by a dodecagonal cupro-nickel coin in 1969. On several occasions, commemorative issues of this coin with special designs have also been made. The introduction, since 1966, of the $5 note and the $50 note and collector coins with face values of $10 and $200 have also, of course, involved new designs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As the honourable member will be aware questions involving various aspects of superannuation arise on a continuing basis in the ordinary course of reviewing government policies in areas such as taxation, social welfare and industrial relations. It would appear that the Task Force on Occupational Superannuation, which has been undertaking inquiries into aspects of occupational superannuation, is the only general inquiry at the official level of relevance to the honourable member's question.</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in my press statement of 12 July 1979 the Task Force on Occupational Superannuation was established to consider the role of occupational superannuation in providing for retirement and whether there is a need to revise or impose new standards for schemes. The Task Force was asked to make recommendations if existing standards were regarded as inappropriate and to examine the question of trade union involvement in superannuation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> I would also refer the honourable member to the announcement made on 7 June 1982 by Mr David Connolly, MP, concerning the establishment of a Committee of backbenchers to examine current superannuation arrangements and possibilities as a result of a decision of the Government parties and its terms of reference were outlined in Mr Connolly's announcement of 7 June.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the early stages of its work the Task Force on Occupational Superannuation put forward a preliminary report and in the light of that report the Government agreed that a number of specific matters should form part of its work program. These matters were principally concerned with the formulation of possible arrangements for ensuring that superannuation funds which attract taxation concessions are used for genuine retirement purposes and observe improved operational standards (e.g., in the area of security of benefits) and with the examination of a number of other superannuation issues of relevance to taxation and social welfare policy.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Subject to the outcome of processes currently in hand for further Ministerial guidance to be given to the Task Force, it is my expectation that the Task Force will be able to report to the Government later this year.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) to (4) I refer the honourable member to my Press release No. 134 of 23 July 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of the Commissioner of Taxation that profits arising from the sale or redemption of securities purchased or acquired at a discount represent assessable income. The Government believes that the view held by the Commissioner is correct in law. Amendment to the income tax law to make these profits liable to tax is not necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless representations to the Government in recent weeks have clearly demonstrated that a significant number of small investors have purchased discounted securities in the bona fide belief that the profit on sale or redemption would not be regarded as assessable income. To some extent this belief may have been influenced by the fact that the tap stock prospectus contains no advice that the redemption discount is assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided, therefore, to amend the income tax law to exempt from income tax profits made by investors on the redemption or sale of securities purchased at a discount before June 1982. The exemption will not apply to profits made by traders or dealers or that are profits to which sections 26AAA, 26C or 26 (a) apply.</PARA>
