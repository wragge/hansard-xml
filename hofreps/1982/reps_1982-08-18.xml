<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Treasurer. It concerns his protestations that there has been no political interference in the figures produced in the Budget. I ask whether he is aware of a recent statement by the head of Treasury, Mr Stone, who, in evidence to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure on 26 May of this year, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . the Budget Papers tendered to the Parliament are tendered by the Treasurer. They are his responsibility; they are his papers. He has officials prepare them under his direction. Therefore the content of those papers is his decision . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Will the Treasurer now agree that he personally is responsible for all those figures? Can he therefore assure the House that this year's Budget is more soundly based than the infamous 1977 Budget, the benefits of which were quickly whipped away in the subsequent year?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have absolutely no hesitation at all in saying that not only is the Budget issued under my authority but also the documents attached to the Budget papers are issued under my authority. I regard them as papers for which I am responsible. What I have said-the honourable member gives me the opportunity of repeating it-is that all the revenue figures in the Budget have been supplied by the Taxation Office, in the case of excise by the Department of Industry and Commerce which has within it the Bureau of Customs, by the Treasury or, in any other miscellaneous cases, by the relevant expert departments. Nobody at a political level has in any way altered those figures. I accept responsibility for them. I believe that the figures are correct because they have been given to me by people whose professional competence and integrity I respect and trust.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Aviation whether it is a fact that the airlines and many airline passengers are concerned about the delays caused by the congestion in landing and taking off at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport? Is the problem there being accentuated by the fact that the New South Wales Government will not agree to the construction of an extra runway? Can the Minister state the present position?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="461" SPEAKER="Fife The Hon W.C." NAMEID="CG4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="FARRER" MINISTERIAL="AVIATION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr FIFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that delays are being occasioned at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith ) Airport. The advice that I have before me from the Department of Aviation indicates very clearly that the position will worsen over the next two or three years. Indeed, it is fair to say that the position is worsening each day. I am sure that many members of the travelling public and many members of this Parliament have been on aircraft that have been delayed in recent times as a result of traffic congestion at Kingsford-Smith Airport. It is also true, as indicated by the honourable member, that the Commonwealth has been prepared for some time to proceed with the construction of a second parallel runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport, but up to the present time it has not been able to obtain the co-operation of the New South Wales Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have also indicated that we are prepared to work in conjunction with the New South Wales Government in an effort to identify and to determine a site for a second airport in the Sydney region. It is necessary, of course, to have the co- operation of the State Government in this respect because any airport site that is ultimately chosen will have to be serviced by surface transport-by road and perhaps even by rail. Of course, they are responsibilities of the State Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few weeks I have been giving consideration to this matter. I hope to put some proposals before the Commonwealth Government in the not too distant future. It is a matter of urgency because, whatever decision is taken, the lead time is great. Several years is involved from when a decision is taken until a remedial project is ready for use.</PARA>
<PARA> Another point that I make in answer to the honourable member's question is that , contrary to popular belief, the growth in traffic is in the commuter area. There has been a decline in traffic movements by international and domestic trunk aircraft. Commuter aircraft movements have increased considerably over the past five or six years. It is necessary, of course, for international aircraft, domestic trunk aircraft and commuter aircraft to use the same airport because many airlines link in with each other. I give the honourable member an assurance that this matter will continue to have my attention with a view to resolving it in the interests of the travelling public.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address another question to the Treasurer. It relates to his pronouncement last year in this House when he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a general rule, each additional $500m raised through indirect taxes results in direct and indirect additions to the consumer price index of almost one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Do not the increases in indirect taxes in this year's Budget totalling $1,046m and the many increases in Government charges mean that the increases in the consumer price index in this financial year resulting from the Budget will be about 2 per cent rather than the one per cent which the Government has claimed?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two qualifications have to be put on the sum that the honourable member has done. The first is that different indirect tax increases have a slightly different impact on the CPI. Some changes have a different or better CPI value than others, if I can put it that way. The other point that the honourable member should bear in mind is that, I am advised, the Australian Statistician does not measure distillate in the CPI. As a consequence the indirect tax gained from the changes in that area would not have any CPI effect at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Defence Support advise the House whether the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, has been successful in its attempt to obtain a sub- contract for the supply of certain parts to a crawler tractor contract recently let by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="462" SPEAKER="Viner The Hon R.I." NAMEID="EE6" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="STIRLING" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE SUPPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE6">Mr VINER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This House knows that ever since the honourable member has been the member for Bendigo he has had the interests of the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, at heart. He has worked very assiduously in the interests of that factory. He has been quite prepared to fight for the interests of the employees of that factory at Bendigo during the period of uncertainty over the last 12 months. The factual situation is that the honourable member, together with my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was instrumental in seeing that the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo was given every opportunity to tender for work with the State Electricity Commission of Victoria for the crawler frames, being parts of a bucket dredge for the Loy Yang project. Indeed, in April of this year the Minister for Industry and Commerce assured the prime contractor, Demag Industries, that even if the factory were sold or leased the factory would honour its contract if it were granted to Bendigo. I understand that the other competitor for this contract-it is a major one-would be a German firm engaging in importation. So the House can see what is at stake for the factory and for Bendigo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can inform the honourable gentleman that the management of the factory is holding discussions today with the State Electricity Commission of Victoria and Demag Industries to consider price. So far as I am concerned, every reasonable opportunity will be given to the factory to tender at an appropriate price. I am concerned to see that the Victorian Government likewise provides every opportunity to its instrumentality, the State Electricity Commission, to see that the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, can obtain this job. I understand that there has been some discussion between the Victorian Minister for Economic Development , Mr Landeryou, and the Victorian Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr White. I hope that Mr Landeryou will see that nothing is done within the instrumentality or by his ministerial colleague to prevent this contract from going to the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, following these negotiations on price today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to the Budget proposal to grant mortgage relief. Is he aware that every one per cent rise in mortgage interest rates results in a rise of $300m in total household interest payments? Is he aware that, because home loan interest rates have risen by 4 per cent since 1980, the interest bill for households has risen by $1,200m? Since the Budget provides $ 155m in mortgage relief this year, how does the Government propose to compensate home buyers for the rest of the interest burden imposed on them by its economic policies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Prime Minister seen the joint communique issued last evening by the United States of America and China concerning United States arms sales to Taiwan? If so, could he comment on this communique in the light of discussions he held during his recent visit to China?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="462" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A joint communique between the United States and China has been issued. I believe that all honourable members would welcome the substance of that communique because it puts to rest a dispute which had potential for a serious breach in relations between the two countries. It is to the credit of both that an agreement has been reached and that the matter has been put to rest . The critical element in the communique that both countries have issued reads in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having in mind the foregoing statements of both sides, the United States Government states that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that it intends to reduce gradually its sales of arms to Taiwan leading over a period of time to a final resolution. In so stating, the United States acknowledges China's consistent position regarding the thorough settlement of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA>A continuing dispute would certainly have had the possibility of having far- reaching consequences in our own part of the world and it would have inhibited a very necessary co-operation between the United States and China in many other areas. While I was in China I had significant discussions on this issue. There have also been communications with the United States Administration over time and since I left China. It is important to note that in terms of the containment of the aggressive inclinations of the Soviet Union a strong Western alliance is of paramount importance, but of very nearly equal importance is a sensible and good working relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China. I am glad that that has been preserved by this agreement and it is something that the whole House should applaud.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to the Government's Budget commitments in the area of youth training programs for 1982- 83. I ask: Is it a fact that during 1981-82 the Budget allocation in this area was massively underspent by around $16m or 21 per cent and that the number of participants in youth training programs fell short of anticipated levels by over 25,000? How can the Minister explain this situation? In the light of last year's massive underspending, does the Minister concede that there has been very little actual increase in the Government's commitments in the area of youth training programs during 1982-83? Given the substantial increases in subsidies available to employers under the major youth program, the Special Youth Employment Training Program, just to achieve last year's training targets, will the Minister also concede that the Government's programs in the area of youth training are misconceived and ineffective? Finally, how can the Government justify its total emphasis on training programs when it is patent that the dramatic decline in employment opportunities is the major problem confronting young people?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="463" SPEAKER="Macphee The Hon I.M." NAMEID="6I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BALACLAVA" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr MACPHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listed for discussion today is a matter of public importance on this subject which I shall go into in more detail later; but let me say now that this Budget aims to do a number of things. It continues the global allocation of funds for training. Last year it was found that there were some rigidities in the administration of the Special Youth Employment Training Program which limited the number of eligible persons entering that program. Many persons in fact instead entered under apprenticeship and other programs, including through the technical and further education colleges. We have eliminated the administrative difficulties. We have increased the subsidies under the Special Youth Employment Training Program and increased the rebates under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentices Full-time Training Program. On that basis we expect employers to find it infinitely more attractive to employ younger people than was the case in the past financial year. Moreover, we intend promoting those programs so that eligible young people and employers know all about them. We intend also to concentrate them in areas where there has been the greatest employment shedding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer in particular to some of the capital works programs which have been mentioned in the Budget and which will be amplified by operative Ministers. Each of those represents employment opportunities and many will attract assistance from the Special Youth Employment Training Program as well as CRAFT. Our objective has been to avoid make-work programs of a temporary kind-often performing work which is not needed and certainly work which does not add skill to the unemployed youth. Our objective is to lift the levels of skill, to make it easier for people to retain employment and of course enable them to have the confidence to go where jobs are. The figures which I shall produce in the debate this afternoon will indicate that the programs have been a huge success.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget has been put together against the background in which there was a growing recognition, I hope, in this Parliament and, I certainly believe, throughout the wider Australian community that it is very important for different groups and sections to recognise the interests they have in common and to exhibit a determination as Australians to work together to overcome the problems that Australia faces at present. The Government took very closely into account the points of view that had been put to it in a tripartite meeting between the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. There had been subsequent discussions between the Treasurer and officers of the ACTU in relation to tax matters. There has been ongoing consultation between the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and the ACTU. We are seeking to build a base upon which it is reasonable to expect a very real degree of wage restraint. As the honourable member and other honourable members in the House would know, there have been some notable examples in relation to that in recent weeks, but it needs building on and there is much to be done. The Budget was put together against the--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should have a little patience; I am coming to that, but in my own way. The Budget has been put together against a background in which it would be reasonable to expect a degree of wage restraint. For example, a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children on $180 a week income, and taking into account some reduction for the additional indirect taxes that will be imposed by the Budget, will be about $30 a week better off than before the Budget, and that is a very substantial addition to that person's income. A taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children on $300 a week will be nearly $18 a week better off. This is a very substantial amount and a very substantial assistance to families, and especially to lower income families. It is reasonable to expect that those things be taken into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can well understand how, in the rush of last night's proceedings, the balance of the Budget between the benefit to families and wage earners and the weight of increased indirect taxes may not have been fully understood by some commentators . I was, to a degree, disappointed by the reaction of the President of the ACTU last night. When I saw that reaction this morning I asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to contact the ACTU and to hold himself available for consultations-that applies also to either his officers or officers of other departments if there is a need for any technical explanations of details of the Budget-so that the weight of the Budget and the benefit to the wage and salary earners of Australia will be fully understood by the ACTU in coming to its final attitudes in relation to wage determination. The Minister has already been in touch with the ACTU and I am encouraged to believe that the beneficial effects of this Budget will be understood and accepted and will enable this nation to build upon the current climate for wage restraint.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Prime Minister a question, and it follows his application to the generosity of the Government to Australian families. In that context I ask: Is it a fact that, even taking last night's Budget into consideration, the typical Australian family on average earnings pays $7.10 more income tax a week now than in 1975? Is that family paying $10.80 a week more in indirect taxes now than in 1975? Is that family, even after the home loan interest concession announced last night, paying $13.70 more a week in loan repayments now than in 1975? Is that family, as a direct result of his Government's economic rigging and rorting, $40 a week worse off than in 1975?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman omitted to advise the House that there was a deficit approaching 5 per cent of gross domestic product as a result of the kind of Budgets that he was introducing, and the people of Australia also had to pay for that in a multitude of ways. I think Australian families will be interested in a comparison of the situation as a result of this Budget with what applied before the Budget was introduced. We are dealing with 1982. I can understand the Leader of the Opposition wanting to stay in 1975 but some of his colleagues want to forget that experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think anyone in this House will gain credit by creating a little noise, thus making it difficult for the people of Australia to understand the very real benefits that are available to them as a result of the housing loan interest rebate that has been introduced, as a result of the increases in family allowances and as a result of the family income supplement which, for the first time, will enable all members of Parliament-I hope members of the Opposition will also applaud this measure-to go out and say that families even in the lower income groups will be better off than those same families would be on the welfare system and as a direct charge on the taxpayer through the Department of Social Security. As is so often the case, this imaginative and far-sighted reform is something that has been introduced by a Liberal and National Country Party Government. It is one that represents a very significant first for this Budget. All credit should be given to the Minister who devised it and persuaded his Cabinet colleagues to accept it. It is the kind of far-sighted reform which is of very significant assistance to low income families as is the case with the reform of family allowances which was of great importance to low income families. It was this Government and these parties which introduced these reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me repeat that, as a result of the situation that the Budget introduces, a family on a weekly income of $180, with a dependant spouse and two children, will be $30 better off taking account of the fact that there will be some indirect tax increases in accordance with the normal household expenditure. That is a very substantial increase for a low income family and of enormous benefit to people who are hard hit under present circumstances. The other example I gave is of a family on $300 a week which will be just a few cents short, in net terms , of $18 better off than it was before this Budget was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> This Budget, in the truest possible sense, is one for Australian families. It is a Budget for children and it is a Budget designed to assist young people. The very generous increases in the secondary allowance scheme will be a great encouragement to many low income families to keep their children at school in order to gain some education and training. This will obviously be much better to them than leaving school without the necessary job skills. So, from whatever point of view one looks at this Budget, one sees that it addresses the very real needs and concerns of Australians in 1982 and the years ahead of us. It does this in an imaginative way and in a way that assists many hundreds of thousands of Australian families, indeed virtually all Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I am informed, those figures are the Treasury's best estimate of the number of people who will be in receipt of unemployment benefit. The estimate as far as my Department is concerned, as best it can estimate, is that there will be in the order of 7 per cent unemployment as we go into the new year . It could actually exceed that. In other words, until school leavers are placed the unemployment figure early next year might be slightly over 8 per cent-far less than some of the figures spoken of by some members of the Opposition. We do not expect there to be a worsening of the employment situation of the magnitude mentioned by some Opposition members. I am not responsible for Treasury figures. I am indicating my belief that in the next few months we will see a worsening, but nowhere near as dramatic a worsening as the Opposition, for political reasons, would wish to see.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it worth commenting that in Western Australia, the State from which the honourable gentleman comes, there has been a succession of very worthwhile visits by ships. Indeed, this year there have been around 50 port visits and many of them-30 of them-have been to HMAS Stirling. In that instance they included three carrier battle groups each of nine ships. Perth has won a great deal of respect from United States servicemen not just because of the excellence of the naval facilities there but also because of the hospitality of Western Australians. I am quite sure, however, that it is not just in hospitality terms but in the meaningfulness of the ANZUS arrangements--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is worth while, in answer to the honourable gentleman, to mention that the ANZUS arrangement is something that members of this House, certainly from this side, believe to be intrinsic to our defence posture. We believe that it is essential that there be an opportunity for visits by friendly powers and by warships of friendly powers. The communique issued at the termination of the thirty-first meeting of the ANZUS Council held in Canberra on 21 and 22 June reiterated that conviction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I add, finally, that it is worth noting that the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, I understand, supported Mr Cain. Had the Australian Labor Party been in power in that State I presume that those visits which have been so worth while for Australia and Western Australia would not have taken place. However, the Federal Government intends to introduce legislation shortly to ensure that the Federal Government's constitutional power is understood in this area. Later in the day I expect to be introducing that Bill into this House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the vague and open-ended statements about home loan interest rebates in the Budget of 1982-83 and, particularly, to the statement that the rebate will be paid for home loans from any source. Do these sources include finance companies and usurers charging interest rates in excess of 20 per cent? Do they include second and third mortgages? Do they include loans from relatives? Do they include mortgage transfers? Does the Minister accept that the rebates could promote new tax evasion opportunities? Is the Government aware that the rebates will encourage desperate home seekers, rejected by banks and building societies, to enter into risky, high interest, home purchase debt?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not entirely certain from the honourable gentleman's question whether he supports the rebate. It would be very interesting to know whether the Australian Labor Party supports the rebate, but I will endeavour to answer the honourable gentleman's question. It is intended that the rebate be available for a wide range of loans and not just be restricted to loans from the more conventional home lending sources. There is a very good reason for that. I am surprised that the honourable gentleman did not acknowledge it. The fact is that owing to the relative unavailability of money from banks and building societies because of their incapacity in the past to attract sufficient deposits to lend for housing, many low income people in this community have been forced to borrow at much higher rates of interest. It would be very unfair to those people if we were to restrict the rebate to banks and building societies. I am amazed that the honourable member should be implying that the rebate should not be available to some of the poorer sections of the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>

These provisions and the other incentives given to industry should allow industry to spend a great deal more money on industrial research and development .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept a linkage between the establishment of the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers and Israel's armed intervention into Lebanon. Peace between Egypt and Israel by negotiation rather than military conflict is the most outstanding achievement to date in the search for peace and stability in the Middle East. Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai and the establishment of the Sinai MFO was, and remains, quite vital to the process of maintaining confidence and peace between two countries which, until the peace treaty, had settled their differences on the battlefield. To suggest, for example, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is reported as suggesting, that the agony of Lebanon could be stopped by withdrawing Australia's contribution to the achievement and maintenance of peace between Egypt and Israel, is just plain nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's objectives are the achievement of a negotiated settlement in Lebanon to stop the loss of life and the destruction there, to restore the sovereignty of the Government of Lebanon over its own country and to ensure that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are achieved and that the security of Israel is maintained within secure and recognised boundaries. I cannot understand how these objectives or the search for peace in the Middle East could be helped by putting the hard won peace between Egypt and Israel at risk. Peace, however and whenever achieved, is too important to be pushed around like some sort of bargaining chip. I believe that the Sinai MFO and Australia's participation in it are a significant contribution to peace between Egypt and Israel and the broader goal of a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. In short, the Government does not intend to withdraw its contingent to the Sinai force.</PARA>

I have been misrepresented in that we have always said that we wanted to see the establishment of a home for the Palestinians on the West Bank and that, until such time as that was done, there would not be any peace in the Middle East.

It was a premeditated action by the Israeli Government to go into Lebanon once that force was established. It is the principle of the Camp David accords-if they had been applied-that there be a home for the Palestinians on the West Bank. That has never been achieved.

The States may make provisions relating to the regulation or control of nuclear activities but that is not set out as an obligation in the Commonwealth Act. That is the weakness of the Act. The Commonwealth can make regulations in its own right under the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act only if requested to do so by a governor of a State. The point is that in these matters there is a need for a truly national code implemented by a national government to replace existing legislation. This Act fits in to the whole complex conglomeration of Federal and State legislation which sets out to control the nuclear industry. To illustrate what I mean, I shall quote briefly from a report from the office of the Government's own Supervising Scientist in the Northern Territory. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Supervising Scientist must perform his functions within a complex interlocking network of legislation and agreements. This is a reflection of the conflicts of interests aroused by mining developments in the Region and the need to reconcile Commonwealth control of uranium mining with regulatory responsibilities of the self-governing Northern Territory of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This Code of practice is dependent for its implementation on the States in an area where the Commonwealth really should have full jurisdiction. It should be fully implemented on a uniform and national basis. Schedule 5 of this Code relates to the transport of yellowcake. It is Government policy at the moment to push companies such as ERA, Western Mining and Pan-Continental into further mining developments despite the weakness of the international market and before it has adequately set up a proper method of national control of the various aspects of the industry, including transport. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on the subject of the economic instability which hangs over some of the proposed new mining developments. A recent report compiled by the Northern Territory Government itself casts doubt on the availability of long term sales contracts; for instance, that for a $650m development at the Jabiluka mine. This report states that production from Jabiluka will be 3,000 to 4,500 tonnes of yellowcake a year compared with current world consumption of about 33,000 tonnes a year and production of 55,000 tonnes a year. It also states that the oversupply is due to over-projection of uranium demand in 1980 and that prospects of uranium sales are extremely limited. It goes on to state that the prospects for large sales and new contracts of uranium from Jabiluka appear extremely gloomy unless the Commonwealth dramatically lowers its minimum export price or abandons the minimum pricing policy altogether. Further, it weakens its ability to reach acceptable international safeguards agreement arrangements and acts against setting up a proper framework on a national level to regulate all aspects of the industry not only including development, mining and environmental matters, but also transport. In short, the Code is all right, but I very much doubt that it will be properly implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate we will be dealing with a single most important and potentially dangerous issue confronting our country; that is, the total collapse of the labour market and the increasing permeation of our society by the devastating cancer of unemployment. This disaster is made the more unpalatable by two facts, both associated with the deceptive character of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) as revealed by separate statements made by him in 1975. Honourable members will recall that one of those statements was unequivocally that if he and his Government were returned to power at that time there would be jobs for all in this country. In the light of what was said in the Budget last night one will also recall what he said at that time. He said that what happened in this country was not to be blamed upon what was happening overseas, but was totally within the control of the Government of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To be precise on this matter I will quote from the statement of Malcolm Fraser at an ANZAAS speech on 22 January 1975. It is a most memorable quote. This is what he had to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that men and women are governed by inexorable events beyond their control. When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped , it is part of a world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership when if they were men of real stature they would be saying 'We can overcome'. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was said by Malcolm Fraser in 1975. We have extensive and growing unemployment in this country today. Out of the mouth of the same man we are being told, 'No, we can't help it, because predominantly it is attributable to overseas events', which make this growing cancer even more unpalatable. Let me first of all establish the facts both in respect of what has been happening to employment in this country and what has been happening on the other side of the coin to unemployment. Let us deal, firstly, with the employment situation. Between 1975-76 and 1981-82 there has been an increase of only 460,000 jobs in this country or an average annual rate of 80,000 or 1.2 per cent when the actual available labour supply has been increasing by 1.5 per cent. So clearly employment has been growing at a grossly inadequate rate. Since 1980 the annual growth in employment has shown a significant downward trend from rates of between 3 per cent and 3 1/2 per cent in the latter part of 1980 to less than a half per cent in the June quarter. The disastrous figure most recently available shows that over the year ended June 1982 the actual level of employment in this country fell; that is, there were less people in jobs in June 1982 than there were 12 months before in June 1981. In respect of the growth in employment that has, in fact, occurred over this longer period, the greatest rate of growth has been in part time employment. In fact, growth in employment is 46 per cent. This has been accounted for in part time jobs. What has happened with regard to employment for our young people? Over the six years to August 1981 the actual number of young people in full time employment fell by 14,500. That was a decline of 3 per cent in the period to August 1981. But since August of last year there has been a worsening of that situation at an alarming rate. During 1981-82 the number of full time jobs held by teenagers actually declined by 54, 300, the stark fact being that at the end of 1981-82, 54,300 fewer of our teenagers were in full time employment than 12 months earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very briefly, and necessarily briefly, in regard to a disastrous situation I turn to what has been happening on the employment front. We have seen the gradual deterioration, and now the collapse, of the employment market in this country. How has that been reflected in terms of unemployment? We have had a serious trend of underlying deterioration in unemployment statistics over the lifetime of the Fraser Government. In fact at this time the level of unemployment is 50 per cent worse than when this Government took office at the end of 1975. But as disturbing as that steady deterioration in unemployment over the life of this Government has been, even more alarming has been the rapid deterioration in the year 1981-82. The June figure for unemployment was the highest mid-year figure since the end of the war and represented a worsening of the unemployment situation-in other words, a 28 per cent increase in unemployment from June 1981 to June 1982. The latest available figures, which are for July of 1982, show in seasonally unadjusted terms a level of just under 450,000-449,000 to be exact-which in seasonally adjusted terms represents a figure of 6.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the officially recorded figures, but every economist in this country, irrespective of his point in the political spectrum-every independent economist- knows that the recorded unemployment is only part of the story and that the hidden unemployment makes it much worse. This is attested to by the statistical fact that the labour force participation rates have been declining generally over the last year. The level of 60.5 per cent in June of 1982 represents the lowest participation rate in more than a decade and is the clearest indication of the growth in hidden unemployment. I suggest again that no economist in this country, irrespective of his general political position, would in any way deny the fact that when we take hidden unemployment into account with the recorded unemployment the number of people in this country looking for jobs and for whom jobs are not available is well over 10 per cent. That is, worse than one in 10 people in this country who want to work do not have a job available for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming to the level of youth unemployment, the seasonally adjusted figure shows that in respect of our young people between the ages of 15 and 19 the figure is now 19 per cent. In other words, the stark, disastrous fact is that virtually one in five of our young people between the ages of 15 and 19 who want to get a full time job cannot do so in this economy. That is obviously a situation which is not to be measured simply in economic terms, a fact to which I will come in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to the statistics of the duration of unemployment. Here again we have a stark worsening of the situation. In 1975 the average duration of unemployment was 13 weeks. That has deteriorated; the present average duration is now 30 weeks. Hard core unemployment in the sense of duration is now reaching massive proportions. The number out of work for more than six months has increased dramatically to almost 150,000 in June of 1982. That is, almost one- third of all those who are unemployed have now been unemployed for more than six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Having given as briefly as I can the factual situation as it is now, what do we say as to the future? We will find out the significance of what has happened in this Parliament today because the associated papers that were available last night with the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) went to this issue. If we turn to page 61 of Budget Paper No. 1 we find the proposition which states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that there is unlikely to be any growth in employment in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> The paper refers to the decline in the participation rate and states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . So, it is likely that there will be a marked increase in recorded unemployment this year. </PARA>
<PARA>But we then come to the figures which have been revealed in this House today. They are not as rubbery but they are as totally unacceptable at least to one Minister in the Government. Of course to his credit, as one would expect from this gentleman, there was not a preparedness to accept figures which, on their face, are outrageously unacceptable. What does this document say? It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with this assessment, and the assumed effect of the government manpower policies, the Budget estimates allow for the average number of unemployment benefit recipients to rise from an average of 332,000 in 1981-82 to an average-</PARA>
<PARA>mark this-</PARA>
<PARA>of 395,000 in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>What were the figures available last night, when these documents were put before this House, about the level of recipients of unemployment benefit in July? What was the latest figure? Let us remember that the Government said that the average unemployment figure for 1982-83 will be 395,000 but last night it was stated that the figure for July was 405,000. Already 405,000 people are unemployed in July 1982, and the Government is saying that unemployment will get worse. It is trying to delude this House and the people of Australia into believing that the average number of unemployed for 1982-83 will be less than the figure for July which is 10,000 above the average which it is trying to put forward. No wonder this Minister, to his credit and as one would expect from him, said today: 'I am not responsible for those figures'. So what has already been revealed in less than 24 hours of this Budget being handed down in this House is that one Cabinet Minister is conceding that there has been a misrepresentation to this House and to the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we are not dealing with some peripheral matter about drains in some outback block in Western Australia, which is unfortunately misrepresented by the creature opposite, but are talking about the level of unemployment and about the tragedy of people not being able to work, what a tragedy it is that this Government in its Budget cannot do better than misrepresent the position in the way I have outlined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my speech on the Budget I will deal with the gross inadequacies of the manpower training programs of this Government. At this point let me say simply that the Treasurer last night attempted to trumpet the fact that there is a 21 per cent increase in the Government's expenditure programs in the manpower and training areas. Let me put this statistic simply before the House. Even with that 21 per cent increase in money terms referred to last night, in the lifetime of this Government, between 1975-76 and 1982-83, there will be a 38 per cent drop in real terms in expenditure in this area. That statistic is irrefutable. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have a proposition that because of international forces we cannot do anything about unemployment. Let me give you, Mr Speaker, and the House, figures for the unemployment rates in the early part of this year in four countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The unemployment rate in Austria was 3.2 per cent; in Norway 2 per cent; in Sweden 2.8 per cent; and in Japan 2.4 per cent. It is to be noted that all of those countries, in one form or another, have governments which are committed to the concept of indicative planning within the framework of prices and incomes policies. In other words, if a government is concerned about people, about young people, and about ensuring its resources are made available to provide employment this problem can be reduced to manageable proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I come to the refusal of this Government to accept the proposition that it must embrace the concept of job creation programs. It steadfastly refused to do this on every occasion when the proposition was put about the Government undertaking the responsibility of establishing job creation programs to help reduce the level of unemployed and particularly the danger of unemployment amongst our youth. We always hear, as I put it, the calculators of the conservatives saying: 'But look at the cost'. We never hear those calculators talking about the costs of not having job creation programs or of the costs upon our health services, social security services and police services of allowing this growing cancer to spread in our society, particularly amongst our young people. The time has come when this Government should recognise the spread of this cancer which has arisen because of the Government's own ineptitude and callousness. We as a community should be led by a concerned and responsible government trying to eradicate that cancer which is increasingly, as I have said, not just an economic problem but also a social disease threatening the very fabric of our society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will dispose of one matter which the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) made something of in his remarks. This concerns the Budget calculations of average numbers of unemployment beneficiaries. I think all honourable members will recognise that the key words are 'average' and 'unemployment beneficiaries'. Of course, not all of the persons who are shown as unemployed in the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics are in receipt of benefits. The Treasury and the Budget Papers are silent on the forecast of numbers of unemployed persons. The figure which I gave in my answer to a question without notice was an estimate of what I thought would be the situation, around February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we know the capacity to employ people rests very heavily on economic growth. A great deal rests also on the capacity to control those things which are within our influence such as wage movements and the reduction in working hours. One will have to say a little about the efforts that this Government has made to place the trade union movement in a position now to exercise wage moderation over the next 12 months to help the employment situation-both the retention of jobs and the creation of new jobs. Not very long ago the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced a package of measures designed to assist industry with investment thereby retaining employment and, in the course of time, increasing employment. As I mentioned in Question Time, we have in this Budget a number of job creation programs, through capital works programs, for work which is of a kind that we need-for example, airports, roads and so forth. </PARA>

That is by no means a universal conclusion. If the honourable member for Wills or any other member of the Opposition wishes to put a detailed program to me for examination I will be pleased to look at it. I have tried to find a couple of speeches which the honourable member for Wills has made. In terms of the costs he has in fact spoken of fairly minimal costs and has looked at what he calls the overall wage costs. The costing which my department has been able to do, on the basis of what the honourable member has said, suggests that the gross cost would be around $730m a year. That is a very substantial addition to last night' s quite necessary outlays.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr MACPHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minimum net cost, as I have been able to calculate it, is some $ 550m per annum. The Opposition has, in fact, estimated only $250m, ignoring a number of expenses which local authorities would have to meet, including the cost of materials. If the Opposition is serious about putting a job creation program on the table, we will be pleased to examine it and cost it. Having done that, I believe the conclusion most commentators would reach is that we are doing the best we can in a difficult situation. It is a difficult situation. The honourable member for Wills, in a number of speeches he has made outside the Parliament, has acknowledged that difficulty and has acknowledged the role of external factors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is certainly not assisting the confidence of this country for everyone to be talking of a labour market collapse and for suggestions to be made-not today but elsewhere-by members of the Opposition about double digit unemployment. There is a psychological aspect about facing up to the labour market which this Budget is seeking to address in a positive way. I really think that the Opposition ought to assist not only by accepting the realities of the difficulties facing the labour market but also by trying to enable those people in management and trade unions who can improve our competitiveness by their application to their job to recognise that that and revived productivity growth are the answers for our long term employment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of deep concern to the Government-we have never denied it-that the momentum for employment growth, which we were quite pleased with until 1980- 81, has now been lost. The financial year 1981-82 has seen unemployment grow by a little over one per cent over the previous year, compared with almost 3 per cent growth over the previous year, that is, 1980-81. With employment growth falling well short of the labour force growth, unemployment has obviously risen. The number of unemployed persons increased by 26,900 or 6.8 per cent over 1981- 82, bringing the number to 419,700. This represents an unemployment rate of 6.2 per cent for 1981-82. In July 1982 the unemployment rate was 6.6 per cent compared with 5.5 per cent in 1981. They are the facts of the market situation which last night's Budget endeavoured to address, while still maintaining economic responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is going to get worse according to the Budget and according to all the best estimates. What we have endeavoured to do in this Budget is adopt a package of measures which, in fact, meets the requests put to us by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and other bodies that came to us in pre- Budget discussions. We believe this package represents a combination of measures that will retain as much employment as possible and put us in a better position to take advantage of economic recovery on a world scale when it comes. Let us remember that our economy has been out of cycle to the better compared with world economies. Sadly, we are catching up to them in terms of unemployment. Unfortunately, our inflation rate is now exceeding that of a number of other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is reflecting that fact-the fact that we are in the grip of a world recession and that our own competitiveness is worsening rapidly-that the Budget forecast is for no growth in overall activity in the non-farm economy. We know that drought conditions may well act to pull down the overall gross domestic product in the year for which we are now budgeting. The Budget Papers indicate that employment is not expected to grow in 1982-83 and that unemployment will increase. Recognising those serious trends, we have tried in this Budget to cushion the labour market from further decline. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of initiatives which underpin activity and which will assist employment. Let me itemise those very briefly. There is the reduction in personal income tax and other assistance for families. That clearly ought to assist people, especially lower income families. There is the assistance to home purchasers and to welfare housing-very practical measures which are very relevant to the subject of this debate. We have given more generous tax concessions for business. These had been announced before. They were announced earlier deliberately to prevent some of the employment shedding which we knew was about to occur. There are sizable real increases in the capital works. Several Ministers will be unfolding further details of those. Each of those capital works represents a considerable potential to employ people. Even so, we know that it is fairly peripheral to the need for economic growth and for restraint in our cost structure especially in the area of wages. </PARA>
<PARA> We have improved and expanded our manpower programs. These have a proven success record, to which I will come in a moment. If the Budget is to be successful then it requires employers to continue to retain staff where they can , to meet early retirement aspirations where they can and to meet part time and job-sharing arrangements where those meet the convenience of the employees and the employers. But a bit of imagination is required on both sides for that to be so. As well, it requires the trade union movement to moderate its wage claims and to remove altogether suggestions of reduced working hours. As a country we cannot return to strong employment growth while our inflation rate is well ahead of that of our trading partners. One of the major factors, but by no means the only one, is to do with hours reductions and wage movements in the past 18 months. The past is past; we are now endeavouring in the spirit of the 7 July conference to provide leadership across the board, regardless of some philosophical differences, to try to get a more sensible approach to the area of wage costs. Provided we can keep our costs under control I believe that we can be in a good position within this financial year to benefit from levels of investment which we can expect to accompany the expansion of the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise that in framing this Budget we have had very much in mind the propositions which were put to us by the ACTU. We believed that the ACTU, like ourselves, understood the recent experiences in terms of wage costs and reduced working hours. We, in response to its log of claims made the substantial reduction in the burden of taxation on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. We made those increases in family allowances and unemployment benefit. We gave interest relief on housing and increased expenditure on employment and training programs especially for young people. The expenditure on a range of training programs has gone up from $206m last year to $250m this year. All of those things will give significant assistance to Australian families especially those in the lower and middle income brackets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he did not. But I understand that the ACTU has the matter under closer study today. I hope that a more measured comment will emerge. These decisions and the Government's submissions to wage fixation tribunals have set an environment which we believe is favourable to salary and wage restraint and therefore conducive to increased competitiveness on the part of our industries. In particular, we have also pursued wage restraint with our own employees. We will continue to do that. We have welcomed similar action by the private sector and by State governments. The approach taken by the number of trade union leaders and, indeed, by the honourable member for Wills in this regard has been consistent with an awareness of the need for wage moderation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this year's Budget, $254.7m has been allocated for employment and training programs compared with a total of $210.5m in 1981-82 and just $116m two years earlier-that is 1979-80. The reasons for those figures reflect the Government's concern with growing unemployment. Whereas we had a situation of employment growth two years ago and we now have none we have attended to that by a variety of measures specifically focusing on employment and training and on the range of other social and public expenditure matters that I have referred to. This increase of more than $44m altogether on the range of training programs is a positive response by the Government to recent developments in the labour market. To have added to the Budget figure a total of $550m or thereabouts-as estimated by our costing, at least, of the job creation program of the honourable member for Wills-would have made it an irresponsible Budget. We were not prepared to do that in economic terms because it could only worsen the state of inflation, and therefore our competitiveness and capacity to employ people. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1982-83 allocation demonstrates the Government's full commitment to helping young people and other disadvantaged people including adult persons who are disemployed as a result of the downturn in our economy. Some of those persons choose to retire but those who seek retraining will have programs available to them. We are satisfied that the work experience programs have been very effective and successful. The record of persons being able to find and retain jobs as a result of going through the Special Youth Employment Training Program, the apprenticeship programs, the School to Work Transition Program and work experience programs we believe justifies their continuation and funding at the levels contained in the Budget. We believe that these schemes, together with the Community Youth Support Scheme and others that have been announced, take account of the needs of people and that they represent a very responsible result in what is a very difficult budgetary situation. </PARA>

There has been a whole series of quotations by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), from the very first time that he was elected as Prime Minister in November 1975 until recently, about the job opportunities that would be available for the Australian people. But this Government will still not admit what is happening in Australia. It will still not tell us exactly what is going on in industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) did not mention that he had a visit from industry leaders this morning telling him about the way in which industry in Australia is being absolutely crippled. He told us at Question Time that the estimates of his Department were that the unemployment level would be 8 per cent in February 1983. I respect the Minister's word greatly. I do not respect the word of many of his colleagues. But I can tell him that no one in Australia believes that only 8 per cent of the work force will be unemployed in February 1983. The most optimistic estimate, if one likes to put it that way, is 10 per cent. Even the Secretary to the Minister's Department is being quoted around Canberra as estimating a 10 per cent level of unemployment in February 1983. Industry leaders who met with the leaders of the Australian Labor Party in the last two weeks have put the estimate as high as 14 per cent unemployed in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1975 we have continually asked that committees of this Parliament be established to look at the dangers of unemployment and the way in which jobs are being eradicated from industry, not on a temporary basis but permanently. Jobs are disappearing and never coming back. The Opposition does not have access to all the information the Government has. The Government has far greater avenues to all the information from the industry leaders around Australia on what is occurring to employment opportunities. We know that each year we have to establish at least 120,000 to 130,000 new jobs just to maintain unemployment at the present rate. If we want to keep unemployment down to 6.5 per cent, the present figure, we have to create 130,000 new jobs in the next twelve months. </PARA>
<PARA> In wrestling if a person wants to give in he taps the mat. Last night the Government tapped the mat on unemployment. It said there would be no new jobs in 1982-83. Not one new job will be created in the Australian economy. After seven years all these great economic managers could tell us last night was that inflation is going up because of the increase in indirect taxes, interest rates will go up because inflation is going up and unemployment will go up by 200,000. At least 650,000 people will be registered as unemployed early in 1983 as a result of having seven years of these great economic managers! God, we were lucky to have them! Parties are being held all over Australia to celebrate the announcement of John Howard last night, the seventh great statement by this Liberal-National Country Party Government! Its members are the only people who were born to rule; they are the only people who could possibly have achieved all these pinnacles of economic achievement: The highest interest rates we have ever had; the highest unemployment and almost the highest inflation that this country has ever seen!</PARA>
<PARA> There is no glimmer of hope at all in the statement made last night. The Government is just hoping that the newspapers each day will run the charts showing people how much they will save in November. But what does an unemployed person save? For seven years people under 18 years of age who have been unemployed have received unemployment benefit payments of $36. Last night they were told they would receive $40. After seven years of double digit inflation we have increased the unemployment benefit by $4. This Government does not give a damn about the unemployed and never has. There has never been a sign that any of its policies aimed at the unemployed have been to do other than try to smother the debacle which has been caused by its economic policies in that seven-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> Every member of this House, even the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), as simple as he is, would understand that industries are closing down in every electorate represented in this House. In every electorate we go into people are being laid off, given redundancy notices or offered voluntary retirement at 50 years of age. All this is happening in Australia and the Government says: 'Well, just wait a while. Sooner or later it will come good.' The fact is that domestically we are in the midst of a recession which is picking up a momentum that no one could have foreseen. The Government does not have any of the strategies that are required to deal with the sorts of problems with which we are confronted. It has not one idea of what is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> For the sake of honourable members just let me rattle off some examples. At Kwinana in Western Australia there has been an increase of 400 in the number of people unemployed. In Wollongong it is just about depression period as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has announced that it will reduce its work force by about 5,000. In Newcastle there has been an increase of 2,000 in the number of unemployed people. This has all occurred in the last few months. Members of the Government do not seem to understand the situation. Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd announced a reduction in its work force of 1,300 over the next six months. Last week the State Dockyard in Newcastle announced a reduction of 500. The metal trades industry, which 12 months ago made an agreement with the metal workers union based on what it thought would be a strong pick-up in the economy, has reduced its work force by almost 4 per cent. This reduction has been right across the board in the metal trades industry throughout the country. It has not been only in the unskilled and semi-skilled areas; many of those now unemployed are tradesmen. To lay off boilermakers, pattern-makers and fitters was unheard of in Australia's history. All these people are now on the dole yet this Government tells us that it will increase funding for the Community Youth Support Scheme to around $19m. There is no way that will remedy the sort of recession conditions that employment is going through at the moment. It is like putting a band-aid on a broken leg. The Government will not solve the problems with the sorts of schemes that have come up once again in the statement made last night. All over Australia the same thing is occurring. It is expected that about 3,000 jobs will be lost from the metal trades industry. At least 10 per cent or 12 per cent of the people disappearing from the industry are tradesmen. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise the problems with which we will be confronted. Not only did we ask in this House for a committee to be established to look at employment problems in Australia, but also we asked for a committee to be established in the House of Representatives to look at the impact of immigration. We said that the Parliament should make decisions with regard to immigration in a bipartisan way. The Government refused the Opposition the opportunity to look at these things. Now what do we find? We are bringing into Australia 120,000 people, approximately 48,000 or 50,000 of whom want to enter the work force. What does it mean to bring in 50,000 people at a time when the Government, by its own admission, says that not one extra job will be created in Australia? We can run a successful immigration program in this country only with the support of the people who already live in the country. If we try to defy their wishes they will reject us out of hand. There is no way in the world that the Australian people, having heard the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) last night about employment opportunities, will welcome a decision to bring another 50,000 people , at least half of whom are almost totally unskilled, into this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other measures that should be tightened up by this Government. We understand from figures given to us that the number of visitors legally in Australia but working illegally may be as high as 30,000. The number of people illegally in Australia-those who have overstayed their visitors' permits and who must be suspected of working in order to keep themselves-is between 40,000 and 50,000 at the moment. There are 10,000 people working for multinational companies. We believe many of their jobs could be taken by Australians. There are 16,000 working holiday makers-a loose way of using disguised immigration. Almost 100,000 jobs have been taken by those people. It is time the whole scheme was tightened up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before supporting what the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) has said, I draw attention to some of the remarks made by Opposition speakers. The last comment made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) was rather astonishing and, as usual, can be attributed to his natural knack of stretching the truth or making the cloth to suit the occasion. He said that 50,000-odd extra people would be coming on to the unemployment list under the family reunion guarantee scheme. He knows quite well-if he does not, he should-that under the family reunion scheme people must have a job guarantee before they are allowed to enter the country. The Opposition proposes to increase the number of family reunion migrants with no guarantee of a job. The honourable member was saying that what the Government was doing, in his interpretation, was wrong and that it was his philosophy that he was espousing. We understand why the honourable member is still making such comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member also called for an explanation of what has happened. He said that the Government had not enlightened him as to what was happening in this country. He went on to spell out some of the facts about the levels of unemployment. Of course, everybody is aware of those levels. But we are also aware of what, in many cases, has been the cause of those problems. I suggest that not only economic problems are causing unemployment. I suggest that honourable members opposite consider the effect that their own organisation, the trade union movement, may have had on Australian industry over the years, particularly during the 10 years that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) was head of it. I recall that during that time we had the introduction of a 17.5 per cent loading on holiday pay for three weeks annual leave. </PARA>
<PARA> The unions have fought desperately hard to destroy service industries in this country. Strange as it may seem, every industry in this country is not a manufacturing industry. There are in this country industries related to tourism which are absolutely vital and which employ many thousands of people. Yet how many restaurants are open seven days a week? How many places which provide a service to people can afford to have people working for them for the extra time because of the high penalty rates imposed by the trade union movement? The unions press heavily for a reduction in working hours but not a reduction in pay to match those working hours. I am sure that the honourable member for Wills, who is a fair man, would be the first to acknowledge that if working hours are reduced to 35 hours a week for the same pay packet as a 40-hour week, only two things can occur. The first one is to cause-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="037">Mr BOURCHIER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was talking to the honourable member for Wills, the intelligent member of the Australian Labor Party. He would acknowledge that if working hours are reduced to 35 a week, the employer's costs rise markedly-if he keeps the same salary structure-and productivity goes down. What is the answer to that? The honourable member for Port Adelaide has sought a response. If employers wish to stay in business and keep jobs for the majority of employees, they have to stand people down. If the Opposition is fair dinkum and genuine about its concern for the unemployed it should not say that it thinks the Government is wrong and that the Government must do something. It should come forward with a proposal of its own that it can take to the trade unions. If the Opposition were on this side of the House it would only exacerbate the situation because it is under the control of the unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us be honest. If the Opposition wanted to do something proper, it would allow the honourable member for Wills, a former leader of the trade union movement, to tell Australia that if the trade union movement were prepared to take away the 17.5 per cent loading, to do away with penalty rates, to seek a full 40-hour working week and to try to chase higher productivity every time it sought a wage increase instead of doing the reverse-the honourable member for Wills is so interested that he is yawning; the rest of the people in Australia at least will be taking note of it-Australia would benefit in the long term. As a former president of the trade union movement, the honourable member for Wills should be leading this call. This is a matter for the whole of the community, not just for the Government. It involves government, employers, trade unions and , last but perhaps not least, the Labor Party working for the benefit of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> To suggest that this Government is not doing anything is utterly ridiculous. At least we have brought in positive measures. The honourable member for Wills has proposed the reintroduction of a scheme similar to the old Regional Employment Development Scheme. It must be hard to get the message home to the Labor Party. It introduced the RED Scheme in 1974. Bearing in mind that wages were approximately $120 a week in those days, the cost of funding the RED Scheme rose to over $200 per person. It was such a major success that the Labor Party wiped it out the next year! It was there for one year and was a total failure. The Labor Party has the gall to say the Scheme was a success. I understand that. Neither the honourable member for Wills nor the honourable member for Port Adelaide was a member of this place in 1974 when the Scheme was introduced. Had they been, the Scheme may have had extra points to make it succeed. But it certainly did not succeed under the Labor Party regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has outlined broadly what this Government has done. I will demonstrate some of those points. I hope that the honourable member for Wills in his generosity will at least be fair enough to acknowledge that this Government has done a lot over the last few years to try to help in the training of young people and to try to assist those who are unemployed. It is no good for us to put our heads in the sand. It is acknowledged that this is a huge and growing problem. The answer is not to run around saying how bad it is. The answer is to say: What can we do about it? This Government has been positive. Included in the unemployment programs which the Minister has introduced and to which he has successfully allocated much greater funds in this Budget are the manpower and training programs, the total allocation for which is up 21 per cent to $254.7m compared with $210.5m in 1981-82. More than 252,000 people will be assisted under those programs. That is not insignificant. Even the honourable member for Wills would not-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are 252,000 young people being trained for jobs-a very significant effort on the part of the Government and an 18 per cent increase over the previous year. The Government has significantly increased the benefit for work experience programs. There is a $20 per week increase in the Special Youth Employment Training Program standard subsidy from $55 to $75 a week. The extended SYETP subsidy has been increased by $20 to $100 a week. There has been a 33 per cent increase in the annual intake of SYETP trainees into Commonwealth establishments, commencing on 1 January 1983. There are 74,200 approvals under work experience programs expected during the year-a 44 per cent increase. The Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training has been adjusted to take account of full wage increases over the last two years, with an additional 10 per cent to encourage employers to take on apprentices. Total expenditure on the CRAFT scheme will be raised by $5.3m to $84m. Expenditure on skills training is to be increased by 29 per cent to $21m. These are programs that have been brought in by a government that cares. For the Opposition to say that the Government is taking no action is utterly ridiculous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are major improvements in the area of benefits and allowances particularly for young people who are receiving the unemployment benefit or are participating in the Secondary Allowance Scheme or the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. The maximum TEAS rate payable has been increased to $38.65 a week. Also, we have arranged to bring in a loan scheme to provide extra money on very generous terms for those who may require it to help them get through their school training. The maximum amount payable under the SAS has increased to $16. 75. This substantially increases the incentive for young people from low income families to remain at school. The family income test associated with the TEAS allowance and the SAS has been relaxed. In addition to this, major changes to other areas of education and social security benefits include the increase in the basic non-indexed rate of unemployment benefit for persons 18 years and over without dependants to $64.40 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments hardly reflect the actions of a government which has, in the words of the matter of public importance, accepted 'the economic and social disasters associated with rising levels of unemployment'. The reverse is the fact. This Government has taken very strong and positive measures to do all within its power. But that is not the end of it. It is not as if we have said ' this is it'. I know that under the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations we will come forward with even more assistance and do everything we can as a government to help people obtain jobs and overcome the problem. </PARA>

<TITLE>Proposed Student Loans Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Restrict Access to Education</PARA>
<PARA> People from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts. These people, if they enrol, will be forced to amass loan debts. Richer students do not face this handicap.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Undermine the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme</PARA>
<PARA> TEAS should cover the basic living costs of students. Currently the scheme only assists 38% of full-time students and the maximum level of TEAS is a mere $49.67 . Government statements indicate TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA>3. Disadvantage Women</PARA>
<PARA> Women students would be disadvantaged by a loans scheme as they have a lesser ability to repay loan debts, because on average women earn less and have a higher unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA>4. Disadvantage Mature-Age Students</PARA>
<PARA> Usually mature age students forgo income to study and already have large financial commitments. They could not return to study if it meant incurring substantial debts.</PARA>
<PARA>5. Distort Educational Choices</PARA>
<PARA> Mounting loan debts would force students into studying shorter courses or not continuing with post-graduate study.</PARA>
<PARA>6. Result in Massive Attrition Rates</PARA>
<PARA> Students will attempt to undertake extensive part-time work or overload courses to minimise their loans. Increased failure rates will result forcing students to ''drop-out'' rather than continuing study and increase their debts.</PARA>
<PARA>7. Cause Administrative and Financial Difficulties</PARA>
<PARA> Overseas experience shows high default rates will occur on student loans. Government money will be channelled away from TEAS to paying off banks. The government will also bear the administrative burden of pursuing defaulters.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the proposed student loans scheme will have disastrous effects on tertiary education, which we believe benefits the whole community, not just the individual student.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill to amend the income tax law covers a range of subjects. It contains amendments to effect income tax exemptions for certain foreign pensions payable in consequence of persecution during the Second World War. The proposal announced on 23 July 1982 to exempt profits from the sale or redemption of discounted securities acquired on or before 30 June 1982 is also being given statutory expression. Exemption is being provided for income derived by the Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island Limited. Some extensions of the gift provisions, foreshadowed in recent announcements, are being made. Amendments foreshadowed on 9 February 1982 to deal with further tax avoidance arrangements of the expenditure recoupment type are included. Other provisions of the Bill will clarify the operation of anti-avoidance provisions enacted in 1978 to deal with schemes which circumvent the sufficient distribution requirements for private companies. Finally, a minor amendment to the secrecy provisions of the income tax law concerning the supply of information to the Australian Statistician is also being made. I turn now to the details of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Pensions Related to War-time Persecution</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> On 3 March 1982, I announced the Government's intention to extend an existing exemption of pensions paid from the Federal Republic of Germany to Australian residents in compensation for Nazi persecution. The Bill will extend the exemption so that it applies to payments of pensions from the Federal Republic where the entitlement arises wholly or partly because periods of Nazi persecution, or flight from such persecution, have been treated as periods during which the recipient contributed to the Republic's pension scheme. Had such contributions actually been made there would have been relief from Australian tax under other provisions of our law. </PARA>
<PARA> As also announced on 3 March, the extended exemption will also specifically cover pensions from the Netherlands paid as compensation in respect of Second World War persecution by, or disablement from resistance to, enemy forces occupying the Netherlands or the former Dutch East Indies. There is, however, a need to give the concepts underlying the extended exemption a general application. For this reason, the Bill provides that the exemption will apply to other foreign pensions received by residents of Australia, which are found to relate to, or take into account, Second World War persecution or disability arising from participation in a resistance movement. The exemption will apply to payments made to the person who suffered or to his or her dependants. The Bill provides that payments derived on or after the date of the foreshadowing announcement-3 March 1982-will be within the scope of the extended exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>Sale or Redemption of Discounted Securities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year, the Commissioner of Taxation publicly affirmed the view that profits arising from the sale or redemption at par of securities issued or acquired at a discount are assessable income. It is accepted by the Government, however, that a significant number of small investors had purchased discounted securities in the bona fide belief that the profit on sale or redemption would not be assessable. Indeed, the tap stock prospectus of May this year, which contains no indication that the discount component of the amount receivable on redemption of the stock is assessable income, may have contributed to this belief. Accordingly, it is proposed by this Bill to amend the income tax law to exempt from tax profits made on redemption or sale of any securities acquired at a discount on or before 30 June 1982, other than profits made by traders or dealers and profits to which section 26AAA, section 26C or paragraph 26 (a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act applies. The exemption will not affect the tax treatment of profits on the sale or redemption of securities purchased after 30 June 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island Ltd</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As part of new arrangements for the mining of Christmas Island phosphate, the Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island Ltd-an Australian Government owned and controlled company-was incorporated on 25 June 1981 to replace the British Phosphate Commissioners as managing agents for the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission. Honourable members will recall that amendments incorporated in the Christmas Island Agreement Amendment Act 1981 made this replacement possible. The new company has been acting as managing agents since July 1981. That was an initial step pending the winding-up of the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission . </PARA>
<PARA> The next step under the proposed arrangements is to obtain the Parliament's approval of a new Christmas Island agreement between Australia and New Zealand which, together with an exchange of notes between the two governments, will enable the Phosphate Commission to be wound-up and the company to assume responsibility for the mining operation. Introduction of the necessary Christmas Island Agreement Amendment Bill is proposed for the current sittings of the Parliament. Income of the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission is exempt from income tax under the Christmas Island Agreement Act 1958. The amendment proposed in the present Bill will provide a corresponding exemption from income tax for the Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island Ltd. The exemption will apply to income derived by the company on or after a date to be notified in the Gazette. The date intended to be notified is that on which the company replaces the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission as the island's mining operator. Until then, of course, the income from the operations will remain that of the Commission and will continue to be exempt under existing provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The gift provisions of the income tax law allow deductions for gifts of the value of $2 or more to specified funds, authorities or institutions. Details of each of the proposed extensions of this concession have been the subject of previous statements and I need mention them only briefly now. One extension will authorise deductions for gifts made after 31 May 1982 to the Connellan Airways Trust. Another will authorise deductions for gifts made after 30 June 1982 to the Queensland Cultural Centre Trust. Further changes will authorise deductions for gifts made in the 1981-82 financial year to Polish relief appeals and to relief appeals established in response to the cyclone disaster in Tonga. Finally , there are provisions which will authorise deductions for gifts made during the 1981-82 and 1982-83 financial years to appeals established for the provision of relief to Falkland Islanders, British servicemen or the families of islanders or servicemen affected by the Falkland Islands dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure Recoupment Schemes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Anti-avoidance provisions of the income tax law apply to a wide range of losses and outgoings with effect from 24 September 1978. Put broadly, the legislation denies a deduction for a designated loss or outgoing that is incurred under an arrangement whereby the taxpayer or an associate obtains a benefit the value of which, taken with the sought for tax saving, effectively recoups the claimed loss or outgoing. Variants of recoupment schemes with which this Bill deals are ones that attempted to exploit the income tax rebates and deductions for calls paid on shares in afforestation companies and the rebate for moneys paid on shares in petroleum exploration companies. The amendments proposed by the Bill will extend the expenditure recoupment provisions so that no rebate or deduction will be allowed in these further categories of schemes. The amendments are to apply with respect to expenditure incurred after 24 September 1978 under tax avoidance schemes entered into after that date. The decision to do this follows the clear warning given on that day and repeated on several subsequent occasions . </PARA>
<PARA> Although I think it is now generally recognised that the Government's unrelenting campaign against blatant forms of tax avoidance, culminating in the enactment of the general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA, has put paid to such activities, the obligation to the general body of taxpayers to prevent the success of any expenditure recoupment type of tax avoidance scheme entered into after 24 September 1978 must, however, be recognised and assumed. I point out that any schemes which seek deductions for calls paid on shares in an afforestation company and which are entered into after 27 May 1981 will not be subject to the proposed amendments. Such schemes would be struck down by the general anti-avoidance provisions of Part IVA which took effect on 28 May 1981. The provisions I now introduce will also ensure that there can be no remaining incentive for proliferation of rebate schemes that are outside the scope of Part IVA. As foreshadowed in my statement of 9 February 1982, any rebate scheme entered into after that date that comes to be covered by the expenditure recoupment provisions of the law will attract 200 per cent additional tax on the same basis as do schemes covered by Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA>Dividends Satisfied by Share or Debenture Issue</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A private company is liable to pay additional tax on its undistributed profits if it does not, by way of dividends, make a sufficient distribution of profits to its shareholders. Anti-avoidance measures were introduced in 1978 to counter arrangements under which a dividend, which was not capable of being taxed in the shareholders' hands, was formally paid and that ensured that a substantial benefit flowed back to the company. In these circumstances there was no real distribution of profits. The 1978 measures may, however, operate too widely where dividends are satisfied by an issue of shares or debentures that legitimately have a market value appreciably less than their face value. If such dividends are effectively taxed in the hands of the shareholders, there is no tax avoidance. A reduced market value may legitimately exist, for example, because of factors such as lack of security, lack of ready marketability or uncertainty as to the date of redemption of the debentures or redeemable shares.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that the law should clearly not compel private companies to pay cash dividends in such cases. Appropriate relief will be provided by the Bill so that, where the Commissioner of Taxation considers it unreasonable for the anti-avoidance provisions to apply to a dividend paid after 20 January 1982 and satisfied by an issue of shares or debentures, the dividend will be taken into account in determining whether a sufficient distribution has been made. </PARA>
<PARA>Disclosure of Additional Taxation Information to the Australian Statistician</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under the secrecy provisions of the income tax law, information available to the Commissioner of Taxation about the name, address and industry classification of an employer can be provided to the Australian Statistician, but only for purposes related to employment statistics. Consistent with its policy of seeking to reduce, wherever practicable, the burden on businesses of responding to statistical requirements, the Government has decided to amend these provisions in two respects. Firstly, the limitation to use in employment statistics will be removed in order to enable the information supplied to be used for a number of related statistical purposes. Secondly, the Bill will authorise the provision of additional employment information to the Statistician, namely the numbers of male and female employees of persons who are employers for PAYE purposes. An explanatory memorandum providing fuller details of the various measures contained in the Bill is being made available to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to discharge the responsibilities of the Commonwealth in relation to visits by foreign warships. The House will be aware that in recent months the Government of Victoria sought to exclude certain categories of foreign warships from its ports. Somewhat earlier the Government of New South Wales expressed reservations about visits of these same categories of warships to the Port of Sydney and to other ports in that State. There have also been attempts by some organisations to hinder or put difficulties in the way of such visits. The Government has made quite plain that it will not accept interference with these visits. Visits to Australian ports of foreign warships are an important aspect of Australia's international relations. They have obvious and important implications for our defence and security. </PARA>
<PARA> Constitutionally the powers in respect of such matters rest with the Commonwealth. It is the Commonwealth, not the States, that is responsible for the maintenance of defence and international arrangements with other countries. Quite properly the Commonwealth has exercised exclusive authority in this area. It intends to continue to do so. To ensure that there is no uncertainty as to the legal position applicable to the visits of such ships, it is believed that legislation in the form now introduced is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to asserting in practical terms the exclusive authority of the Commonwealth, the Bill will perform two other functions. It will make provision in formal terms for the authorising, on behalf of Australia, of entry to our waters by foreign warships where such entry is desired. The need for authorisation to precede any such visit has long been recognised as a matter of international law and practice. Secondly, the Bill will provide a legal framework for appropriate action to be taken to safeguard approved visits from obstruction or interference. At the same time, the Government expects that there will continue to be co-operation with the relevant State authorities in regard to the visits of foreign warships. In the vast majority of cases over many years such co-operation has been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill specifically adverts in its objects clause to the co-operation and assistance of the States and their authorities in facilitating access to Australian ports for visiting warships. The Government has reiterated in recent statements the importance it attaches to visits to Australia by the warships of allied and friendly countries in the context of our overall defence arrangements . These visits are of the greatest importance, whether they occur in the course of joint exercises, for resupply purposes, for crew recreation or as a practical demonstration of goodwill. We believe that foreign warships should be as free to visit Australian ports as Australian warships are to visit the ports of our friends and allies. The Government has no doubt that its views in this matter are endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. It is also relevant to quote from the joint communique issued by the representatives of the governments of the United States, New Zealand and Australia at the conclusion of the thirty-first meeting of the ANZUS Council held in Canberra on the 21 and 22 June 1982. The communique states:</PARA>
<PARA> In particular (the Deputy Secretary and the Ministers) confirmed the high priority each partner placed upon a regular and comprehensive programme of naval visits to each other's ports, as well as to friendly ports in the Asia/Pacific region generally. They recognise the importance of access by United States naval ships to the ports of its Treaty partners as a critical factor in its efforts to maintain strategic deterrence and in order to carry out its responsibilities under the terms of the Treaty. In this regard the Australian and New Zealand members declared their continued willingness to accept visits to their ports by United States naval vessels whether conventional or nuclear powered. </PARA>
<PARA>In the light of statements made by the Premier of Victoria and earlier by his counterpart in New South Wales, it is believed that this undertaking may not be capable of implementation without the passage of this legislation. The Government accepts that concerns have been expressed, quite understandably, with particular regard to ships which are nuclear powered or ships which could be carrying nuclear weapons. So far as nuclear powered ships are concerned, the Government's position continues to be that expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his statement to the House of 4 June 1976 on this matter. Subject to compliance with appropriate safety procedures, visits of nuclear powered ships can proceed without significant risk of adverse consequences. With regard to visits by ships which could be carrying nuclear weapons, as has been repeatedly made clear, the position is that the foreign governments concerned will not confirm or deny that a particular ship is carrying nuclear weapons. Again, if I may quote from the ANZUS communique:</PARA>
<PARA> (The Ministers and the Deputy Secretary) noted and accepted that it is not the policy of the United States Navy to reveal whether or not its vessels are armed with nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA>To do so in particular cases would over a period of time provide valuable information to potential enemies about the capabilities of the naval forces concerned and, of course, as to the particular ship. The Government accepts this position and will not be seeking disclosure as to whether a particular visiting ship is or is not carrying nuclear weapons. In relation to the safety of nuclear weapons which may be carried on visiting allied warships, the precautions and procedures that are known to be taken by the navies concerned are such as to preclude the possibility of an accidental nuclear detonation. The risk of accidental explosion of the conventional explosive in such weapons is judged to be as small as the risk of an accidential explosion involving conventional weapons carried by our own naval vessels. Such an accident has never happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background I turn to the terms of the Bill. As I have already mentioned, the Bill includes an objects clause stating that it is intended to establish procedures for the discharge by the Commonwealth of its constitutional responsibilities and powers. The clause also declares the intention that in furthering the object of the Act the co-operation and assistance of the States and their authorities be sought and utilised, so far as it is appropriate and practicable to do so, in facilitating access to Australian ports for warships visiting Australia. However, the Bill is expressed to operate to the exclusion of any State or Territory laws that would prevent or obstruct any act or thing that a warship or person is empowered or permitted to do by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Central to the operation of the legislation is the power given to the Minister for Defence to grant approval for a specified foreign warship, or class of foreign warships, to have access during a specified period to Australian ports or to specified Australian ports. Such an approval may be made subject to conditions. It is envisaged that, in practice, all such approvals will be subject to compliance with conditions relating to navigation and safety, and health, quarantine, customs and immigration requirements. Provision is also made for the Minister to give directions to the commander of a foreign warship in respect of which an approval is in force. Directions may be given about the movement of the ship or its crew or about the loading or unloading of goods. Directions of this nature would essentially be supplementary to the conditions attached to an approval, and could be necessitated by circumstances arising after an approval is given. Where an approval is in force, a foreign warship covered by the approval will be entitled to enter, remain in and depart from an Australian port covered by the approval. In addition, goods may be loaded onto or unloaded from the ship and services may be supplied to the ship. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 9 of the Bill, the Minister for Defence is empowered to give directions to facilitate access by a foreign warship to an Australian port, where a relevant approval is in force. These powers would be exercised only as a last resort where access by a foreign warship was being frustrated or significantly hindered by a refusal or failure to provide the goods, services or facilities normally required for that purpose. These might include the provision of pilotage or tug services, the availability of berthing facilities, or the supply of services such as water or electricity. Clause 9 provides that a direction may be given only where the Minister is satisfied that giving the direction is necessary to secure the entry, stay or departure of the ship, or the safety of the ship, its crew or other persons, or is necessary or convenient for the effective operation of the ship. Provision is made for compensation for loss or damage sustained as a result of compliance with a direction. Provision is also made for payment for the provision of goods, services or facilities, or other things, pursuant to a direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will establish offences of preventing, hindering or obstructing the entry of a ship to, the berthing of a ship at, or the departure of a ship from, an Australian port in respect of which a relevant approval is in force. Other offences are provided relating to failure to comply with a direction by the Minister for Defence under clause 9, and of preventing, hindering or obstructing other specified activities relating to a ship. As I have already said, the Government believes that visits to Australian ports by the warships of our friends and allies have the overwhelming support of the Australian people. The Government is confident that this legislation, prompted by threat to the continuance of such visits, will have similar support. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is intended to ensure that the Australian Omega navigation facility can be operated free from unnecessary interruption. The Australian Omega station completes a world-wide network of eight stations. The other seven stations are operated by Argentina, Japan, Liberia, Norway, France, and the United States of America at Hawaii and North Dakota. The Omega system is a long-range radio navigation system for use by aircraft, ships and land vehicles to determine their position in virtually any part of the world and in any weather. Each station transmits omnidirectional signals in the very low frequency radio band. In the usual mode of operation, a receiver needs to detect signals from at least three Omega stations to determine a position fix. Omega receivers of varying complexity are available from commercial sources throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The governments of Australia and the United States of America entered into an exchange of notes in 1977, agreeing to the establishment and operation of the Australian station. The agreement has been previously tabled and is reproduced in the Schedule to the Bill. The agreement provides that Australia is to be solely responsible for operating, managing, staffing and maintaining the facility and that each government is required to ensure the continuous operation of its respective facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian facility comprises a transmitter and associated equipment located on Commonwealth land near Derriman in Victoria, and monitoring equipment located on Commonwealth land near Carrajung, also in Victoria. The facility commenced transmitting on a fully operational basis on 16 August and is to be officially opened in October this year. Being an integral part of the world-wide Omega system, it is essential that the Government take all necessary steps to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the Australian facility. The Government believes this Bill to be an appropriate measure to deal with any threat of irresponsible action to interfere with transmissions by the Australian facility.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bill, where circumstances necessitate, persons who ordinarily supply goods or services required for use in connection with the Omega facility may be directed by the Minister to supply such goods or services. Obstruction of the supply of goods or services, and refusal to carry out a direction of the Minister, are defined in the Bill as offences. The Bill also ensures access to the facility by persons whose access is sufficiently important to warrant protection. One of the objects of the Bill is to secure State co-operation in the continued operation and maintenance of the Omega facility. State laws consistent with that object are preserved. However, State laws that conflict with the purposes of the Bill are set aside. The Bill operates concurrently with other laws, particularly those relating to protection of property and the safety of navigation aids. In addition it contains a provision to ensure that the prosecution of offences in relation to Omega can be undertaken by the Commonwealth without having to rely on State action. If a person suffers loss or damage or property is acquired from him as a result of the operation of the Bill , he is entitled to compensation from the Commonwealth on just terms. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Government's objective is to provide effective navigational aids for the safety of ships and aircraft operating in and around Australia, particularly those engaged in our coastal and overseas trades. The establishment of the Omega facility is a significant step towards the achievement of that objective, and the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the operation of the facility is not disrupted. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate was adjourned I was referring to the merits of this measure to reform our military law and in particular to the introduction of a uniform tri-Service code in the place of the three older codes . I was using the new definition of mutiny as an example of this uniformity in place of the provisions of the old codes, two of which did not have a statutory definition and one of which did. To conclude that section, mutiny, as defined under the Defence Force Discipline Bill, is a combination of two or more Defence Force members: Firstly, to overthrow lawful authority in the Defence Force or allied forces; secondly, to resist authority to the substantial prejudice of operational efficiency; or thirdly, to refuse important service. The new penalties are now more fitting, and incidentally more lenient. The first two categories of mutiny involve a maximum term of 10 years imprisonment and for the last category, a very specific and serious one, the maximum penalty will remain life imprisonment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another example of an area where a necessary unification as well as a rationalisation of Service law has come about is in the provisions of the Bill regarding desertion. Under clause 22 of the Bill different legal definitions of desertion among the separate Services, as well as different penalties, have been unified and rationalised. Under the Bill's provisions the offence of desertion will be confined to conduct formerly generally known as constructive desertion; that is, conduct manifesting an intention to refuse particular duties by absenting oneself from duty. In particular the Bill will penalise absence from active service. Other types of absence will be treated as absence without leave. The new maximum penalty for desertion, replacing penalties ranging from life imprisonment to imprisonment for two years, will be five years imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> When one examines the ways the Bill has rationalised and reformed Service law, one area which stands out is that large field of law concerned with war crimes. This is not a field with which we in Australia have had to be particularly concerned in the past. Nevertheless since, and indeed before, the days of Breaker Morant bitter experience-especially the horrible crimes committed during the Second World War-has focused the attention of jurists and legislators on the necessity for extending the rule of law to servicemen on active duty. Some of the high crimes dealt with at Nuremberg and other tribunals of that kind-that is , broad crimes against peace and humanity-cover conduct which is outside the capacity of ordinary members of the armed Services. This Bill will not as a rule cover such conduct in enemy forces. However, the Bill does cover the kind of situation which is portrayed in the film Breaker Morant in that it seeks to apply as far as possible the restraints of civil law to Service personnel on active duty. To this end the Bill brings about a very necessary modernisation in its treatment of the jurisdiction of Service tribunals over serious crimes. </PARA>
<PARA> The present law, as it stands before the reforms we are debating, preserves significant inter-Service differences and some features of imperial law. The Army codes lay down that offences against the laws of England are triable only by a Service tribunal if they are committed outside Australia or Her Majesty's dominions or more than 100 miles in a straight line from any town or city where the accused could be tried by a civil court. The Royal Australian Air Force has the same unusual legal boundaries. The Royal Australian Navy, on the other hand, is permitted to try offences against both the laws of England and the Commonwealth of Australia but only if the offences are committed outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 63 of the Bill before us, serious offences, if committed in Australia against the law of the Commonwealth or the Australian Capital Territory, will be triable by a Service tribunal only with the permission of the Attorney-General. This would mean that normal practice will be for such crimes in Australia to be dealt with by the civil courts. I certainly commend this bias in favour of civil procedure in Australia. It emphasises the point that members of the armed Services are not some special section of the community but remain Australian citizens subject to the laws of the land-the rights as well as the obligations. To emphasise this as the Bill does is to emphasise the universal rule of law throughout our whole community. </PARA>
<PARA> An important consideration relating to war crimes is the definition of the responsibility of the individual serviceman or servicewoman in obeying unlawful superior orders. The Bill tightens up the tests in the various older service codes. Under clause 14 a serviceman can be convicted for obeying an illegal order not only if it is unlawful but also if he knows, or ought reasonably to know, that it is unlawful. The precise decision on the difficult points involved here is a matter for the individual tribunal judging the individual case but the guidelines laid down are adequate protection for the individual serviceman concientiously performing his duties while extending the rule of law over the operations of the armed Services. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area where the Service codes will be clarified and unified under the Bill is the conduct of Defence Force members when prisoners of war. Clause 19 of the Bill creates the new offence of failing to take reasonable steps, or preventing others or discouraging others from taking reasonable steps, to re- join the force to which a person belongs. The maximum penalty provided is five years imprisonment. Another new offence, following American experience, covers conduct of prisoners of war. This is conduct such as behaving in a manner detrimental to other POWs, or, when in authority over other POWs-including when appointed by one's captors-ill treating the other POWs. The maximum penalty is also five years imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA> These and the provisions relating to collaboration with the enemy in clause 15 of the Bill meet the pressures of modern ideological and psychological warfare against POWs familiar to us from the Korean and Vietnamese conflicts. It should be noted in this connection that under clause 15 a statutory defence is provided where the accused has reasonable excuse for his behaviour. The Bill, of course, applies only to members of the defence forces, not Australian civilians. It is worth noting that the only Australians I know of suspected of this sort of conduct have been civilians. Once again this is a matter for particular application by the courts. However, it does lay down the necessary guidelines. We know from both the Korean and Vietnamese wars of the extreme pressures which ruthless captors of totalitarian disposition can apply to the POWs in their power, either to subvert their loyalty or to produce propagandistic statements or so-called confessions from their victims. We know also the kind of manipulation of group loyalties that can go on in such prison camps of totalitarian direction. Therefore the Bill is to be commended for its endeavour to uphold both the essentials of discipline in such difficult situations as well as its capacity to provide for the special circumstances introduced by pyschological warfare. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill deserves the support of the House. I was glad to hear from the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) that the Bill, in all but minor detail, is receiving that support. It represents nine years of concentrated labour as well as some years before that of slightly less concentrated labour. It provides a code of discipline for the armed Services that is modern, unified and Australian. The penalties introduced are uniform and consistent between all three Services. The moderation of the penalties, relative to the older codes, reflects both the thinking of the wider society of which the Australian armed forces are part and the more rational discipline of modern military life. I believe the Bill is a major reform and a major achievement for Australia as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity, given the presence in the House this afternoon of the former Minister for Defence, Sir James Killen, to make a couple of observations. It is a cause for a great deal of regret that those of us who have been associated for some time with the defence area may lose the picturesque language that the Minister often inculcated into his speeches. I notice that in the introduction to the second reading speech of the Defence Force Discipline Bill in the last session he referred to the previous disciplinary law as a 'Serbonian bog of archaisms'. I do not doubt that the Minister and certainly other honourable members of the Government have a greater familiarity with Serbonian bogs of archaisms. I confess that certainly the legislation which this Bill now seeks to replace could be so described. It brings together in one Bill a large variety of often conflicting legislation- British and Australian. To that extent I certainly congratulate the Minister for having brought it forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again alluding to the Minister's second reading speech, I believe he dismissed too readily some of the more interesting features of the inherited legislation. I notice he made an observation about the deletion from the code of discipline of that wonderful phrase 'behaving in a scandalous manner unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman'. I make only one suggestion which is that instead of having that in a code of discipline for the armed forces the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) might consider having it in a code of discipline for Ministers of his government. </PARA>
<PARA> The other observation concerns the ancient occupation of sutlery. I am sure the former Minister will recall that spectacular phrase in Henry V when Pistol proclaimed to his colleagues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I shall sutler be. </PARA>
<PARA> Unto the camp, and profits will accrue. </PARA>
<PARA>The ancient art of sutlery is alive and well. Any of us who have been associated with defence will know that profits do still accrue. It goes well beyond the farthings and pence of Shakespeare's day. Those of us who have been associated with negotiations with foreign corporations and foreign military sales operations know that the supply and equipment of stores to the armed forces runs into hundreds of millions of dollars. This, of course, is the meaning of sutlery . I am sure that we all welcome the introduction into some form of defence legislation the provisions of sutlery so that we might continue to have some control over the activities of the modern-day sutlers. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has had a record gestation period. It started just after the Second World War. It was revitalised, as many other things were revitalised in the defence area, in the period 1972 to 1975. The Australian Labor Party revitalised the working party back in 1973. The legislation has taken a long time. The reason it has taken a long time is that it has been an enormously complicated and difficult task. The issues that have been included in the legislation are certainly not easy. </PARA>
<PARA> I will come now to some of the principles that have to be considered in this legislation. We are all aware of the Nuremburg trials. I suspect that was more a political trial than a legal trial. I suppose it is one of the advantages of being a victor in a war that one can proclaim certain moral values. In the associated trials in Nuremburg there was one very essential feature that had to be considered-whether it was an attempt to establish the locus of guilt of the German nation. The matter really came down to the proposition whether guilt for war crimes resided with those who gave orders, with those who carried them out or with both. Also as members of this Parliament we are very well aware of the My Lai incident and the trial in the United States of Lieutenant Calley. This is still the very nub of the question of discipline of forces and the rule of law. It is almost a contradiction in terms to have a rule of law in the affairs of war. I think this legislation goes part of the way to attempting to settle some of the issues that affect servicemen in a war time situation. It is a very complex problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Bill to which I want to refer are those that deal with the execution of orders or lawful commands. The Bill deals with this matter in a couple of provisions. Clause 14 which is headed 'Act or omission in execution of law' reads:</PARA>
<PARA> A person is not liable to be convicted of a service offence by reason of an act or omission that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) was in execution of the law; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) was in obedience to an order, not being an order-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that was clearly unlawful; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the person knew, or ought reasonably to have known, was unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA>We have to keep thinking back in our minds about this question of the locus of guilt, whether it resides with those who give orders or those who take orders. This matter is taken up again in clause 27 of the Bill which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> A defence member who disobeys a lawful command given to him by a superior officer is guilty of an offence for which the maximum punishment is imprisonment for 2 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The import of that clause-I am not quite sure whether the drafting of the legislation completely covers it-hinges on what constitutes lawful command. There is a mass of definitions in the front of this Bill but there is no definition of 'lawful command' in this Bill. There was not even an explanation of it in the second reading speech of the former Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that clause 27 refers to oral commands because subsequent clauses, particularly clause 29, deal with compliance with a general order. The definition of 'general order' set out in the front of the Bill seems to indicate written regulations issued by authorities within the Defence Force or within the Department of Defence. So we are dealing with an oral command. This raises the problems which exist in the heat of battle of what, in fact, are the rights and obligations of those giving the command and those taking the command. The Minister, in his second reading speech, explained:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a member of the armed forces can be convicted of disobeying a superior order only if it is lawful . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That question of what constitutes lawfulness is presumably left to the court martial to decide. The Minister then added:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that a member of the armed forces . . . cannot be convicted for the consequences of obeying a superior order unless the order was clearly unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA>In this context at the time when the command is given the onus is placed on the recipient of the order. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice some honourable members present in the House today who have been on active service. We could all ask: What opportunity is there for a soldier in the heat of battle to disobey an order which he believes is unlawful but which his superior regards as an order to be carried out immediately? We have that dilemma which has been referred to in the explanatory notes and which was explained by Dicey. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking of the serviceman, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> He may . . . be liable to be shot by a court martial if he disobeys an order, and to be hanged by a judge and jury if he obeys it. </PARA>
<PARA>This is really a very significant part of the legislation. Whilst I suppose I can excuse the drafters of the legislation for not really coming down to it, I think this is the least satisfactory part of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to queries raised in, I think, 1977 by the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman), the Minister indicated that consideration was given whether there should be a provision imposing an obligation on a serviceman to refuse an order which is unlawful. In the explanatory notes-I must compliment those responsible for the explanatory notes because it is a very useful document -this was considered but it was not taken up in the Bill for, I suppose, the reason that it was a very complicated problem to solve. </PARA>
<PARA> In the generalities in the approach to the drafting of this legislation and the drafting of Defence Force discipline we have an endorsement of the traditional position. That traditional position in effect is that a serviceman can be convicted of disobeying a command or an order only if it is lawful and cannot be convicted of the consequences of obeying an order or command unless it is clearly unlawful. Just stating those propositions raises the very real problem of accepting the orders of command and the very real difficulties of trying to establish within a Defence Force discipline code the proper method of handling it. </PARA>
<PARA> One point to which I particularly want to refer-I think there may be some opportunity to incorporate this in the drafting of the legislation-is the need for a reference in the Bill to the Geneva Convention of 1949 which attempted to establish the rules of war and the conduct of forces in a variety of areas during the war. I hope that there will be some opportunity for that to be directly referred to in the legislation. I know that we have hit upon the idea-I suppose it is a useful idea; I am not fully conversant with all the implications of it-of accepting the Australian Capital Territory laws. I presume that the laws of the Commonwealth in force in the Australian Capital Territory comprehend the Geneva Convention. But I think we would all agree that this is an exceptionally remote and indirect reference. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Government that there should be some direct reference to the Geneva agreements in the Defence Force Discipline Bill. I think this is important because I know that our forces and particularly our officers go through training programs on the rules of war. This new Defence Force discipline code will be a basic test for them. But they might not have the benefit of going through the Geneva Conventions and understanding and comprehending those to the fullest extent. I think some direct reference in the Bill to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 would be an advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note and welcome the inclusion of a new clause, clause 62. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> A defence member who commands or orders the commission of a service offence is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This means that the responsibility now, for the very first time in the legislation affecting Australia, places the onus on a commanding officer to act lawfully; and the orders and commands that he gives have to be on the basis of law. If he is found guilty of not giving lawful commands-still leaving aside that question that we have not defined a 'lawful command'-that imposes an obligation on all superior officers in the Defence Force when they are giving an order to a junior to ensure that the command is within the context of the laws of the Defence Force. If they move away from that position they are subject now, under clause 62, to a charge. I hope that these points that I have referred to can perhaps be more clearly set out. Clause 62 is fairly clear but, again, we have this great difficulty with definition. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is important that we continue to look at the Defence Force discipline codes. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has indicated that the Opposition will be moving in the Committee stage of this Bill for a review of the operations of the code after a period of three or four years. I do not want the Government just to reject that out of hand. It is a proposition that we have thought about. This code has taken a long time to put together and I do not think anybody in the House would argue that it is perfect. After we have had an opportunity of seeing it in operation there may well be parts of it that should be subject to review. I believe it is very important that this Parliament takes an active interest in the legislation and the results of the legislation. I hope that the Government will act on what I regard as a sensible suggestion. I have always taken the position that this Parliament, in making the laws, has a very real responsibility to ensure that those laws are kept up to date and are maintained for the purposes for which this Parliament designed them . I believe that the suggestion that will be put by the Opposition for a review after three or four years of the operations of this Bill when it becomes an Act should be accepted. I trust that the Government will accept that suggestion in the very sense that it is made by the Opposition because I believe it is a useful suggestion. I trust that the amendment will be accepted when it is moved by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief for one very obvious reason: I have been included in a line-up with brilliant talent to debate a Bill of this nature when the legalistic side of the matter is being stressed and I wish to indulge in just one or two generalities. I will develop that theme a little further. Eminent lawyers in both the present Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) and the former Minister for Defence have been handling the matter. Lined up to speak are the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman), the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) and the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Harris). So it would be futile of me to attempt to go into the legalities of this matter in any way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would just like to comment on one aspect and, in doing so, inevitably I must accentuate the attributes of the former Minister for Defence. It is not surprising that he should attempt, first of all, to review a very antiquated system, but I think he would probe a little deeper because, as we who know him and have seen his association with the defence forces are quite aware, he is sensitive to the necessity for morale, discipline and good common sense. That the whole of the system was very antiquated was against everything he stood for. One thing that was fairly obvious to me in my short term as Minister for the Army was that one could not regard the defence forces-in my case the Army-as a world apart. This concerned not only the manner in which the legal system was approached and carried out but also more minor things. I remember well making an inspection at Singleton on one occasion and seeing one or two hair pieces on the tables in the various rooms and, on questioning, finding out that the fellows would wear them to dances and so on because they were a little tired of the old Army haircut. I have been informed that my predecessor in the portfolio-the honourable member for Kooyong, who is just leaving the chamber-had not been wildly excited about there being a new haircut. However, it was introduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take on board the good sense of the present Minister. The process of law is vitally important. I think people who enter the forces-it is a new world to them-look for discipline most particularly and they look for a system which would see the matter of discipline carried right through. Where there are breaches they see a court of appeal which would go beyond the ordinary court martial stage. This has been provided by the Defence Force Discipline Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think I have aything more to add. I just wanted to bring forward the point that the former Minister attempted to fuse these various qualities of morale, discipline and good common sense and, in doing so, was able after many years to produce the Bill that is before the House today. I am sure that we would commend him for it. I am sure that everything else that has to be said will be said by the other honourable members who are to speak on this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the honourable member for Kennedy ( Mr Katter) for his remarks. I trust that his very generous remarks about the competence of others who will follow him in this debate will not be in any way diminished by the incompetence of those who endeavour to speak on this very complex matter. I am not necessarily speaking for my colleagues when I say that; but certainly, for my own part, I must say that I have never had any experience in the law in this very difficult area. I was struck by the complexity and the difficulty that those who have practised in this area must have experienced when I read the part of the speech of the former Minister for Defence where he gave us some particulars of the number of laws and the places that one had to look to seek the information necessary to guide those who were to be dealt with by way of discipline in one way or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I expand on that, I would certainly like to commend the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Sir James Killen)-my colleague the honourable member for Moreton-for his willingness to pilot this very important legislation through notwithstanding the fact that he is no longer departmentally responsible for it. The Defence Force Discipline Bill is a monumental piece of legislation. I think it is one of those items of legislation that people, looking at this Parliament in the years ahead, will see as beacons. It may not be that many people will speak on it or that there will be great contention. Rather it may be this will be another of the pieces of legislation that have helped to develop an Australian identity and enhance our national pride because we have a law of our own that operates in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment discussions which are obviously designed to enhance Australia's nationalism are going on in numbers of areas. I am certainly pleased that the States and the Commonwealth are starting to put aside their differences, although not completely, and consider the residual links that the States have with the British Crown. A number of reforms are likely to be developed and introduced into Australian law shortly for which there will be necessary and complementary British legislation to give us an independence which we will accept with a great deal of pride and which we recognise enhances our reputation as a nation. I think that the fact that we have come so far after operating for so long in this area with three United Kingdom Acts, two of which have ceased to operate in the United Kingdom, four sets of United Kingdom rules or regulations, all of which have ceased to operate in the United Kingdom, and three Australian Acts and nine sets of regulations under Australian Acts indicates what I mean about Australian nationalism. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that we have a Defence Force disciplinary code of our own. That it will operate for members of the Australian defence forces in each of the three areas of expertise is equally important. I was interested to read that a uniform code for the Navy, Army and Air Force was developed in other countries well before this code of ours. We have seen a uniform code adopted in the United States of America and Canada. The former Minister for Defence, in his second reading speech, mentioned that whilst this is largely a uniform code there are some special areas, particularly in relation to the Navy, where, very often because people are isolated and away for long periods, unique provisions might still have to operate. That is well and truly understood. But we will have a law which will largely be uniform among the three Services. It will be much clearer, it will use modern language and it will remove many of the ambiguities of the existing legislation. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) put it very simply when he made his worthwhile comments in this debate. I think he picked up some of the words of the former Minister. This is a Bill that is Australian, modern and uniform. For that reason I think it will be welcomed by all members of the defence forces and certainly by all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I wanted to speak on this legislation because the former Minister said that representations had been received on the need for reform in this area. I guess I was one of those who made some representations. I was concerned particularly about the area of penalties. I will give honourable members the benefit of the representations that were made to me without identifying the people involved so that they might be aware of why there was an important need for legislation of this sort, why it was important that the complexities and difficulties be removed and why we developed a system which took into account the relationship that ought to exist in a modern system between military and civil law. Before proceeding to identify those representations I will note some of the principles that the then Minister said were so important in relation to this legislation. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill deals with three principal matters and a number of ancillary matters. These may be briefly described as follows: It prescribes offences that apply to members of the Defence Force and certain civilians who accompany the Defence Force; it creates tribunals for the trial, conviction and punishment of such offences; it provides machinery for appeals against, and reviews of, convictions and punishments; it deals with ancillary matters such as investigation of offences, trial procedures, and serving of sentences. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to deal with the latter matter in particular because it was in this area that I became aware of certain gross inadequacies affecting people serving in the Defence Force. I will simply apprise honourable members of the nature of the representations that were made to me. In 1981 I was approached by a constituent, a Mrs X, who produced a copy of a letter she had received from the former Minister for Defence. In that letter the Minister indicated some of the provisions of the Naval Discipline Act that applied to a serviceman who had been punished for certain offences and who had been committed to gaol in New South Wales for two years. He indicated that the provisions of the Naval Discipline Act gave effect to the New South Wales remission procedures and that as a first offender the serviceman was entitled to some remission of his sentence for good conduct. The Minister also indicated that the Naval Discipline Act gave naval authorities the power to suspend or remit the unexpired portion of a sentence in certain circumstances but, essentially, that arose only where there was a change in the serviceman's position. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> You will see from the above that there are provisions whereby your husband's sentence could be suspended or remitted. </PARA>
<PARA>The important sentence was the next one. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A naval court martial has no power to make an order in relation to parole and the New South Wales and Commonwealth legislation does not apply in the case of your husband. </PARA>
<PARA>I was somewhat alarmed to find out that there was no scope for parole in circumstances such as this man faced and that he was in a very different position from other people serving two-year sentences in the gaols of New South Wales. Other prisoners had the prospect of a non-parole period being fixed and being released on parole. When I spoke to the officers concerned with this matter I was told that although there was no scope for parole in this case, this factor may well have been taken into account by the court martial when it determined the severity of the sentence to be imposed. But, of course, there was no statement to that effect and it was very much a conjecture on the part of the officers as to whether those who sentenced the man might, in fact, have taken into account the fact that there were no parole provisions whereby the court could say that the man may have to serve, say, one year in gaol and thereafter may be able to be paroled. For that reason I was most concerned and I corresponded for some time with the former Minister for Defence and with the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) because I was anxious about the lack of such provisions in the existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was alerted to the prospect of these matters being dealt with in the Defence Force disciplinary code when it was ultimately developed. Therefore I must say that although my constituent has been released from gaol and certainly was not able to avail himself of the provisions in this code I am pleased that others will be able to take advantage of the corresponding civilian procedures that operate in relation to the sentencing of offenders. Clause 68 of the Defence Force Discipline Bill sets out a scale of punishments that a service tribunal might well be able to impose in decreasing order of severity. I do not intend to list them all. They can be found in the Bill itself. Clause 70 sets out the principles that are to be taken into account in sentencing offenders. It sets out many matters to be taken into account in extenuating circumstances. It is pertinent to note the wide range of matters that can be taken into account. Sub- clause (2) sets out the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) his rank, age and maturity;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) his physical and mental condition;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) his personal history;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the absence or existence in his case of previous convictions for service offences, civil court offences and overseas offences;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) if the service offence involves a victim, his relationship with the victim;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) his behaviour before, during and after the commission of the service offence; and</PARA>
<PARA> (g) any consequential effects of his conviction or proposed punishment. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are obviously very important matters that need to be taken into account in considering the type and severity of the sentence that ought to be imposed on an offender. I draw the attention of the House to some further clauses in this Bill which, I think, help to bring the legislation into line with that operating in most of the States of Australia today. I am particularly pleased with clause 72 of the Bill. It is a new provision. There have not been provisions of this sort before. It requires a court-martial or a Defence Force magistrate to order a non -parole period whenever imposing imprisonment. I think that is a very worthwhile reform. It brings the defence forces into line with the type of civilian code that operates throughout Australia. It will certainly mean that if a member of the Defence Force has committed an offence and is sentenced to a term in a State gaol he will not be there on a substantially different basis from other offenders serving their sentences for whatever offences they have committed. Clause 72 (2) of the Bill applies the Commonwealth Prisoners Act to orders for non-parole periods made under sub-clause (1) to which I referred earlier. The Commonwealth Prisoners Act sets out the procedure to be followed with regard to parole for persons sentenced to imprisonment for offences against laws of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other worthwhile provisions in this legislation relating to punishment. I refer particularly to clause 75 which involves a procedure that is well known in the civilian area. It is a new procedure to operate in relation to the Commonwealth whereby a court may proceed to a conviction in a case where an offence is proven, but not proceed to punish a person. Very often the simple recording of a conviction is sufficient in relation to an offence and is the sort of minimum penalty that ought to be imposed in particular circumstances. It means that the officers or the magistrate involved will be able to record the conviction and not impose any punishment in an appropriate case. As I mentioned, this is a new provision but it is a very worthwhile reform. It was intended in 1973, when a draft code was proposed, that there be a provision of this sort. I am certainly very pleased to see that such a provision exists in this legislation. In clause 82 we see that there is provision for the remission of punishment of detention on imprisonment. By this clause a punishment of detention, whether suspended or not, is remitted if the offender is subsequently sentenced to imprisonment. Whilst in the existing law some provision was made for naval personnel to be dealt with in this way, there were no similar provisions previously in relation to the Army or the Air Force. I guess it was a form of double punishment that could be offered and it seems to me to be very important that such remissions operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I draw clause 174 to the attention of honourable members. Whilst this is not a particularly new provision, I think it is important because it provides that the State or Territory law in relation to certain prisoners-that is, servicemen who are sentenced to imprisonment in a State or Territory-will apply. If honourable members look at that clause they will see why I think it is particularly important, having regard to the experience of my constitutent. The clause states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where a prisoner is detained in a prison of a State or Territory under a warrant of commitment issued under section 170, the prisoner, while so detained, may be dealt with in the like manner and is subject to the like laws, including laws relating to the reduction or remission of sentences, as if the imposition of the punishment of imprisonment by the service tribunal by reason of which the warrant was issued had been a sentence made or pronounced under a law of that State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will see that that provision is particularly important because it enables the prisoner to be dealt with in a like manner to people who are imprisoned under State law. It means that if in those States provisions operate by way of work release programs or special consideration for parole taking into account the conduct of a prisoner while he is in gaol, he will be treated in a like manner to any other prisoner in that gaol who has broken a State law or other laws. I think that is particularly important. I do not think Service personnel, particularly in peacetime, ought to be discriminated against in State gaols. I regard these reforms in relation to punishment and penalties as very worthwhile reforms. I am pleased that the Leader of the House has been associated with them and has been able to see them into fruition. I have no doubt that this very important legislation will be passed. It will be a beacon in the years ahead when many people will say that this was the year in which this code was implemented and that Jim Killen, if I might say so, was the man responsible for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly in this debate on the Defence Force Discipline Bill. I will not detain the House for too long. Firstly, I congratulate the Minister at the table, the former Minister for Defence and now Leader of the House (Sir James Killen). He would wish me to congratulate all those who, over the years, have played a role in the eventual formulation of this Bill. I see in the advisers' box Brigadier Maurice Ewing, the Director of Army Legal Services in the days when I was Minister for the Army. He is still in that position. He and his colleagues have put in countless hours on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) saying earlier in the day that this Bill has evolved from the actions of the Australian Labor Party when in government. The fact is that the current Bill is based on the 1973 working party on the Defence Force disciplinary code. Of course, it had its germination in approximately 1946. When my colleague the Leader of the House was Minister for the Navy and I shared a Service portfolio with him we were involved in looking at what was described in the 1960s as a uniform defence or disciplinary code. So its germination has been long. Painstaking work has been involved in the revision of the defence disciplinary laws. Therefore, it is a matter for congratulation of the Minister, all those officers and men in the various Services who have worked on it and the civilians who have advised on it.</PARA>
<PARA> I say as well that it is pleasing that the Opposition, despite the fact that it will move an amendment for a review, which will be considered during the Committee stage, is supporting a Bill of this nature. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), described the Bill as monumental, and indeed it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned a uniform disciplinary code. Without wishing to be pedantic-many will know that it is many years since I was involved in active practice in the law-I think it is a misnomer to describe it as a uniform disciplinary code because the regime created under the legislation, as I read it, is not entirely uniform; nor is it, strictly speaking in a jurisprudential sense, a code. The Bill is based on common law principles and is not based on a criminal law code. As I said, it is based on a report of the 1973 working party on the defence disciplinary code and undoubtedly follows widespread consultation with members of the defence forces, members of parliament and the public. Indeed, the Minister indicated when introducing the Bill that he would be receptive to representations from the community. I understand that he will be putting further amendments-this has been foreshadowed-when we reach the Committee stage. The resulting Bill is one which should be acceptable to all those concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In introducing the Bill the Minister referred to the existing body of law dealing with Defence Force discipline as a 'Serbonian bog of archaism'. I noted with interest that the honourable member for St George alluded to this. We will miss this type of language in defence material which is brought before the House unless the Leader of the House continues the active and keen interest he is showing today by carrying the legislation through. It is not often that I need to refer to a dictionary when I listen to the Leader of the House, with his capacity for well chosen words, but having been a student of Milton I thought I would look at the dictionary. I note it reveals that the phrase comes from Milton. The dictionary describes the term used by the Minister as 'a situation from which escape is difficult'. The dictionary is somewhat remiss in my view because, as I recall Milton's own words are more appropriate than those found in the dictionary. Milton described the phrase as referring to a place 'where armies whole have sunk'. The existing laws may not have swallowed or sunk our Services but I am sure the escape through this Bill will certainly be a welcome relief. At present each of the Services is subject to different Acts and regulations. The Army and Air Force rely on United Kingdom Acts and regulations long since discarded in the United Kingdom, while the Navy's disciplinary laws are based on more modern United Kingdom statutes. Differences exist, for example , with respect to rules of evidence, provision for laying charges for civil offences, maximum punishments, et cetera. Moreover, unlike the other two Services, the Army draws a distinction between offences committed during peacetime and those committed while on active service. Many offences under existing law are clearly outmoded-the Minister referred to this in his speech- while some modern offences, for example, drug offences, are not dealt with specifically. The objective of the review process has been to achieve a cohesive body of law which is Australian, which is simple and clearly worded, which reflects contemporary attitudes to offences and to the administration of the law and which will meet the requirements of Defence Force discipline for many years to come. This new Bill will, I think, achieve those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a completely revised set of offences common to all three Services. Obsolete offences are eliminated and other offences are added, so that there will be less reliance on the general catch-all charge of 'conduct to the prejudice'. In future the charge of prejudicial behaviour will apply only to minor offences; it cannot apply, as I understand it, to the more serious offences. As I have said, offences are expressed in modern language that is more easily understood by all Service members. This, of course, is a particularly important point, since for the most part those administering Service law are not in fact lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, there will no longer be a need to keep abreast of United Kingdom law which, to put it mildly, was an extraordinarily difficult and time consuming task for even the most sagacious lawyer. The Act, as I said, will be entirely Australian and, in respect of civil offences, triable by Service tribunals. The relevant body of law will be the law of the Australian Capital Territory, not the law of England. As I understand it Defence civilians will now be subject to Service tribunals for certain offences and the scope of Service tribunals to deal with both Defence members and Defence civilians committing civil offences has been widened. The system of punishments has been revised so that maximum punishments reflect modern approaches to the law. A distinction is made between serious and minor offences and this is reflected in the maximum punishments applicable. Outmoded penalties such as cashiering and dismissal with disgrace will disappear. It is worthy of note that the death penalty has been abolished, and properly so. In line with the principles on which it relies, the Bill allows for sentencing tribunals to have regard to circumstances of the offence, the convicted person's prior record, maturity and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides sentencing criteria to be observed by Service tribunals, allows for sentences to be served concurrently, makes provision for the recording of convictions without punishment and so on. In other words, the Bill brings military law into line with practices and procedures of civil courts for sentencing offenders. Similarly, procedures relating to summons, arrest, custody and suspension of duty have been modernised. With respect to the investigation of offences, the Criminal Investigation Bill 1982 will apply. The administration of Service law will be rationalised with a view to achieving greater uniformity. There will be a two-tiered system of courts martial and a three-tiered system of summary authority. In addition there is provision for Defence Force magistrates, who will be suitably qualified and experienced lawyers and who will have similar authority to a restricted court martial. This innovation, I believe, should allow for cases to be dealt with more expeditiously, especially when complex legal matters are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The major area where uniformity has not been achieved is in the powers of summary authorities. At present naval summary authorities enjoy much wider powers than their Army or Air Force counterparts. That this is so-and will to a degree remain so-reflects the very special operational conditions of the Navy. However, the discrepancies between the Services will be reduced and there will be greater supervision over the imposition of more severe summary punishments. There is, of course, provision for the automatic review of findings, sentences, et cetera and for the reviewing authorities to obtain legal advice. Consistent with the overall approach embodied in this Bill, there will be one Judge Advocate General, with a Deputy Judge Advocate General from each of the Services . </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the objectives of the review process of the Defence Force discipline laws have been more than adequately met. This Bill is Australian; it is contemporary; in practice it brings military law more closely in line with that applying in the Australian community generally; yet it meets the practical requirements of a modern defence force. There must be those-and I think I heard it said earlier outside the precincts of the House-who have laboured for so long and who now find this day almost surprising as it reaches its fruition. Many years of dedicated work have been spent in bringing this legislation about. Those involved, from the Minister down, in this long and laborious task, are to be congratulated. The Bill ought to be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my opening remarks in this cognate debate I pay tribute to the former Minister for Defence and now the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen), who is at the table, for introducing this legislation into Parliament in the last session and letting it lie on the table, thus enabling consultations to take place and the legislation to be looked at and examined. I think it is an example that should be followed by many other Ministers in respect of other pieces of legislation. Undoubtedly we will get better legislation if this is the format and procedure adopted. I pay tribute to him as Minister for tying all the various strings together and bringing together the pieces of this legislation into this one uniform code. As has been said before in this debate, and as the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) just said, this legislation Australianises the law for military purposes. It modernises it and makes it uniform. I congratulate the Minister for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope and suspect that this Parliament will be in a new era of participation by honourable members in complicated legislation. Knowing the Minister's great love of, or attitude towards, parliamentary committees-I say this as much in jest as anything else-we may well see when this Bill goes into the Committee stage a new approach and a new attitude to the Committee stage in the House. In seriousness, I think the number of honourable members on the Government side who have spoken today shows the respect for the Minister in the job that he has done . I think it may be the start of a new interest in complicated and detailed legislation in this House. I wish the Minister well and I will watch with great interest the Committee stage of Bills in this session of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made of the hard work that has gone into this Bill over many years. From the task force in 1973-74 to the days when the Leader of the House was Minister for the Navy and the honourable member for Kooyong was Minister for the Army this legislation has been talked of. I think those in the Attorney- General's Department and in the Department of Defence need to be congratulated. It has been a prolonged exercise. There has been a thorough review. I pay tribute also to the Defence Force legal reserves, including the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. They have borne a large burden of this work over many years. I know that they have felt frustrated inasmuch as this legislation has not come to pass before now, but I think now that it is here they would understand that something as complicated as this, which undertakes such fundamental changes as does this legislation, inevitably takes time. The work of the legal reserves of the Army, Navy and Air Force-the seminars they conducted, the discussions they held and the bringing together of their experiences-has played a very important and fundamental part in bringing this legislation together from the three threads of the respective arms of the Defence Services into one piece of legislation applicable to all three. I am sure that Brigadier Ewing, who is in one of the seats occupied by the advisers, would pay tribute to his colleagues in the Navy and in the Air Force in that regard. I can remember Toby Nicholls in the Air Force years ago having seminars and living in hope that this legislation would come sooner than later. As I said, it is here and I think it is timely. It reflects the hard work and the time that its preparation has taken. It has been a worthwhile exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, however, that the legislation be kept under review. It is new and may need modification and change. It is Australian and it is called an Australianisation. I think that is important. Let us not take it as settled, let us not regard it as perfect. Let us see whether the legislation needs changing and reviewing from time to time to meet the changed circumstances that may exist as something might have been omitted. It standardises basically for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. Inevitably there will be some differences. Conditions on a ship at sea for long periods are different from conditions applying in the headquarters of an Army base in a capital city. Similarly being in the front line in an Army situation is different from sitting at naval headquarters. We must keep the legislation together and not let it split to return to the three various arms of military law. It is important that we keep the strings of the three threads of the Services-the Army, the Navy and the Air Force-tied together and as uniform as possible. This will reflect the differences that need to be respected in the different Services. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid that I did not consult any dictionary on this matter and I do not have any poetry to quote on this occasion. Some of my colleagues have done so. I find it very hard to treat this matter lightly because it is a serious subject. The legislation has to be straightforward in order to be understood. It is important that it be serious but simple because not every platoon commander, regimental officer, sergeant major, regimental sergeant major or non- commissioned officer has a lawyer with him or her in any particular situation. The law has to be clearly and simply understood and administered by those who have to administer it in the defence forces. That is why the legislation is serious and, therefore, should be straightforward. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect the community at large will have a greater understanding of this sort of legislation than ever before because, whilst we are having an Australianisation of defence law relating to Defence Force discipline, at the same time in the Australian community there has been a great rebirth of the film industry. Numbers of the more successful films have been ones that have related to military forces where the interpretation of military law has been part of the theme. I think of films such as Breaker Morant, Gallipoli and the recent Australian Broadcasting Commission success 1915. If members of the community were to stop to reflect on the situations in some of those films, they would see how important it is that we have a simple military law, an Australian military law, that captures the spirit of the original Gallipoli. But it has taken until this time for us to have a completely Australian discipline law to apply to our military forces. We do not have to rely on United Kingdom statutes. We do not need to have a myriad of books to consult from various jurisdictions; in fact we can go to one place at the one time. The former Minister for Defence pointed out that the previous system was a mixture of the United Kingdom and Australian law and certainly provided ample scope for errors to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I have reflected and spoken about the time taken in the preparation of the Bill . It is worth saying that the offences have been completely revised and brought up to date. We have seen offences such as the illegal use of vehicles or the possesssion or use of narcotic drugs brought into the legislation. This is only sensible. In the tying together of the law and bringing it into the one enactment for the three Services three levels of summary authority are provided. The extensive summary powers conferred on Navy commanding officers have been substantially reduced but, on the other hand, there has been an increase in the powers of Army and Air Force summary authorities. Greater supervision has been provided over the imposition of the more severe summary punishments. This is an example of the bringing together of and the compromising among the various arms to have a common denominator applicable to all the services. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) made an excellent contribution in his speech to the House. He said that the Bill brought about major reforms, Australianised the military law, and replaced the British law with a new and more appropriate Australian law. As I have also said, it modernises our military law which, until now, as the former Minister for Defence in his second reading speech has pointed out, has been notoriously out of date. The honourable member for Wentworth also said in his thoughtful speech that it provided a uniform code , which I have mentioned, and it simplifies the military law in its rules and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation Australianises and modernises the law as to Defence Force discipline in Australia in introducing, for the first time, uniform legislation. I congratulate the Minister at the table. I commend the legislation to the House , together with the amendments that I know the Minister proposes to introduce. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These Bills will, when passed, finally consolidate and modernise our disciplinary law in this country as it applies to our Defence Force. The Defence Force Discipline Bill provides new disciplinary legislation for our Defence Force and for the first time in one Act the disciplinary law applicable to the three arms of our Force. The Defence Force Discipline Bill is based on a report of the 1973 working party on the Defence Force disciplinary code which was tabled in Parliament in April 1974. As has been noted by a number of previous speakers, the origins of this legislation in fact go back to about 1946. It has taken a further eight years since the tabling of the report to get to this point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that the Opposition supports this Bill. One hopes that the legislation will have a speedy passage when it gets through to the Senate. I join with those honourable members who have spoken in paying tribute to all those who have worked to get this very large piece of legislation to this point and in particular to the former Minister for Defence and present Leader of the House ( Sir James Killen), who is at the table, who has had and still has the carriage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force Discipline Bill provides new disciplinary legislation. I will not attempt to deal with all of the essential features of the Bill which include the creation of service tribunals with a power to try members of the Defence Force on charges of Service offences against the Bill. It will provide these tribunals with the power to try civilians accompanying the Defence Force outside Australia or on operations against the enemy for some of those offences in certain circumstances. Civilians are not otherwise to be liable to be tried by service tribunals, nor are any offences created by the Bill to be triable by civil courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides a system of internal appeal against, and review of, convictions and punishments complementary to the system of external appeal against, and review of, convictions provided by the Courts-Martial Appeals Act. The Bill also makes provision for related matters, such as investigation of offences, suspension from duty, powers of arrest, power to order restitution of stolen property or payment of reparation for damage or loss caused, conviction without punishment, approval of certain punishments by higher authority, suspension and remission of punishments, execution and enforcement of punishments, and parole. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference has already been made by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock ) to the desirability of parole and the problems which have occurred in the past with the inability of the Services to allow for that. The additional, different and varied forms of punishment available in this legislation allow service tribunals and courts-martial to apply punishments of a kind which are generally accepted in civil courts as being appropriate in these times. The Bill provides for service tribunals to operate at two principal levels: At the lower level there are summary authorities; at the higher level there are courts-martial and Defence Force magistrates. No offence is to be tried by a court-martial or a Defence Force magistrate unless there has been a preliminary hearing by a summary authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedure under the Bill by which charges against an accused person are heard and brought to trial is in many respects analogous to that by which an alleged offence is heard and tried by a civil court. The function undertaken by a magistrate of disposing of minor charges and conducting a preliminary hearing of charges that are to be brought to trial before a superior court is, in relation to offences under the Bill, to be undertaken by a commanding officer. The Bill provides three levels of summary authorities. In ascending order these are: Subordinate summary authorities, commanding officers and superior summary authorities. The manner in which an alleged offence will initially be dealt with will depend upon the nature of the offence and the circumstances of its discovery. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the facts are straightforward-for example, a member is detected in the commission of an offence-the member will immediately be charged with an offence. In the case of some offences, such as theft or fraud, the laying of charges may have to be deferred pending an investigation by Service or civil police in order to establish the identity of the alleged offender or to obtain sufficient evidence to justify the laying of charges. In the case of apparently more serious offences, including those involving injury or loss of life or the negligent operation of a ship, the laying of charges may have to be deferred pending the holding of a Service court of inquiry or board of inquiry. An accused will not be placed under arrest unless there is a particular reason for doing so, such as to prevent him repeating the offence, destroying evidence or absconding. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the accused is a sailor, soldier or airman, he will, after he has been charged and such police investigation as is necessary has been completed, attend before the subordinate summary authority for a formal hearing of the charge. The charge will be read to the accused and, if necessary, explained to him. If the subordinate summary authority has power to try the charge and proposes to try the charge himself, the accused will be asked to plead to it. The evidence will be given orally, on oath and in the presence of the accused, who will be entitled to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses and to call witnesses in his defence. This is, of course, essentially the procedure which we find in our normal civilian criminal courts. If the subordinate summary authority tries the charge and convicts the accused he will, before imposing a punishment, hear any plea in mitigation of the punishment that the accused wishes to make and consult the previous service record of the accused. When dealing with a charge that will be referred to the commanding officer a subordinate summary authority will usually not hear all the evidence; it will be his function to hear sufficient evidence to ensure that relevant matters will be brought before the commanding officer. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Royal Australian Navy, as has been mentioned by at least one other speaker, there will be two tiers of subordinate summary authority: The officer of the watch, whose powers of punishment will be the same as those of an Australian Army or Royal Australian Air Force subordinate summary authority, and the executive officer, whose powers of punishment will be greater. Offences by sailors will normally be considered first by the officer of the watch and then referred by him to the executive officer or to the commanding officer as appropriate. This difference in relation to the Navy is, of course, a product of the differences of naval service. For example, it would be very difficult to convene a court-martial when a ship is away on exercise or, even more so, if it is operating in distant waters. Even if it is not a court-martial but is a matter to be heard by a Defence Force magistrate, the problems of getting the accused, witnesses and the like to the Defence Force magistrate would be both time consuming and costly. </PARA>
<PARA> When a charge comes before a commanding officer he has several options: He may try the charge, direct that it not be proceeded with or refer it to another commanding officer, a superior summary authority or a convening authority, depending upon the circumstances of the case and the jurisdiction that may be exercised by himself and other authorities. The superior summary authority will have power to try charges against officers, warrant officers and civilians only. He will try a charge or refer it to a convening authority. There will be two levels of courts-martial: General courts-martial and restricted courts-martial. The only difference between the two is that the latter will normally consist of fewer members with a less senior president and will have restricted powers of punishment equal to those of the Defence Force magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedure of trial by court-martial appears not to be essentially altered from that of the past in that certain functions of a judge, such as ruling on questions of law or summing up, are performed by the judge advocate. The members of the court-martial will perform the role of a jury but will also determine the punishment. The president of the court-martial will be responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the trial. This procedure, as I said, would appear to be essentially that which existed previously. The appointment of Defence Force magistrates will be made from qualified service lawyers whose names are on the judge advocates' panel. I join the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) in paying tribute to the many officers of the Reserve legal panels who have contributed and assisted over a long period and, no doubt, will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> One final matter I wish to refer to is the question of review. There will be an automatic review of all convictions and punishments imposed by service tribunals . This is a highly desirable measure. I recently had brought to my attention a situation in which injustice would undoubtedly have occurred had it not been for a further review of the particular case. Convictions and punishments imposed by a subordinate summary authority will be reviewed in the first instance by the commanding officer, who may obtain a report on the proceedings from a designated legal officer. The proceedings may in certain circumstances be subsequently reviewed by reviewing authorities appointed by each Chief of Staff or be reviewed by the Chief of Staff himself. In the case of all reviews by reviewing authorities and Chiefs of Staff the obtaining of a report on the proceedings from a designated legal officer will be mandatory. As I said, I think this is a most important provision in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the nature of things, errors can occur, certainly in summary punishments. For what is thought to be for the good of a particular establishment, matters might be disposed of too swiftly and, possibly, to the injustice of an accused person. As I said, this legislation is a notable advance. One hopes that we will not take 37 years next time to introduce changes to Defence Force discipline legislation. One hopes equally that the vast amount of work which has gone into this legislation will mean that we will not have to have such dramatic and considerable changes for a long time. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>Application of Commonwealth Prisoners Act</PARA>
<PARA> '72. (1) The Commonwealth Prisoners Act 1967 (other than sub-section 4 (3) applies in relation to a service tribunal that imposes a punishment of imprisonment for a specific period on a convicted person as if-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the service tribunal were a court of, and the person was convicted in, the Australian Capital Territory; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the reference in sub-section 4 (2) of that Act to matters to which a court is to have regard in fixing a lesser term of imprisonment in pursuance of sub- section 4 (1) of that Act included a reference to the need to maintain discipline in the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> '(2) The fixing of a minimum term of imprisonment, or the giving of a direction , by a service tribunal under the Commonwealth Prisoners Act 1967 in its application by virtue of sub-section (1) of this section to the service tribunal , shall be taken, for the purposes of this Act, to be an order fixing that minimum term of imprisonment, or giving that direction, as the case may be, made by the service tribunal under this part.'</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that this amendment will give greater certainty to the outcome which I am very anxious to achieve in this legislation, that is, that service tribunals have the opportunity to fix a lesser term of imprisonment which a person might serve before he is released on parole. Whilst the amendment, as proposed, certainly does not state that that is the objective I understand that for greater certainty the matter has to be dealt with by reference to the Commonwealth Prisoners Act 1967 which also gives effect to that. I would like to draw honourable members' attention to the explanatory memorandum which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clause (1) requires service tribunals to make orders fixing non-parole periods as if they were courts of the Australian Capital Territory; the Parole Ordinance 1976 (ACT) is to be applied. Sub-clause (2) allows these orders to be deemed to be orders of the purposes of the Commonwealth Prisoners Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply reiterate the matters that I mentioned in my speech at the second reading stage of the debate. It is very important that servicemen who are committed to prison be committed in relation to like offences in the same way that people might be committed to prison for the commission of offences under civil law. I mentioned that I was aware of a particular case where a prisoner was committed to prison for some two years by a defence tribunal. He was left in the invidious position of having no parole period fixed. He had to serve the sentence that was given to him while others, who had two year sentences, of course could be released somewhat earlier because a period for parole had been set when the sentence was imposed. Whilst it might be surmised that those who are involved in setting sentences would be aware of the fact that there was a difference between the defence provisions and the civil law that is not a matter that ought to be left to chance. It is a matter that needs to be dealt with by the law. I understand that these provisions will give effect to that and for that reason I am very pleased that such provisions will be included in this Bill . </PARA>

It involved a case where a sailor had been convicted and sentenced to two years gaol but there was no opportunity for his sentence to be reduced or for parole to be granted. I felt keenly about the issue at the time but all I could do was to offer sympathy to the honourable member for Dundas and I am indebted to him for his sense of perseverence over the years.

<PARA>As I indicated to the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) earlier the Opposition has deleted two sub-clauses of the amendment. Obviously clause 9 has been renumbered to become clause 7. The deletion involves certain technical matters which relate to freedom of information. We feel these should not be written into this type of amendment which is designed specifically to bring about a review of the Act by a board of review after this proposed Act and other related Acts have been in operation for a period of not less than three years. This is a fairly complicated piece of legislation. This Parliament is certainly covering new ground in Australian law in relation to the Australian forces. We believe that it is not possible to anticipate problems in a piece of legislation of this magnitude but it should be mandatory that a review take place after a reasonable period when any defects in the operations of the Act have shown up. For that reason we are proposing that a review take place after three years. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out the great difficulties that there are of reopening a subject such as this at a parliamentary or even a political level once it has been dealt with and the traumas of getting legislation such as this before the Parliament. I mentioned in the debate at the second reading stage that this piece of legislation is the result of an initial order of the Minister for the Army as far back as 1946. It came before this Parliament as an initial draft in 1973 and again in 1975. One would think that given that type of history it would be better to have a provision in the Bill which requires that a review take place rather than depend on the fates of history, politicial activities and who happens to be in power at a particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that the reviewing committee would find nothing wrong with the Bill but I think it is better to have an automatic review. There is already provision for automatic reviews of all cases heard under this legislation. It would be better to have an automatic review built into the legislation than to have to wait until substantial deficiencies occur that would require a review. Minor deficiencies can be just as debilitating to those people involved but these would very rarely bring about the political action necessary to change them. In dealing with the amendment dealt with earlier I think the Minister indicated that a deficiency in a Bill is not always corrected merely because it becomes apparent. </PARA>

It was the then Army Minister, Mr Frank Forde-who is still alive today-who commissioned Mr Justice Reed to make certain inquiries. The honourable member has a sense of anxiety that there may be a lacuna in this proposed Act. In his view there may be deficiencies and the legislation should be reviewed. Having said that, I wonder whether my friend's amendment meets his sentiment. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after the expiration of three years after the proclaimed date, establish a Board-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, a board to review. That amendment could be read two ways. Firstly, what if a deficiency were found three months afterwards? One would seek to review it. I am one who does not take a cynical view of this world. I think reason still has a role to play in the conduct of our affairs. Irrespective of what kind of government it may be, I would hope that with legislation of this character if deficiencies were found the government would attend to the matter. I have reflected on what my friend said and circulated on his amendment. I have taken the opportunity of discussing it with officers who have had a very long association with the legislation. I cannot see a convincing argument in favour of the amendment. I am not being obstinate about this. Plenty of Bills have passed through this chamber on which I would have liked to tack amendments. I am thinking of what my friend would call the halcyon days, 1972-75, when I would have liked to tack on requirements for reviews in one month, three months or six months. That would not have been within the realm of practical politics. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that I cannot respond to the plausible and courteous argument which the honourable gentleman has pressed on the Committee. I say to him and to his colleagues to be of good cheer. If there are flaws in the legislation I am sure the Minister of the day, whoever he may be, and the government of the day, whatever its political colours, will attend to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I merely say there are two aspects. Firstly, the drafting of the Bill is that of the draftsman who drafts it in order to achieve a purpose. I think the Defence Force Discipline Bill is not necessarily the same as the general run of Bills which go through the Parliament. I believe, as the Minister has indicated, that if a major flaw in a piece of legislation such as this turned up it would be immediately corrected. The purpose of any review would be to review the operations of the proposed Act in its totality in order that any changes which were necessary or recommended or which had become apparent were undertaken. It is quite possible in an act of this nature for that to cover a fairly widespread area without having any major deficiencies. An Act which seeks to impose an almost totally new concept of law, which one would hope is not of a political nature but concerns the rights of various individuals as they relate to the Bill, should be respected, should be capable of review and should be reviewed after a period of operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill is new law and whilst the basis of it may be well established it is not an area-such as those areas the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) mentioned-where political considerations may come into effect. In fact we are not suggesting that there are any political motives or any deficiencies in the Bill at the moment. I am sure there are a number of areas in which my colleagues and I could have drafted amendments. We did not. We believed that it would be far better to test the operation of the Bill in practical terms, through its actual operation, and to ensure that the results of those operations are subject to an automatic review-not one which has to be dredged up through the political system, given the pressures which exist in this place and in government for matters of lesser political consequence to be given lower priority. I do not suggest that any Minister would wish to neglect this but I point out that the traumatic history of this legislation would suggest that without a provision such as this in the Bill it would be extremely difficult to have it reviewed in any reasonable time. Unless major reasons were able to be advanced, rather than minor reasons, I think it would be impossible to get a review established at a time when I believe the operations of the Bill should have become apparent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;World traffic in fauna and flora is a lucrative business which has endangered the survival of many species in the wild. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora- that is, the CITES agreement-signed in 1973 is the result of international attempts to control this illicit trade. The Convention seeks to regulate strictly trade in species which are endangered. Seventy-three countries have ratified CITES but certain countries, notably Singapore, act as a clearing house and also a laundering facility for illicitly procured wildlife. At present the illegal trade is extremely lucrative with profits approaching those of drug trafficking, without the risks. The live animal trade involves great cruelty with up to 90 per cent of the specimens dying en route to market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia ratified CITES by introducing the Customs (Endangered Species) Regulations in 1976 under the Customs Act. These regulations control the export and import of species listed in appendices of CITES. Unfortunately the Customs Act provides for penalties of up to only $1,000 in fines. I was informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) in answer to a question on notice that in spite of the fact that illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be worth $40m a year there have been only two convictions made under the Endangered Species regulations since 1976 with fines totalling only $250. This situation must be changed. The Opposition, with some qualification, supports the proposed legislation. It should help by providing penalties of sufficient size to act as a deterrent to smugglers and reversing the onus of proof in certain cases. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation consolidates other regulations concerning prohibited imports and exports and gives legislative teeth to Federal intentions regarding wildlife . It will regulate trade in Australian native fauna, species which are endangered by reasons other than trade and species which Australia considers a special case on the grounds of animal welfare or national policy. The welfare of live animals is considered as to whether institutions or circuses and travelling exhibitions can humanely keep the species in captivity. Strict rules apply about the non-release to the environment of imported species. I understand that the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill covers some weaknesses of CITES by protecting endangered species not affected by trade and so not in the CITES appendices and by regulating the import of wildlife or their products which are considered to be personal effects. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the States were consulted on this legislation and that they have supported it. The Opposition, considering this legislation necessary and long overdue, supports it also. Under present arrangements the Minister responsible for Customs is in charge of the regulation governing the import and export to Australia and is also the management authority regulating CITES. Wildlife authorities provide assistance, I understand, but it is a most unsatisfactory arrangement to have the Minister responsible for Customs in charge of wildlife protection legislation. Under this Government there have been examples where a Minister responsible for Customs has made decisions on wildlife export or import without any consultation or without sufficient consultation with the Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment. The legislation before the House places control of wildlife firmly in the hands of the Minister responsible-that is, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. The Act is to be administered by his Department and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. They will, and should, handle inquiries, publicity, applications, permits and authorities while Customs officers should still enforce the Act on the ground. In certain cases wildlife officers from the Commonwealth or a State may enforce the Act also. Such arrangements should result in more effective control. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will operate through a series of schedules which list species which require or do not require a permit issued under its provisions. Import or export without a permit of species on Schedules 1, 2 and 3 and those Australian native species not on Schedule 4 will be liable to the maximum fine of $100,000 for a person or $200,000 for a body corporate and/or a gaol term of up to five years. The first three schedules list plants and animals which may not be exported or imported without a permit. Export of live native Australian animals, except for fish and certain marine vertebrates, is prohibited for commercial trade on welfare grounds. The public cannot keep exotic pets as easily as it does dogs and cats. I agree that protection should be offered to those Australian wild animals that are not on Schedule 4 to prevent unregulated trade in that area because we have to be responsible for the ultimate welfare of the animals in question. It may be very easy to argue that because we are shooting kangaroos or killing parrots in Australia it is acceptable to export them even under a management plan in large numbers as it is to shoot them. But the point is: Once we get Australian kangaroos, birds, et cetera becoming part of the world pet trade it is very easy for people, say, in apartments on Manhattan Island to take a spot decision to purchase a small kangaroo. It is easy to buy, but it is much more difficult to look after the animal. I do not think Australia wants to get into the situation where we are not unwilling to crack down on this undesirable trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 1 contains those species on Appendix I of CITES threatened by international trade, those Australian plants and animals considered endangered by the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers and other species in danger for reasons other than trade-that is, habitat destruction, et cetera. There are stringent rules, I understand, in granting permits for these species. Export and import can be for scientific research or inter-zoological garden transfer. If a species is not a live Australian animal, it can be exported for commercial purposes if it was bred in captivity. The Australian institution which receives the plant or animal must be an institution approved to care for that class of specimen. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 2 includes CITES Appendix 2 species which may become threatened if trade is not regulated. Commercial trade in these species is allowed if the species was bred in captivity or was taken in accordance with a management program approved by a designated authority. Schedule 3 includes all the cetacea- that is, whales and dolphins-with stricter control than Schedule 1 since no commercial export from this Schedule is or should be allowed at all. Schedules 4 , 5 and 6 contain reverse lists of species of plants and animals which may be imported or exported without a permit. These are species involved in primary industry and regulated by other legislation-for example, fisheries. Schedule 4 includes all species of marine fish, barramundi and marine invertebrates, such as mussels. </PARA>
<PARA> All native Australian species not on this Schedule require a permit to be exported. Conditions for export are similar to those in Schedule 2. None of these live animals, except freshwater fish or household pets, can be exported other than for research programs or inter-zoo transfers. Freshwater fish can be exported live if caught under an approved management program or bred in captivity and household pets can be taken out with the owner if they have been in the person's care for three years. Schedules 5 and 6 list animals which can be imported without a permit. Schedule 5 contains a list of domesticated animals well-established in Australia. I understand that Schedule 6 is comprised of species of freshwater and marine aquarium fish which may be imported into Australia without a permit under this Act but after meeting the provisions of the quarantine Act to ensure that they do not introduce disease or pests into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that an area of the Bill not included in the schedules deals with imports of animals for travelling circuses. In this case, as with zoos and scientific institutions, a prime consideration is the welfare of the animal in captivity, as it should be, and the prevention of its release into the Australian environment. Only species not listed in Schedules 1 and 2 are allowed to be imported with the circus. While dealing with the subject of animal welfare , I foreshadow an Opposition amendment to this Bill. Schedule 3 is designed to protect on welfare grounds. It includes whales and dolphins. In light of the brutal Canadian seal hunt, the harp and hooded seals should be placed on Schedule 3. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) issued a Press statement today stating that Australia will participate as an observer at the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas conference on the seal hunt. However, I think the Government must act now to put the seals in Schedule 3. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of points in this Bill might make it an effective piece of legislation . Most decisions on rejected permits will be appealed against through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The onus of proof is reversed in clause 53 (1) (b) in which a person possesses a specimen and knows or has reasonable grounds to know that it has been illegally imported. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, in its 1978 report on trafficking in fauna, stated that once a smuggler gets past the point of entry he or she is virtually impossible to bring to justice. This Bill will not cover interstate trade. But I note in clause 75 that the Minister can collect statistics on interstate as well as international trade. It is here we should consider the establishment of an office of traffic to monitor properly the CITES trade, the interstate trade and, if possible, the illicit trade. More staff in the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service would be needed to do this. Since there is no comparable office of traffic in the Western Pacific or South East Asian region it would serve an important function internationally to monitor the regional trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian wildlife fetches huge prices overseas. A breeding pair of golden- shouldered parrots in appendix 1 of CITES have been claimed to have been sold overseas for $30,000 while the sulphur-crested cockatoo fetches in the order of $1,000 to $1,500 in the United States of America. A pair of New Guinea's birdwing butterflies may fetch $1,000. In the past controls have been most ineffective. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is considered a major channel for illegal fauna smuggling yet convictions have been few and far between. In 1979 there were six prosecutions for 160 bird seizures. In 1980 there were three prosecutions for the seizure of 80 birds and 21 reptiles. In 1981 there were seven prosecutions for the seizure of 161 birds. Clearly, these successful prosecutions do not reflect the extent of the problem. From October 1979 to June 1980, 39,000 birds native to Australia were illegally imported into the United States, mainly through European countries. Assuming an 80 to 90 per cent mortality rate for illegally smuggled birds, between 100,000 and 200,000 must have left Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been allegations of a lack of co-operation between wildlife and Customs authorities hampering proper operation of the present regulations. The Government, I think, has been lax in investigating these allegations. I hope the situation will improve when this legislation is proclaimed. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill is a complicated piece of legislation which will require a major commitment in staff and funds if it is to be effective. Before it is proclaimed an information campaign should be established to inform citizens and relevant bodies of the requirements of Australia's legislation. If the public can be educated not to carry back products of endangered species, staff can be released to catch the more unsavoury individuals involved in the massive illegal trade. Success would also depend on co-operation between State and Federal wildlife authorities and Customs officers. </PARA>
<PARA> A Labor government will seek co-operation with the States to ensure that the Act, amended if the Labor Party sees it necessary, works efficiently. It will be important that the Government thoroughly examines overseas management programs before approving species to be collected to ensure the preservation of not only the population but also the habitat and that any collection is carried out in as humane a manner as possible. The Act should be proclaimed as soon as possible because under this Government there has been an inordinate delay in combating the cruel trade in endangered species and Australian wildlife and in the completion of this legislation. Now is the time to implement what this Government says it stands for without any undue delay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to support, with some qualifications which I will mention later, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill introduced by the Government to strengthen arrangements for the protection of Australia's animals and plants and world wildlife generally by improving the effectiveness of our import and export controls. I am sure we will all agree that the uniqueness, diversity and quantity of Australia's flora and fauna place a special responsibility on all of us in this Parliament to do our utmost to ensure that we avoid species becoming extinct. Regrettably, many species of our flora and fauna have become extinct in recent times. The causes, as the second reading speech by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment ( Mr McVeigh) suggests, include thoughtlessness, over-exploitation and simple lack of knowledge and understanding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Possibly the most devastating impact on wildlife has been the destruction of the natural habitat which for many species has made survival impossible. I believe Australia has traditionally set high standards of protection and in some respects we have provided world leadership. For example, I mention the particularly significant legislation that was achieved in 1980 with the enactment of the Whale Protection Act which prohibits the taking of cetaceans in Australian waters or by Australians elsewhere. At meetings of the International Whaling Commission Australia continues to play a most significant role in reducing the catch quotas and in arguing for a complete moratorium on harvesting . As the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) said, in 1973 Australia and about 70 other countries negotiated the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna. This arose, of course, from a world- wide concern about the adverse effects of unregulated trade on the world's wildlife. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to this new piece of legislation and its accompanying amendments. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill consolidates wildlife controls into a single Act. It will allow the Commonwealth more effectively to implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. A permit system will be used to impose conditions appropriate to the status of the species being traded. The Bill also provides for maximum penalties of $100,000 or five years imprisonment, plus forfeiture of goods and equipment involved in the case of individuals. The maximum penalty is $200,000 plus forfeiture in the case of organisations. I believe these penalties are appropriate to the high potential rewards involved and to the indications of organised criminal activity in wildlife trafficking. The possibility of a gaol sentence is a necessary deterrent, as illegal traffickers customarily offer to pay fines and all other expenses for couriers. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation in its 1976 inquiry of which I was a member-the Chairman was the honourable member for Petrie who is now the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges)-reported on the trafficking in fauna and the wildlife smuggling that occurs in remote areas of Australia. During our inquiry we found that the international smuggling of Australian native birds is a highly capitalised and organised activity involving land, sea and air operations and a network of contacts throughout Australia and overseas. It was a thriving commercial activity involving an annual turnover estimated then by some to exceed $2m and by others to be several times that figure. The involvement of light aircraft and ocean-going yachts is an indication of the extent of the huge profits available. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's strict controls over the export of fauna and the existence of many unique native species have created a demand overseas and a strong incentive to smuggle. The range of profitable smuggling lines is extensive, ranging from rare species to common varieties of birds and reptiles. Australian birds, especially parrots, are the most popular item in demand overseas. Conservative estimates of the prices of Australian parrots on the overseas markets during the year in which we made our inquiry ranged from $100 a pair for crimson rosellas to $3,000 a pair for the rare golden-shouldered parrot. Evidence was given to the Committee that the current value of a matched breeding pair of golden-shouldered parrots ranged from $8,000 to $10,000. Other witnesses representing the Bureau of Customs referred to a prosecution of couriers for attempting to smuggle out of this country 14 parrots concealed in an overcoat. These birds had an estimated retail value in Europe of $27,000. The total fines imposed amounted to only $1,740. Allowing for a casualty rate in the birds being smuggled of 50 per cent or even more this attempt, had it been successful, would have resulted in a considerable profit and was well worth the risk to the smugglers. </PARA>
<PARA> Resulting from the widespread inquiry that the House of Representatives Committee carried out, many recommendations were made in relation to the relaxation of import controls. Criticism was constantly made during the course of our inquiry that restrictions on the export of Australian fauna since 1959 had been responsible for the increase in demand for our wildlife overseas. These have created the climate for commercial exploitation and smuggling as it exists today. Arguments were advanced by witnesses in favour of the relaxation of Australia's export controls, indicating that the present export policy does not discriminate between rare and endangered species of fauna or common or pest species. Species considered as pests are given the same export protection as the rare and endangered ones, hence the absurd situation of smugglers earning large sums of money abroad for fauna which is being destroyed daily in Australia because it is a pest. The honourable member for Cunningham cited the case of the sulphur crested cockatoo which is bringing $1,000 per bird in New York. Many primary producers in the west Wimmera area of my electorate would be prepared to send millions of sulphur crested cockatoos to New York for nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> Various institutions overseas are able to breed rare species of marsupials in captivity. The success in New York of breeding the platypus before it was achieved in Australia is an interesting illustration. Thus to allow exports of these species may help the survival of that species. Some aviculturalists consider that certain species of birds, although rare and endangered in the wild , have been so successfully bred as aviary birds that they are now common in captivity and should therefore be available from aviary stocks to aviculturalists overseas. The relaxation of export controls for common or pest species would allow authorities to concentrate their efforts on the conservation of a considerably smaller number of species. Australian Government fauna export control policies are stricter than those of any other national government and go further than is required by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora to which Australia is a signatory. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, many witnesses in the course of our inquiry argued that Australia's strict export regulations should be retained. The main arguments placed before the Committee were that, regardless of any relaxation of the existing policy to permit the export of common or pest species, there would always remain a demand for rare and endangered species and the situation would be virtually unchanged. It was argued that restricted export of a limited number of species would establish the principle, that Australian native fauna was a commercial commodity and that pressure would develop for the quota of individual species and for the number of species approved for export to be increased. The profit motive for the export activity would ensure that this pressure was maintained, thus distracting officers from more important work. It was also argued by witnesses opposed to opening up the export markets for Australian fauna that although government would control the quantity of fauna exported and its destination, it had no power over the scale of demand. </PARA>
<PARA> In weighing up the evidence we heard, the Committee recommended that the export policy be relaxed to allow government-controlled export to individuals and institutions of all common aviary-bred birds, of uncommon aviary-bred birds which are ringed or banded and registered with a State fauna authority, or for wild, trapped, common and pest species of birds provided that, firstly, such birds were trapped under the control of a State fauna authority and, secondly, that harvesting was based on sound conservation practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I support this Bill, believing that it will achieve our aim to develop legislation reinforcing other Government measures to conserve Australian flora and fauna and to ensure that international trade threatening wildlife is responsibly controlled. However, I believe that the Bill could have gone further . We have to expect that from time to time some of our wildlife-even our unique wildlife-can assume pest proportions and must be controlled according to appropriate and sound conservation principles. It always interests me that in places such as this Parliament we can accept and project family planning programs, and even sometimes more radical means of controlling human population growth, but whenever we suggest a means of controlling some of our wildlife all hell breaks loose. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if we do not adequately harvest and control some of our wildlife , some of our unique species, we may even threaten their extinction, particularly at times when they assume plague proportions. Two excellent examples of this at present, even in my electorate, are certain species of kangaroo and some common species of birds, such as long billed corellas and sulphur crested cockatoos. In the north of my electorate kangaroos are presently destroying drought affected crops and encroaching on farmland. They themselves will be faced by starvation and death unless there is some control and suitable management techniques are employed. In the south of my electorate, throughout the Wimmera, as I have already mentioned, corellas and cockatoos are devastating , with a very heavy financial loss, many cereal crops and pastures. There are huge flocks of suphur crested cockatoos in the west Wimmera in my electorate. One farmer west of the Grampians area has estimated that some 7,500 long billed corellas and sulphur crested cockatoos are invading his property. I understand that two employees are firing some $30 worth of ammunition every day in an attempt to save 320 hectares of crops sown this season. Even so, the birds have already taken a quarter of that crop. This places these farmers in an intolerable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government, unfortunately, has failed to respond satisfactorily to farmers' requests for help. Some have asked for permission to poison troublesome birds. Surely it would be preferable to commercialise the species and have the State fauna authority mount a trapping program. It would reduce flock numbers and at the same time earn overseas income for Australia. I am deeply conscious of the need to protect Australia's unique and endangered wildlife, but urgent action has to be taken against such species as sulphur crested cockatoos which are now costing farmers many thousands of dollars in crop loss and inconvenience. Both the present and former Victorian governments have procrastinated on this problem for years. Research is about to begin in Victoria to produce a cockatoo repellant, a chemical, that may be available in a couple of years. This legislation, however, will allow limited and controlled exports but, as I said earlier, I believe it could have gone further. I accept that the suggestions I have put forward would not overcome the very real problem we have, but they may have alleviated it. They may have helped Australia to gain export income. They would, I believe have satisfied a demand overseas and would have allowed our wildlife authorities to concentrate their efforts in ensuring that our endangered species are not threatened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to support the Wildlife Protection ( Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill and the amendment moved by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) I recognise that this Bill consolidates in one piece of legislation what has previously been covered by several Acts. It is no doubt a tidier arrangement and as such is to be applauded . I wish to say how surprised I was by the speech of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher). It was eminently sensible. It is regrettable that the Government did not take this opportunity to rethink this whole question of fauna management. It should be recognised that the export of live fauna has never endangered a single species. In fact some have been saved from extinction. An example is the Per David deer, whose natural habitat has been destroyed but which happily thrives in Europe where it was taken earlier this century. There are birds and other animals in the same situation. Sadly, the exploitation of animal products has wiped out or seriously threatened many species. Today in Australia kangaroos are shot for pet meat yet it has not been possible to export a live kangaroo on a commercial basis since 1 January 1960, despite the fact that live kangaroos are worth far more than carcasses. Apparently a live kangaroo exported depletes our fauna yet a dead one does not. Frankly, I do not understand this phenomenon and I wonder whether the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to our fauna management, this Bill is philosophically negative and defeatist. In respect of Australia's fauna exports it is not a commitment to international agreements; rather it is the result of the Government's overreaction to an emotive campaign conducted by ill-informed city based conservation groups. It arose primarily out of a justified outrage at the appalling conditions under which marsupials were shipped from Victoria in 1958. Never considered at the time was the highly efficient trade conducted from South Australia where the main shippers carried their own insurance and guaranteed live delivery. The Government's response was a total ban on all exports of fauna on a commercial basis as from 1 January 1960. In the peak year of 1959 fewer than 7,000 kangaroos were shipped, mainly to the United States of America for zoological gardens and private collections. That many are destroyed every week to feed dogs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the ridiculous situation in which we now find ourselves, where we simultaneously ban exports of all our birds and animals yet declare some of them to be vermin and kill them in great numbers. Due to the expansion of the wheat industry we have provided a source of food unknown to cockatoos in previous years. At the same time we have removed many of the trees in which they nest. So they now have abundant food and have multiplied, wreaking havoc on wheat crops and utilising existing trees to a far greater degree. One of the habits of these birds is to ringbark the gums in which they raise their young. The resultant hard, smooth but dead surface is good for deterring predators such as goannas and cats but not very good for the trees. </PARA>
<PARA> All this is happening at a time when we are starting to consider the importance of trees in our efforts to combat salting of our agricultural land. Nature in all its ferocity can and does wipe out vast numbers of birds. Sometimes they are trapped in water holes that dry up or are caught in fires that either kill them directly or destroy their environment. I have seen 20,000 gallon tanks full of dead budgerigars which have drowned as they have desperately sought to obtain a drink. Twenty thousand gallons of budgerigar soup contains more budgies than we could export in many years. This happens again and again in our hinterlands. They are simultaneously dry and lush, kind and cruel-and always capricious. Developments such as that on the Ord River have produced hundreds of miles of permanent fresh water where finches thrive, but where they cannot be trapped, for it is the nature of the trade that they cannot be commercially netted adjacent to large expanses of water. While we enhance their breeding grounds and make it impossible to trap them, we simultaneously poison them. They are killed in great numbers in the most indiscriminate manner to protect the experimental sorghum harvest on the Ord River farms. I ask the House whether this is what is meant by management. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister laments the cruelty of bird smuggling. He is correct; it is a heartless and ruthless business, offering a greater reward than drug smuggling yet lacking the social approbation of the former. The rewards are such and the chances of getting caught so slim that the new penalties will not stamp it out; they will simply drive up the prices in response to the market, a process that I am convinced few members of the Government understand. The Minister should recognise that it is this very embargo on exports that has made the smuggling industry so viable. Prior to 1959 there was a general recognition of the protected list and trappers themselves tended to enforce it. Self-regulation has gone and it is self-deception to believe that the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has the necessary money, or even the expertise, to stop smuggling. Under this Bill rare species such as Alexanders, Princess Regents or golden shoulder parrots may be smuggled as well as cockatoos or Red Rumpts. The Naretha parrot is almost identical to the Blue Bonnet but much rarer and infinitely more valuable. The penalty in either case is the same. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been presented with the spurious argument that we must stop the sale of all Schedule 2 classifications, that is, animals not considered rare, because the Department says it cannot be sure what environment these animals may end up in. A review of the situation prior to 1959 showed that zoos and collectors constituted the overwhelming market for fauna. Birds went to fanciers, and cockatoos and budgerigars went generally to the same market that we cater for locally where they are usually well cared for. A controlled industry that kept up its prices could ensure the well being of all animals sold. What should be done? We should recognise that the easy emotional response of passing legislation such as this and abhorring all nasty facts is simply not enough. Conservation can be enhanced by proper management of our national parks which are currently a disgrace and, in many cases, merely shaded areas on maps. Conservation and tourism are not incompatible. Both need far more money than they have received. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1959 the export trade in fauna, which included feral ostriches and camels, was worth #1.5m to South Australia. It is worth noting that we used to compete successfully with South Africa for the sale of ostriches. Our camels were in demand due to the freedom from foot and mouth disease in Australia. This trade is useful but is not viable in isolation. Conservatively, a rigorous government- controlled export industry could net $30m a year in export income from which the Government could take half for the development of parks and the enhancement of our fabulous natural heritage. I have an Aboriginal group in my electorate which is a world leader in its endeavours to commercialise emus. The emu, which is a valuable commodity, returns something close to $100 gross a year. This is far more than will be returned by sheep or cattle. The emu is able to survive in much worse conditions. The industry is hampered by a variety of export regulations such as those relating to the selling of spare emu eggs which can be a useful addition to the overall economy. In times of hardship it would be very beneficial to pastoralists to be able to obtain licences for the export of some of the cockatoos, galahs and other common parrots that abound in that area. I hope that a more rational policy can be developed. I will be working towards this end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Government for introducing the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill to protect our native flora and fauna. It is very heartening to see a bipartisan approach to this Bill being adopted from both sides of the House. This measure is obviously not something that any of us in this place would want to see involved in the day to day political battles that sometimes occur. It is very heartening to see both sides of the House agreeing on the measures that should be taken and agreeing to support this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With hindsight on our side we can all agree that there is a need to take action that will protect some of the unique species of fauna that we have in Australia. Irresponsible management and actions that have been taken in the past have caused the extinction of some of our very distinctive and unique fauna in this country. The one that comes to mind is the Tasmanian Tiger. It was a unique animal in its time. Due to its irresponsible shooting we are now spending thousands of dollars trying to find whether there are any remaining live species . Perhaps better management 100 or 50 years ago would have protected that animal so that we would still have it available to add to the uniqueness of our fauna in this country. Thankfully we have developed in our maturity in this country to the point where we now realise the uniqueness of our fauna. We realise that we need to protect our native species so that they can be carried on as a heritage for future generations. This Bill is part of that process. I am delighted that it is going to be uniformly supported by all sides of the House. I trust that it will be given the same treatment when it reaches the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which has become quite apparent not only in the debate here tonight but also with other media publicity that has been given in recent times, is that trafficking in species of Australian fauna is world wide; it is a very lucrative and also illegal traffic. We need to concentrate our minds on that particular issue. Other honourable members who have spoken in this debate have named some of the species that are being sold illegally in other parts of the world. They have referred to the very lucrative trade and the high prices that are being brought for species, some of which are quite widely available and in fact in some parts of Australia are even in plague proportions. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3F4">Mr BURR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member interjects and says: 'The galah'. The galahs or the cockatoos are almost in plague proportions in this country and yet in other parts of the world they bring high prices on the illegal market. What concerns me most, and should concern other members of this House, is that that trade is part of a world wide network of organised crime. It is not something that happens in isolation in certain instances; it is part of a world wide organised crime network. We need to recognise that point. What we have in Australia is not simply a culling of some species that we might think are a pest or a nuisance or in plague proportions-it is nice to get rid of a few of these species-but an organised crime network that is world wide, very extensive and very lucrative. I do not think that we, in Australia, quite apart from the need to protect some of our unique species of fauna, can tolerate such an organised crime network operating in this country. The fact that it exists is beyond dispute, but that is no reason why we should close our eyes to it or pretend that it does not exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do have widespread organised crime operating in Australia that is part of a world wide network. The trade in illicit fauna is just part of the activities. The fact too that that section of organised crime is assisted in this country by people who hold official positions in my view is also beyond dispute. Actions are being taken on this matter at the moment. I congratulate the Government for conducting investigations into such august bodies as the Bureau of Customs and other Customs personnel. With the co-operation of the States we also have established a crimes commission. These are all the embryo stages of trying to identify within our institutional bodies in this country where help is being provided for that world wide network of organised crime. It is a start, but at this stage we are only scratching the surface. I congratulate both the Federal Government and the State governments for at least recognising the problem and starting on a process of co-operation to try to eliminate it for the benefit of this country. I think that in the case of the illicit trade in fauna we have to look beyond the shores of Australia. The fact that these species can be collected in Australia is one aspect but there must also be an organised network throughout the world that distributes these birds and animals and also collects money in payment for them. If we are properly to control or to eradicate that illegal trade, it is obvious that we need to have the co-operation of other countries around the world. Some of those countries we might term well educated Western countries, but also in some of the less developed countries in the world actions need to be taken. I note that the Australian Government is working in co -operation with various international bodies to try to have regulations brought in on a world-wide basis that will provide some form of control. I urge the Government to continue its efforts at that international level. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice also that this Bill provides some quite severe penalties. I think that the penalties that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) has outlined are appropriate to the nature of the organised crime that we are facing and also to the volume of money that obviously flows through this illegal trade. The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) mentioned in his contribution that this could be measured as about $40m per year. We are talking about a lot of money so the deterrents must be appropriate to the profits that can be made. The Bill provides for a maximum penalty for an individual of $100, 000 or five years imprisonment and in the case of organisations a maximum fine of $200,000. I would not consider that those penalties are punitive; I would consider that they are appropriate to the trade that is operating and the profits that are being made. I also note-and I think the Government has been quite responsible in this respect-that we are not prohibiting by this legislation the export of all flora and fauna. There will be permissible exports of our species for bona fide zoological and scientific purposes. I think that is quite appropriate. We want people in other parts of the world to be able to observe and to study our unique flora and fauna. The Bill provides appropriate measures by which this can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that I make before I close my contribution to the debate is this: I note that the Minister in his second reading speech mentioned that the Bill also takes account of certain areas of the Great Barrier Reef. The Minister noted in his second reading speech that three sections of the Great Barrier Reef Marine National Park have now been declared and, in those declared areas, protection can be provided for the marine species. That is fine, but what about the rest of the Great Barrier Reef? The Great Barrier Reef is unique and the species which live in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef are also unique. I do not think that we can possibly select certain areas such as the Capricornia or the Cairns sections of the Great Barrier Reef and say that this section of the reef and the species that live on the reef there are unique and must be protected and not provide similar protection for the other sections of the Reef and the species that live in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that work is being done by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and by the Commonwealth and Queensland governments to have other sections of the reef declared marine national parks as soon as possible. I suggest to the Government that the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef be declared a protected area while the detailed work can be undertaken in order to declare marine national parks in the remaining areas. Declaring protected areas will give some protection to the reef and to the species in those undeclared areas. I congratulate the Government for introducing this Bill. It has my wholehearted support. I am delighted that it will not be contested in this place as it will be supported by both the Opposition and the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also welcome the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill and I commend the Government for introducing it. It is good to see that there is bipartisanship in regard to this legislation. We will move an amendment later, but the general thrust of the Bill has our complete support. I have looked forward to the day when a Bill of this nature was introduced into the House. I was very fortunate to serve my party as shadow Minister for the environment for three years. It gave me the opportunity to learn a great deal more about the problems of endangered species both here and overseas. I am very grateful for the period that I served as shadow Minister because it opened up a whole new world to me. I was in favour of conservation but I did not do the specific reading and study one ought to do and that one just does not bother to do until one has the responsibility of looking after legislation in this area. That responsibility took me to many parts of Australia and to parts of the world where I had the opportunity to visit wildlife game parks and to read about and study the problems of conservation throughout the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight most of the debate has been about the preservation of Australian flora and fauna. Of course I support that concept totally but I wish to deal specifically with some of the problems of species outside Australia in relation to the general world wildlife scene. Before I do that, I mention the previous speaker. I agree with him completely; if we had had conservation measures years ago, the Tasmanian tiger would have survived. Of course, had it not been for President Hoover who lived out here for some years in the latter part of the last century and who developed an affection for the Australian koala, it is likely that there would probably be no koalas in Australia. It was President Hoover in the 1930s who banned the import of koala fur by the United States and thus ended the devastation of Australian koalas. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I wish to talk about species from outside Australia because we have a very important role to play in not only preserving our own wildlife but also preserving the wildlife of the rest of the world. I was fortunate-some would say 'fortunate' and some would say 'unfortunate'-to return recently from a visit as a member of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Africa. Quite frankly, as most people know we were lucky to get back. An excellent group of people went, including the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) whom I notice is in the House tonight. But I was surprised and somewhat shocked to find on my trip from Zimbabwe to Zambia in the journal of Air Zimbabwe, which was in the back of the airline seat, an advertisement headed 'Hunters Safaris'. The advertisement announced a 21-day tour of Zimbabwe at $550 a day, approved by the Zimbabwe Tourist Board, to shoot certain animals. I shall read the list of animals in that advertisement. They were: One leopard, one buffalo, one hippopotamus, one eland, one giraffe, one sable antelope, one crocodile, one water-buck, one zebra , one wildebeest-that is a gnu-two kudu, one reebok, one bush-buck, one tseebe, two cyvet cats, one wild pig, two warthogs, one impala, one serval, one honey badger, one duiker, one steenbok, one grysbok, one gennet, one jackal, one baboon, and one elephant. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who have taken the time to study the Schedule provided by the Government will have noted that a number of these species are listed on Schedules 1 and 2 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Among the animals listed in Schedule 1 as endangered and not permitted to be imported into Australia are the leopard, the sable antelope and the crocodile. Schedule 2 lists certain species of zebra, the baboon and the elephant. I am appalled to think that a newly-emerging country such as Zimbabwe, which has done so many excellent things since it has been independent, is allowing people to slaughter its wildlife in this way, particularly those endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA> There are reasons for killing animals. If a person has to kill for food to live it is justifiable. If it is for self-defence it is equally justifiable. In many countries, including Australia, it is justifiable to cull animals so that the species does not endanger itself and other species and to keep the number of animals within manageable figures. However, I find it quite fascinating that some people kill for sport. I think that they are sick beyond belief. It leaves me completely bewildered that anybody would want to shoot animals just for fun. </PARA>
<PARA> I went with the honourable member for Hume to one of the wildlife parks overseas. We drove around in a Kombi van and were able to get within six or eight feet of lions, cheetahs, elephants and a whole range of other animals. I was able to get as close as humanly possible to photograph them. If I had had a gun I would have had no trouble in blowing out their brains, but what would have been the skill, the pleasure or the sport in doing that? I have some correspondence from the Safari Club International defending the right of sportsmen to blow beautiful animals to pieces. I would like to see us abolish all forms of hunting, unless it is for the reasons I have given. I have absolutely no sympathy for those who kill for sport. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's standing in Africa is extremely high. It probably comes as no surprise to people to hear that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is more popular in Africa than he is here. For a whole range of reasons, we have a high standing in Africa and I think that we can use our influence with the presidents and governments of countries such as Zambia and Zimbabwe which allow these neurotic people to slaughter their wildlife. In recent years a lot has been written about this matter. It goes to show that the preservation of wildlife is worth more to a country in the long term than the short term benefits from the sick trophy hunters of the world. Many countries-Kenya, for instance-have forbidden all forms of shooting for that purpose. As I have said, I think one can get an enormous thrill from getting close to these magnificent animals with a camera and photographing them. If I could, I would be delighted to incorporate in Hansard some of the photographs of animals which I showed to officers of the Minister's Department today. I am sure that many people in Australia would agree with me on that. Let us hope that this Bill succeeds in stopping imports of certain specimens into this country. The absurd argument that people often put up is that they should be able to bring in specimens-the ivory and the skins- because, after all, the animal is dead. The logic of that argument escapes me. What will happen if one keeps buying the specimens is that people will continue to kill animals to provide those specimens. We in Australia have as much responsibility to preserve the wildlife of the rest of the world as we have to preserve our own wildlife. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now deal with something that is related to my electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast of New South Wales. I have a small problem in that the correspondence I want to quote from is rather lengthy and I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House on it. Perhaps I should try to summarise it . The Central Coast has an excellent man-made attraction known as Eric Worrell's Australian Reptile Park. It is one of the three or four excellent attractions on the Central Coast which help to bring hundreds of thousands of visitors to the area. Another attraction is Old Sydney Town. Mr Eric Worrell, a well known naturalist, set up this park some 20-odd years ago to do two things: Firstly, to provide a high quality reptile zoo for recreation and education purposes for the local community and the tourist trade and, secondly, to provide raw venoms to various scientific institutions within Australia and throughout the rest of the world. He has succeeded. It has been a long, hard battle. I am not saying that Mr Worrell did this purely out of altruism. He had a business. But the benefits to our community have been considerable. Large numbers of people come to the Central Coast to see the reptile park. It is famous throughout Australia. Thousands of school children visit it and university students study there. He has one of the largest, if not the largest, collections of snakes in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years he has had considerable trouble in importing certain species. For reasons which I have found difficult to ascertain, he has been constantly stopped by Government departments-quarantine authorities primarily-from bringing them in. I think the Minister is off the hook here. In December of last year I wrote a very lengthy letter-four pages-to the then Minister for Health, who is in charge of quarantine, setting out the whole history of Mr Worrell's background, the problems he was having with the Department and the barriers that existed regarding importing certain types of snakes for breeding purposes and ultimately for their venom. On 19 January I received a letter of acknowledgement from the Acting Minister for Health, Senator Peter Baume. On 22 January I forwarded further correspondence to the Minister with some further evidence backing up the case that I put. The period from 14 December to 18 August is, I think, a more than reasonable period to receive some sort of answer other than an acknowledgment. It is unfair, both to me and to Mr Worrell, that I have not had a proper reply from the Minister. It was suggested, off the record, that the reason Mr Worrell was not allowed to import these snakes was that the venom could now be obtained in a frozen form imported from overseas. I will quote in full a letter from Dr Struan Sutherland, a famous Australian. He states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Cohen,</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Eric Worrell has asked me to write to you in regard to the supply of exotic snake venoms for research purposes. For many years Mr Worrell has played a key role in the development of antivenoms and an essential part of this has been the provision of venoms of the very highest quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Several years ago he responded to our request for venom from both the Indian Cobra and the American Rattle snake. Using these venoms obtained from snakes held by Mr. Worrell, work was undertaken which has significantly altered the recommended first aid for snakebite both in America and India. In the lattter country over 10,000 people die per year from Indian Cobra bites, and hence the use of this new type of first aid is of considerable significance. </PARA>
<PARA> I enclose two recent publications which describe the work undertaken using Mr Worrell's venom. Other venoms which have been obtained from Mr Worrell include the King Cobra venom and currently he is providing Malaysian Pit Viper venom for anti-venom production. </PARA>
<PARA> When we obtain venom from Mr Worrell, we can be certain not only of the purity and quality of the venom but we know it has come from correctly identified snakes. </PARA>
<PARA> Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any further information. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, Struan Sutherland</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Sutherland is a very famous Australian. He is probably the foremost expert in this field in Australia and he is involved in some sort of controversy with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratory. The point that the Department appeared to want to make was that if Mr Worrell got orders for venom then he could import the snakes . This is a bit of a catch-22 situation. He does not get orders until they know he has the snakes here. This venom is not wanted often but it is wanted by scientists in a whole range of disciplines who use snake venom. Interestingly enough some of it is used for heart research. I have a list of dozens of requests of that nature from people who want only the quality venom that Mr Worrell can provide. I only hope that this new legislation will clear up the uncertainty that has prevailed with regard to the Australian Reptile Park over many years. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Mr Worrell does a wonderful job for science and for the Australian community. Incidentally, for those honourable members who may not be aware, it was Mr Worrell who provided the venom for funnel web spider research that enabled Dr Sutherland to finally make the breakthrough that produced a funnel web antivenine. That is one of the many contributions that Eric Worrell has made . It is important not only to science but also of course, to our own community. Finally I hope this matter can be cleared up. I congratulate the Government once again on this legislation. I hope that it achieves all the things that it sets out to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the motives which the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) has in introducing the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill and which honourable members have in supporting it are of the highest order and are most laudable in their desire to protect Australian native animals, birds and flora. I am sure that we are all proud of our unique fauna and flora which we all know from our various travels throughout this very large continent. I am sure too that one of the worst things that we have done for Australian native fauna and flora is to introduce the rabbit, the fox, the cat and the pig. The depredations they have made on the habitat and the lives of our fauna are incalculable. That situation is something we can only regret and which, of course, this Bill does nothing to redress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think this Bill is wrong-headed and misdirected. I think it will perpetuate the very thing it is trying to diminish both inside and outside this country. There are many contradictions in the Bill and many contradictions among those honourable members who suppport it. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen), for instance, who just resumed his seat is decrying the fact that a constituent of his is unable to import reptiles. If this Bill were promoted by governments in other parts of the world from which he would want to import these reptiles, then he would be prohibited from doing so. There is a contradiction in the support that the honourable member for Robertson gives this Bill. He is supporting the very types of restrictions which he then decries as they affect his constituent. I do not say that in any personal, antagonistic way. I only draw that inconsistency to the honourable member's attention in support of my contention that this Bill is very wrongly directed. In supporting the general laudable motives I have mentioned, I point out that of course the Minister outlined this matter in a very high-minded way when he introduced the Bill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to strengthen arrangements for the protection of Australia's animals and plants, and world wildlife generally, by improving the effectiveness of our import and export controls. </PARA>
<PARA> The uniqueness of Australia's flora and fauna places a special responsibility on all of us-</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure it is a responsibility we all accept. Obviously it is a responsibility we would accept in different ways. The Minister goes on to make comment that, of course, tends to negate his own argument because he is continuing the present system. It is a system which is described in his own statement as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the efforts of nations upholding the provisions of international conventions, there is a flourishing illicit trade in wildlife. </PARA>
<PARA>It is this system which we are perpetuating which has brought about this flourishing trade in wildlife. I see little sense in simply increasing the penalties and continuing the same system. The increase in penalties will do nothing to stop this trade. It will simply make it more expert and bigger business and more in the control of the criminal element in this community. One can ask why this wildlife is scarce. It is scarce on the world market because of this Bill. The Bill is very much a prohibitive Bill. It has been loosely said that the Minister can issue permits at his discretion for the export of Australian fauna. If one looks at the restrictions it will be found that they are very wide and all embracing. It is not right simply in defence of this Bill to say that the Minister has the discretion. I think that on very few occasions indeed will the Minister use the special permit provisions which are so strewn with impediments as far as their use is concerned. For instance clause 23 of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . may make an application to the Minister for the grant of-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a permit to export a specimen . . . prohibited by section 21. </PARA>
<PARA>We go on and find in further clauses that other sections apply. For instance clause 28 states:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) where the specimen is a live native Australian animal, that the proposed export-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) would be an interzoological gardens transfer; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) is for the purposes of scientific research;</PARA>
<PARA>That provision relates to Schedule 1. Clause 29 under Schedule 2 provides:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the proposed exporter and the proposed recipient are approved institutions in relation to a class of specimens that includes that live animal; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in the case of a live native Australian animal, the proposed export would be an export of a household pet in accordance with section 16. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 16 is a laugh. I do not know how many honourable members have read it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Export of household pets</PARA>
<PARA> 16. The export of a live native Australian animal from Australia or from an external Territory is an export of a household pet in accordance with this section if-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the animal is an animal of a species specified in Schedule 7. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at Schedule 7. This demonstrates how wide the description of a household pet is. It includes a sulphur-crested cockatoo, a galah and a budgerigar. That is very wide. We can export dead kangaroos but we cannot export a live one if it is a pet. We can export three categories of bird, but not easily. A person must have owned and kept the bird for three years. I wonder whether these birds live for three years. The owner must have been a resident for four years immediately preceding the export and he must be leaving Australia for good. He cannot look at coming back. So he could not take the bird for a year or two. He would have to look at permanently getting out of the country and taking the three categories of bird with him. Of course, it is only possible to take one category because clause 16 (e) in relation to the export of these categories states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not proposed to export any animal of that species that has been kept as a household pet by the exporter or the members of the household of the exporter other than that animal or that animal and one other animal of that species. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose under this provision one would be allowed to take two, for whatever reason that may be. But what a nonsense bureaucracy is becoming when we are going to vote in this House on the restrictions placed on people taking a pet with them overseas. We are restricting them to three common types of birds which are destroyed in their millions around Australia yearly. I do not think that is helping any vision of a co-operative system of government in any way as it affects the Australian community. I mentioned the matter of the zoological requirement in relation to the problem of the honourable member for Robertson. I find this to be a very restrictive intention in clause 12. The explanatory notes which the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided state:</PARA>
<PARA> The relevant criteria will be in accordance with Commonwealth policy and requirements as exist at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The criteria for approval under the regulations will include that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the zoo is owned or controlled by a government or learned zoological society;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) breeding or public exhibition is the major function;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the zoo is primarily non-commercial and non-profit making; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the zoo does not engage in commercial trade in fauna other than captive bred animals. </PARA>
<PARA>The export under this so-called permit system is to be restricted to government- owned zoos. I repeat that the explanatory notes state:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . controlled by a government or learned zoological society;</PARA>
<PARA>It is not quite as severe as that but it is very close to it; it is a restriction to officially approved zoos. Any thought that private zoos can have our fauna under a permit system is gone. Why is that? Why is it that private zoos, which can be inspected and approved by our Customs officers overseas, are to be denied this right? They will be denied it because we have, as previous speakers have said, a non-discriminatory approach to pest and rare birds alike. I believe these lists have been-I will not say carelessly drawn up; I suppose a great deal of care has been put into them-rather foolishly drawn up. In the schedules we find native birds, rare birds and pest birds mixed with overseas birds. We have mixed the import and export categories. Of course, one has to be a naturalist to be able to read the schedules sensibly. It is a nonsense for most of us in this House to interpret species by species the meaning of these schedules. I think it is a discredit to those who drew up the Bill that they should mix the categories in that fashion. There ought to be a separate schedule list to separate those various categories simply so that the public can read this Bill and understand it. We have the assistance of draftsmen, counsel and so on. It is a disservice to members of the public whom we are trying to protect that we should provide a very complex schedule for them to study. I believe that not only have we been non-discriminatory but also we have used emotional approaches, citing the extinction of previously existing species or rare birds and mixing with them the pest varieties which exist in this community. </PARA>
<PARA> We have, of course, annual duck slaughters in Australia. People can get together and have a good binge a few hours before the bell rings and then slaughter ducks in their hundreds and thousands throught Australia. That is accepted, but we cannot export them. We cannot ask a duck whether he would like to be exported rather than shot but that is the comparison we make. That is the nonsense we accept. I have heard it said by an authority that we have had in South Australia for some years the slaughter, quite legally, of a quarter of a million kangaroos. We can export them dead for pet food or game meat-I think they go to Germany-but we cannot export them live. </PARA>

<PARA> The honourable member for Cunningham is not in a totally unanimous position. Certainly not tonight is he in a unanimous position. His colleagues sitting behind him simply do not agree with him, nor do they agree with the inconsistencies of the honourable member for Robertson. The Committee made a recommendation. The Committee made a greater study of this matter than the honourable members sitting opposite tonight who speak so lightly of a punitive situation which will force more cruelty on to the wildlife and the fauna of Australia. They will stand quietly. This Bill will be responsible for a far greater emphasis on export trapping and the illegal export of our fauna. Penalties will not stop this trade. There are penalties in the world such as capital punishment which do not stop the drug trade. There are people in Australia who will kill for crime's sake. These penalties will not inhibit those types of people from continuing and expanding a trade which cannot be held by punitive action when there are 10,000 kilometres of coast across the northern part of Australia. If honourable members in this place think that by upping the penalties and putting two or three more boats in the water they can stop the trade they are very innocent of the geographical factors or the way human nature works. The colleagues of the honourable member for Cunningham agreed on this report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the export policy be relaxed to allow government controlled export to individuals and institutions of all common aviary bred birds uncommon aviary bred birds which are ringed or banded and registered with a State fauna authority wild trapped common and pest species of birds provided that</PARA>

<PARA> (b) harvesting is based on sound conservation principles;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) (a) the export policy be relaxed to allow government controlled export of mammals and reptiles to acceptable overseas recipients; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the category of acceptable overseas recipients be considerably widened to include approved private zoos and parks, whether run for profit or not</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am regretting that the Bill will pass in all its innocence because it does not address the problem at all. The problem will be met only by destroying the market and the market will be destroyed by a regular and enlarged supply of birds which are in pest proportions in Australia but which are so valuable overseas. This Bill creates the market. That point was clearly made by this Committee which reported after it, I believe, ably examined the subject. We are creating the market by passing this Bill. We are creating a market which creates cruelty in very large proportions in the export of these birds. We stand responsible for simply failing to attack the root cause of the problem. Any economist, any realist and anyone involved in the trade can tell us that the problem is that there is not the supply to meet the demand. The rewards, therefore, for meeting that demand are sufficient to create the illegal trade based on cruelty and disregard for the future of our fauna.</PARA></TALK.START>

I could not vote against this Bill. What would be the use when innocents abroad, such as the honourable member for Cunningham, rush in to support it and when the honourable member for Robertson, with all his inconsistencies, can regret the application of that type of clause in the Bill but still support it?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, along with colleagues on this side of the House, support this rather belated Bill-the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill. I really believe that the way in which this Government has dragged its feet in coming to grips with the problem of the illicit trade in wildlife which has been growing in monstrous proportions in and out of this country is to be deeply regretted. The speech of the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) which I have just heard really reflects the strange conflict that can exist in the minds of some of the Government members. I am not surprised that it has taken so long for the Bill to be introduced. I would like to point out that it is the Government that is introducing this Bill and not the Opposition, although the Opposition wishes to make an amendment to the Bill to expand its provisions. It is mainly along those lines that I wish to speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill, of course, now spells out exactly what can and cannot be exported. This is a point which I think has been overlooked in the speech that was just made. One may now apply for a permit and know precisely where one stands; this has to be a step forward. Rather than dwelling on the tardiness of this Government I must say, however, that the task before the Parliament now is to ensure that this Bill encompasses the sorts of provisions that most Australians would like to see. I think there can be little doubt that we are all concerned that possibly our most valuable heritage-the Australian wildlife-is being pilfered and plundered at an alarming rate. Not only does the trade in wildlife endanger the very existence of some of our most valuable species, but also the suffering that these animals must endure-those that actually live through it all -should not be allowed to continue in a humane society such as ours. </PARA>
<PARA> Insomuch as the Bill represents a tightening up of export and import procedures and insomuch as it substantially increases penalties associated with the control of the fauna trade the Bill is to be commended. But tonight I want to argue that the amendment of Schedule 3 proposed by the Opposition be carried by all honourable members. I argue that to do otherwise would be to abrogate our responsibility as representatives of the people of Australia. For it is without doubt that the Australian people spoke as one in the cry of outrage when exposed to publicity earlier this year about the annual slaughter of the baby Canadian harp seals. I think it is our duty to respond to that outcry and to move to include this species amongst those already named in this legislation. The inclusion of Schedule 3 of this Bill so that importation of harp seal products will be disallowed along with whale and dolphin products is not only the moral duty of all honourable members but also their democratic duty. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context I can speak from my own experience as member for the Lilley electorate. Although a few of the print media reports of the inane slaughter had filtered through to the Australian consciousness the catalyst which sparked off the immense reaction from Brisbane people to the baby seal carnage was a television documentary showing its stark reality screened one week night. I think it was really enlightening to see how people can react once they see what is the end result of actions by governments or actions taken in Houses such as this. In fact, I would like to see such a process carried through to educate all people. I feel that there would be much more outcry against some of the legislation coming from this House were people able to see starkly in their living rooms the end results-as happened on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> For weeks after that program my office was deluged with calls from people asking what could be done to stop the carnage. In some instances I even received telephone calls from primary school children. Needless to say, there were numerous letters on the subject also. Yet it was the reaction of the children which set the ball rolling. Children talked amongst themselves and their teachers at school and sent letters. Giant, colourful petitions poured in from school classes throughout my electorate. I was pleased to receive them not only because those children saw the baby harp seal as a little furry animal and therefore were able to respond in this instance but also because it awakened their conscience. In this nation where, if we die of anything, it will be apathy , it was marvellous to see young people responding and wanting something done. I would like to see us take up that challenge and bring in what is really a very simple but very necessary amendment which the Australian Labor Party is putting forward; it could hardly be termed as political. It would actually be voted through this evening if Government members were willing to listen to what must have happened in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that it was just as disturbing to most parents as to the kids to learn that the Federal Government was not going to take any specific action to put pressure on the Canadian Government, something that I am sure most people felt would have been obligatory in the circumstances. I know for a fact that the reaction in other federal electorates in Brisbane was similar and I am aware of considerable nation-wide response. Surely, if other members in this House received even half the pleas that I received in these few weeks their obligation to their electorates on this occasion would be clear. By opting tonight to speak in favour of this amendment I am hopeful in some way of giving credence to the wishes of not only the majority of my constituents but also the Australian electorate as a whole. After all, they did put us here; they put us here for a purpose. The least Government members could do to acknowledge the reason for their presence in the chamber tonight would be to vote for the amendment and thus show to their constituents that their letters and petitions did not fall on barren soil and that Government members were, in fact, big men in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with concern that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) issued a Press statement today stating that Australia would participate as an observer at the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas Conference on the seal hunt. But the Government will not move otherwise. I hope that back benchers and other members in the Government will turn around this Government decision because it would be a retrogressive step, as far as I am concerned, for the Parliament just to fall into party lines on such an issue, one which is hardly going to divide us but one which could deliver something which is required by the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 3 of the Bill as it stands applies to whales, dolphins and porpoises only. Whilst not many Australians can claim to have seen whales in their natural environment many of us have seen the clever antics of dolphins-they are a very intelligent species. Few people would deny, however, that these animals seem to have a special aura of their own which sets them apart in the animal kingdom. As well, several species of whales have been voraciously killed for the products that they yield to man and they border on extinction. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons in particular this Bill, in banning products from these animals, would be an humane document. To my mind, we are taking only a very small step along the path which may well be an important yardstick in our standing as a truly progressive nation. For our entire history we as human beings have been indistinguishable from the rest of the animal kingdom in our species' narcissism-as seen in this chamber. Humans have carved a swathe through both the landscape and the flora and fauna of our planet in the pursuit of human comfort. In many cases, fellow human beings have been sacrificed also in the name of progress. In the same way, lions have ravaged other animal species and so on down the food chain. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I wish to make is that we have always set areas apart from our fellow travellers on this planet and sought to control nature to suit our own needs, often to our detriment. It is only recently that a wider consciousness has evolved which subscribes to standards of freedom and justice based on something more than human mortality. It is only recently that man and woman as a species have recognised the interdependence of species and glimpsed the dignity of the many animal species with which we share this planet. At its most esoteric, this consciouness has been manifested in the animal liberation movement. I am convinced that one day this movement will be seen as part of the fight to accord some notion of respect to animal life. When we respect animal life we respect ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> For the moment, however, man and woman are taking the first few steps and beginning to recognise facts that should always have been obvious, such as the fact that animals experience pain. Our consciences let us take this only so far. Whilst certain large animals can create an unsightly disturbance while being killed, most of us avoid situations in which we are confronted with this fact. It seems now of that we are finally willing to grant dispensation to one or two favoured animal species. The animals we have chosen such as the whale and the dolphin have been largely selected using the ultimate of criteria-their apparent intelligence and passivity. In other words, they alone in the animal kingdom possess those qualities which we as egotistical humans would like to think separate them from other animal species. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the more sensible approach, if we are to venture on the path of sparing animals from wholesale slaughter for reasons other than that of species survival, is to choose the criterion of pain. They, with us, all share that criterion. In this case the entire animal kingdom would probably have to be counselled and thus far, of course, this is totally unacceptable. Therefore, we must be content for the time being to accept that, whilst animals which experience pain will continue to be bred to be slaughtered or be used in sometime mysterious scientific experiments, at least some will be spared this fate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that much of the sympathy for the baby harp seal stems from its appearance and, not least, from the simple fact that it is, after all, a baby at the time of being slaughtered. It cannot claim to have the brain of the dolphin or the whale although it certainly shares the characteristics of passivity. There appears to be little doubt, however, that it is as endangered a species as the whale. On this latter ground alone it warrants protection. Yet clearly Australians have always said that the sight of a baby seal, with its innocent eyes, being clubbed to death is unacceptable. With this statement they have taken the first step towards rebelling against the apparent pain inflicted on animals by man. While the Canadian Government, in troglodyte fashion, continues ignoring the pleas of the world we as representatives of the Australian people have the unique opportunity to protest officially against the slaughter by voting in favour of this amendment. It can only add to the respect which we respectively earn amongst our constituents and amongst each other. I believe that this amendment, if carried, will ultimately mark this piece of legislation as a milestone in defining our relations to the animal world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all honourable members for their constructive suggestions and their contributions to the debate. By and large there is total support for the legislation. I will comment on one or two of the speeches because of the queries raised in them. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) raised the question of live exports. The reasons for that are simply concern and fact. We believe that Australia should continue to provide international leadership in nature conservation such as it did in relation to the ban on whaling. We believe that any increased export of live fauna would run counter to the world wide trend to reduce trade in wildlife and that it could greatly harm Australia's credibility in the area of responsible conservation. Exports would run counter to the spirit of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora to which Australia is a signatory. To be effective the proposed relaxation of export policy would require the introduction of controls and surveillance with a consequent increase in government bureaucracy and capital expenditure at both Commonwealth and State levels. Export of common Australian bird species would not reduce the demand for rare bird species as collectors' items. In fact, export of common or pest species would heighten overseas interest in Australia's rare specimens of wildlife. However, there would also be considerable adverse local and overseas reaction to increased exportation of wild fauna, particularly on animal welfare grounds in relation to the concept of trapping Australia's unique wild fauna for the purposes of export and eventual confinement in cages for the rest of their lives. Quite obviously, there could be objections from other countries, given the possibility of birds escaping and becoming pests. I think one of the speakers indicated that we would be a lot better off in Australia if we did not import such things as cats, pigs and foxes, some of which subsequently escape. More importantly, statistics show that more than 90 per cent of wild birds legally trapped die before reaching their overseas destination. I think it is deplorable on animal welfare grounds for people even to indicate that we should be exporting live animals to a greater extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point is that Australia is free of virulent diseases such as Newcastle disease and consequently Australian birds have absolutely no immunity. The placement of Australian birds in overseas quarantine centres where these diseases are prevalent would result in extremely high mortality rates. Quite obviously, these matters are of great concern. We are merely continuing the policy of successive governments for many years. It appears to me that we should , if we really believe in the preservation of our native fauna and flora, continue the policy of opposition to the export of live animals. Another point raised was that animals could not be exported on a private basis. That is not true. If honourable members closely read the Bill, they will see in clause 44 that the Minister has discretionary powers on a case by case basis. So, if all the conditions are lived up to, if adequate securities are given and if the Minister of the time can be convinced that the export of a live animal is in the interests of all people in both the giving country and the receiving country, with adequate guarantees that there will be no commercial exploitation, he can on a case by case basis give that permission. In conclusion, I thank the speakers not only for their very worthwhile contributions but also for the spirit in which they entered the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to take up the time of the House for very long with what I propose to say. I introduce a new matter which relates very much to what the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) just said. He said that the Minister would have, on the information available to him, the capacity and the opportunity to change the lists of species that might be imported or exported. The Opposition welcomes this Bill because it provides for the first time in one piece of legislation comprehensive lists of species ineligible for export or import. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) correctly made some criticisms of the fact that some of the animals and species on the list are from time to time commonly regarded as pests. That, of course, is one of the problems because much depends on the circumstances at the time-rainfall, climatic conditions and the like. These lists are drawn up against a background of considerable lack of modern knowledge on the abundance or rarity of hundreds of species of Australian mammals and other animals. I hope that, if this Bill is an earnest of the Government's new interest in Australian fauna, it will also extend to flora. It should be part of a program of increased resources made available for the national biological survey and for the acquisition of lands for national parks. I point out the paucity of information available to the Minister or any other Minister to enable him to make these decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian flora and fauna in many cases have survived from earlier periods and in more recent times have been the victims of changes in climate. Many species are extremely vulnerable to climatic change and to man's activities in altering the environment, which has been the principal reason for the increased pace of change since the British settlement of this country in 1788. The introduction of predators, as has been mentioned, has been a big factor in that. The need for legislation of this kind is made even greater by the changes that have taken place in our lifetime. In the days when people settled the part of Australia that the Minister comes from, the pace of change in the environment was very much slower than it is today. We know that in recent times changes have been made to the landscape by bauxite mining, by open-cut mining for coal and by the clearing of rainforest and brigalow. We know the mistakes that have been made. There has recently been discussion in Queensland about the brigalow scheme, which was financed by this Government and carried out over a period going back to 20 years ago, and about the fact that that development took place without any real care for the survival of many species of Australian plants and animals. I hope that the Government, in its policies and in other legislation that it introduces, will take those things into account. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the attention in the export of animals is given to parrots and reptiles , many of which are fairly small and quite rare. The parrots are very beautiful and are in great demand overseas. Species are still being found. A survey partly financed by this Government and carried out by the Queensland Museum in conjunction with the Australian Museum into rainforests in north Queensland and in central and south-eastern Queensland has in fairly recent years discovered new species of animals. It will, therefore, be necessary for the latest information to be made available to the Minister so that he can keep his appendices up to date. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is a need for a substantial educative program. Because these lists are very comprehensive, people may break the law without knowing it. If the legislation is to be effective, not only should it be seen in a punitive sense but also the restrictions and obligations that the legislation imposes should be made known to the people of Australia. Not only should this take place in airports where we are cautioned about taking prescribed articles such as explosives and dangerous substances on to aircraft, but also it should be part of a program of education in schools. The success or otherwise of the program will depend upon surveillance at our airports and ports and on coastal surveillance in the north of this continent, because much of this law will be unenforceable unless there is proper coastal surveillance.

<PARA>As indicated on 6 May 1982 in the second reading speech on the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill, the purpose of the Bill is to strengthen arrangements for the protection of Australia's animals and plants and wildlife generally by improving the effectiveness of our import and export controls. In order to ensure that this purpose is realised to the fullest extent possible, the Government proposes a number of amendments to the Bill. The proposed amendments are designed to overcome a number of minor problems which become evident after introduction of the Bill and to implement certain suggestions of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the proposed amendments insert into the Bill two new definitions relating to scientific research to ensure its effective operation; empower the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review decisions of the Minister with respect to management programs and the duration of permits; improve the seizure provisions and provide for forfeiture or disposal of specimens used in the commission of an offence; and correct a number of technical and typographical errors in the Schedules to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>I will inform the chamber very quickly why I have moved this amendment. This matter has recently received publicity throught the world. No doubt honourable members will be familiar with this outrage that is perpetrated in Canada at this time. The original population of harp seals, albeit several hundred years ago, was approximately 10 million. It is now between one million and 1.5 million. From that very small depleted population the current annual quota is 186,000. Many organisations throughout the world have called upon the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species to list these species on Appendix II and, of course, if they were so listed, they would be on Schedules 1, 2 or 3-if the Government saw fit to add them to Schedule 3-of this Bill. They are not; they should be. I remind the House of the cruel and chilling sight of the clubbing to death of thousands of baby seals as witnessed on the television sets of the nation some months ago. At that time on behalf of the Federal Opposition I called upon the Government to demand from the Canadian Government that it cease this barbarous practice and also that Australia prevents the import of products from harp and hooded seals. Unfortunately, the Government did not see fit to accept that demand but it is now belatedly possible for it to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The hooded seals are an even more endangered species than the harp seals. It is difficult to work out from current evidence and data just what the current population of hooded seals is, but I am reliably informed that during the 1950s the population was approximately 500,000 only and all of the indications are that it is now only 200,000 or 300,000. From this the Canadian Government has authorised quotas of 45,000 a year, so they are even more endangered than the harp seal. I am afraid that I have an advance indication that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) and the Government will say no to this amendment. I am very sorry that they are going to do that. The Opposition is offering full support to the Bill and I know that they may believe that there are some grounds for supporting what I am saying. I think that if they do not accept the amendment it will be because they are really afraid of the trade reaction from the Canadian Government. I think that that is very sad. They should not be afraid. I know that the Minister has put out today a Press release after receiving advance notice of the amendment that we have moved tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I retract that, but I believe the Press release has gone out today because it has been pointed out that it is so obvious that the harp and hooded seals have not been added along with the cetacean creatures-whales and dolphins- to Schedule 3. The Press release is to the effect that Australia will participate as an observer at the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas Conference and that the Government will take a position later. Quite frankly, I do not think that is good enough in light of the figures I have given the Minister. I think that the Minister's decision to put out a Press statement stating that Australia will attend, as an observer, the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas and that the Government will then make up its mind is really a belated attempt to head off all the criticism that has been coming in from hundreds and thousands of people all around Australia who have signed the petitions that have been forwarded to the Government in their thousands. I conclude by urging the House to support the amendment. I urge the Government not to delay. These species are in danger. The Minister and the Government have indicated by introducing this Bill that they wish to protect endangered species and to support CITES, and I suggest that they support this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS AND ENVIRONMENT ON GOVERNMENT ACTION CONCERNING THE CANADIAN HARP AND HOODED SEALS</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, the Hon. D. T. McVeigh, MP, said today that the Government has carefully considered possible action by Australia in relation to the concern of many Australians about the annual hunt in Canada of Harp and Hooded Seals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has received many representations and petitions seeking action because of the perceived threat to seal populations and the apparently inhumane aspects of the killing and skinning techniques. Similar concern has been expressed in other countries. Seal products are not imported into Australia in any significant quantities. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr McVeigh indicated that Australia had already taken the opportunity on several recent occasions to raise this issue with Canada at Ministerial level.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister noted that there was disagreement about important scientific aspects of the seal population assessment and that Canada and the European Commission had agreed that a special study be carried out by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) on the effect of the hunt on the survival of the two seal species. ICES is expected to present its findings later this year. The Government has decided that Australia will seek to participate as an observer at the ICES meeting at which that report will be presented. Meanwhile consultations will continue with the European Commission and Canadian authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr McVeigh said the Government will reconsider whether further action by Australia is appropriate following conclusion of the ICES report and any immediate follow up action by the European Commission and Canada later this year . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House the disastrous unemployment situation confronting this nation. I intend to refer in detail to the situation in my electorate. I have studied the situation very closely and I believe that a microapproach has much to contribute to understanding the problem. In recent years the macroapproach has entirely dominated debate. This is partly because the Government has banned the publication of Commonwealth Employment Service figures which provided a regular indicator of regional changes in unemployment levels. However, another reason is that unemployment has been seen as a transitory problem that changes in policy or an upswing in the economy would eventually improve. The solutions were all macro, so no microanalysis was necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that a change has taken place in the expectations of all sectors of society as to how the problems of mass unemployment are to be approached. This necessitates a new, more detailed analysis of the problem. To get these unemployment percentage figures I used the Department of Social Security figures on numbers of people in receipt of unemployment benefit by postcode and applied them to the total population by postcode, from the 1981 census, as multiplied by the State average percentage in the work force. Admittedly there is room for some error in this formula. The main problem is that only unemployed people in receipt of benefit are counted, so all figures are underestimates. However, the figures are quite accurate enough for regional comparison. Using this technique I discovered that in June the Victoria Park subdivision had an unemployment rate of 13 per cent; Riverdale, 12 per cent; East Victoria Park, 11 per cent; Bassendean/Ashfield 9 per cent; and Belmont, 8 per cent. These are working class suburbs. They also have above average numbers of people on pensions and other benefits. South Perth and Kensington, largely middle class suburbs but with many blocks of flats, have a rate of 8 per cent. As these figures were all well above what was alleged to be the State average I thought there may be some miscalculation on my part, so for comparison I studied the suburbs of Mount Pleasant and Applecross as part of an area of wealthy middle class homes on quarter-acre blocks. In this area the unemployment rate was 3 per cent, which leads me to suspect that in fact my method of calculating the other figures was valid and points to a very serious regional unemployment problem in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Trade unions have notified me of lay-offs in factories employing people from the working class areas I have mentioned. Despite the hopes pinned on the North West Shelf the steel industry has been laying off workers over the last six to 12 months. A major employer, for example, in the agricultural machinery field, Chamberlain John Deere Pty Ltd laid off 40 foundry workers in May. It is quite clear that male breadwinners as well as school leavers are becoming unemployed in increasing numbers. It is plain that this Government is not prepared to do anything about this situation. Government estimates blandly announce that the number of people to be unemployed next year will be approaching 50 per cent higher than it is now. Yet there is no plan for dealing with this massive tragedy except more training schemes and more work experience for unemployed youth. Government counts the cost of job creation but not the terrible social and personal costs of mass unemployment. A close look at the nature and location of unemployed people shows that job creation schemes are desperately needed in certain areas for certain people with definable levels and types of skills. In my electorate it so happens that the greatest need for job creation is in the suburbs that are most in need of improved public facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Belmont City Council made excellent use of Regional Employment Development Scheme funds during the term of the Whitlam Government. The facilities built at that time included a water playground and a cycleways network. Both are now major attractions to people moving into the area. They were not a waste of money ; they were very useful, long term improvements and they were labour intensive in construction but low cost in maintenance. Similar socially useful, labour intensive schemes could be devised in the Victoria Park area. A close analysis of the social needs of areas with high unemployment can have a major impact on the personal tragedy of unemployment and improve the living environment of thousands of people. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that I wanted to make tonight was a plea to get back to looking at Commonwealth Employment Service figures as a basis for calculating the levels of unemployment in particular areas. Where unemployment among breadwinners is concerned it is important to get to grips with those figures to know what sort of problem we are dealing with. I hope that honourable members will take notice of the method of calculation that I have used in that regard so that if the Government is not prepared to do it at least they have a means to do it. Once they have established those figures they will have a means to place pressure on the Government to devise the types of regional schemes which are now very necessary and which are not entailed in any Government legislation which has come before this House to date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Scare stories being publicly spread by the Australian Labor Party in my electorate that up to 500 naval personnel in Nowra could be sacked following yesterday's Budget are both false and dishonest. These Labor Party public allegations are similar to those scare stories that were spread by the Labor Party before the last Federal election. There will be no sackings of Service personnel whatsoever. In fact, HMAS Albatross at Nowra is still accepting re-engagement offers from retiring servicemen on a 12-month basis while awaiting the Government's decision on a new aircraft carrier. However, there will be some short term rundown in numbers at HMAS Albatross. This will be as a result of no replacements of retiring personnel being made while we await the Government's decision later this year on which aircraft carrier to acquire, what aircraft to purchase and what to do with the present aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had already announced this situation, after the British Government failed to proceed with the sale of HMS Invincible. The Nowra fixed wing element was rationalised following the decommissioning of HMAS Melbourne. The number of personnel involved in this natural attrition with no recruitment would total a maximum of about 180 this year. In the event of the early commissioning of an aircraft carrier there would be a reversal of this rundown of fixed wing personnel and a further increase in the large numbers of personnel involved in the expanding rotary wing element of HMAS Albatross. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget figures, confirmed by the Navy office today, on which the false allegations are based, outline the small reductions in Navy personnel numbers expected this year as a result of the decommissioning of HMAS Melbourne's 300 personnel-and the resultant reduction of the Navy's fixed wing activities-180. Only about 50 of the Melbourne's complement are in the Fleet Air Arm, along with about 130 from the fixed wing element. Apart from retirements these personnel have mainly been placed in alternative Service roles. </PARA>
<PARA> It is incredible that a Labor candidate would deliberately set out to cause this kind of morale problem by spreading such falsehoods for political purposes. This is typical of the Labor Party's approach to the whole problem of the Fleet Air Arm and the replacement of an aircraft carrier, in Nowra, and the general question of defence in Australia. The Labor Party has publicly stated and restated that it would sell any aircraft carrier that this Government acquired, that it is totally opposed to the acquisition of an aircraft carrier and will get rid of the fixed wing element from the Navy's Fleet Air Arm in Nowra. The statement the Labor candidate in my area is now making is being spread around and is causing distress and concern to the people involved. It is disgraceful. Its hypocrisy can be seen when compared with the stated public position of the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in this House and his spokesman on defence. Their total opposition to the survival of the Fleet Air Arm is on record. The pattern of deliberate deception that is involved with candidates in my area relating to the Fleet Air Arm is on record. It is incredible that the Labor Party would so falsely play politics with the lives, future and morale of our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very concerned when I heard from Nowra today that there was great distress among serving members of the Navy at HMAS Albatross. These false reports were spread around by the local media. Naturally they believed that no one would recklessly make such disgraceful statements and took them at their face value. It is evident that the Labor Party's record on defence is dishonourable and that the activities of its endorsed candidates are dishonest. Its concern for these people who are in fact serving this nation in the defence forces is non-existent. I suggest to the Australian Labor Party that if it has any interest in our defence forces it should change its tune and start telling the truth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time which is at my disposal tonight I wish to record my protest in relation to the Independent Committee of Inquiry into Commonwealth Laboratory Services and Facilities. Both the terms of reference and the aim of this inquiry have caused considerable unease to a number of people in my electorate and, no doubt, many people in other electorates who are at present benefiting from the assistance provided by the National Acoustic Laboratories for children suffering hearing impairments. Their particular fear is that the Committee will recommend that members of the public using the facilities of the National Acoustic Laboratories will be required to pay for the provision of facilities as has happened in so many other health and welfare areas. Their concern is reinforced when the membership of the Committee is examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The composition of the five member committee, which is chaired by the Deputy Vice-chancellor of the Australian National University, does not inspire confidence in relation to its findings. The Committee comprises two company directors, two scientists and one academic. To put it mildly, this is a rather conservative membership. Bearing in mind many of the facilities which the Commonwealth laboratories have provided to the general public one would have expected that the Committee would contain at least one member who could represent general consumers. However, the worst aspect of the inquiry is the terms of reference which are very clearly designed to reduce the cost to government of the services at present provided by the Commonwealth laboratories.</PARA>
<PARA> Any doubt about the reason for the inquiry is dispelled by the specific statement in the terms of reference that account must be taken of the Commonwealth's immediate aims to streamline and fine down Commonwealth operations. If one looks also at the specific terms of reference it is quite clear that the aims are exactly the same as those of the infamous razor gang brief, that is, the rationalisation of Government funded institutions in order to hand over their functions to private enterprise. It is a philosophical commitment of the Government which bears no relationship to cost-effectiveness, efficiency or convenience to the public. The National Acoustic Laboratories, for example, provides a uniform, comprehensive service which is unique. The lack of such facilities in many overseas countries bears witness to this. There is no doubt that the initial result of the inquiry has been to cause great concern, not only to members of the public who benefit from the facilities provided by the Acoustic Laboratories but also to those people who work in the laboratories and are rightly proud of the quality of the services they provide. It is obvious that when the inquiry is completed the Government will take active steps to ensure that many of the products of Commonwealth laboratories are transferred to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appalling that the mindless commitment of the Government to the superiority of the private enterprise system means the sacrifice of some of the most efficient and publicly acclaimed government institutions at the altar of so -called entrepreneurship and the maximisation of profits. Past experience has shown, as has been proved by the practical effect of the razor gang recommendations, that the cost to the Australian public of transfers from public enterprise to private enterprise has risen and the quality of the services provided has decreased. Whether we examine the sectors of education, health or transport the so-called rationalisation of facilities has meant that the Australian public is required to pay more for the services provided. The proposed aims of the inquiry to streamline and fine down Commonwealth operations should be recognised for what it is-an intention that, regardless of the efficiency of the Commonwealth laboratories or the need by the community to receive the services, the services and facilities will from 1984 onwards be provided by private enterprise on the basis of the user pays principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that my speech tonight will not persuade the Government to change its mind with regard to its most iniquitous inquiry. However, I hope I have drawn attention to the fact that members of the public and members on this side of the House appreciate that the real aim of this inquiry is to support the outdated philosophical outlook of the Federal Government at the expense of the disadvantaged members of our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, unlike the previous speaker, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), I will try to speak at a rate at which you will be able to understand me. I have pleasure in speaking tonight after hearing another speaker talking about the micro policy as it applied to the unemployed. I thought it would be ideal to draw the House's attention to my approach in assisting our young unemployed people. At the time I took the action about which I want to tell the House tonight the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) was in Western Australia taking up plenty of time on the radio telling people how he would employ the unemployed. He still seems to have a commitment to the Regional Employment Development Scheme, although he had nothing to do with it directly, as I did. He was not prepared to take some of the advice that I gave him in this House as to the huge deficiencies of that program. He thinks that young people will be employed if we introduce a $150m construction scheme such as, to quote him, the Snowy scheme of many years ago. Honourable members can imagine how much work that would make for the thousands of young unskilled unemployed. Such a scheme would be quite good for him and for some of his party colleagues because the day the $150m scheme was announced they would argue about site allowances, but I sincerely doubt, in this day and age of high technology and big capital equipment, that such a project would assist. Consequently, he thought he would have a youth corps. I am not exactly sure how he will make that work, but while he was doing that I was out presenting the Tuckey perpetual ladder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tuckey perpetual ladder was presented to a young lady called Leanne Dickson , who lives in Esperance and who was attending a Community Youth Support Scheme group. I made a speech to that CYSS group pointing out that there were great opportunities for employment of the young if they rethought their positions and took some individual initiatives for which Australia was known throughout the world. I pointed out that I felt that within Australia many jobs exploited employed people who would be very happy to pay for certain services. As an example-a simple one, taking the micro point-I gave the washing of household windows. I said to the project officer at Esperance that if he could find a young person from his CYSS group who would attempt to see whether he or she could make a go of it I would provide the ladder. I was quite happy to invest the necessary $50. In fact he rang me and said that he had managed to get someone to take up the offer. I have since provided that ladder to the young lady. She is now making quite an adequate living on her own. Of course, she is no longer a burden to the taxpayer, to say nothing of the fact that her personal pride in being employed is a wonderful thing for her. The other amazing thing is that even though she is a young person who is still not earning a great amount of money she has been able to display some charity. When she works for any person on a pension she carries out the work of washing windows and so on at half price. I believe the effort was pretty good. The reason I called it the perpetual ladder was that I suggested that when she got herself on her feet she would give it to someone else in order for them to start. In fact, the total capital she required once she got the ladder-</PARA>

In fact there are 400,000 houses in Western Australia. If all their windows were washed once every three months 1,000 kids could get in front of the dole permanently. If the honourable member thinks that that is the answer to the unemployment problem of Australia he is quite wrong. Nevertheless, it is a dashed sight more smart than the $150m scheme to employ the young unemployed referred to by the honourable member for Wills. It is a lot of rubbish.
