<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Firstly, has the Government had interim report No. 3 of Mr Costigan, the Royal Commissioner inquiring into the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, since 18 December 1981? Secondly, does that report contain specific recommendations asking the Government to take action to amend section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and to amend the Royal Commission's terms of reference? Thirdly, is the Prime Minister aware that the Commissioner says in his report that such amendment 'is directed to the enhancement of the investigative capabilities of the Commission' and 'would require early legislation if it is to be of use to the Commission'? Finally, in the light of the foregoing and of the Prime Minister's allegations in this House on 18 February about another person, will he tell the House why, having had this report for nearly three months, he has refused to take action to see that these recommendations of the Royal Commissioner are implemented?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand from my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services that the report was received on or about the date mentioned by the honourable member for Wills. The answer to the second part of the question is yes, and I think the answer to a large part of the third part of the question is also yes, in that the honourable member was quoting the words of the Royal Commissioner himself. It was indicated in my colleague's tabling statement of a week or so ago that the Government would give early attention to the recommendation of the Royal Commissioner. I add only that I wish to emphasise something that appears to have been lost sight of in all of what has been said arising out of the Royal Commissioner's interim report, namely, that the particular tax evasion practice that was described in such colourful terms by the Royal Commissioner was in fact declared a criminal offence by an Act of this Parliament, at the initiative of this Government, about 16 months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable gentleman, I was most concerned when I learned of the gift from an article in a newspaper. Apparently the difficulty in the Australian Broadcasting Commission's accepting it is that it was made to a specific division of the Commission and the constitution governing the Commission and its ability to receive a gift drafted in that form have been under consideration by the Attorney-General and by other lawyers. I have asked the Chairman of the ABC to ensure that nothing within the Commission will hinder an early consideration of the gift. I believe that, given the purposes of the bequest which I understand is directed to activities of a general educational character, it is well suited to the general operations of the Commission and I hope that it will be able to take up the offer. I certainly hope that, as a result of my discussions with the Commission, it will be possible for the gift to proceed and for the existing apparent legal impediments to be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>

The estimate was based on the fact that it has been clearly demonstrated that doctors are more likely to prescribe for a greater patient use of prescriptions when those pharmaceutical products are free. Secondly, scripts would also be available free for items costing less than $3.20 which are not covered now because that is the minimum patient contribution. So there would be more items covered. Finally, the pensioner health benefit scheme also includes additional items not generally available under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That answers the question as to why it is more likely that people would obtain more prescriptions when those prescriptions are free. Firstly, patients would expect them; secondly, doctors would be encouraged to give them; thirdly,-</PARA></TALK.START>

Finally, the ALP's costings take no account of the promise contained in the so-called Hayden health plan for reduced pharmaceutical costs for people with chronic illnesses. It does not detail what those chronic illnesses are and what the reduction of the fee would be. The fact of the matter is that it is very difficult to calculate the costs of chronic illness patients-of course, they would be high users of pharmaceutical items-and I would be very grateful to the Labor Party if it would make clear which chronic illnesses it is going to make fee reductions for and what the extent of these fee reductions will be. On the figures available to me, the estimates provided by the Government are based on experience overseas and a conservative estimate of the cost of supplying pharmaceuticals at reduced cost to people with chronic illnesses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Treasurer concerns the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System and its conclusion that bank mortgage interest rates should be deregulated. Is the Treasurer aware that the Committee concluded that, with deregulation, bank mortgage rates would rise from their current level of 12 1/2 per cent to the Government bond rate, now at 15 per cent? Is the Treasurer also aware that a recent study by two economists at the Australian National University Centre for Economics Policy Research showed that at the interest rate levels prevailing last December deregulation would raise the average mortgage interest rate from 13.6 per cent to between 17 per cent and 18 per cent? In view of these horrendous interest rate consequences that would flow from deregulation and the great concern in the community about the future course of interest rates, will the Treasurer now assure the House that the Government will reject out of hand the Campbell Committee proposal for deregulation of interest rates?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the conclusions reached in the Campbell Committee report . In fairness to the report I think I should point out to the honourable gentleman that the conclusion was that certain interest rates would suffer the rises suggested by the honourable gentleman, other interest rates could well fall and that it could well be that the average cost of money borrowed might not vary over time a great deal at all. I think in all the debate on this issue variations in the average cost of money over a period have to be borne in mind. I have made it clear on a number of occasions that the recommendations of the Campbell report are relevant to what the Government is looking at in the housing area. I do not intend to respond to the invitation of the honourable member for Gellibrand and in any way pre-empt a decision of the Cabinet at this time or at some future time on that or other recommendations of the Campbell report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without obtaining a good deal of statistical information-which I will get for the honourable gentleman-it is not easy to give a totally precise answer to that question. A number of patterns are apparent. It is fair to say that over the past couple of years-particularly over the last 12 months-savings banks in particular have fared badly in deposit gathering. The rise in deposits for savings banks over the last 12 months has probably been around 7 per cent, which represents a significant fall in real terms. It is also true that permanent building societies, which for a number of years did very well in relation to savings banks, over the past 12 months have experienced a tapering off in their deposit gathering capacity. They have probably suffered a little more through the competition of other deposit taking institutions which offer higher rates of interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did indicate last week, and I repeat it to the House, that in reaching decisions and conclusions on the housing issue one has to keep a sense of proportion. Whilst it is true that by the standards of, say, 1974 and 1975 the overall volume of money available for housing is still very high, it is equally true that over the past 12 months a downward trend has developed. For the benefit of the honourable gentleman and the House I will bring together some statistical information which, in any event, is already available publicly. Perhaps it can be more conveniently put together.</PARA>

I also refer him to his statement of 1 March 1982 in which the estimate of revenue forgone in a full year as a result of the health insurance rebate was put at $470m. If the Budget estimate is wrong, can the Minister firstly explain to the House why anyone should have confidence in his costings of other people' s schemes when he is so inept at costing his own?

<PARA> The point that I wish to make is that these figures were complete. They were the only ones available. The figures as at 30 November or later were only preliminary figures. As soon as the more complete figures become available to us-I hope that that will be within the next couple of weeks-an update will be given. But the fact of the matter remains that the figure of $470m was calculated using complete data and, therefore, it is the figure to be taken. The earlier figures mentioned in the Budget Papers were derived from estimates based on expected membership levels and expected levels within the health insurance parameters, that is, between hospital insurance, health insurance or combined insurance. The $470m was based on complete data available to the Government at the time. I mention that it was 30 September and not 1 September as the honourable member for Bonython put out in his rather emotional response to the Government's costings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a good deal of misleading publicity on this question in the last few days. I am pleased with the publicity because perhaps it has done something to increase the awareness of honourable members and Australians generally of the importance of Antarctica to Australia. I assure the honourable member for Mackellar that there is no intention of closing any of Australia's four Antarctic and sub-Antarctic bases. They will be continued and maintained. The Government is committed to a $58m rebuilding plan for all the bases over the next ten years which gives some idea of the Government's commitment to Antarctica. There have been reports also that staff in the Antarctic Division has been reduced in recent times. That is not true. There has been no reduction of staff in the Antarctic Division over the last three years. When the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions recommended a 2 per cent across the board cut for all departments the Antarctic Division was excluded from the cut by my Department and its share of the cut was taken by the rest of the divisions. I believe that gives another indication of the Government's commitment to this very important area. Antarctica is important to Australia in a number of ways- scientifically, environmentally, for strategic reasons and, perhaps in the future, for resources.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government have agreed to provide a subsidy of up to $1m per annum from each government to maintain Trans Australia Airlines F27 services, even if on a reduced scale, to western and northern Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable gentleman would know, with the introduction of the Holcroft formula for the setting of air fares it has not been possible for TAA to cross- subsidise fares in western Queensland with fares on other routes. The result has been, of course, that TAA has had to continue those services to western and inland northern Queensland at a loss of about $3m per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government, in association with TAA and the Queensland Government, undertook a very thorough evaluation of the services that were being provided by TAA to Queensland. As a result of that examination it was decided to rationalise the services and so reduce the total loss to TAA to approximately $ 2m per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> There will be some reduction in frequencies in certain parts of the Maranoa electorate. There also will be some reductions in frequencies to the electorate of Kennedy. As the honourable member for Kennedy would understand, those reductions will be largely offset by an improved jet service between Townsville and Mount Isa.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the people of Queensland will welcome the fact that this arrangement will apply at least until the 1983-84 financial year. Indeed, at the end of 1982-83 there will be a review of the level of subsidy. I expect that in that interim period attempts will be made by the Queensland Government and also by other airlines and other operators to look at providing a more effective service to the western and inland northern Queensland people without the need for a subsidy. It is hoped that by 1983-84 aircraft will have a capacity to operate more efficiently over such routes. We would be encouraging other airlines to take over as TAA may phase out of F27 aircraft within the next two years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the House knows there has been considerable debate on this question. I think there is general acceptance throughout the community of the need for a single meat inspection system. But as the House also knows the Commonwealth responsibility lies in respect of meat for the export trade. The State governments' responsibility lies, of course, with the domestic health services. It has been difficult for me as Commonwealth Minister to get State agreement to a single service. The nearest to a breakthrough has come with Victoria where the Minister of Agriculture has been pleased to join in a study to see whether we can get a single meat inspection service for Victoria. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that those studies are proceeding very satisfactorily. There are a number of difficulties yet to overcome but I think that progress will lead to a single service in that State. That will then set the pattern, I hope, for other States' consideration of the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Western Australia has exhibited some interest in the study going on, as has Queensland. Regrettably, the honourable member's own State of New South Wales has displayed no interest at all in a single meat inspection service and I am not too sure how we will ever get it up to the barrier.

Is it a fact that the membership of private health insurance funds covered about 54 per cent of the population at September last year and that on that basis the income forgone from the health insurance rebate would be the equivalent of some $470m, the figure he has quoted? Is it a fact that his Department, however, in the post-November period worked and currently works on an assumption of 70 per cent membership of the Australian population in private health insurance funds and on that basis the figure quoted by the honourable member for Bonython of $ 660m is a correct and reliable figure? In the circumstances why has he traduced his Department by drawing it into this fraudulent costing exercise that he has engaged in?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first part of the honourable member's question, if I recall it correctly, suggested that the figure for people covered by health insurance was 53 per cent as at 1 September. To the best of my knowledge, that is incorrect. The figure was about 53 per cent at the end of March-April. The figure at 1 September would have been higher than that. The percentage figures at the end of September, upon which the estimates were based, were in the sixties. They were the first complete figures and are the only complete figures from all the health insurance funds which are yet available to the Government. I have already stated that the figures for later in the year are preliminary. We expect that we will receive the consolidated figures fairly soon. I would be very happy to provide the honourable member with an estimate once those consolidated figures for later in the year are available to us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to assure the honourable gentleman that the answer to the first part of his question is a very resounding no. The answer to the second part is yes and, of course, I hope the services will be improved. A campaign has been conducted, particularly in Victoria, around country postmasters. It has been designed to generate fear and concern amongst employees of Australia Post and recipients of the services of Australia Post. The whole system of Australia Post involves a continual appraisal of the needs of communities. As a result new post offices are opened from time to time. The honourable member for Petrie, Senator Georges and I participated in an opening of a new post office last week in one of the outer suburbs of Brisbane. From time to time changes are made too in the staffing requirements of different post offices. Australia Post, in the proper conduct of its business, reviews the needs of the community and endeavours to ensure that the staffing and the status of the post office meet those needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no program afoot in any way to downgrade or change the status of post offices as a result of any new program, review of Commonwealth functions report, or anything else. The whole of the operations of the post office are obviously designed to try to maintain the service that was so frustrated through the industrial troubles that were generated through the whole of the Redfern Mail Exchange period. The Redfern Mail Exchange was not a good working environment. Australia Post recognised that and has moved away from that centralised mail sorting establishment to establish decentralised mail sorting areas. These are working very efficiently. When that program is completed I have every reason to believe that throughout Australia the general services available will be at least as competitive as any that are available from any other postal system anywhere in the world.</PARA>

I cannot give him the details of the amount spent on scientific research in Antarctica. I will find them and let him know.

Australia is taking part in a number of scientific programs to discover as much as it can about these great resources. The scientific programs need to be upgraded. I hope that greater resources will be made available. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is perhaps aware that the very large rebuilding program has put a drain on the resources of the Antarctic Division. The fact that we have to accommodate in the Antarctic bases a large number of building staff from the Department of Housing and Construction has drained the resources. This is a matter of concern to me and will be considered in the Budget context. I am well aware of the importance of scientific research in Antarctica and of increasing our efforts there. There has to be a balanced program. There is a great demand on the costs of the administration because of logistics and the rebuilding program. There is no doubt that we could spend very large sums of money in Antarctica.

The Australian Minerals and Energy Council has done a good deal of work on this matter. To further interest overseas investors committees between Australia and Japan and Australia and Korea have been looking particularly at this aspect to try to interest Japan and Korea in doing more smelting and refining of materials in Australia rather than in their own countries, where there are so many environmental problems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I do seek your indulgence. In an answer that I gave to a question without notice on 23 February concerning the date at which it had become apparent that the Budget deficit was likely to be greater than planned, I replied that, without checking the record and to the best of my recollection, this had become apparent about six weeks or two months previously; that is, towards the end of December. I have now had an opportunity to check the record. Some of the individual factors which contributed to the overrun, particularly the effect of the postponing of the operation of the new sales tax and the loss of crude oil revenue from the strike affected production in Bass Strait, were known or anticipated as early as mid-October. However, the first time these and other factors were put together to give an indication of the overall extent of the prospective deficit overrun was towards the end of November and not towards the end of December. As the process of fully checking the record was not completed until late on Thursday, 25 February, I was not able to inform the House of these details before the House rose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make a couple of points clear. The main reasons for the blow-out to date have been the shortfall in crude oil revenue and the failure to pass the new sales tax measures on the revenue side and the larger than expected public sector wage settlements on the expenditure side. We should also not lose sight of the fact that it is not yet possible to be very precise about the likely deficit outcome for the year as both receipts and expenditure can still fluctuate markedly, even in the last few weeks of the financial year. The Government has been kept fully informed by its advisers of the Budgetary situation as it has developed. In turn, both my collegue the Minister for Finance and I have, in accordance with normal reporting processes, kept our own colleagues fully informed of those developments. </PARA>
<PARA> During last week I was asked by one newspaper whether I had in fact checked the record. Having done that at the time I was asked, I saw no good reason in the interests of proper disclosure why I should not respond to that request. That accounts for the fact that a report of this matter appears on an entirely attributed basis in the Australian Financial Review in advance of my informing the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The second Monday in March is set aside to mark Commonwealth Day and, as today is the closest sitting day, I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the significance of the Commonwealth, and its importance for Australia. The Commonwealth has shown a remarkable capacity to adapt to changing world circumstances, especially in recent decades. It has a demonstrated capacity to maintain its own continuity through a process of evolution and subtle modification and at the same time it has a proven track record in solving problems. As Commonwealth Secretary-General Ramphal said in Melbourne last year, 'it is acknowledged that the Commonwealth can handle disagreement and generate accord'. He went on to say that 'our dialogue is one between friends within the community of the Commonwealth'. These views have been echoed by dozens of Commonwealth leaders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, we live in a fragile and dangerous world in which there are few enough fruitful avenues open to the nations of the world to come to grips with the problems which confront us. Because this is so, we should all try to nourish and encourage any avenue which exists and which can do good, and the Commonwealth is, without doubt, an avenue which has a number of unique advantages. It brings together rich and poor, North and South. It cuts across many prevailing expectations of alignments among nations. It enables people with very different political philosophies to sit down together and work towards agreement on matters that would otherwise divide them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is the only forum in which heads of government set aside several days of their time every two years-in the case of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting leaders, every year-to address a range of problems of common concern. The informality and flexibility of the Commonwealth enable it to bring new and practical perspectives to bear on problems where the rest of the world community has sometimes found itself locked into sterile exchanges between structured groups. Commonwealth leaders have shown their determination to make the Commonwealth work. Difficulties and shortcomings have never been allowed to stand in the way, and there is no doubt that the Commonwealth warrants our continuing support. </PARA>
<PARA> This year, 1982, will be an important year for the Commonwealth. The third Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting will take place in Suva in October. This will be the first meeting of Commonwealth leaders in the Pacific Islands, and this has a particular significance following the emphasis given to issues of Pacific concern at last year's Commonwealth meeting. This meeting will involve Commonwealth Heads of Government from the Asian and Pacific Regions. The development of regional Commonwealth meetings was, as honourable members will know, an Australian initiative. We look to the meeting in Suva to carry forward the valuable and practical achievements of the two previous regional meetings in Sydney and New Delhi, and we would anticipate that a number of the issues considered in Melbourne last year will receive further attention at the Suva meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The views of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-indeed, his commitment to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Day-are well known. He has declared them on many occasions. Equally , it is obvious that the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting has made an enduring impression on him. He has invested a great deal of commitment in that body as an action body capable, in his view, in certain respects of fulfilling certain world and regional needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, of course, my own views have been put on the record. It is pointless my canvassing them again. I restate for the record, however, a couple of matters on which the Prime Minister has declared himself, where he has worked and where I have consistently declared my approbation for what he has done. The first concerns Zimbabwe, its emergence to independence and its administration under the hands of a declared Marxist, Mr Mugabe. The Prime Minister did not allow his ideological fixations to stand in the way of what I believed at the time was a sensible course of conduct and which I still believe to have been a constructive role fulfilled by him. I have no doubt that, as a consequence of his role there, no matter how excoriated it may be by his colleagues in the British Goverment and no matter how justified they may feel that excoriation, that role has improved the stock of good will among black African countries; in particular, I have in mind black African former colonies of Britain, now Commonwealth countries as loosely defined. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter concerns the Prime Minister's consistent-at least since he has been Prime Minister-opposition to apartheid in South Africa. We would have wished that that opposition had been declared much earlier-for instance, when some of us were confronting authority in opposition to the presence of Springbok footballers in the early part of the last decade in this country. That is a matter of regret. But no matter; the important point is redemption, no matter how late it may occur. Added troops to the forces of worthwhile causes are always welcome. Conversion is not an impediment to those who later join the ranks of virtuous causes. The Prime Minister has done that. He has done it unequivocally. I believe he has established a valuable store of good will on that score too with black African countries and, more particularly those of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two reasons why I mention this. The first concerns the impending Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. It would appear from reports in the media that these Games may be imperilled. The presence of a New Zealand sporting contingent participating in those Games could result in the black African countries, through a decision of the Organisation of African Unity, withdrawing from participation in the 1982 Commonwealth Games at Brisbane. That would be a tragedy. In physical or financial terms it would represent a great loss of money invested in the preparation for those Games. I think those who follow closely international sporting events such as the Commonwealth Games would recognise that a disciplined withdrawal of black African Commonwealth countries from the Games would cause a serious collapse in the standards of performance in many important areas and detract enormously from the expectations of the people watching the Games and from the international spectacle that the organisers and, indeed, this country hope to see promoted through this event. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very real threat. A test of the good will that the Prime Minister has claimed to have established, and which I believe he should have established, by his role in the two areas which I have mentioned will be whether he will be able to influence black African Commonwealth countries to participate in those Games. I put it to him that the Games are too important to be imperilled. If the slackness, the political opportunism and contrivances of Mr Muldoon and his Government in New Zealand have been such as to imperil the Games, there should be no hesitation; New Zealand should be made aware that it will not be allowed to participate in the games. It will not be the fault of Australia if this peril should arise. It is a matter of regret that the outrageous behaviour of the Muldoon Government, more concerned about winning government by dividing the nation, should have created this possible penalty for New Zealand athletes. But it has been created by the New Zealand Government, not by any government in this country, not by any Australian and not by any action or intention of the people responsible for the Commonwealth Games at Brisbane. The Games should not be imperilled even if the behaviour of Mr Muldoon, as irresponsible, as reckless and as politically outrageous as it was, is to mar the Games. It would be a matter of regret to have to do this to a country which is so close to us and with which we have had such enduring and unequalled political, social and historical ties. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another matter which could also add to the dissidence of black African countries as they weigh the pros and cons; will they go or not to the Commonwealth Games at Brisbane? I refer to the quite clear racial intolerance of the Queensland Government. It is discomforting that members of this Parliament and broadly the community of Australia, committed to the rights of Aboriginals, should have witnessed only recently the Premier of Queensland engaging in a fudge, a fiddle, and a flimsy pretext and declaring that he was establishing land rights when he was doing no such thing. The Prime Minister said: 'This is a step forward'. It was merely a step in a revolving door. It gave nothing to the black people of this country. They do not have freehold title to the land. Anyone who understands the deep-seated spiritual commitment of black Australians to the land, the meaning of having control of the land, will understand the gratuitous offensiveness of the behaviour of the Premier of Queensland added to by the declaration of the Prime Minister that this is a step forward. All that the Aboriginals of Queensland have got--</PARA>

We want to explore the implications which arise from it, the benefits we expect to establish on the one hand and the difficulties that could be presented to us on the other. That is exactly what I am seeking to explore. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting it was the Prime Minister who talked about the breakdown of racial intolerance in this country and the way in which Aboriginal welfare and rights have been promoted. While he has been in government he has been responsible for many hundreds of millions of dollars in real terms being cut back from the allocation to welfare spending on Aboriginal needs in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Today I would like the House to step back from the cut and thrust of everyday political life to consider the direction in which we wish to move as a nation over the next few years. This Parliament has a profound responsibility to keep abreast of the whole range of issues facing Australia. We need to understand Australia's position in a broad perspective as well as in detail, in the light of international as well as domestic factors. We need to understand the choices which lie ahead and the consequences of the decisions we take. We need a clear sense of our nation's values and objectives and we need to develop and explain our policies in the light of our philosophy. The world is full of uncertainty and, because of this, Australia needs a policy approach which is marked by balance, vision and realism . The world is also full of unrealistic demands and expectations in spite of the immediate social and economic problems which many countries are experiencing and which are having an indirect impact on most countries. In a situation of significant uncertainty and difficulty, it would obviously be absurd to expect that high and immediate expectations can be attained at little cost or as a matter of course. But neither should we allow the difficulties being experienced by the world economy to be seen in a way which gets them out of proportion-it would be wrong to overestimate or underestimate them. We need to try to understand them realistically because it is vital if we are to move ahead as one nation in the next few years that people's expectations should be closely adjusted to reality. Nobody has a crystal ball to predict the future fully but we do know that, unless we anticipate and adapt our policies in line with changing circumstances, unless we are in a position to take advantage of changes in the world economy as and when they occur, opportunities will pass Australia by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also know that the old adage that you only get out as much as you put in remains as true today as it has always been and it is timely to remember, when we are considering realistic levels of expectations, that what some people get cannot go to others. </PARA>
<PARA>The International Perspective</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In coming to grips with Australia's present position in an overall perspective, it is appropriate to start with the international dimension. Our independence as a nation cannot blind us to the fact that overseas events affect us profoundly. Much of Australia's history bears witness to the recognition by earlier generations of Australians that we are affected by what happens in other parts of the world. At the present time, Australia cannot ignore the tensions and the threats which exist in so many parts of the world to international security and stability. The Soviet Union pursues its militaristic and opportunistic programs relentlessly. We see the effects of that policy in Afghanistan and Poland and in attempts to frustrate the peace process in the Middle East. We see it through Cuba's support for Communist insurrection in Africa and Latin America and, closer to home, Vietnamese troops continue to occupy Kampuchea, in violation of that country's sovereignty, and posing a threat to Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA> Without question, the world situation is troubled and uncertain. New trouble spots can erupt with little or no warning. Our policies must take account of the broad global context and we must recognise that Australia's security is bound up with the strength of the Western alliance. We obviously benefit from the security which this alliance brings to us but at the same time we must shoulder the responsibilities which it entails. All of this is part of interdependence and whether we are talking about threats to world peace and security, or about problems of world poverty, or about the slackness of world trade, the growing interdependence of the world must be seen as fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say here that the development of multiculturalism in Australia in recent years has helped us enormously as a community in gaining the wider understanding which the successful management of interdependence will increasingly call for. I believe it is a tribute to our responsibility and compassion as a community that Australians have felt involved in tragic events in other countries and have given practical effect to these feelings as shown by the massive public responses to appeals like those for Kampuchea, for Southern Italy after the earthquake, and for Poland. The same concern is equally apparent in the willingness of hundreds of young Australians to respond to an appeal to go as teachers to Zimbabwe. Interdependence is real and in managing it we need policies which take advantage of the opportunities it creates, as well as minimising the difficulties and dangers which go with it. The growth of world trade provides a compelling illustration of our growing interdependence, of the advantages it can bring as well as its impact on key areas such as employment. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the rapid expansion of trade in the post Second World War period that was a mainspring of rapid world economic growth that supported the growth of employment opportunities, and of real living standards for countries at all levels of development. Between 1963 and 1970, while the volume of world output grew at an average annual rate of 5.6 per cent, the volume of world exports grew by 8.6 per cent a year. But during the 1970s, the growth of world output and exports both significantly slowed and as a result unemployment started to get worse. It is particularly worth noting in this regard that between 1973 and 1978 , exports from developed to developing countries rose at an average rate of over 20 per cent. How much worse would unemployment problems in developed countries now be without that trade? We must also recognise a further aspect of interdependence-that other nations are taking an increasing interest in our economic and trade policies. Others rightly expect us to be good neighbours, to play our full part in promoting the continued orderly growth of world trade as responsible members of the international economic community. It is plain that the growth of trade, and the growth of interdependence more generally, increasingly exposes a nation's economic system to influences from outside its own borders. Our own increased interdependence with the rest of the world has been highlighted by the quite violent economic fluctuations which have been a characteristic feature of much of the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Each surge in the price of oil has led to a crisis which caused the growth of world trade to slacken and Australia has been affected in a number of ways by both the oil price shocks and by the slackening of trade. There was obviously renewed interest in the exploitation of alternative sources of energy and this has given Australia opportunities. But the slower growth in world markets has affected our exports and any dip in commodity prices due to unfavourable conditions overseas is plainly going to have an impact on Australia. Even before the first oil price increase in 1973, inflation had become more or less endemic in most industrialised nations. Excessive growth of government spending and inappropriate use of deficit financing played a major part in this. The oil price increases compounded these problems, making growing unemployment and growing inflation the order of the day. Even then, most countries did not recognise what was needed in terms of restraint of government spending, in terms of firmness of monetary policy and in terms of wage restraint. Although there are now signs in a number of countries of a determination to pursue more economically realistic policies, natural economic processes have run their course. In Europe and North America, economic growth has virtually come to a standstill in the last two years and unemployment is high, and rising. In France and in the United States unemployment is 8.5 per cent and in the United Kingdom it is 11.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> By the second half of 1982, total Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development unemployment is expected to rise to 28.5 million people, compared with just over 21 million in 1980. In these conditions of virtually no growth and rising unemployment, overseas inflation rates are falling. The OECD inflation rate is now under 10 per cent and falling, a reduction of three percentage points below the 1980 rate. The United States inflation rate fell from 12.4 per cent in the 12 months to December 1980 to 8.9 per cent in the 12 months to December 1981, and the British inflation rate fell from 15.1 per cent to 12 per cent in the same period. Perhaps paradoxically, sluggish growth and falling inflation have been accompanied by some of the highest interest rates, both real and nominal, that the world has seen. This situation stems from a number of factors. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation should be seen against the background that interest rates rose less rapidly than inflation during the 1970s. Real interest rates were negative for a substantial part of that decade. And while falling inflation rates in some countries are a cause for optimism, financial markets are not convinced that the underlying problem of inflation has been solved. The present situation has been aggravated by an unfortunate mix of policies in some countries. Budget deficits have been allowed to soar and the resulting pressures on the money supply have been kept in check only with exceptionally stringent monetary policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Sluggish growth, low business profits and high interest rates have in turn interacted to produce stagnant investment and continued economic recession. Overseas markets are growing very slowly, if at all. International commodity prices fell 20 per cent in the year to the last September quarter. Australia's farmers are experiencing generally flat or falling prices along with rising costs and they are also subject to quotas and restrictions of many kinds in international markets. Over the last year or so, and partly reflecting some of the factors I have been referring to, there have also been some significant shifts in the world oil situation. At the present time, world crude oil supplies are more than ample to meet demand but oil prices are still very high. The future levels of energy supply and energy prices are full of uncertainty. Our economy is inevitably constrained, and increasingly constrained, by its interdependence with the rest of the world. We cannot but be affected by factors such as the present slackness in world demand and the high cost of funds, nor can we avoid being affected by the protectionism which strikes at many of our exports, especially our farm products. And it is important for us to be aware of the very real dangers that are created by increasing protectionism in other countries during a time of world recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with these influences has been a rapid growth in our current account deficit, squeezed profitability for our export industries and some reappraisal and deferment of resource projects. But investment is still moving ahead strongly. We cannot afford, as a nation, to try to ignore overseas developments or their inevitable influence upon us. What we must do is develop appropriate responses. We must be ready to react, ready to adapt, especially to fundamental changes in the world economy, while minimising the undesirable effects of unwelcome influences. In so doing we need policies which lay solid foundations for future growth, which will allow us to take full advantage of the renewed growth overseas which must occur at some time and which will carry us through the interventing period of world downturn no matter how short or long it may turn out to be. In particular, we must prove ourselves reliable and competitive suppliers. We cannot afford to price ourselves out of world markets, or earn ourselves the reputation of being incapable of meeting conractual commitments because of poor industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Economic Achievement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> When we look at Australia's present position in the light of our economic achievements over recent years, it is plain that great advances have been made and a strong foundation laid for the future. Although we are a trading nation, and despite the continuing slackness of world trade over recent years, we have swum against the tide. I believe that in the current circumstances, when the facts of interdependence plainly make our position increasingly difficult, our determination to succeed through far-sighted and sustainable policies will be seen as right. It is an undoubted fact that as a result of our policies Australia has prospered in recent years while the rest of the world has been stagnating. Private enterprise has prospered and Australia has benefited. To be sure, in a troubled world economy, we have had valuable resources to exploit and profit by. But that did not make success certain, for the opportunities we had could have been squandered. Possession of resources is only the first condition of prosperity. Another necessary condition is sound government policy and there is no denying that the policies we have followed have created the conditions in which private enterprise has been encouraged to take the lead in exploiting the opportunities on offer. The confidence required for investment to go ahead has been created and, as a result of this turnaround, the living standards of Australia's families have been improved and we now stand ready to grasp the opportunities which will inevitably lie ahead for us. </PARA>
<PARA> A consistent assault on inflation has been essential in creating an environment in which private enterprise could plan and invest with confidence. The sustained restraint which has been imposed on government spending which has been virtually unrivalled throughout the world has been indispensable to success. The interests of all Australians require that this restraint must be maintained along with giving proper emphasis to priority needs and concerns. The Budget deficit has been pulled back from almost 5 per cent of gross domestic product to less than 1 per cent. The Commonwealth has eased the pressure on domestic capital markets by curbing its own borrowing requirements and we look for support in this endeavour from other levels of government. Action has been taken to promote industrial expansion and encourage the growth of productivity and there has been a concern for the competitive position of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> While success with inflation has been vital, successful, non-disruptive management of the exchange rate has also been vital. Secure and improved access for our products has been sought on established markets, in the United States of America, Europe and Japan and Australian exports have been helped to make significant gains in new and expanding markets, especially in Asia and the Middle East. Industry has been helped by initiatives to encourage industrial research and development and by an accelerated depreciation allowance. Industry has been given due notice of change where reduced levels of assistance are desirable. To avoid delay in putting in place the stable policy foundation on which industry will be able to plan in the longer term, the general reference on tariffs was brought forward. </PARA>

<PARA> Manufacturing industry is indispensable to balanced development throughout Australia, and in 1981 manufacturing industry investment increased by 32 per cent in money terms. The effect of all these policy approaches has been to build Australia up. Their goal, which we all share, has been higher living standards for Australian families. Their benefits are now plain to see: Almost 400,000 new jobs created in the three years to the December quarter; almost 90 per cent of them in the private sector; real household disposable incomes up by $2.9 billion after tax in 1980-81; average weekly earnings up by more than $13 a week in real terms in the two years to the September quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been reflected in stronger growth in consumer spending and much stronger private investment in housing: Between 1977-78 and 1980-81, investment in dwellings rose by 26.5 per cent in real terms. The gains that have been made also point towards a better future. Business profits rose by 17 per cent in real terms in the last three years. With that has come a surge in business investment . The 1980-81 rate of increase was the highest for 30 years. The 1981-82 rate is also likely to be over 10 per cent in real terms. This, as a share of gross domestic product, will bring business investment back close to the levels that used to be taken for granted in the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> Business investment is vital to our children's future. It is the only basis of more jobs and more real spending power in the Australian community and this is why it is so important to give high priority to building up the economy. But it is not only in economic matters that Australians expect their Governments to apply effective policies. And when we look across a wider range of concerns, there is cause for pride in what has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall mention just a few areas in order to provide a broader perspective from which to view some of the challenges which lie ahead. In relation to defence, important steps have been taken in the policy of making sure Australia has an up to date, balanced and effective defence force, including the acquisition of the FA18 fighter aircraft, of the British 105 millimetre gun, and of the aircraft carrier Invincible; and we need to be aware that strong capabilities contribute not only to national security but also to regional stability and security. </PARA>
<PARA> In international affairs, consistent expression has been given to Australia's concerns and actions such as our efforts in relation to the issues of world poverty, our decision to take part in the Sinai peacekeeping force, and our contributions through the Commonwealth have helped to build Australia's reputation as a forward-looking, outward-looking and reliable nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of tax avoidance, determined measures have been consistently applied-measures which are really biting into this anti-social industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of legal reform, the Human Rights Commission and now the freedom of information legislation-the first that will come into place nationally in a Westminster system-are effective measures to meet important community concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of environmental protection, the declaration last year of the new section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park gave further clear expression to the concern for the preservation of our environment which is so widely felt in the community, especially among young people. </PARA>
<PARA> In education, the issue of giving our young people the skills they need is being tackled and the increasing emphasis on technical and further education is an important element in this. </PARA>
<PARA> Families, especially those with low incomes who received little assistance from the old rebate arrangements, have been enormously assisted by the family allowance scheme which was introduced several years ago and family allowances were substantially increased for larger families from last January. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of social welfare, the automatic indexation of pensions has given income security to a very significant number of people in the community and assistance has been extended to particularly needy groups, such as pensioners facing high rents and sole parents on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obviously important that governments work to advance the wider opportunities and way of life which Australians want as well as working to secure and improve the material living standards of Australia's families. I believe that as a result of what has been achieved, Australia is now facing the future from a position of comparative strength for there is great underlying strength in this economy and, as I have said already, we are well placed to take advantage of future opportunities provided we work hard to maintain our strong position. </PARA>
<PARA>Challenges and Problems</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> But it is not only opportunities which lie ahead although they will surely come . As we look ahead, as we form our expectations for the future, we plainly need to recognize that there are also problems and challenges. It is our task to identify them, to explain them, to address them realistically and, having done that, to seek the co-operation of the community in coming to terms with them. One thing which is plain at the present time is that a fresher and sharper breeze is blowing through the markets of the world as our industrial competitors , faced with their own situation of no growth and unemployment, restructure their industries, as they improve their productivity and efficiency and as their inflation rates fall. When this is added to the fact that many markets are, if anything, shrinking rather than growing, it is clear that we shall have to fight harder to sell the exports on which our economic development depends. </PARA>
<PARA> This harder competition from overseas comes at a time when there are some problems on our own doorstep. Plainly, inflation remains at the forefront as the principal threat to this economy because while much has been achieved in pulling inflation back, there are substantial inflationary pressures in our economy at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> Demands for higher wages and shorter working hours have been contributing substantially to these pressures. And in Australia's present situation, there can be little doubt that excessive wage rises and damaging strikes are placing economic progress at serious risk. It is imperative that we recognise as a nation that wage rises which are beyond the capacity of the economy harm everyone and benefit no one. They cause higher inflation, they threaten our ability to compete on world markets and they create more unemployment. There is no doubt that wage restraint in the next few months is vital to us all for further wage increases at this time on top of the wage and shorter hours settlements of the last six months are beyond the capacity of the economy and time is needed to absorb the increases which have already taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me add that there is plainly a continuing need for an appropriately firm monetary policy. In present circumstances, with a weakened balance of payments and strong inflationary pressures, there could be no thought that the money supply would be allowed to expand to accommodate inflationary wage settlements. It is vastly important to us all that demands and expectations should be matched with economic reality as it now is both internationally and domestically. Whatever else may be arguable, there is no doubt that our overall level of economic growth places clear limits on the sustainable real wage increases which can occur. </PARA>
<PARA> We must never forget that everything, including wages, has to come out of what Australia is producing. Further limits on wage increases are imposed by the claims of needy and underprivileged people to share the benefits of prosperity and investors also have their legitimate claim for profits, which are the basis of the further investment on which future growth depends. As I have said on many occasions, Australia would benefit greatly from rational debate on the proper balance between these respective claims and I believe that such a debate could have a most valuable impact in helping every section of the community to decide what expectations are reasonable, what claims are legitimate and which demands ought to be moderated. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the industrial front where the level of strikes and industrial disputation is plainly a matter for the most serious concern. The Government is addressing the situation with some important legislative initiatives as part of an ongoing concern with reforming industrial relations. First among these initiatives will be the provision giving private employers a right of stand-down in strike situations to bring about a better balance in the bargaining position of unions and employers and to equalise their responsibility before the law. We believe that this measure will help to bring home to unions the real cost to the community of strike action and that it will help bring a degree of balance to the negotiating process. The second initiative is designed to put renewed vigour into efforts to achieve a restructuring of unions more in line with the needs of a modern Australian economy and to move away from a system rigidly tied to craft -based unions. And the third proposal, for voluntary unionism, seeks to protect the basic right of ordinary average Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is also addressing a number of industrial relations issues in co-operation with the States. Important concensus was reached at the recent Premiers Conference and labour Ministers have already met to consider options to facilitate handling of demarcation disputes and the development of a complementary industrial relations system. In considering the problem of demarcation disputes, the objective must be to protect both employers who are harmed and unions which are attacked. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premiers have also agreed to work with the Commonwealth in efforts to seek agreement with unions and shipping interests along the lines of the recommendations of the Crawford report, and to reduce the level of industrial disputation in the maritime and waterfront industries. Thus in co-operation with the States, and through our own legislative initiatives, we are taking a positive approach which should remove some of the hurdles in the path of industrial peace and bring a greater sense of responsibility into industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the threats to Australia's economic well-being posed by wage demands and industrial disputes, there are a number of other issues which are of great concern to the community which need to be explained and addressed with balance and realism. Home ownership is one issue which is causing very considerable concern in much of the community and nobody wants Australia's high level of home ownership to be damaged. The issue is complex. There are three inter-related problems: The availability of funds, the high interest rates which currently prevail, and the high cost of houses, especially in some cities. At the present time, the Government has this issue under close review and the Government will in due course announce the policy changes it believes are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation is a further issue of great concern to the entire community and I want to reaffirm that it is the policy of the Government to make further income tax reductions when it is economically responsible to do so. The present tax levels concern the Government as they concern many people in the community and it is important to remember the major taxation reforms which the Government has implemented, including initiatives such as the doubling of the rebate for dependent spouses which has taken place, the deductibility of superannuation contributions up to $1,200 a year for self-employed persons and others not covered by employer-sponsored schemes, the abolition of death duties, and the tax rebate for health insurance. The cost to revenue-and I think this is not generally understood-of these initiatives alone is well over a billion dollars a year. It is important, when the community considers taxation levels, to be aware of a number of critical factors-the implications for the Budget of an aging population, the need for increased defence expenditure, and the need to pull back earlier Budget deficits drastically. Consistent with factors such as these, the Government's commitment to lower taxes and greater spending power is clear and we shall continue to follow those policies which provide the only basis for sustainable tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sought to draw the House's attention to some of the major factors which need to be taken into account by the Australian people as we look to the future and seek to match our expectations with reality. Many of the issues which we are facing are complex. Many of the problems do not offer easy solutions and the right balance between competing claims is in many cases difficult to find. But, of course, it is not unusual for a situation to exist in which expectations are greater than can be satisfied, in which different groups within the community are making claims which are inconsistent with each other, in which some claims can be satisfied only at the expense of others, in which some short term aims conflict with longer term objectives. It is easy for people in pursuing their own objectives to overlook the claims of others and put at risk the source of the future well-being of everyone in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of the vast majority of Australians are plain. As a nation, we seek rising standards of living. We seek more dollars in taxpayers' pockets. We seek an increasingly compassionate society. We seek wider opportunities and greater scope for people to develop their talents. We seek greater security for all our people. We seek increasingly efficient public institutions. We seek the conservation of our heritage and our environment and much more as well. All of these objectives are consistent with each other and a balanced policy approach commits us to pursuing them all. But we plainly cannot pursue all or any of them as fast as we would wish. Indeed, in times of economic difficulty and stagnation overseas, we may be committed to pursuing them far more slowly than we would wish because one thing which is vastly important is that in pursuing these objectives, we cannot afford to destroy economic growth itself. Without growth, all our other efforts and objectives will come to nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that Australia's growth rate in the last two years has been almost twice the OECD average and it is significant that the OECD predicts a growth rate of over 3 per cent for Australia in this calendar year against an OECD average of just over 1 per cent. There is growth in this economy but we cannot take the future for granted. In a situation of international uncertainty and world economic downturn, where our own growth is held back by the no-growth situation of other economies, we must surely accept as a community the need to avoid putting at risk the present strength of this economy. In dealing with these issues, it is imperative that we weigh up our own claims and expectations against the kind of growing Australia which we want to build for our children, considering both in the light of the real opportunities which are open to Australia in the interdependent world in which we live because only in that way can we reach responsible conclusions on the decisions which lie before us both as individuals and as a nation.

There are no apologies for the damage which has been inflicted on Australia and Australians in the past six years of the Fraser Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We find in the course of the address that a new offender has been discovered as being responsible for our economic problems-the Australian public. Their fault is that they expect too much. We find that another offender has been discovered- the world. The world will not respond to their expectations. There is only one cause, one fault responsible for the problems of this country today-it is the Fraser Government. Scourge the Fraser Government from office and we will have taken the most significant positive step towards remedying the problems that confront Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> Four weeks ago the Prime Minister was given an opportunity to speak to the Parliament, to defend his Government's policies, to explain what it was he is about. It has taken him four weeks of anguished labour to produce this statement . Only he could convert a mountain into a mole hill. What has happened in the intervening period? The Prime Minister has been smoked out. He has been smoked out by the by-election in Lowe. He has been smoked out by the State election in Victoria. He has been smoked out by the incipient mutiny in his own ranks. He has been smoked out by the jockeying of Lynch, Howard and Peacock, all wanting to replace him. He has been smoked out by the conflict, the contradiction and the downright disagreement with what he stands for by his Minister Carrick and his back bencher Groom. This is a government in disarray. The Prime Minister not only does not have the confidence of the community; he also does not have even the confidence of his own party. </PARA>
<PARA> Have we ever witnessed in the history of this nation a situation where a seat, an electorate traditionally safely Liberal, has been handed across to the Opposition by the declaration of the Prime Minister? He will not stand up and fight. Can there be any more clear confession of the acknowledged failure of the Government in economic management? The fact is that the Prime Minister is giving away Lowe because he does not have the confidence, he does not have the self- respect, to get out there and defend the Government's policies. That is because they are not defensible. There have been too many wasted years in this country under the Fraser Government, a description immortalised by Sir Billy McMahon, one of the people closer to the Prime Minister than most people in this country or the Parliament. He knows the Prime Minister; he knows what he is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> The self-indulgence of the Prime Minister this afternoon is repudiated by the public record-not by the Opposition, not by the trade unions, not by the taxpayers who are wincing under the load of the highest taxation bill ever, not by the home buyers who are being forced to put their homes onto a collapsing market and suffer losses, and not by the hordes of people who are being disadvantaged day to day, year in and year out, by the stubborn persistence of the Fraser Government with policies that have taken us nowhere but backwards. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us listen to what the newspapers have had to say. The Government does not listen to the ordinary people, the Opposition or anyone who might have an axe to grind. After all, that would take too much time. It would involve 14.75 million Australians. The Australian stated: 'Black day for jobs, housing and exports'. The Melbourne Herald stated: 'Interest shock: Up again'. The Sydney Morning Herald stated: 'Survey points to a gloomy Australian economy'. The Melbourne Age said: 'Outlook bleak on jobs, trade'. The Canberra Times stated: 'Gloomy year for industry'. The Sydney Daily Telegraph said: 'Lynch stirs hornets nest on pensions'. The Liberal-National Country Party Government has to be going bad for the Murdoch newspapers to criticise it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look in more detail at what has been said about this Government. The Prime Minister told us today that this Government is better equipped to handle the difficult times which are ahead of us. Dr Peter Sheehan of the Melbourne University on 26 January this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The unique opportunity offered by Australia's resources boom is being thrown away by inadequate economic policies, high interest rates, tight money and increased wage inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Age of 29 January stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has portrayed itself as one with the answer to inflation. That claim is now doubtful. The Government will talk--Mr Howard is an expert at it, almost the Minister in charge of Bad News--of singular circumstances, accidents, special events. All such talk misses the point. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney Morning Herald survey of banks and other economists a few weeks ago concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> After six years of Fraserism, the major economic problems remain as intractable as ever and probably are worsening . . . The potential from the opening years of the resources ''boom'' have been largely squandered. </PARA>
<PARA>The Fraser Government has a record of excellent opportunities which have been squandered and lost. The community pays the price. The Prime Minister, through his state of the nation address, declared that the Fraser Government is the Government for hard times. Certainly it has had more experience with hard times in the post-war period than has any other government. It has been practising for the last six years. Australians have had to suffer as a result of it. The Prime Minister blames it all on the world. He says the problems will be intensified by the condition of the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put a few simple propositions to the Prime Minister and members of the Government. If the rest of the world sets the pace and the direction of the economy in this country, as the Prime Minister declared today and as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has declared on other occasions, let the Government answer this: How come petrol prices are not to go down as they are in the rest of the world? How come interest rates are not to go down as they are in the United States of America? The Treasurer has declared repeatedly in public and in the Parliament that we have high interest rates because they are high in America. He has said: 'We cannot put them down because they are high in America'. We now find the Government is equivocating. It is to look for another scapegoat. Petrol prices are going down elsewhere but the Government, through its greed, wants to keep the price up in Australia because it wants to hang on to the revenue which it grabs from ordinary Australians as the highest taxing government in this country's history. Interest rates are going down in America. The Government will keep them up here, in spite of its fictitious alibis in the past, because it has become the mouthpiece for the financial institutions in the banking world in this country. It does not give a damn for home buyers, small business, the small farmers and a host of other people who are being racked by the interest rate charges which apply in this country today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has said that we have done better than the rest of the world and that the rest of the world sets the standard. Let me raise a few factual propositions for the Prime Minister from the statistics of the organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Prime Minister has said that we have done better than the OECD has done in recent years. He has said that the rest of the world sets the standard. In the major seven OECD countries unemployment averaged 5.5 per cent between 1976 and 1981. The total for the OECD was 5.5 per cent. For Australia the figure was closer to 6 per cent. We did not do that much better after all. The Government is using Phil Lynch's principle of using rubbery figures when in trouble. Consumer prices in the major seven OECD countries went up by less than 9 per cent for the same period. The total figure for the OECD was a little over 9 per cent. For Australia consumer prices went up by a figure approaching 11 per cent. How much better is the record of this Government? If the rest of the world sets the circumstances for this country, why did we not do as well as the rest of the world?</PARA>
<PARA> Growth, which is important, generates wealth, determines people's living standards and what government and the private sector can do. For the major seven OECD countries growth increased by over 3.2 per cent. For the OECD in total it was a little better than 3 per cent. Australia was struggling to make 2.7 per cent. Let us understand something. In the last half of the last decade the industrialised countries of the world had the intervening redemption after the collapse of the 1970s economic recovery, reducing unemployment and effectively reduced inflation. This was not achieved by the Fraser Government. All we got was more of the same-the same sort of punishment, the same sort of bankruptcies and the same sort of unremitting toughness for households in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did we go the wrong way if the rest of the world sets the target? The Prime Minister, of course, is seeking to set the scene. He will try to condition people to accept the proposition that it is all beyond this country; it is all beyond his Government. I would agree with the latter, no matter how simple the challenge. The fact is that the Government cannot blame the rest of the world. Domestic conditions generated by Fraser Government policies, overviewed by the Prime Minister himself, are responsible for a far greater level of damage to this country now, and will be in the future, than world conditions, no matter how difficult, can be blamed for. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation is increasing in this country not because of world conditions but because of the Government. The Government has increased charges for health insurance. It has increased costs for essential commodities by way of indirect taxes. It has increased petrol prices. In this country we have the highest real interest rates of any indutrialised country in the world. So the Government is not satisfied with imposing on Australians the highest tax burden which they have ever had to bear. It inflicts on them the highest real interest rates of any of the industrialised countries in the world. Petrol is too expensive because of Government greed. If the Government were to reduce the price of petrol in line with the reductions by suppliers which are taking place world wide, Government revenue would go down by $112m and profits for its generous bank rolling backers in the corporate sector would go down by $22m. The Government will not instigate either. We have one of the highest tax bills in the world. This year in income tax we will be paying 25 per cent more in that one area alone than all of the tax revenue that was collected in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister rails about industrial harmony but he is the Leader of the Government. He is the architect of the Government's policy of industrial confrontation. How genuine and consistent is the Government? A few weeks ago the Prime Minister asserted to the community a commitment towards working to establish industrial harmony. He correctly recognised that there was too much conflict. In the period since then Sir Billy McMahon has retired from the seat of Lowe and there is to be a by-election. We suddenly find that we are back to where we have always been-when in electoral trouble, confront, assault and abuse the trade union movement and try to create division and distraction in the community. His Government is responsible for unemployment rising again. It is sheer nonsense and a shabby fiction to come into this House, as the Prime Minister does, and suggest that there are at work elements which are released from outside this country and which are beyond the control of this nation. I repeat: It is a difficult time but there is no shortage of will and commitment by the people of this country to confront these difficult times and to overcome them as they have confronted and overcome difficult times successfully in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The crisis rests not with the Australian people but with the leadership of the nation under Malcolm Fraser. One cannot expect people to sit back and remain indifferent when every week that goes by, through some pretext or other, through some snide device or other, the Government is whittling away their living standards. The living standards of the average family today would have to be increased by $20 a week to give it the same real disposable spending power that it had in 1975. The people know it and they resent it. They will try to re- establish their living standards when they can see-as I will come to in a few minutes-the privileged groups in the community doing so well and when there is nothing but distress for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister says, with that grand- iloquence which rolls off his lips very much as a steamroller moves over a bumpy road, that the living standards of Australian families have been improved. That is like trying to sell snake oil to a literate audience. It is a fake. I will tell honourable members what has happened to living standards in this country under the Fraser Government, the taxing Government, the highest taxing Government in the history of this country. These are the sorts of things it has done. There has been a $10 a week drop in living standards because payments to private health insurance funds have effectively been imposed as a private tax on average families. There has been a $20 a week increase in repayments on the average housing mortgage because interest rates have been skyrocketing, and they will rise even more. There has been, or will have been, with the full package of the Government's indirect taxes, a $5 a week increase in the cost of living because of that package. There has been a $15 a week increase in the cost of living in petrol taxes because of the Government's taxing policies. There has been a $15 a week increase in personal income tax for the average income earner. If the average income earner, proportionate to income, paid the same tax that he was paying in 1975 under the scales that I introduced then as Treasurer he would be paying $15 a week less. There is some of the evidence as to how people's living standards have not been just eroded away but hacked away in a brutal and unremitting way by the Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes the statement we have before us as a literate exposition of what the Prime Minister is dedicated to, the national management of this country is built on economic waffle. Let us look at some of the promises we have had. As recently as 12 months ago the Prime Minister said, and I quote him exactly:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's success in winding back inflation has been a precondition for the substantial progress in reducing interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>He must think he can do it with magic mirrors. In November 1977 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates have begun to fall . . . they will keep falling . . . Once the election is over, we will start to move in the consummation of a 2 per cent reduction in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to declare a fall in interest rates on housing mortgages. That never happened. They continued to go up. He stated.:</PARA>
<PARA> We will fully index personal income tax for inflation over 3 years. </PARA>
<PARA>He would prefer to forget about that. He declared in 1975:</PARA>
<PARA> We will maintain Medibank. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one promise that the Fraser Government could not keep. I give this commitment now: That is a promise which we give and we will keep it for it. In 1975 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> We stand by our commitment to abolish means test on pensions. </PARA>
<PARA>Then, of course, we have the most fetching undertaking of all in that campaign:</PARA>
<PARA> I'd like to have a government which people can trust. </PARA>
<PARA>All of those promises and more were solemnly given and crudely and cynically violated. The problem with the Prime Minister is that he has no more credit at the public bank of goodwill and trust when he asked to be taken on his word. His performance is against him. </PARA>
<PARA> If I could adapt the immortal words of Alex- ander Haig-admittedly used in another context-this Government is run by a bunch of duplicitous bastards. Eighteen months ago we were told by this Government that constantly makes and breaks promises that we were on the doorstep of a golden age. The mineral boom was about to take off. Let us have a look at what the record shows. The Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony), the man responsible for this belief, encouraged people to believe that there would be a boom. In July last year he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are in the midst of what has inevitably but unfortunately been called a resources boom. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I am certain that . . . what is occurring right now will lift our economy significantly, and permanently, on to a higher growth plateau opening up better and more wide-ranging possibilities for our society . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What happened to that boom? We heard today from the Prime Minister that there is an extraordinary level of investment in business. But what about the ordinary people, the little people, the people out in the suburbs, the people who are conducting small businesses which are the backbone of this country, which really are innovative and competitive because these people cannot shore themselves up against the forces of the economy. What about the small farmer? Why are they not sharing in this wealth that the Prime Minister is always talking about? The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick), when speaking on this issue, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing with the prospective resources boom in Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The resources boom in Australia comes about for two reasons . . . Secondly and most importantly the resources boom comes about . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I just stress the words 'resources boom'. We were told that all we had to do was to sit back in a comfortable chair, strap on our safety belt and our crash helmet and we would take off to the biggest boom that was ever going to occur. What has happened in less than 12 months? August was the last time when the Minister for Trade and Resources declared that we were about to take off into this new Eldorado. There can be only one explanation-that the Government botched it again, that once again it snarked the economy. Lewis Carroll could just as easily have scripted the economic strategy of this Government. If I may, for light diversion, quote one stanza from the 'Hunting of the Snark' which really sums up more effectively than anything I have come across what government economic strategy is:</PARA>
<PARA>But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,</PARA>
<PARA> And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,</PARA>
<PARA>Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,</PARA>
<PARA> That the ship would not travel due West!</PARA>
<PARA>That is what is wrong with the economy today. The Prime Minister talks about world currents but he takes us in the opposite direction when they are in our favour; and now he is saying, when they are not in our favour, we will have to go in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now witnessing the lastest search for scapegoats, for the people who will have to take the blame for the Government's failures. We have seen a long list of them before. They have been the trade unions and government advisers, they have been the Public Service and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. You name them, the Prime Minister has thought of them. One would have thought that he had exhausted all possibilities, but there are new ones coming up. I refer to the Budget deficit. We heard today the mea culpa of the Treasurer (Mr Howard), with his George Washington hat on back to front. I started to declare then, and I declare now on the basis of the reliable information that has been conveyed to me, that there is only one credible explanation for that mea culpa. It is simply this: The Public Service, particularly the Department of Finance, has made it clear that it will not take the blame for what it knows to be a Government failure. It has declared that the information about the blow out on the deficit has been available to the Government not for weeks but for months. For all that, the Prime Minister, in a rather craven way, has sought to impugn the integrity and the ability of the Public Service by saying that the Government is suddenly overwhelmed; it is inconceivable that such an event could have occurred, that the Public Service maintains constant monitoring over what is happening with regard to expenditure and revenue and regularly advises the Government of the process of these things. What happened is that the Prime Minister, again caught out on economic management, with the deficit blowing out by more than $1,000m, looked around for a scapegoat and concluded that he had not done the Public Service over for a while, it was muted by Public Service Act restrictions, so he thought he would put the boot in there. He came a cropper. The Public Service, or some people in the Public Service, were prepared at a pinch to go public on this matter if the record was not rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the other group of scapegoats, one of the most dependent groups in our midst-the pensioners. We now understand quite clearly that the Government intends to move, at what it regards as a propitious moment, to introduce asset testing on pensioners. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that there is no proposition before him, pushing it to one side of the table in order to make sure that it is to one side. But we know very well that in the months ahead the intention that has been frequently declared by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to reintroduce this sort of asset testing will be consummated. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the facts? The facts are that the payment of pensions as a proportion of the payment of total income support benefits has gone down. It was over 67 per cent of the total in 1974. It is less than 55 per cent today. Secondly, the total welfare income support bill has gone up very largely because within that total proportion the money going to the unemployed, who are the casualties of the Fraser Government's policies, has gone up some four times from a little over 3 per cent to nearly 14 per cent of the total. Let me put that another way, a simpler way. If we had full employment in this country today we would be saving more than $800m on unemployment benefits, enough to increase the age pension by $9 a week. The pensioners are not at fault. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, it is being argued that by the turn of the century there will be a far higher proportion of people who will be of retiring age and eligible to draw on the pension. It will go from about 10 per cent to over 13 per cent. That is an irrefutable fact. But what is equally irrefutable is that that happens because we are becoming an aged population. The proportion of dependent young at the same time will go down, and by a much greater proportion. The consequence overall is that, in terms of the income support bill and the general welfare support bill that the Government will have to sustain, there will be no net addition to that burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us kick right out this nonsense, this fiction, that it is all the fault of the pensioners, that there are millionaire pensioners who are getting the pension, and accordingly all pensioners who have some sort of modest savings salted away should be subjected to a particularly inclement means test. How sincere can a government be, anyway, when it is talking about austerity at the margin, which is vicious in its impact on the more dependent people in the community, and only a fortnight earlier it blithely entered into the purchase of HMS Invincible, or, as it will be called by the Minister for Defence, HMAS Irresolute? It took long enough to get here; it took long enough to get a decision. We are to pay $500m for that. In spite of all the problems that it will create for the defence budget, in spite of all the fiscal problems that it will create overall, and in spite of the problems that it will create on our external balance of payments, the expenditure of that sum is no problem; it is for defence! But when it comes to ordinary people who are struggling and battling, who are having a very difficult time of it in Australia today, the Government wants to pinchpenny even more. </PARA>
<PARA> How is the Government-this businessman's government that knows how to run the corporate affairs of this country, if I may use what I regard as an objectionable analogy but the sort of thing that conservatives like to draw on when they are talking to a local progress association-handling the economy? If this country is well run, it will not be run into hock; it will not be run into a level of debt externally which creates extraordinarily difficult problems. This Government was the government that declared a virtue of avoiding overseas borrowings in 1975. I do not know whether the facts are recognised, but they are fairly startling: Within a few weeks, we shall have an overseas debt in excess of $5,500 million. We shall have, to back that up as currency assets held overseas, no more than $800 million. No business undertaking would try to run its affairs with a borrowing ratio of 80 per cent or a 20 per cent asset backing . </PARA>
<PARA> When we went out of government, as Treasurer I presided over a situation in which our overseas indebtedness was reducing and was below $1,000 million, in which our overseas reserves exceeded $3,000 million in foreign currencies-a very healthy situation. It has all been squandered away. The per household debt to pay for this overseas borrowing-borrowing overseas is quite unwise, with consequences that can be quite dangerous at present-has risen six times to over $1,200 million. I apologise for all the figures, but they ought to go on record. This is supposed to be the businessman's government which operates according to prudent fiscal principles. It does not do that. It is reckless in the way in which it prodigiously borrows overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, if one looks at what is happening on the money markets, one sees where the confidence is. In more recent times there has been a big shift in where the money is going. It is not going into the finance institutions, where it can go out as longer term investment, going out in turn for longer term investment in the development of this country. It is increasingly going into the short end of the money market. Fixed deposits, certificates of deposit, have increased by some 21 per cent the amount of liquidity in that area. The amount of liquidity that is generated from what is called M1, trading banks cash and so on, has increased by less than 6 per cent. So the Government can look at an average figure overall and say, 'We are sticking to our target of 10 per cent', but when one starts disaggregating it and analysing it one sees therein the seeds for enormous and sustained economic instability. </PARA>
<PARA> It means, in a nutshell, in economist terms, that no one who is informed in the money markets believes that interest rates will come down, that the smart money is investing in hedging on the short term market expecting that rates will rise- and they will rise. They will rise after the Lowe by-election and after the Victorian State election, and they will rise in Australian savings bonds by at least one per cent, which means that they will rise on housing mortgages by at least one per cent, which means that there will be even more distress in that area in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Can one invest any confidence in the businessman's government, especially when there is a man such as Sir Phillip Lynch in charge of industry and commerce? If one had put $100,000 into the share market in blue chip shares the day after the last federal election, today, as a result of the erosion of inflation and the flight of confidence on the share market, one would have an asset holding worth about $50,000-that is, in about 16 or 17 months, the real worth of one's lifetime savings, which one has drawn on through computation from a superannuation fund, has been cut in half. That is the sort of security that the Fraser Government offers. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has the Prime Minister not discussed some of these rather critical questions that really undermine confidence and security in Australia? Why did he not discuss in detail the tough time that the home building industry is having, where financial approvals from major lenders are down by 20 per cent in 12 months, where the increase in interest rates of some 3 per cent in the past many months has added $20,000 to the repayments on a $30,000 mortgage? With another one per cent increase, effectively the cost of the mortgage would have been doubled by the Fraser Government's policies. Why did not the Prime Minister, when he evinced, he claimed, some heartrending concern for the poor in our community, discuss the revelations of the Redfern legal services that poor people in Sydney are being forced to pay up to 120 per cent to unsecured fringe finance institutions to borrow enough money to get along from day to day? Why did he not discuss the fact that 280,000 people are homeless, that a quarter of a million Australians are in makeshift dwellings, that 80,000 people are on waiting lists for welfare housing, and that since he has been Prime Minister the net financial allocations for welfare housing to the States have been slashed from nearly $600m to $50m?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister talks about concern about the size of government. It is a fraudulent concern. Since he has been in government, he has trans- ferred items out of the Federal Budget across to semi-government instrumentalities and State governments, where these things have to be funded directly. If one looks at the total spending of the public sector since the Prime Minister has been in government, compared with our period in government when it was an average of a little over 35 per cent of gross domestic product, one finds that it is now well over 38 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> Government has not been reduced. It has become more intrusive. It has become more punitive, and it serves the interests and expectations of privileged groups . But in the meantime it is ordinary people who are being disadvantaged, who have to pay more for health insurance, who have to pay more for essential commodities, and who have to pay more to drive their cars in pursuit of work, and who have to endure the humiliation of being unemployed for extended periods.</PARA>
<PARA> We are now-the Prime Minister did not discuss this-well moved into a nasty credit squeeze. It will intensify in the months ahead. Interest rates will rise. There is a very large shortfall of liquidity needed in the community that the Government just will not cover as its policies now stand. Those policies are too severe and too restrictive. They will do damage to a number of financial institutions and to a large number of small businesses. They will be particularly punitive to households in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude. What all this comes down to is that 6 1/2 years of the worst government that this country has known has been reduced to 10 pages of Alice in Wonderland propaganda. It loftily proclaims about the nation's and the Parliament's need to keep abreast of the great economic events, and how everything would be all right if only everybody was as clever and as sensible as the Prime Minister. But there is not one word of acknowledgement and not a single hint of apology for the fact that the lives and well-being and the sheer hope of tens of thousands of Australians have been screwed by this Government for almost seven years, and for what?</PARA>
<PARA> I will tell honourable members what the Government can do. It can cut taxes to boost consumer spending. It can regulate interest rates and directly assist home buyers. It can reintroduce universal health insurance and ease the huge cost burden on families. It can abandon its new sales taxes. It can devalue the dollar. It can help reduce inflation by abandoning Government measures which directly add to price increases. It can co-operate with the trade union movement in a prices and incomes policy. All of these measures are immediately open to the Government if it is really determined to turn the Australian economy around from the severe recession into which it is plunging. In other words, it can stop blaming everyone else when things go wrong and face up to its national responsibilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the conviction that the Australian people need to have an understanding of the economic situation and the effects of the current world situation on Australia and the economic uncertainty throughout the world today. It is a pity that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), did not attempt to give some positive leadership instead of, as usual, trying to sow confusion and discord in a debate which is of national importance. Frankly, I am disappointed at his very negative contribution, poetry and all, but I am not surprised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the six years he has been Leader of the Opposition, since he played such a disastrous role in the overwhelming defeat of the Labor Government-one of the greatest defeats of any government in Australia-he has not made one positive contribution in an economic debate in this House. All we have heard is his usual ranting and raving. Instead of the Leader of the Opposition giving us a reasoned argument as to how we should attack these problems, all we have heard from him is bitterness. Instead of positive proposals we have heard whinging and his high -flown twaddle. Instead of acting like the alternative Prime Minister of this country, all he has shown is vindictiveness against the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter what the Leader of the Opposition says about the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister has been in office longer than any Australian Labor Party Prime Minister since the federation of this country. That in itself shows a proven record. I suppose it is little wonder that he has a better record than any Labor Prime Minister because in the last 60 years there have been only 14 years of a Labor government being in office, and that was too much for the Australian people. I think it will be a good many years before we see another Labor government in office. Of course, whenever we have a Labor government in office, it is there for only three years and then it is out for another 20. The results speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition has been chiming in with the media and trying to make mischief about what people might have said about a means test on pensions or this and that, but what about his own party? What about Senator Grimes? On Monday this week he said that there should be an assets test as well as an incomes test on age pension eligibility. Goodness me! One of the leading spokesmen of the Opposition has said just the thing the Leader of the Opposition is trying to accuse us of having said. The Leader of the Oppostion talked about a record borrowing. Certainly this Government has been borrowing for infrastructure purposes for the development of this country. But we all remember the illegal $4,000m that the Labor Government was trying to borrow when it was in office. We all remember what it wanted it for; the nationalisation of the resources of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a marked difference between the approach of the Labor Party and the approach of this Government to the economic development of this country, the building of its prosperity and the well-being of its people. Labor's approach is the way of socialism. Honourable members will hear members of the Labor Party roar 'socialism', the old word. They can cover it up and camouflage it however they like. Labor's policy is for more government intervention and more government intrusion. Why the Labor Party continues to worship at the tomb of this worn-out philosophy I will never know. Obviously it is the lure of power and authority that motivates the Labor Party. But it is a worn-out philosophy and not one that the Australian people will ever accept. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party strategy is to divide the nation, to sow the seeds of bitterness and fear and to intimidate any person or organisation daring to question it. Labor's vision of Australia involves turning it into a giant, grey post office where everything not forbidden is compulsory. Its vision involves putting Australia under the heavy fist of an all-knowing central government; an Australia whose people are taxed more and more heavily for the privilege of being regimented by a bloated bureaucracy and dictated to by the trade unions. Well that is not my vision of Australia and it is not the vision of my party or this Government. This Government recognises that the wealth of this country, and the wealth of all its people, comes from its great productive private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The engine for the creation of wealth in this country is a strong, vigorous and internationally competitive private sector which can take maximum advantage of the international and domestic opportunities. We have worked to create the conditions in which Australian industry is outward looking and helping Australians through the wealth it generates and the jobs it provides for people. One major factor underpinning the growth of the Australian economy in the last few years has been the strength of the world interest in our mineral and energy resources. This interest has been reflected in the strong rise in investment. In turn, this investment has given our economy a considerably higher growth rate than the economies of most other Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development countries. Over the next decade Australia will continue to be a major world supplier of minerals and energy resources. Indeed, it will become more significant and play an even greater role in the world economy and the growth of this region of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two factors which are vital to the development of our resources and it is these that I wish to concentrate on this afternoon. They are the state of the world economy and our own international competitiveness. The effects of the current state of the world resources market are reflected in the dismal annual reports being released by our major mining groups. Nevertheless, at a time when such a world economy has been suffering from recession, Australia's economic performance has been strong. The slow-down in the world economy has meant that the demand for many of our major export commodities has declined and prices have been affected. The severe drought in 1980 reduced the availability of many of our exports and stock levels are still low. On the other hand, imports have kept growing strongly, largely because of the steep rise in capital equipment associated with accelerated energy resource development. Although our trade outlook remains uncertain because of the uncertainty of world economic prospects , there is hope that the rapid deterioration of our trade account is ending. Some improvement in world economic activity is expected towards the end of this year. In the view of the OECD, international developments in 1982-83 are likely to be more favourable for Australia than for many other countries. Our rural exports are also likely to recover, given more normal seasonal conditions, and our import growth is not expected to continue at the extremely high rates of the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate for me to remind the House and all Australians that our current economic conditions clearly show the stupidity of Labor's plan for a resource rent tax. It would be a disaster for the Australian mining industry and those employed in it. Mining ventures need to be confident that the profits which can be expected in good years will not be creamed off by stupid, greedy governments which do not understand the risks involved and the traumas that the mining industry has to suffer during bad years. Labor's resource rent tax would remove the basic element that keeps the mining industry going through good years and bad, that is, the profit incentive. Take that away and this country would revert to the position under a previous Labor Government in which not a single major resource development took place. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Australia is well placed in the resources area, we must never forget that it is only one of a number of resource rich countries to which buyers can turn. Our success and prospects for jobs and wealth, now and in the future, depend very much on maintaining our hard-won reputation as a sound, reliable, competitive supplier. The foundations of that reputation are in danger of being damaged. It is a reputation which depends very much on the intangible qualities of trust and confidence, and those qualities are being stretched to the limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial disputes have seriously affected all of Australia's trade. The situation on the waterfront in recent months has been the despair of anyone who realises how vital trade is to our national prosperity. It has seriously affected our trade in minerals. In the long term these conditions can significantly limit our future exports by encouraging existing customers to diversify their sources of supply and potential customers to look elsewhere. They can also put downward pressure on the prices we receive for our exports. The Government has done and continues to do all it can to reduce industrial disruption. Unfortunately, as I have pointed out, governments cannot pass laws to make people work if they flatly refuse to do so. Governments can legislate to protect certain of their rights. Governments can help with their organisational structure and they can assist in the disputes settling procedures. We have done all of these things. We have provided rights to protect individual unionists. We have introduced secret postal ballots for federal union management elections. We have extended the grounds for deregistration of unions and simplified the procedures. We have introduced legislation providing for secret ballots before strikes and we have banned secondary boycotts under the Trade Practices Act. We are now studying further measures which have already been outlined by my ministerial colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> The initiatives of the Commonwealth, however, have been seriously undermined in States where the Labor Party is in power. Labor governments, particularly the Wran Government in New South Wales, have caved in time after time to union demands. Perhaps 'caved in' is the wrong choice of words. The fact is, of course , that the Labor Party is a creature of the trade union movement which pays its bills. The Wran Labor Government in New South Wales, like the Whitlam Government in the early 1970s, has joined willingly in a rort on wages and conditions, boosting the power of the already militant elements of the trade union movement. The effects of Labor's captive role as a servant of the trade union movement can easily be seen in the resources sector. Mr Wran's management of the energy resource industries in New South Wales has been as negligent as his mismanagement of the State's electricity supplies. The most obvious example of a basic lack of direction and backbone in New South Wales is in the area of coal export. Today the ships which can be seen moored off the ports of Newcastle and Port Kembla are being dubbed Wran's navy. The Wran Government's failure to bite the bullet on resource development is nowhere clearer than in this area of transport. We have the wrangle with the unions over who is going to man the proposed Newcastle loader. We have the decision to build a new loader at Port Kembla instead of Botany Bay. Goodness me, this indecision is costing the coal mining industry of New South Wales something like $190m. This enormous cost is incurred because that Government cannot make up its mind. It cannot be positive. It is run by the trade union movement which is its master. It is a puppet of the trade union movement, and everybody knows it. That is why the Australian people will always be concerned about relying on the Australian Labor Party to manage the economic affairs of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has clearly outlined that this Government has taken a very firm and positive approach to handling the economy of this country under difficult circumstances. </PARA>

The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) has blamed everybody except the Government for the miseries of Australians at present. He said that 'Wran's navy' is to blame. Let me put the position in perspective. 'Wran's navy' is in no danger from Fraser's aircraft carrier; no danger at all. The only danger is that the carrier might collide with one of those ships. It certainly could not attack those ships. The big issue in this debate is what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said today. Let us get away from the abuse, the raking over of the old coals of the Sankey conspiracy case. I invite honourable members opposite to have the courage to find out who paid Sankey's costs. We have asked this question in this place 45 times. An amount of $75,000 was paid by a little old lady who drew on an account at the ANZ bank in Burwood. Which one of you people on the Government side put up the money? Why do you not come clean? You people who sit opposite talk about conspiracy charges. You are worried about what has happened to Bill Hayden's leadership. We won an additional 13 seats in the last election. You people forgot to mention that. After the next election you people will be out of business. We are happy to accept an election challenge at any time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The points which need to be discussed in this debate are those set out in the speech of the Prime Minister, not the speech of the Deputy Prime Minister. A couple of weeks ago the Labor Party moved a motion of censure on the basis of whether the Government would explain its economic policy. The Government gagged that debate after putting up only the Treasurer (Mr Howard) as the fall guy for all its supporters. One was enough. We were not allowed to have Question Time that day. The Prime Minister marched out of the House saying: 'If you don't behave yourselves better there will be no Question Time tomorrow'. What an incredible situation! Admittedly the two Thursday sitting days after that day would have been two of the blackest Thursdays one would ever see in the life of this Parliament. For once the Government had to allow the Speaker to take control of the Parliament. On the last Thursday sitting day we went through the nonsense of trying to debate Poland as the situation existed in 1980 rather than discuss unemployment, the matter of public importance proposed by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). That illustrates the standard of debate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite honourable members to have a look at this last will and testament of the Prime Minister. He certainly has a terminal political life; we can tell you that. Have a look at this document. What does it tell us? It says that the world is full of uncertainty. What an incredible thing for us to find out. He said that because of this uncertainty and because of the danger we have to step back from the cut and thrust of everyday politics. He said we have to talk about the problems of the nation. Surely to goodness the cut and thrust of everyday politics in this place relates to what is troubling the community. It is not a question of what is troubling Mr Fraser or somebody else; it is a question of what is troubling the community. The cut and thrust of what we say in this Parliament relates very much to what is on the minds of people throughout the community. I was amazed to hear the Deputy Prime Minister say a few seconds ago that everything is going to get better later this year because the Prime Minister said in his last will and testament that we will all be practically dead by the end of 1982. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> In Europe and North America, economic growth has virtually come to a standstill . . . By the second half of 1982, total Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development unemployment is expected to rise to 28.5 million people, compared with just over 21 million in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is the evidence of this remarkable improvement? Is this not an indictment of this Government? The 1975 policy speech of this Government said that the Liberals were going to turn on the lights. In 1977 the slogan was: 'We have the job done'. In 1980 the Government did not even give a title to its policy speech . It was too ashamed of the situation, but it gave us a lot of rhetoric. I remind the house of the rhetoric of 1980 compared with the demise of the Prime Minister as evidenced here today. On 30 September 1980 we were told in a statement from the Liberal Party of Australia: 'Today a new spirit, a new enthusiasm, a new dynamism is at work in Australia. A new confidence is alive. Our financial position is the envy of many. Business expectations are high. The optimism of overseas investors has been restored. Our balance of trade was the best for a decade. We achieved the best employment growth for 10 years. Australia is the best place in the world to live in'. Today we have had a litany of misery from the Prime Minister who said: 'What a dreadful problem the world is in. The world is so uncertain and unemployment has become worse than ever. Inflation is enormous and we have to try to work together to manage this economy .'</PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who have been in Lowe in recent days-I do not suppose many Government members have-will know that the people in Lowe are about to cast a verdict on whether the Government is guilty or not guilty. I wager now that it will be condemned on the very issue that it has not been able to fulfil any of the promises it has made. In December 1977 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Once the election is over, we will start to move to the consummation of a 2 per cent reduction in interest rates-and that means about $500 a year for someone on an average home loan. </PARA>
<PARA>The forecast of the futures market is that by June the interest rate will be 19. 8 per cent. That is the position. Why does the Government opt out of all its responsibilities to the nation? The Government talks about how the Budget will now balloon out. I might add that in the statement by the Prime Minister he praised himself for how he has been able to contract the Budget by about one per cent. However, the Treasurer said today that it is going to balloon out further.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer says it is not. He can make another explanation. He talked about the crude oil levy being a problem. Let us talk briefly about that fundamental issue. The crude oil levy was espoused by the government as a conservation measure, not a taxation measure. The Treasurer admitted that himself. It had nothing to do with taxation. The Treasurer is now grovelling around the Parliament saying that the situation is beyond his control because he did not receive enough from the crude oil levy. When the crude oil price comes down shortly, as it will, he will not, as he should, reduce petrol prices by 10 per cent. He will not do it; he cannot do it, as he admitted today. This is the fallacy of all the policies of this Government. They do not exist. The only people doing well today are foreign companies who have invested heavily in Australia and who absorb most of the Australian capital funds. Almost 32 per cent of the total funds provided to foreign corporations in Australia is taken from the Australian capital market. If we look at the Foreign Investment Review Board report, we see that this will cause some concern for Australians. Of course it will. How will people compete in the market when foreign companies come in and take up the domestic capital? What is left, except high interest rates, for the rest? The profits of the three major private banks in Australia have risen by 225 per cent in four years because the banks are charging Australians high interest rates for borrowing their own deposits. That is the sort of economic management that we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the Prime Minister's statement of what a great government this is and how it has helped to reduce taxation. On the point of a social wage, we should look at what this Government has done to employees and people in Australia. In fact it has diverted $27 billion from the infrastructure of education, health, housing and the whole gamut since 1976. That has been a diversion of $27 billion from the social wage. There has been another diversion of about $21 billion from the worker in direct wages and direct taxation. All this is shown up in statistics. In 1975-76 pay-as-you-earn tax was 41.7 per cent of the total. Today it is over 45 per cent. PAYE tax as a proportion of total income tax has risen from 59 per cent to 66 per cent. A process worker would have to cover a $37 loss in increased taxes plus a $22.50 loss in the social wage to return to the standard of 1975-76. In other words, because of both direct and indirect taxation, a process worker, married with two children, is now $60 a week worse off than he was six years ago. Does the Government say that that is reasonable? Those are the statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to my area of foreign policy which received reference in the early part of the Prime Minister's statement. He talked about the world and how we can do little about it. The real problem is that we should have done much more. It is appropriate and correct to condemn the Soviet Union for its actions in Afghanistan and also in Poland. It is also important to do something to help Poland. If Poland asked for trade credits-as it did-to help the Polish people, why refuse those trade credits? Why wait to receive a Dorothy Dix question as to whether the Government would give tax concessions to people who give aid to Poland? That is what the Government did recently. It was some months before it did anything about it. Why does the Government not condemn the action in El Salvador? It has ignored it completely and done nothing about it. What about supporting a resolution in the United States Congress for an immediate stoppage of arms to El Salvador? Why is it that the United States of America has to trade on the doubtful distinction of being the biggest armaments seller in the world, followed closely by the Soviet Union. There is not much distinction between the pair of them. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a world of uncertainty, poverty and misery. Half the population of the world is illiterate. Half of the people do not even have a life expectancy of 35 years. Half of them cannot even get health care. Yet we hear talk about billions of dollars in armaments. Do we see an indictment from this Government of those policies? Is it not a fact that Reaganomics are in a dreadful position because of excessive expenditure on armaments? Has there not been a complete diversion of funds from normal resources that should be available to the American people to people who will use them for nothing but arms? Why cannot the Australian Government stand up in this independent world and talk about what should happen. What about the world? It is all very well to take a keen interest in the Sinai with a very doubtful peacekeeping force. What about a peacekeeping force to our north? What about our participating in the area between China and Vietnam on the basis of a communique that was issued by some of the Foreign Ministers, namely those of Laos, Vietnam and others, stating that they would welcome some lessening of tension? That would be a very effective role for us to play. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in Japan last year and talked to the then Japanese Foreign Minister, who said that he would welcome some initiative by Australia. Perhaps, with Japan, we could play a role in lessening the tension between China and Vietnam. What about the proposal for a demilitarised zone between Kampuchea and Thailand? That was also mentioned in the communique. Do we hear any statement from the Government about that? We have not heard a word, not a mention about what this Government can do to ease the tension in our own region. Is it not important for the future of Australia, when these matters are discussed, to understand the problems immediately to our north? It is ridiculous to talk about interdependence. We have to make it very clear that we are very independent of other nations purporting to lead on our behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> In our view, both Reaganomics and Reagan foreign policy are disastrous. Neither gives any hope or any solution to the problems of the world. But we can do a lot more. Why is it that because Reagan's interest policies are failing ours have to fail? It is important that the Government take some action. It is elected to lead. The position is very clear. Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act gives power to take an interest in and to control what is happening in this country. Developers coming into this country can absorb our funds and leave nothing for housing. Surely the priority is for housing of our own people. The Government should go to the constituents of the Lowe electorate and ask them what their priorities are. Why has the Government reduced funds for welfare housing to such an extent that they are only one-eighth what they were six years ago? Why is it that young people who try to borrow money, even from the Commonwealth Bank, now find they are offered, say a commercial bill for six months, with an effective interest rate of 20 per cent or more? Why has the Government failed so often, had to be condemned so often?</PARA>
<PARA> How ridiculous it is that the present debate has occurred only because the Prime Minister has made a statement. He makes many statements but never takes part in a debate. By looking at Hansard we can see that he has debated in this Parliament only three times in two years. When next we propose a motion designed to encourage a discussion of the economy, let such a discussion take place. Let us not have a statement made on the eve of a by-election, merely to try to mitigate the internal wrangling in the Liberal Party. The Government has lost the seat of Lowe. It has lost it because it has failed to adhere to its promises . It does not deserve to be in government, and the sooner it is thrown out the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) referred to Lewis Carroll. That was appropriate. Lewis Carroll obviously wrote his speech, which was a 'wonderland affair', out of touch with reality and the challenges and opportunities confronting Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since this Government came to office in 1975 its consistent objective has been to correct the gross economic distortions caused by the former Labor Government and, at the same time, to re-establish a stable economic environment. The record shows that we have been successful in restoring economic growth in Australia. Among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies, Australia has stood out over the past two years as an example of growth and stability. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has stood out as one of the most successful political leaders in Australia's political history, one who is supported totally by all of his ministerial colleagues. I have said that our record has been one of growth and stability. The level of real gross domestic product rose by 3 per cent in 1980-81 and is expected to grow by 3.5 per cent in 1981-82. Inflation rates have generally been below the OECD average in recent years. Last year investment increased by 21 per cent in real terms and in 1981- 82 is expected to increase by 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the capacity of industry to invest in Australia is a stark reflection of its confidence in the future. In the last financial year private consumption rose by 3 per cent and in the current financial year should show a similar rise. This encouraging record would not have been achieved without the Government's consistent and disciplined approach to the economic management of this country. It could not have been achieved if we had not, with vigour and determination, pursued policies aimed at bearing down on inflationary pressures; policies involving the restraint of government expenditures and the money supply; policies directed towards the resistance of pressures for excessive wage and salary increases and shorter working hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The restoration of an optimistic environment for investment has been one of our prime objectives. Australia continues to attract strong investment from investors around the world. In 1980-81 private investment capital inflow totalled $6,406m-a substantial increase over the 1979-80 level of $1,842m. Australia's continued attractiveness to overseas investors rests squarely on the fact that since 1975 this Government has provided Australia with stability and economic policies based on a firm belief in the free enterprise system. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as the Prime Minister made clear today, there can be no grounds for complacency. There are some disturbing economic trends, both international and domestic, which must be of concern to the Government and to the country at large . The world economy, which has been growing more interdependent for decades, has been subject to powerful disintegrative pressures, both economically and politically. Foremost among these problems are recession and rising unemployment . In the United States of America, Canada, Great Britain, West Germany and the other Western industrialised countries, the slump is expected to lift total unemployment to 28.5 million workers in the second half of this year. These are the highest levels since World War II. Whether individually or collectively, openly or covertly, protectionism is growing throughout the world and is imposing strains between the industrialised countries and between the developed and developing nations. </PARA>
<PARA> In the current decade, world trade is likely to expand almost twice as rapidly as growth in world output, with manufactured goods accounting for some 80 per cent of the increase. The newly industrialised countries will be at same time striving for a bigger share of the markets for traditional manufactured goods in the older industrialised countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States and the other OECD countries are suffering from sluggish economies and slender prospects for immediate improvement. The current United States deficit does not augur well for future interest rates in that country. The growth rate for OECD Europe is expected to be less than 2 per cent this year . Hard times exacerbate political antagonisms, which feed on economic conditions . In a world so fraught with political and economic uncertainty, it would be foolish to expect the Australian economy to remain unscathed. Australia is not, and cannot expect to be, entirely immune from the difficulties which now beset the major economies. Slow growth overseas must mean less demand and lower prices for Australian exports. Our interest rates are a reflection of domestic inflation, demand for funds and interest rates overseas. They are not immune from the laws of supply and demand. Increased interest rates are a corollary of the higher demand for funds and are necessary both to attract savings and to avoid a rationing of available funds by lending institutions. Despite the very bleak and uncertain international outlook, much has been achieved in economic growth and manufacturing industry performance. </PARA>
<PARA> We face the future as a nation from a position of comparative economic strength . But our competitive edge is threatened today by wage increases, the pressure for a reduction in hours and by industrial stoppages. The key issue for manufacturing industry in the emerging economic environment is to maintain and improve international competititiveness so that it will be in a better position to ride out short term difficulties and be able to take advantage of any upturn in the world economy and growth opportunities in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government believes that a strong manufacturing base is an essential prerequisite to a balanced, viable and independent national economy. The solid gains made by manufacturing industry over recent years reflect the Government's responsible policies towards both industry and the economic management of this country. Our industrial policy is aimed at encouraging industry to restructure and become more efficient, more innovative and more internationally competititive. Our policies have led to a renaissance of manufacturing industry from the intolerably low and declining levels of activity which prevailed when we took office. We have developed a number of specific measures to encourage positively activities that are compatible with our economic environment and endowments, including our highly endowed and skilled work force, our vast natural resources and the innovative and entrepreneurial capabilities of Australian industry. We have clearly stated our belief that, as a long term objective, the Australian community will be best served by a manufacturing sector with a structure requiring minimum levels of government support. Considerable progress has been made in reducing industry protection and encouraging desirable structural change while seeking to ensure that changes are gradual, sensitively handled and within the capacity of the community to absorb.</PARA>
<PARA> Many factors will influence the ability of Australian industry to maintain and increase its competitiveness. Among the more important are movements in Australian costs, particularly wages, relative to other countries and international trade pressures. Obviously our cost structure is a major determinant of our international competitiveness and in the present and prospective economic environment undue wage growth would present a serious blow to the Australian economy in two major ways. The wage-price spiral will add further to inflation at a time when inflation levels in other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries are decreasing. If the present upward trend in wages continues, the competitive gains we have painstakingly achieved over recent years will be rapidly eliminated. We cannot afford to let this happen. The sooner the main actors on the age setting stage-employers and trade unions-realise this, the sooner all Australians will be better off. A return to wage moderation is an essential prerequisite if we are to restore our international competitiveness. In that sense the present national wage case will have a vital impact. </PARA>
<PARA> International trade pressures can be expected to increase over the next decade, as I mentioned earlier, with pressure on labour-intensive industries, in particular, likely to continue to intensify. These pressures can also be expected to extend to other industries as some of the industrialising countries in Asia shift their production and export efforts to capital-intensive, skill- intensive and high technology activities. Of course these developments in the Asian region will, at the same time, open up growth opportunities for some industries, particularly those based on our resource and energy endowments and some complementary skill-intensive activities. Naturally in a depressed international trading environment almost every other developed country will also be seeking to take advantage of these same growth opportunities. In order to cope with this intensified international competition Australian manufacturing industries will have to increase productivity faster than many parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this Government took office manufacturing industry has gone through a period of consolidation and improved competitiveness. Current difficulties and those immediately in prospect can be surmounted. The manufacturing sector's success in restructuring will largely determine its capacity to participate in and contribute to Australia's economic growth during the 1980s. Let there be no misunderstanding: Realisation of these growth opportunities will be be automatic . For the Government's part, we are acutely aware that the industry policies we employ must be as effective as possible in terms of both the needs of industry and their costs to the Australian taxpayer. To that end we are urgently reviewing the major instruments of our industry policy, including the important area of encouraging greater productive investment. Profitability, the adequate supply of investment funds, and capital, market and taxation systems operating to facilitate the necessary growth in investment, are prerequisites for a growth -oriented manufacturing sector. The Government's decisions on the reform of the financial system and on future industry policy measures will have a major bearing in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that the Opposition, as reflected by its ill-conceived industry policy, has not grasped the realities, both national and global, which are now facing Australian industry. There is no evidence whatsoever in its industry policy that it has learned from its past mistakes. When it was in government the Australian Labor Party took a series of steps which crippled and demoralised Australian industry. The investment allowance was withdrawn, export incentives were eliminated and inflationary wage increases were supported in every form. Australian manufacturers lost then the capacity to compete internationally and 124,000 manufacturing industry jobs were lost in a single year. Now Labor's policies have become even more radical than before. Labor proposes a comprehensive range of new taxes and disincentives to industry and to investment in this country. Unprecedented income tax rates and a wealth tax--</PARA>

The Labor Party proposes a resources rental tax, withdrawal of the investment allowance, specific regulatory action to impede productivity growth and of course strong support for wage increases and a reduction in the working week. At the same time, it gives implicit support for many of the industrial stoppages which are taking place in this country. These proposals would lead to the gradual demise of the private sector of the Australian economy. The simple fact is that the Opposition does not have an industry blueprint to lead this country into the 1980s. The Government, for its part, is committed to a vigorous, free enterprise economy with incentives for achievement. I am confident that, with the industry and economic policies of this Government and with the support of all sections of the community, Australia's growth potential can and will be realised during the decade ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Flinders, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party; it was Lazarus doing a political comeback. It is the first time we have seen him in a major debate in three or four years. He is known in this chamber as a deputy's deputy. He will serve anybody as deputy leader. He served the present Speaker, the honourable member for Bruce (Sir Billy Snedden), as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and then after he was involved in knifing him he served the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. Now that it looks as though the Prime Minister is in trouble, he has made it obvious to everybody that he is prepared to serve another leader as deputy, or perhaps run for the position of leader himself. We notice also today that the Treasurer (Mr Howard), who is normally right up at the start of these debates, either the first or second Government speaker, is putting distance between himself and the Prime Minister. He is moving away from the economic policies and style of the Prime Minister. The only people supporting the Prime Minister in here today are the brigands of the National Country Party, those in the cockies' corner-the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), who has temporarily left the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford- Smith, (Mr Lionel Bowen) said, on the first day of the sitting, two weeks ago, we proposed a censure motion against the Government on the state of the Australian economy. The Parliament had not met from November until February. When we came back at the end of February we proposed that motion of censure. The Government failed to take on the motion by regarding it as a motion of censure, and we received the Treasurer's standard glib reply to the pressing issues of the economy. Today we have heard a statement brought in by the Prime Minister headed 'State of the Nation'. It is supposed to be dressed up as the Australian version of the State of the Union message. Although it was a State of the Nation address, it was more a state of the Prime Minister address. He set the scene for the losses about to take place in Lowe on the weekend and in the elections in Victoria, the heartland of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> He was really taking out an insurance premium inside the Liberal Party. He gave this apologia of how well the Government is going, what has gone wrong and the international influences. But he has been disowned by the Deputy Leader, the honourable member for Flinders, who has made statements this week disowning the thrust of a policy of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has been distanced by the Treasurer and of course he is held in contempt by the heir-apparent to the Liberal leadership, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). So we have all of the hierarchy of the Liberal Party leaving him for dead. Today he had the support of the National Country Party, with a Deputy Prime Minister ranting and raving about the socialism of the Australian Labor Party. What was the message of the State of the Nation address? It said that all of our problems are the fault of the international economy. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our independence as a nation cannot blind us to the fact that overseas events affect us profoundly. </PARA>
<PARA>He is now looking for an overseas alibi to absolve himself from seven years of failure in Australia. But contrast that with what he said in 1975 when he was on the political make. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that men and women are governed by inexorable events beyond their control. When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped , that it is part of the world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what was said by the present Prime Minister in 1975. What sort of humbug is being proposed to us today? We are told that our situation is being caused by the problems of the international economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In this statement, this piece of political graffiti, what do we find? Under the heading 'The Australian Economic Achievement' the Prime Minister talks about strong foundations laid for the future. What strong foundations have been laid for the future? We have had one of the lowest growth rates of any industrialised Western country. He said that as a trading nation 'we have swum against the tide '. Why would we not swim against the tide? We are selling things that are in short supply, products such as wool and grains. The only reason there has been any possibility of investment in the minerals area is because we have been selling an oil replacement material to Japan. We have been selling steaming coal and we are gearing up to sell liquefied natural gas to Japan. If it were not for the fact that the Japanese Government, not the Australian Government, wanted to diversify away from the Middle East oil we would have no growth prospects in minerals. There has been no growth, in all the years of the Fraser Government, in the steel related minerals areas of coking coal and iron ore which have made up the main part of our business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Prime Minister stood up here today and said that no iron ore projects were started in Western Australia by the Labor Government. They still have not been started seven years later. Mount Goldsworthy, Area 'C' and Marandoo are still on the drawing boards in Japan and will not start because demand is not there for the product. Demand is there for steaming coal and for LNG. This has happened despite the Fraser Government, not because of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Fraser Government's performance in respect of the growth rate. There was a 2.5 per cent growth in gross domestic product in 1975-76. The growth in 1976-77 was 3.1 per cent; in 1977-78 it was 0.4 per cent; in 1978-79 it was 4.4 per cent; in the first half of 1980-81 it was 4.3 per cent and in the second half it was 1.2 per cent, giving an average of 2.9 per cent. The average for the whole period is 2.7 per cent. Compare that with the performance of the United States of America, Japan or West Germany which over that period had growth rates double that of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at the other strong foundations laid for the future. When Labor left office 4.9 per cent of the work force was unemployed, 300,000 people. Now 437, 000 people are unemployed, 6.4 per cent of the work force, plus 400,000 in disguised unemployment-that is, people who do not bother to the register. It is more likely that 12 per cent of the work force in really being affected by unemployment. The number of bankruptcies has increased 170 per cent under the Fraser Government. That is what honourable members opposite call strong foundations laid for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, we get to the great preoccupation-we will hear more garbage from the Treasurer about this when he follows me in this debate-the constant assault on inflation. The rate of inflation is now running at 11.3 per cent. If we played the dirty tricks the Liberals played in 1975 and multiplied the last quarter, the December quarter, inflation rate by four-this is the sort of antic they got up to when Labor was in power-we would have an inflation rate of 17 per cent. If we use these sorts of figures-if we use comparable figures and compare like with like-the people opposite are now presiding over the highest quarterly inflation rate in Australia's history. The total for the year is 11.3 per cent. It is now well ahead of the rate for countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Prime Minister has always prided himself on having figures lower than those of the OECD. The Treasurer has frothed at the mouth, for three years or five years-for however long he has been Treasurer- telling us that Australia has an inflation rate below that of members of the OECD. The Prime Minister damned himself in his speech today when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The OECD inflation rate is now under 10 per cent and falling, a reduction of 3 per centage points below the 1980 rate. </PARA>
<PARA>Our inflation rate is now onto 10 per cent. We are on the way up, not on the way down. The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The US inflation rate fell from 12.4 per cent in the 12 months to December 1981 , and the British inflation rate fell from 15.1 per cent to 12 per cent in the same period. </PARA>
<PARA>What are we doing? Our inflation rate is not falling. It is on the way up. By the Government's own record, by its own statements, our inflation rate is going back up. So much for the assault on inflation. This speech is an assault on our intelligence, and the Government well knows it. So we will not hear any more bragging from the Treasurer about where the inflation rate is going. </PARA>
<PARA> Another one of the great lies of the speech by the Prime Minister is the statement that the living standards of Australian families have been improved. What a piece of political nonsense that is. The average Australian family would need an increase of $20 a week in income to enjoy the same standard of living that it had six years ago. Look at the situation in respect of taxation. This is the highest taxing government in Australian history. In 1980-81 tax receipts represented 25.5 per cent of gross domestic product. The average during Labor's time in government was 22.2 per cent. Tax paid by the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer- that is the ordinary wage and salary earner who is paid at the end of the week and who is not able to fiddle the system-has increased by 101 per cent since Labor left office although his wage has gone up by only 72 per cent. Tax paid by the non-PAYE taxpayer has increased by only 56 per cent but his income has increased by 94 per cent. So the burden of tax falls all the time on the PAYE ordinary wage and salary earner. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the motorists cop it. All the motorists who are driving home from work this afternoon will know that the Fraser Government has raised $3.5 billion in petrol tax this year. We should remember that it costs $1 a barrel to produce Australian oil and the Government makes us pay $30 a barrel for the privilege of using this product. When Labor left office the amount was $264m. The Government also raises $500m in sales tax. The list goes on. But the greatest consideration is this: On the present Budget assumption, next year-that is the year beginning 1 July this year until 30 June next year-tax collections will rise by $5 billion . Yet the Treasurer will stand up and say that they cannot give the country a tax cut because the Senate might reject a $330m sales tax Bill. The Government cannot give a tax cut although tax will rise by $5,000m in the next financial year. In the latter part of the year people on average weekly earnings will be inflated out of the 32c tax bracket up to the 42c bracket. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a promise that interest rates would fall by 2 per cent. They have now gone up by 3 per cent. Repayments on a $30,000 loan over 25 years have increased by $15 a week or $60 a month. This is the sort of burden which the Fraser Government has laid on the Australian people. But the Prime Minister has the temerity to say that the living standards of Australian families have been improved. That is the statement he makes in this so-called state of the nation address today. What a lot of humbug! Of course, we will hear the Treasurer prostitute his ideas and his intellect again by trying to defend this stuff in a few minutes time. </PARA>
<PARA> The wages argument just shows the futility of this Government. On page 8 of the statement the Prime Minister says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there could be no thought that the money supply would be allowed to expand to accommodate inflationary wage settlements. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they have no wages policy. They are just going to screw all the growth out of the economy, screw the money supply down to make sure that wages cannot increase. The Prime Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there is no doubt that our overall level of economic growth places clear limits on the sustainable real wage increases which can occur. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they argue it both ways-that they will not expand the money supply for wage settlements; if they do not expand the money supply there cannot be any business activity; if there is no business activity they cannot hand on wage increases. What sort of logic is that? We know what this Government is all about. It has no philosophy; it has no policies. It is afraid of prosperity. Every time there has been any growth in this country it has stopped that growth and has tightened up the money supply. We are now being affected by a dramatic credit squeeze. If we look at the Australian Financial Review any day of the week we will find institutions offering 17 per cent for two-year debentures. At what rate are they lending that money? They are borrowing at 17 per cent and are lending at 20 per cent, 21 per cent and 22 per cent. Who could make a business pay when paying 22 per cent interest on borrowings? Who could build rental accommodation or housing on a rate of 22 per cent? That is the money that developers borrow. That is the money that keeps business oiled and running. It is no wonder that there is no activity. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has said, this year growth in Australia will be less than 3 per cent. If one takes the investment phase of mining out of that-that is about the only thing holding it up-growth in the domestic sections of the economy is virtually nil. There is no activity. The whole economy is being brought to a standstill. The share market is collapsing. The value of shares is being wiped away. Interest rates will go up again after the Victorian election. The Treasurer had us on at the last Federal election and kept them depressed. He said that interest rates would not rise, but they did after the election was over. They will rise after the Victorian election. All activity will come to a halt because this Government will not expand the economy. It will not take a chance on growth. Whenever there has been any growth such as that which occurred during the first half of 1980, when we had 4.7 per cent of non-farm domestic growth product, the Government has choked it off. In 1980 the Government said: 'We have too much growth'. It lopped off the head of the growth and we were down to 1.6 per cent for the second half of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is afraid of prosperity. This is too young and too vital a country to be left in the hands of these economic clowns who would be flat out raffling a duck in a pub, much less trying to manage the Australian economy. We have had seven years of the same Fraser formula for the Australian economy and we have had an average growth figure of 2.2 per cent a year. On that basis, with rising inflation, rising interest rates and rising unemployment the Government ought to do the honourable thing and go to an election. Give us a chance to let the public adjudicate. We will have that chance on Saturday in Sydney. We will win Lowe and defeat the Government. We want a chance at a Federal election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The abuse of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) is as unoriginal as are his analogies. The statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the House this afternoon is a realistic and sensible assessment not only of the economic circumstances in which Australia finds itself in the world at present but also of a number of other policy challenges which face this country at present. I certainly welcome the opportunity of saying a few things about the economic situation of Australia and also about the alternative economic philosophies which are paraded in front of the Australian people at present. If politics is anything, it is always a question of comparing alternatives. I for one and we on this side of the House will never lose the opportunity of asking this Parliament and the Australian people whether they believe in the present circumstances-circumstances which were spelt out in a very sober and cogent way by the Prime Minister-whether they want to change horses and whether they want to put back on to the treasury benches the people who were there between 1972 and 1975 but more particularly, the people who, being more contemporary, espouse the economic philosophy of people such as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been quite a bit of talk during this debate about the influences on Australia of world economic circumstances. I have never said and nobody on this side of the House has ever said that what we do by way of domestic economic policy cannot influence in some way the international sources at work in the Australian economy. We did not say that in 1974 and we do not say that now. What we did say then and what we do say now is that it is quite impossible for this country to isolate itself completely from world economic circumstances and pressures. What our domestic economic policies can and will do is either aggravate or reduce the dangerous effects of those influences. Our criticism in 1974 was not so much of the disruptive state of the world economy but rather of the extent to which the policies of the then Labor Government aggravated and encouraged-through the expansion of the money supply, the expansion of expenditure, encouraging the wages explosion and following policies of high deficit-the influences on the Australian economy of the events that were then befalling the Western industrialised world. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as those policies then aggravated and compounded the difficulties that Australia faced, so too would the policies of high deficits and lax monetary policy compound the difficulties which we now face. Does anybody imagine for a moment that with an American deficit approaching $100 billion we would not have higher rather than lower interest rates if we adopted an alternative economic strategy? Does anybody believe that if a Leader of the Opposition and an economic spokesman, who were in favour of letting the money supply go, were put on the treasury benches it would bring down the levels of interest rates in Australia? Of course, interest rates in Australia now are very high. They are uncomfortably high. They are at levels which are causing concern and difficulties to army thousands of Australians and Australian families. The answer to the problem is not to imagine that by some economic magical trick it will go away. There is no way in the present world economic environment, particularly with the level of American interest rates, that Australian interest rates can fall now or in the immediate future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition made a lot of play about comparisons with the United States of America. He said: 'Interest rates are falling in the United States. Why are they not falling in Australia?'. Just because there is one fall of half a per cent in the prime rate charged by a number of American banks, as was announced this morning, the Leader of the Opposition like some impulsive puppy, says that our rates have to follow them down. Has he forgotten that the current prime rate in Australia for large overdrafts is 16.25 per cent and that the average US prime rate over the last two years has been 17 per cent? The current prime rate in the United States of America is 16 1/2 per cent. Against that sort of background is there any argument at all that the forces that are now at work in the United States economy will lead to a reduction of interest rates in Australia? I have said before and I say again that if over a period there is a sustained fall in United States interest rates then there are prospects that interest rates in Australia can fall. But the proposition that just because there is a drop of half a per cent we, like some impulsive puppy, will follow betrays completely-to use his own expression-the economic illiteracy of the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us never lose sight of the fact that in a debate of this kind we are talking about alternatives. We are talking about alternative economic approaches in a very difficult and hesitant world economic environment. There will be no early upswing in economic activity in the industrialised world. What we need at present are policies that reinforce the fight against inflation and policies that recognise more clearly than ever that it is the size of government and the size of what it takes out of the community that, in the long run, really matter. If we adopted the alternative economic philosophies of the Opposition and if we went for high deficits and larger government spending we would not reduce our present economic difficulties. Rather we would significantly aggravate those economic disabilities. I do not think we should lose sight of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I became Treasurer in this Government I do not think there has been a time when it has been more important than now to try to keep an appropriate balance between realism about the international economic situation and that characteristic Australian tendency to self-deprecate. Having heard the speech of the Leader of the Opposition and the speech of the honourable member for Blaxland, one would imagine that there was nothing right in Australia, that there was nothing good about the economy and that every conceivable thing that could have gone wrong had in fact gone wrong. He selectively chose some growth figures. He ignored the present. He was not prepared to admit that in 1981 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development recorded a positive growth rate of only a little over one per cent, whereas Australia managed a growth rate of a solid 3 per cent. He was not prepared to acknowledge that in 1980-81 business fixed investment in Australia rose by 21 per cent in real terms and that we are still expecting a rise of over 10 per cent in real terms this year. Are they the sorts of figures that are consistent with the scenario of gloom and doom that for his own electoral aspirations he would like to believe will fall upon the Australian economy?</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that in many respects the Australian economy has swum against the tide of international economic adversity. That has not only been because of our endowment of natural resources. Of course that has made a contribution. But above that-and this has been borne out not just by our own analysis but by independent analysis-over the last five or six years, by tackling the fundamental problems of controlling the size of the public sector, by tackling the fundamental problems of controlling inflation, by recognising that it is on growth and on the production of wealth that the ultimate strength of any economy must rest, by following those policies, this Government has given this country a competitive edge and a growth edge that other countries have not been able to achieve. We are one of the few countries which, during that period, have been able to reduce their total budget outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product. We are one of the few economies which have managed to bring about a significant improvement in the balance between revenue and expenditure. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) criticised the monetary policy which is being followed in the United States of America. If I have any concern about the conduct of economic affairs in that country, it is not so much about the conduct of monetary policy but rather about the size of the prospective budget deficit. Ultimately, if governments spend more than they collect, they must do one of two things. They must either print the money, which means more inflation, or they must borrow the money, which means higher interest rates. That was the lesson of the Labor years of the early 1970s. It is the lesson that the Western world is having brought home to it at the present time through the size of the Budget deficit in the United States of America and it would be the lesson which would be more cruelly brought home to the Australian people if an alternative economic philosophy were applied, if in fact we were to expand our Budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Blaxland lighted upon a comparison of taxation levels in Australia now and what they were when Labor left office. I have never denied that as a percentage of gross domestic product total taxation collections now are higher than they were in 1975-76. They are plain unassailable facts. But what he did not mention and what ought to be mentioned for the completeness of the argument, is that if we add together total taxation collections and total borrowings, it was a much higher figure in 1975-76 as a proportion of gross domestic product than it is now. What that Government was not prepared to do, what it did not have the courage to do, and what an alternative government now would not have the courage to do, would be to face the fiscal and Budget consequences of its own inability to control its expenditure. If we want a real comparison of that governments take out of the community we cannot ignore borrowings. A government that borrows rather than taxes is a government that lacks courage; it is a government that is not prepared to face the political consequences and implications of borrowing for a current generation, but is prepared to load a future generation with a very large debt burden. </PARA>
<PARA> The final subject I would like to say something about is one that I think is important. It is a subject that shows up a basic difference in approach between the Government and the Opposition. It is something that we hear a lot about from the Opposition. That is the question of tax avoidance. We hear many speeches from the Opposition about tax avoidance. We hear the Leader of the Opposition and more recently the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), and other people talking about tax avoidance and saying that if the Labor Party were in office, overnight it could wipe out this problem. They suggest that if we had acted on the royal commissioner's report, in one stroke we would have got rid of tax avoidance in Australia. The truth of the matter, of course, is that this Government has done more to wipe out tax avoidance in this country than any government since Federation. The other truth is that right at this moment the double standard of the Labor Party on tax avoidance is revealed by two things. Everybody knows that there are two elements to tax avoidance. There are the fancy, sophisticated, technically legal schemes against which we have taken such effective action and there is the burgeoning cash economy by means of which people evade the payment of tax. Everybody knows also that the most effective way of countering the cash economy and bringing a bit of equity back to the ordinary wage and salary earner to protect him from the scourge of the cash economy is to have a greater reliance on indirect taxation because that cannot be evaded. But where does the Opposition stand on that proposal? Each and every attempt that this Government has made to broaden the taxation base, to place a greater reliance on indirect taxation, with all that implies for eliminating the economic effects of the cash economy, these great opponents of tax avoidance have opposed, criticised and frustrated. The Labor Party will also have an opportunity in a couple of weeks' time when we present some amendments to the income tax law, to prevent the abuse of the investment allowance provisions of that law by certain statutory authorities, to oppose those amendments. The honourable member for Gellibrand, Labor's economic spokesman, says the Labor Party is opposed to the announcement that I made on 18 December. If his words are to be believed, what the Labor Party will do here and in another place is vote against a proposal of this Government which would protect the ordinary Australian taxpayer from losing between $100m to $200m to some of the largest companies in Australia. Is that tax equity? Is that a party that is really committed to fighting tax avoidance? No, it is a party which, like its economic policy, demonstrates a total double standard on that subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not necessary to reply to the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) on this occasion. The target in this debate is the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Suffice for me to say, in argument against what the Treasurer said about taxation, that he does not have to rely upon the words of the Opposition to see how taxation is affecting people. All wage and salary earners in this country have to do is to look at their pay packets and they will know what impact taxation is having on them and they will know the increased impact it has had since this Government came to power in 1975. They all know the increased amount of taxation they are paying. So it is no good the Treasurer trying to harangue the Opposition. The Opposition is merely expressing the views of the people in the work place. They are carrying the burden. If the Treasurer were serious about it he would put increased numbers of people to work in the office of the Commissioner of Taxation to do the job that ought to be done in Australia in scurrying after the people who are avoiding and evading their taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an incredible debate that we have on our hands today. For the first two weeks of parliament the Prime Minister acted like Harpo Marx. He could not speak and he could not hear anything and he did not want to participate in any of the debates. He suffered great embarrasment nationally. So Harpo Marx has decided to return to the ring at the second sitting of this Parliament by making a statement to the House on the state of the nation. I do not think the statement tells us anything about the state of the nation but it is interesting that the Prime Minister should call it that and come before the Parliament to take part in the debate. On the basis of looking at the statement it seems to me that the Prime Minister would get sunburnt alongside a rhinocerous because of what is contained in the document. Only a man with a hide as thick as that of the Prime Minister would dare to get up in the Parliament of this nation and paint a picture of the Australian economy and its place in the world such as that which the Prime Minister has given us today. </PARA>
<PARA> Through successive election campaigns he has made positive statements and demanded that Australians believe him. In 1975 he told us-another famous prime ministerial promise-that it would take him two years to get the economy booming. Since then, every single forecast and every single promise-there are no exceptions-that this Prime Minister has concerning the country's economy has proven worthless. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977, in an election forced on Australia because of total failure to live up to his 1975 promises, he painted another rosy picture and asked Australians to stick with him. In 1980, not much over a year ago, he gave us the brightest picture of all. We were told that a new economy dawn was about to burst and he promised Australians that if they continued to vote for him there were $29 billion worth of resources about to tumble on Australia. These, of course, were all Fraser promises and we know what they are worth. Six years after Mr Fraser's initial promise to bring back prosperity, what is the real situation? He told us he would tackle inflation first. In that six-year period, inflation is down just two points and if his Treasurer's estimates are at all accurate-they are not always accurate, as Mr Fraser acknowledges-that two points will disappear fairly quickly in the coming 12 months. Unemployment under Mr Fraser has more than doubled. Interest rates are at an all-time high, with no indication of relief. Hundreds of thousands of Australians, as a direct result of these impossible policies, are either out of work or suffering from high taxes and high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser was one of the loudest voices in 1974 and 1975 claiming that the difficult economic times that Australia faced were in no way connected with events overseas. Having dismally failed all but the wealthiest of his friends in Australia after six years, he is now seeking to blame the international economic circumstances for his pathetic mismanagement and failure. Fraser has failed Australia in goods times. Why should anyone imagine that he will be any more competent in tough times?</PARA>
<PARA> In the past, the Prime Minister has gleefully blamed the possibility of a Labor government for slumps in the Stock Exchange. He has claimed that this has been a clear sign that people do not want Labor governments. But the Stock Exchange floors today are just as empty as the words of the Prime Minister. Six years of deceit, false promises and arrant mismanagement have cured them of that. There will be no resurgence of confidence as a result of anything that the Prime Minister told the Australian Parliament today. We can be sure of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister is rapidly becoming the only one, even in his own party, who believes what he says about his economic skills and management capacity. When men such as the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry and Commerce-they are not noted free thinkers-start going their own way, it must be very hard to convince even the most sycophantic of his party supporters that there is anything other than rhetoric in anything that he has told Parliament today. He has certainly not persuaded anyone in the country at large. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech today is not a speech aimed at advising the people about the state of the nation; it is aimed at preventing a coup in the Liberal Party; it is aimed at preventing the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the honourable member for Flinders (Sir Phillip Lynch) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) leading a coup which would replace Mr Fraser in his position as Prime Minister. This speech is all about the survival of Fraser because of his poor performance, particularly in the first two weeks of Parliament. To honourable members on this side of the House it seems incredible that anybody in any form of politics would be concerned about the honourable member for Flinders, the honourable member for Kooyong or the honourable member for Bennelong. That would be a nice front row for anyone to be up against. The Prime Minister is concerned that these people are in some way getting together to replace him. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, of course, is a first-class advocate of duplicity, and because of the way in which he has conducted himself in getting rid of former leaders before him-I refer to Mr Gorton and Mr Snedden-he no doubt recognises only too quickly what the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for Flinders are up to, and he is out to prevent it. But this is not a state of the nation speech. There is no word in that speech about how many people in Australia are living in poverty, how many are unemployed, or how people such as pensioners are supposed to survive. That is the state of the nation that the people want to hear about. There is no word about how many people have their names on the lists of various housing authorities waiting for welfare housing. Has that not got something to do with the state of the nation? Would not one have thought that the Prime Minister, in talking about these matters, would at least have given recognition to some of the enormous human and social problems that this country faces? But there is not a word about them. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement comes from a man who uses, for the first time, such terms as ' balance', 'realism', 'honesty', and 'compassionate'. No one in Australia has ever heard the Prime Minister use these terms before. The Prime Minister uses these terms today when it suits him in order to survive, but the same man has set Australian upon Australian like no other Prime Minister has done. He has set the employed upon the unemployed. He has set worker upon worker. He has set sportsman upon sportsman. He has set the wealthy upon the poor. No person has done more to divide the nation with his policies and rhetoric than the Prime Minister has in the last 6 1/2 years. The Prime Minister has conducted a personal inquisition upon all those Australians who did not share the extreme right wing views of himself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister complains in his statement that perhaps the Australian people expect too much too quickly. But is this not the Prime Minister who told us about the minerals boom? Is this not the Prime Minister who told us that we would be having a government of smaller taxes? Is this not the Prime Minister who told us that we would have a manufacturing industry boom? Is this not the Prime Minister who told us that we would have an overseas investment boom? Why should not people's expectations at the end of the tunnel, when they have been told all these things at the 1975, 1977 and 1980 elections, be greater than what has been achieved by this Government in 6 1/2 years? Why should not Australians, when they are told of all the resources of this country and what a good position we are in compared with other countries, expect better than the people of other countries? Or are we to do what the Prime Minister did today and say: 'There will be 28 million unemployed in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, so we can expect that unemployment will become a permanent fixture, a permanent crime in our society'?</PARA>
<PARA> Instead of saying that they are going one way and we are going another, which the Prime Minister should have said, he tells us to accept what is happening overseas. If the Prime Minister wanted to give a readily acceptable statement on the state of the nation, he should have said: 'We are going to do something about poverty. We are going to do something about unemployment. We are going to do something about housing. We are going to do something about taxes'. That is what the Australian people require of him. They are not terribly interested in the intricacies of the Liberal Party when their lives are at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members opposite want to get rid of Malcolm Fraser, for God's sake do it, so that we can go about governing the country. If they want the honourable member for Kooyong or the honourable member for Bennelong to be Prime Minister, they should put him up. But they should not fiddle-faddle around with the Parliament and the lives of the Australian people while they are doing it. That is what this exercise is all about. The Prime Minister did not have the courage two weeks ago to speak in the debate on the economy, but now he has to come in and make a statesman-like presentation about the state of the nation. The Prime Minister, as I say, has split the Australian public. He has set sportsman upon sportsman. As Raelene Boyle, one of Australia's great athletes, said last Friday, who has heard of Afghanistan since the Olympics? No one has. The Prime Minister, who was prepared to divide the nation by stopping the sportsmen and sportswomen of Australia from going to the Moscow Olympics has not said a word since then about Afghanistan. I will tell the House why. It is because Australian exports to Russia have quadrupled in the last five years. Four times as much wool, meat and primary produce is going off to the Soviet Union. It does not suit the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industry, and all the Country Party hacks, to talk about Afghanistan now because there is no political advantage. There was some political advantage in what they were trying to do previously in splitting the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA> They have done the same thing in relation to wages. The Prime Minister in his statement today put forward the proposition that the economy cannot stand any further wage increases. He might be interested to know that about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of the Australian work force have already received, at the end of 1981 or early in 1982, rather substantial wage increases through collective bargaining. It is the duty of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, when it gives its decision on the case that is being heard now on the national wage, to make sure that all the people who have not received those wage increases, late last year or early this year, are brought up to date. There is going to be established in Australia, whether or not the Liberal Party likes it, a minimum wage of about $225, and it should go to unorganised labour in the same way as organised labour has been able to achieve it. If the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission were to go along with the Government's submission, it would be absolute lunacy. That is not what the Commission was set up to do. But again, it suits the Prime Minister to try to divide the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister then wants us to take into account, as I have said, the fact that things are happening in other parts of the world from which we cannot separate ourselves. But the rhetoric and the vindictiveness of 1974 and 1975 ring in my ears when I see all those faces that were then in opposition. They were telling us that all the woes of Australia belonged to the Government led by Gough Whitlam in those years. They said that all the mistakes that were being made were being made by the Whitlam Government; the problems had nothing to do with the greatest recession the Western world had seen since the Great Depression. Member after member of the Liberal Party or National Country Party got up and said: 'It is all the fault of the Whitlam Government that unemployment and inflation are growing'. But there was no talk then of what was occurring overseas. But now, all of a sudden, the Prime Minister has said: 'Look , we had better cast this responsibility off. We cannot be allowed to carry the fault for what is happening in Australia'. There is one clear sign in this statement. It will be seen as a very sorry sign by people listening to this Parliament or people who become aware of this debate. The sign in this statement is that the Government has no intention of doing anything about the great ills that affect the vast majority of people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer said that all we could do is to speak of doom and gloom. I am telling honourable members opposite that there are thousands and thousands of Australians-hundreds of thousands if one is talking about poverty, tens of thousands if one is talking about people waiting for houses and hundreds of thousands if one is talking about unemployment-who can see nothing but doom and gloom in this country. It is unfair that they should carry this enormous burden, this enormous social crime that is being perpetuated by a government which, since 1975 has consistently set out to represent the more privileged people of this country. That is why more is not done about tax avoidance and tax evasion, because it would catch up too many friends of the Liberal Party in Australia. So the burden must go to wage and salary earners. There will be great changes in this country, as there will be in other countries, because people will not be prepared to tolerate the extremes of the economic order which are occurring in Australia under a Liberal Government. Those extremes will not be allowed to occur in Australia or in other countries. Things could be done and policies could be adopted which would assist in Australia. It is just the arrogance and the aloofness of the Liberal Government that refuses to allow that to happen in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a very good idea to have a debate on this wide-ranging subject. It has been very interesting for me to listen to the Opposition talking off the subject, talking down the Australian economy and talking down the achievements of this Government. I suppose that is what we have come to expect from the alternative government opposite, which has no policies which would overcome the poverty that the honourable member for Port Adelaide ( Mr Young) talked about. It has no policies to help the average working man. The policies it has only create poverty. Labor policies deal, in a very token way, with people who most need care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not imagine I will have time to talk about basic ideology tonight but I can say that the Australian Labor Party, when it was in government, never showed that it has a genuine concern for those in need, and it has never shown any capacity to do anything other than manage the place badly. I suppose the best way to sum up the Labor Party's performance is to say that it could not manage a chook raffle, let alone a country. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard, as usual, the personal attacks on the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), a man who has striven very hard for this country in the past six years and who, on the admission of the honourable member for Port Adelaide, knows how to run a country in good times, which I think is something we ought to remember. The past five or six years have been good times in Australia; far better times than we had in the previous three years. As this Government stays in power during the 1980s and as we overcome, gradually and with very hard work, the problems we have in this country, times will be even better. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose to talk about some of the problems that we have. I think it needs to be recognised that this Government is prepared to admit that we have those problems and is prepared to tackle them. But before I do that I point out again that the Prime Minister, in his statement this afternoon, talked about not only the internal problems of Australia and the internal achievements of Australia in the past, but also Australia in the world context. I suppose one of the things that he, as an individual, needs to take great credit for is his attitude towards the rest of the world and towards building Australia as a middle nation that can be a force for peace and for progress in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of matters relating to our interdependence have been mentioned and need to be expanded somewhat. We have been through a period in which we have believed, wrongly I think, that embargoes and trade restrictions will do a lot of good in terms of protests. I refer to the Olympic Games and the small-that is the way it turned out-wheat embargo in relation to the Soviet Union. I want to put in a strong plea as an Australian for the proposition that trade embargoes do very little good in sorting out any problems relating to peace. </PARA>
<PARA> I was most impressed when I spoke recently in Saudi Arabia with senior members of the Government there about some very real fears that that country felt when the United States of America and Australia imposed, for what we saw at the time as very good reasons, an embargo on certain wheat sales to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I was told most strongly that when we engage in that sort of practice other countries look around and ask whether countries such as Australia and the United States will do that to them. I think we need to remember that it has been part of history that trade has built more bridges than it has destroyed. When I read about America thinking about putting back arrangements with the Soviet Union in relation to the supply of gas, I wonder whether it is a sensible move. It seems to me that if two countries that are naturally hostile to one another-as they are at the moment-can become more dependent on one another it will be all the more difficult for those countries to engage in a war at a later date. It seems to me that the more dependent we are on other nations and the more dependent other nations are on us for supplies of goods that go to ordinary people, the less likely we are to do anything stupid such as going to war. This is a wide subject. I think it needs to be talked about much more. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we also need to remember that not only does trade, and our position in the world, have the effect of increasing understanding and the interdependence that leads more likely to peace, but also it is a very practical means of producing more jobs in our country. I know that I have had a lot to say in Australia about tariffs. I have also had a lot to say about the fact that trade, if carried on at the maximum possible rate between countries, increases jobs. I do not propose to go into all the theory of that. We have found, as we exist in this region, that our capacity to trade with people has not only produced more jobs in this country but also has helped to some extent to increase the affluence of the countries with which we trade. I note especially those countries in South East Asia. Through trading with countries like Australia those countries increase their affluence and their capacity to buy goods from us at a later date. The Prime Minister has said a lot about this in the past. He has said it in overseas forums. I hope that as time goes on we will have the capacity to stick a little more to our words on these matters. It is not only good for us; it is also good for those other countries. As I have said, it ensures a greater capacity for the world to live peacefully. I think, as politicians, that is the thing we ought to address as our top priority. We are after all, as politicians, the people who start all the wars. It is up to us to think about how we can stop them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has also talked of Australia being a leader in the world in several ways. I think that as an Australian in this period I ought to reflect on just how proud I am that we have been a leader. It is not only that we have been a leader in some of the external affairs type of questions-the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) this afternoon referred in a very complimentary way to the Prime Minister's involvement in the Zimbabwe issue-but also we have been a leader in terms of economic thinking. When one looks around the world at present at countries such as Germany and Japan, which after all has a big deficit problem, and the United Kingdom, which is at present pulling itself away from the brink of the abyss that successive socialist governments led it to, we realise that we led the way. I know that our economic system is not perfect and I know that too often we have not followed our own principles. But as the statistics show, we are moving towards increased prosperity for our people because we are following, just gradually, a policy that is more and more oriented towards a recognition of the individual and the fact that an individual in an Australian context, given the chance to strive, does get on, does see that his family gets fed and clothed and does see that there is a capacity to look after those more in need. But the Labor Pary has to talk down the achievements, has to spread the gloom that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) referred to, has to try to convince the Australian people-I suppose in the context of the Lowe by- election and shortly the Victorian election-that we are not doing well. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite honourable members to look around their electorates. Just look at the number of people who have savings in the banks at present. Just look at the people who were able to go on holidays in the last Christmas period, something which a generation ago they could not have contemplated. Just look at the people in Australia with new cars. Just look at the people who have colour television sets and the people who can afford to eat out at restaurants. I am not saying that Australia has the best distribution of income. I acknowledge as the honourable member for Port Adelaide has said, that we do have poverty in this country. But surely a government which has policies that will lead to greater growth, to greater affluence, to more money in the pockets of the people, I have just referred to, is a government that will therefore provide a capacity to look after those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the policies of the Labor Government are more tokenism when it comes to thinking about people in poverty. Labor Party supporters are prepared to run around talking about poverty but the person they are always looking for to pay is someone out there who is making a profit. They are never prepared to put their hands in their own pockets. They are the sorts of people who are always looking for a third party to solve the problems of somebody else. When I look at my supporters in my electorate and see the work they are prepared to do, as individuals who care for people, I feel very proud to be sitting on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment on one of the matters the Prime Minister raised which I think is probably our greatest internal problem. It is partly psychological and it is partly bred from avarice or greed if you like. In this country there is an alarming capacity to self-destruct. Whenever I travel overseas, which happens every now and again, I return home thinking: Why on earth are we not achieving our potential better? Why on earth do we have to fritter away our potential at such an alarming rate? Why do we insist on eating away at our gains? The other night I was discussing the question of shorter working hours with some constituents of mine in the country. A school teacher said to me: 'You should not talk about shorter working hours. It is well recognised that when we moved to a 40-hour week in the late 1940s people'-I suppose largely those on this side of the House-'jumped up and down and said that the country could not afford it'. This constituent of mine said: 'When you look back you will see that we could afford it'. All that I said to him was: 'If we had not gone to a 40-hour week, if we had left it for another 10 years, the arithmetic tells me we would have been even better off'. The arithmetic tells me that if Labor Party supporters go around the country saying that we cannot afford this, we cannot afford to help these people or to help those people, and that we are charging too much tax, then surely lower working hours without additional production-and initially shorter working hours means that-will mean that we will be that much worse off. It is a matter of plain arithmetic. If the Labor Party is talking about this country doing better, the best thing it could do is tell the unions which are looking for shorter working hours at this stage, whose members want to produce less and somehow have more money in their pockets-which is an impossibility-that they ought to adopt a responsible course. It should be saying: 'You have an option. You will have less by working less or you can have more by working more' . But no, the Labor Party is not prepared to do that. As I said, it could not run a chook raffle. Its management would say that by some magical process people can work less and have more. That is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about our self-destruct mechanism, why on earth do unions which profess to worry about the employment of Australians do so much to try to destroy employment? Again it is a matter of arithmetic. If wage rises are greater than productivity, if at the same time profit rates-and this is an element in the equation-are at levels which cannot reasonably be dropped, then the money will come out of the pockets of the people who are in work to the extent that some people will be put out of work. It is an accelerating process. If people are out of work it means there will be less demands, and on it goes. That is the circle that I am afraid the Government has found very hard to break out of. It needs the resolve not just of governments but also of the Australian people. I do admit-and I think the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), who is to speak next in this debate, would also admit this because I have heard him say it on radio-that we do not solve anything in this country by straight out confrontation. To me, as an Australian, confrontation is the way to get Australians' backs up. I was most disappointed again to hear the Leader of the Opposition talking this afternoon about confrontation at the Commonwealth Games between white Australians and Aborigines. The Labor Party claims that the present Government likes confrontation but Labor's own policies build confrontation. That is not on in Australia if we are to solve our problems with the unions. The way to solve those problems is by individual Australians asserting their rights against the monopoly unions. Those rights involve the freedom of choice to join a union and the freedom of choice to strike or not to strike according to the individual's conscience, not at the whim of a monopoly union. As I have said in this place before, monopolies, whether they are of governments, companies or unions, militate against the best interests of individual Australians. I just hope that Australian individuals will strive so much harder in the next few years to break those monopoly unions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a long way to go in this country. The Government has a lot of privilege still to remove. In the tariff area we have some of the greatest privileges. We also have some of the greatest privileges in the union area, as I have said, but it will be up to us, it will be up to Australians individually, to strive to find our own potential. I believe it will also be up to Australians to re-elect governments such as this one which has the capacity to govern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Due to circumstances beyond my control I have approximately seven minutes only to speak in this debate. Therefore I wish to be as concise as possible. Very rarely could this Parliament have witnessed such a catalogue of cant and heap of hypocrisy contained in what is supposed to be a prime-ministerial statement. It is very interesting that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) should have started the statement with the plea that we should resile from the cut and thrust of everyday political life. This is passing strange from a man whom I had reason earlier to dub the cutlery man of politics, the man who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, who speaks with a forked tongue and who does not run out of knives to stick in the backs of his colleagues. If there has ever been a man in the history of this Parliament who has brought about a debased standard of opportunism in the conduct of political affairs it is this man. Whenever the high road of principle is available to him, as I have said before, he avoids it and dives unerringly for the low road of opportunism. Let us look at how that is proven by his speech in the Parliament today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One would not know if one had heard the Prime Minister speak that there was such a thing as the problem of unemployment in this country. It does not rate a mention in the statement. What are the facts in regard to unemployment in this country? The Prime Minister talked about the fact that 400,000 additional jobs had been created in the last three years. The facts in regard to unemployment are simply these: At the start of 1982 the number of unemployed in this country was more than 130,000 greater than when this Government took office. This Prime Minister and this Government came to office on the basis of a promise to reduce unemployment, but it has significantly increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me spend the little time that is available to me in this debate by addressing myself particularly to those areas of the Prime Minister's speech which come more immediately within my areas of concern. The Prime Minister talked about the wages explosion and, as is his wont, has again misrepresented the facts in terms of the period of his office. He chose to say that in the last two years there has been an increase of $13 a week in real terms in average weekly earnings. I ask honourable members simply to take note of what has happened over the whole of the period that this Government has been in office. For the whole of the period from the September quarter of 1976 until the September quarter of 1981, which is the last quarter for which figures are available, the real increase in average weekly earnings is the miserably low figure of 1.8 per cent. That is a 1.8 per cent increase in average weekly earnings over the whole period that this Government has been in office. If we dissect that further, we see just how miserably the lower income sections of the Australian community have suffered. In fact, the lowest 30 per cent of the people comprising the measurement of average weekly earnings, have experienced a fall in real terms in the standard of living during the period that this Government has been in office. If we take into account the impact of higher interest charges, the impact of higher health costs and the impact of a higher burden of taxation, the fact is that not only have the living standards of the lower 30 per cent actually declined but also average families are worse off- significantly worse off-at the end of this period of Fraser Government than they were at the beginning of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened in the area of wages. There has been an attempt to paint a picture of a wages explosion. In two-thirds of the national wage cases that have taken place while this Government has been in office, the Government briefed highly paid counsel to go into the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and argue that there should be no increase in wages. That has been its position. Whatever the increases in prices or whatever the economic circumstances have been, the Government has argued for no increase in wages. Of course, to some extent that has been reflected in what has happened in those decisions which have led to the decrease in real earnings to which I have referred. What is the problem that we have now in respect of wages? It is very clear, simple and straightforward. In the middle of 1981, the Government abdicated from the area of wages policy, threw up its hands in horror and said: 'Let it run. Give away the idea of any centralised system of wage fixation and let the strong exercise their power'. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have had cause to say before, inside and outside of this Parliament, there is one certain thing in this situation. If responsibility is abdicated, and if the philosophy of the Fraser Government that we should leave things to the free play of market forces, which is what was embodied in the razor gang speech of 30 April last year, is embraced, there is one thing, and one thing only, of which we can be certain. That is, that the strong and powerful will exercise their strength and their power will become stronger. In the areas of capital and organised labour, those who are strong and powerful and in a virtually monopolistic position will become stronger. If groups of organised labour have strength and power, they will use it, if they embrace the Fraser philosophy. What is happening in the community at present, directly as a result of the Fraser Government philosophy espoused in the razor gang speech of 30 April 1981, is precisely that. There is a wider dispersion of earnings. On the side of capital, those who were strong are getting stronger and on the side of organised labour those who were strong are getting stronger. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the people who suffer in those circumstances can be identified. Firstly, I refer to those in the labour force who are either not organised or weakly organised; secondly, those in small business; thirdly, farmers; and, fourthly, people on fixed incomes. Those people are the weak ones who have no power. It is those people who, under the philosophy of this Prime Minister and his Government, are paying the penalty. Those are the people who represent the piteous suffering from the application of the philosophy of this Government. In the minute that is left to me, I want to make one point clear about what can be done in industrial disputes. I refer to remarks that I have quoted before, of Sir Charles Court, who at the Premiers Conference in August last year made the position quite clear. In essence, he said: 'You can pass all the laws you like. You can pass the most diabolical laws, but, unless you have a spirit of co- operation in the community, those laws will be to no avail'. What have we had paraded here today? It has been suggested that we have passed punitive laws and that we will pass some more. Sir Charles Court has told the Prime Minister that that will not work and the exercise of any decent common sense will tell him that it will not work. </PARA>
<PARA> Trade unions have made mistakes, and I know that. But let us face up to the fact that they do not have a monopoly of error. Error exists on the part of governments. It certainly exists among employers. The Government should not talk about more punitive legislation and try to delude itself and the community that that will work. It should seek to bring together the trade unions, employers and governments and to let them understand the realities of the problems that exist. If that sort of policy is adopted, we have some opportunity of properly, equitably and fairly harnessing the great resources of this country and ensuring that they are equitably distributed so that no person is living in poverty or unhappiness in this community, as has increasingly occurred during the lifetime of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What this debate on the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) concerning the state of the nation is all about is the contrast between the policies-primarily the economic policies-of our Liberal -National Country Party Government and those of the Australian Labor Party Opposition. It is about alternatives-the choice between this Government's policies and those of the Labor Party if ever it could attain government. It is about relevance and about the capacity of those policies to cope with the increasingly difficult and complex world economic climate that is emerging. The Opposition seeks constantly to cloud and confuse the broad success of this Government's economic policies. The facts are there to be seen and cannot be gainsaid. The runs, so to speak, are on the board. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development pointed out, as recently as January 1982, the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1978, real GDP--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the total production of goods and services in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>has increased at more than twice the average rate for the OECD area as a whole--</PARA>
<PARA>This next statement is in association with that statement-</PARA>
<PARA>employment has risen strongly contrary to experience in many other member countries. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that in recent years there have been 100,000 to 150,000 new jobs annually. As the Prime Minister said, 400,000 new jobs have been generated in the three years to the end of last December. It is true that unemployment, at 6. 4 per cent of the labour force in January of this year, remains higher than we would wish, but at least it is fractionally below the figure a year earlier with the number of people seeking full time work also rather less than that of a year before. This was the result of a significant growth in the work force. Nevertheless the point I would stress is that 400,000 new jobs have been generated over the last three years. The great strength in this development has been the upsurge in investment. Investment in resource development has been the dominant force, but investment in manufacturing and other sectors of the economy has been strong also. The real rate of investment last year, in actual buildings and machines, as opposed to money terms, was up in excess of 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are experiencing now is something of a slowdown-not a recession-which is attributable, not solely but in significant part, to overseas factors. I refer particularly to the no-growth situation in other major economies, the fall in real oil prices and, notwithstanding all that the Government did to offset them in the last Budget, the continuing high interest rates. One effect of this stagnation overseas is that in some countries inflation is beginning to fall from previously very high levels. On the other hand, the continuing thrust of economic activity in Australia, coupled with the spate of irresponsible industrial action on the part of militant unions, particularly on the wharves, is making inflation in this country stubbornly difficult to contain and reduce below an underlying level of 10 per cent. We concede that that is a problem. We do not suggest that there are no problems confronting this Government. But I say to the Opposition, for goodness sake concede what we have achieved-growth at twice the average rate of the other leading industrial, the OECD countries, and rising living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, when you-the Labor Party-were in Government you added to the negative influences from abroad. What we have done-and what the Prime Minister is appealing to all Australians for a joint effort to continue-is to limit the impact on the Australian situation of difficulties overseas. The prospective slowdown makes even more critical the importance of containing excessive wage and salary increases and thereby in association with an appropriate exchange rate policy, maintaining the improvement that has been achieved in our international competitiveness. The improved cost position enabled us, as a result of the policies of this Government, to compete more effectively with imports and therefore to give jobs to Australians, keeping Australian factories operating, and to compete in overseas markets which again creates employment and fosters economic activity in Australia. That is what an effective internationally competitive position means and that is what has been achieved by the containment of inflation and the pursuit of appropriate exchange rate policies. This has contributed very significantly from the supply side, to use a technical term, to the strength and growth of the Australian economy and to jobs and the raising of living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) who preceded me in this debate referred to the current national wage case. It is imperative that if there be any increase in wages it be confined to those employees who have not yet had increases. The honourable member referred to the gains that the 'strong and powerful' have already achieved. For example, the metal workers achieved a very favourable agreement just before Christmas. I hope that the honourable member will join me in stressing the imperative necessity that the strong and powerful, to use his words, do not get an increase twice over-once as a result of collective bargaining and again through a generalised wage increase as a result of a national wage case decision. I hope that the honourable member will support me in saying that. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to my opening statement that what we are debating is the contrast between this Liberal-National Country Party Government and the Labor Party Opposition-the alternatives that they present. Incidentally, that is what the debate is about at the moment in the Lowe electorate also. This Government is committed to free enterprise and a market economy, with a framework of sensible Government policies which 'in particular' are designed to contain inflation and thereby promote employment and rising living standards. This Government is committed to a constant effort to contain big government and give effect to a proper compassion for the needy. That is to be contrasted with the policies of the Labor Party which despite all of the noises Labor makes about assisting the underprivileged, the workers and so on, involve planning and smothering regulation and bureaucracy, which is thinly disguised socialism. I could cite Labor's motor vehicle policy recently announced by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), which envisions the establishing of a Motor Vehicle Authority. I may come back to that point later. Further the Opposition is soft on militant unions-another subject to which I will return in a moment-and it is committed to 'solving' the central economic issue of fostering growth and reducing unemployment and inflation by the 'big spend' and 'a wages compact'. The truth is that the Labor Party does not have a viable policy-it is not an alternative at all-there is no alternative to the Government's present policies. The Labor Party's policy is nothing other than unreal and wishful thinking. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition says that unemployment can be reduced by increasing government spending. I referred a moment ago to the 'big spend.' The honourable member for Wills, on the last sitting day before the recess, said a lot about the necessity to introduce so-called job creation schemes. I referred a moment ago to the way our economic policies have 'generated' 400,000 jobs over the last three years. The honourable member for Wills talked about job creation schemes, government spending. With a minimum wage per employee of $10,000 as an annual cost, plus anything from 25 per cent to 50 per cent for materials, administration costs and overheads, we have a figure in the order of $12,500 to $15,000 per job for 100, 000 jobs-in short, one to one-and-a-half billion dollars. So when I say that the Opposition talks of the big spend, increased government spending, it is not a figment of my imagination. I refer honourable members to Hansard to see what the honourable member said on the last sitting day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They tried that in government and we know what happened-there was an upsurge in costs and inflation the like of which this country had never seen. Such big spending inevitably tends towards inflation. So the other prong of the Labor Party policy is to try to counter the resultant inflation with a so-called 'wages compact' with the unions based on Labor's 'special relationship' with the unions. It is wishful thinking; it is simply not credible. What is the special relationship? The only special relationship I know of is that the unions fund the Labor Party and therefore they tell the Labor Party to do what they say. The fact is that there is no special relationship with the unions of any value to the Australian people as a whole. A wages compact-an incomes policy-based on a special relationship is a pipe dream; it is unreal, it is not believable.</PARA></TALK.START>

At that time we had the greatest incidence of industrial disputation and the greatest upsurge in wage costs and inflation in Australian history, perhaps beaten only by the recent strike record in New South Wales. I have an aged mother in hospital at Harbord and when I visit her I can see anchored off the seashore a dozen of ' Wran's fleet'. I see them every time I go there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is what this debate is all about. It is a contrast between two approaches to policy; two approaches to what concerns primarily, though not only, the economic government of this country.

<PARA> In contrast the Labor Party, whatever the protestations we have heard from that side today, is dedicated to planning, control and a smothering bureaucracy-I refer again to the proposed Motor Vehicle Authority; the honourable member for Adelaide, who raised this matter, referred to regulating pricing and other decisions of the industry-and, in the context of general economic policy, it is dedicated to big government spending, enhanced inflation and an inevitable stop to development and all that that implies for limiting new jobs and rising living standards for all Australians. That is what this debate is all about. That is what the by-election in the seat of Lowe is all about and that is what this Government, when next it faces the people of Australia, will go to the people about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to Parliament today-this so-called state of the nation speech-was a farrago of falsehood and fantasy. The Prime Minister tried to tell the Australian people that at a time of record high interest rates, record high taxation, the highest unemployment since the 1930s, continuing high inflation, sluggish economic growth, falling living standards and declining home ownership that the Government is doing a good job. Not surprisingly, he was not very convincing. In an attempt to give some credence to his highly implausible claim the Prime Minister focused on the international economy. His reasoning is as follows: Firstly, he said that we are affected substantially by events in the international economy and the growing world recession has therefore adversely affected us; secondly, that nevertheless we have made some substantial gains and are performing relatively well; and, thirdly, therefore the Government's economic policies are appropriate to the present state of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to deal with each of those points in the Prime Minister's argument. In regard to the first point, I agree that we are affected by what happens in the rest of the world. Of course that is true. But it is entirely false to attempt to portray international factors as being largely adverse. The fact is that the major adverse factor in the world economy in the last few years has been a positive factor for growth in the Australian economy. I refer to the second oil shock. The second oil shock was the second round of increases in international oil prices which occurred at the end of the 1970s, when a 150 per cent increase in international oil prices followed the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973. The impact of an oil shock on oil importing countries is twofold. Firstly, it affects them in relation to their balance of payments by increasing the size of their import bill and secondly it increases the cost of a basic commodity in the economy and so generates inflation. It therefore forces countries into contractionary policies to keep inflation down and to reduce imports so that they can maintain an even balance of payments. The effect of those contractionary policies is to deepen international recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The international economy was already marked by high unemployment before the second oil shock-the first oil shock had brought that about-and also the inability of most governments to control inflation other than by creating more unemployment. The central economic question of our time involves the inability of governments to control inflation except by creating more unemployment. However, that matter was not addressed by the Prime Minister. I will come back to that point later. Thus the situation we have is that further recession resulting from the second oil shock has been devastating for many countries but not for Australia. Australia is one of the few Organisation of Economic Co- operation and Development countries with substantial oil reserves. We are roughly 70 per cent self-sufficient and so our import bill did not rocket up as a result of increased imported oil prices. Obviously that had some effect but we were largely insulated in that regard, at least in respect of the balance of payments. We could have been insulated from the inflation effect, too, except that the Government adopted a full import parity pricing policy for Australian- produced crude oil. That added substantially to inflation in Australia and so the protection which we would have had was obliterated. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia was not only substantially protected from the adverse effects of the second oil shock but also it gained from that second oil shock in a most important way. Increased investment in resource development was brought about by the greatly increased attractiveness of our non-oil energy resources, especially coal and natural gas, and also the increased attractiveness of developing in Australia industries which depend on energy resources. The aluminium industry is an obvious example. Our energy resources became more attractive because, with the increase in the price of oil, there was an understandable desire by companies and governments to obtain energy supplies of a non-oil type and also to diversify requirements and ensure access to energy in the future. They looked particularly at Australia, with its substantial non-oil energy reserves, and that resulted in a substantial increase in investment in this country, as referred to by the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) and other speakers in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not deny that there has been a very strong increase in business investment in the last year and in the current year. Last year there was a real increase in business investment of approximately 23 per cent-a very strong increase indeed-and in the current year we have seen a rise of the order of 10 per cent to 15 per cent. But those increases are very substantially related, and undeniably related, to resource development directly and indirectly. As a result of this large rise in business investment the rate of economic growth has increased somewhat. Not unnaturally the Government seeks to take credit for this but it has little to do with this Government's policy. It has everything to do with the fortuitous rise in oil prices and our legacy of vast mineral wealth. That is why we have this surge of business investment at present. It is not because the Government's policies were so attractive that all of a sudden businessmen rushed into the marketplace wanting to invest but because something happened in the international market which made Australia suddenly a very desirable place in whch to invest in resource developments. Thus, the impact of the second oil shock in Australia has been vastly different from that in most comparable countries. We have been protected from the initial adverse balance of payments effect and we have benefited from the consequential increased business investment in resource development. That increased investment, involving a high level of capital inflow, even enabled us to improve our balance of payments significantly last financial year. At a time when other countries were everywhere facing deterioration in their balance of payments we were able to improve ours because of the inflow of foreign capital associated with increased business investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, as a consequence of the capital inflow we appreciated the Australian dollar by almost 10 per cent. But now, with the second round effects of the increased world recession reducing demand for our exported commodities, our balance of payments is deteriorating and we are being forced to devalue. We have devalued by 6 1/2 per cent so far since August of last year and are likely to have to devalue somewhat more. Nevertheless, as all other countries are suffering these second round effects as well-that is, the induced recession is affecting everyone's exports-we are still relatively much more protected from the international recession than most other countries. We should surely realise that. Trying to say that international factors are so adverse for Australia and are creating the basic difficulties for this country is an absolute deception of the Australian people. We are one of the countries in the pretty unique position at present of being able to benefit from the situation which has been very adverse for most countries of a comparable nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister claimed that we have made substantial gains in the period that his Government has been in office. The Prime Minister's speech is full of such gains being made and of better performance in Australia than overseas. In most cases they are a gross distortion of reality, marked particularly by a careful use of base periods to best suit the Prime Minister's case. Let us take economic growth. The Prime Minister points to the last two years and says that Australia's growth is almost twice that of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This is substantially true. But, of course, this is because of the completely different impact of the second oil shock on Australia and on OECD countries generally to which I have just been referring. If we look at the last two years we will see that the growth situation in Australia has been better than the OECD generally because of the factors to which I have referred. But if we look at what has happened over the past five years since the Fraser Government took office, 1975 to 1980, a different picture emerges. We see that in that period gross domestic product growth per annum in Australia averaged 2 1/2 per cent but in the OECD generally it was 3 1/2 per cent, which is significantly higher. On a per capita basis, for Australia it was 1.3 per cent and for the OECD generally it was double that, 2.7 per cent. So if we take the period, as far as one can go, under the present Government, we see that our growth rate has been quite poor compared with OECD countries generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister talks of the Government's success in regard to inflation. I guess this depends on one's concept of success. The fact is that the annual rate of inflation is now at 11.3 per cent which is well above the OECD rate of 9.9 per cent at present. The OECD forecast is for the inflation rate to go down to 8 1/2 per cent in the middle of this year. So it is difficult to see how we can claim much success particularly as our inflation rate is certain still to be over 11 per cent at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister says that living standards are very important. He mentions increased living standards as the number one objective of the vast majority of Australians. I would not disagree with that. But as evidence of rising living standards he mentions that average weekly earnings are up by more than $13 a week in real terms in two years up to the September quarter of 1981 and that real household disposable incomes have increased by $2.9 billion after tax in the last financial year. In regard to this let me say firstly that his average weekly earning exercise pays no regard to the increase in taxes over the last two years or increased interest rates. It also ignores the fact that real average weekly earnings before tax declined between 1975 and 1979. Thus, if we take a single person on average weekly earnings and look at what happened between September 1975 and September 1981, we see that real after tax income increased by only 1 1/2 per cent in that six-year period. The real after tax income of a person on average weekly earnings with a dependent spouse and two children over the same period-September 1975 to September 1981-declined by 0.5 per cent. So where is this massive increase in living standards to which the Prime Minister points, this thing which is the number one objective of Government policy and of most Australians? It just has not happened. There has not been an increase in living standards for the vast majority of people. Of course, the figures I have mentioned ignore things like interest rate rises which are also important to living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the rise in real household disposable income in 1980-81, the Prime Minister understandably takes the one year during his period of office in which there has been a notable rise in the real level of such income and ignores the increase in the number of households in that year. The fact is that between 1975 -76 and 1980-81 real household income per household-one surely must take the increase in households into account-in Australia increased at an average of 0.4 per cent per annum which is a miserable rate of growth. That figure of 0.4 per cent per annum is for all households, not just wage and salary earner households . Where the hell is this increase in living standards we are supposed to be seeing? It just has not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to housing, the Prime Minister says that investment in dwellings rose by 26 1/2 per cent in real terms between 1977-78 and 1980-81. Again he picks his base carefully. If he had gone back to 1975-76 he would have shown a growth of only 5 per cent as compared with 26 1/2 per cent he got by going up to 1977-78. He is just playing with base years, messing around and trying to deceive people into believing that gains have occurred which simply have not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Prime Minister's argument that the Government's policies are the appropriate ones for our time. With a record like this Government has it takes an enormous amount of gall to argue that the Government's policies are just what Australia needs, particularly as such policies have not succeeded in any country . The monetarist policies that the government has pursued have been disastrous everywhere they have been tried. Unfortunately conservative governments in many countries have applied such policies and in so doing have greatly accentuated the international recession. It is crucial to understand that what such policies amount to is a preparedness to increase unemployment to whatever level is necessary to keep down inflation. It is taking more and more unemployment to keep inflation down. Three per cent unemployment in 1961 kept inflation to zero in 1962. Although we have six per cent unemployment this year we still have an inflation rate of 11 per cent. So we can see that with twice as much unemployment we still have high inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, if we are to continue with such policies we need more and more unemployment to keep inflation to any given level. This is the clear trend. So we must ask ourselves how long such policies can be pursued before the fabric of our society begins to crumble. Moreover, it is important to realise that with such policies we can never achieve economic recovery. I say that because as soon as some recovery occurs inflation begins to take off and so the Government clamps down on the economy, recovery is aborted and unemployment increases. If we are concerned to see unemployment reduced we must abandon Frasernomics-the economics of recession and unemployment. What we must do, as the Labor Party is doing, is develop a prices and incomes policy which gives us the only chance to have a substantial non-inflationary recovery. Such policies involve government intervention in both price and income setting in order to achieve a reconciliation of conflicting income claims at lower inflation levels than is now possible. It is important not only that Australians do this but also that other countries do so as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the House is discussing the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the state of the nation. It was essentially an economic statement, a statement of where Australia stands in a very difficult world. After hearing the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) I think that those listening to the debate might be somewhat confused with the figures. I would ask them to look back on the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) in particular and to compare what the honourable member for Gellibrand has said with what those two gentlemen have said. The honourable member for Gellibrand shares a certain quality with other members of this House-that is, a great degree of honesty in presentation. After all, he did proclaim to the world at large a couple of years ago that he was in favour of higher government spending and said that we had to educate the Australian people to pay higher taxes. In that he was quite honest about the objectives of the Australian Labor Party. Tonight he has given a speech which I believe, from his standpoint and his economic view, is quite an honest one. If one compares it in detail with those given by the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Blaxland one will see certain interesting discrepancies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In times such as this it is obvious that people will be very confused about the economic direction of the nation. To lay some fears at rest let me say this: Members of the Government parties are very well aware of the great concern of families in Australia in making ends meet. We are greatly concerned about the plight of pensioners in making ends meet. There is not a day goes by that members of the Government side of the House do not meet dozens of people in their electorate offices or out in the field, and spend time talking to them about their very personal concerns about the family budget and about the concerns of the aged as they go into a period when their opportunity to influence their future becomes diminished. Obviously their future becomes financially diminished but sometimes it is also diminished in terms of declining faculties. There is no doubt that in the present day and age families are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. When it comes to the end of each week, fortnight and month the family is highly concerned about an increase in salary, tax, interest payments, the cost of groceries and all those things which are absolutely vital in its life. Those concerns are reflected in the representations that are made to members of the Government parties as they are to the Opposition. Similarly, pensioners are finding that the small amount of income which they are able to earn from their past thrift might be nearing the tax threshold and an income testing limit which might affect their pension or fringe benefits. Those concerns are brought back very clearly to members of the Government parties as they are to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> In these very difficult economic times it is fair for those people to ask how the Government views these problems. It is also fair for them to ask how the Opposition views these problems and what the alternative strategies might be. The first thing that we do from the Government side is to acknowledge that these concerns are real, that they exist. They are very personal considerations that affect each individual family and pensioner. Nobody on this side of the House will withdraw from that concern or that detailed consideration of those problems . The real question is whether anybody will try to delude people as to whether there is an easy answer. I will look at just a few of the alternative ways of examining this economic problem. People say that it is terribly boring to refer back to the period of the Labor Government. Of course it is. It is always boring to look back about six years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That honourable member for Fremantle says: 'It is irrelevant'. It may be irrelevant to him but it is not irrelevant to many people because the same kinds of differences in approach are here with us today. The greatest cheat that we could perpetrate on the Australian public would be to indicate to families which are finding it difficult to balance the family budget and to pensioners who are finding it difficult to cope with increasing costs that it would be easy to solve their problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What do we have by way of opposing strategies to deal with this problem? On the history of the matter we find that the ALP Government did not have an economic strategy at all. I do not think that anybody has claimed that the Labor Party had an economic strategy when it was in government. I suppose the present Leader of the Opposition is a slight exception to that in that he claims that when he came to the Treasury towards the end of that unfortunate period he was struggling towards some objectives which he believed might get somewhere. I admit that that is a matter of debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally speaking, the Labor Government did not have an economic strategy. Basically it believed that government spending could be increased indefinitely. It believed that it could accede to wage demands indefinitely. It believe that it had only to let the tax rates increase through inflation in order to increase the tax take. It believed that it was possible to promise all things to all men and women and that somehow in the end the bountiful Australian economy would come good. Somehow the then Government believed that this would happen despite the fact that it was hitting out at investors-anybody who intended to invest in the future of Australia in a productive capacity in businesses that would provide employment and extend the future of Australia for more and more Australians. It believed that it could hit out at those interests and businesses , attack them as being either foreign or people who were only after their own good, and hope that somehow they would continue to support investment and support employment. Of course, that formula did not work. People stopped investing. People from overseas did not want to come in and invest. The labour unions increased their demands on the economy for increases in wages which were beyond that called for by productivity. Generally speaking, the economy got into a frightful mess. We got into a very substantial Budget deficit of $4.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> The history since 1975-1975 is not all that long ago-has been one of pretty painful recovery. There was an increase in government spending over those three years of the Labor Government of about 10 per cent per annum in real terms, that is excluding inflation. The present Government, to the great disappointment of many of those who voted for it, did not actually manage to reduce government spending. That is something for which people criticise me as a Government member and for which the Government is criticised. People say: 'You promised to reduce government spending. You have not done it'. The present Government, against the advice of the Labor Party and against extraordinary pressure even from its own supporters who do not like government spending being cut when it really comes to the point, has managed to reduce the increase in government expenditure to an average of about 1 1/2 per cent per annum over the six years that it has been in office. That is about the rate of increase in the population. In other words, if one takes it on a population basis, the present Government has held government expenditure flat. Before the present Government came into office government expenditure went up by a real amount of 10 per cent per annum over three years. The extraordinary fight to pull that curve back from a steep increase to a flat curve is well known to everybody. People who vote Liberal and people who vote Labor have complained to Government members in every electorate office about the reductions and cuts in government expenditure. At the same time people have complained about the amount of tax which they are paying and about our incapacity to cut government expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The same people, as my friend the honourable member for Casey points out. Really, what we are talking about is honesty on everybody's part about what the economic sums are. The Fraser Government has had an economic strategy throughout these six years. As honourable members opposite will know, I am one of those who have been quite critical about various aspects of government policy . There were various things that I hoped might happen under our Government which have not happened. But I have to say this: The previous Government did not have an economic strategy; the present Government has an economic strategy. It has not always followed it as closely as I would have liked but basically an economic anti-inflation strategy has been pursued since 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has that strategy been? It has been one of control of the money supply, opposed by the Australian Labor Party. It was opposed tonight in the House by the honourable member for Blaxland. It has been a policy of wage restraint, of delaying the introduction of a 35-hour-week in the hope that wage increases would be governed by increases in productivity-a policy opposed by the Labor Party. It has been a policy of control over government spending against the pressures not only of the Opposition and the unions but also, to a large degree, of the Opposition's own supporters-a policy opposed by the Labor Party. It has been a policy of reducing the deficit, of reducing government borrowing and thereby reducing the need for increases beyond a certain amount in interest rates. In other words, it has been a policy to reduce pressures to increase interest rates, and that policy has been opposed by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has proposed an increase in all government spending and an increase in the size of the Public Service. It has not complained about the current campaign of the Australian Council of Trade Unions on television to increase the size of the Public Service. It has supported demands for rapid wage increases as it did when it was in office. It has taken a benevolent view of what trade unions have been doing in all of the various disputes in which they have been engaged. It has not criticised the Wran model of industrial relations, which has been one of give in and subsequently put up with all the difficulties that that has resulted in. It has been the Hayden social contract model, when no social contract with unions thus far in Western democracy has been proved to work. The Labor Party has had a negative attitude to investment, particularly by people from overseas. It has not encouraged Australians to save to invest in their own resources but at the same time it has criticised foreigners who have been prepared to come in and fill that gap. All of these approaches have been put forward by the Australian Labor Party in opposition to an economic strategy put forward by this Government under great difficulty, often under criticism from its own supporters, and in a world in which we have increasing economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> The real question that faces Australia and the real question that faces this House in debate is this. Admitting that things are difficult, admitting that the average family is finding it very difficult indeed to make ends meet, admitting that pensioners are finding it difficult to cope with increasing prices, the question is: Would it be better for the Australian public, for the average family and for pensioners, to reverse the existing policies as advocated by the Labor Party or would it be better to struggle on with the policies and do the very best we can against adverse circumstances? That is the question I put before the House tonight. I challenge the Opposition not just to criticise, not just to say how bad things are, but to answer the charge which is that if we reverse these policies, surely we will all be worse off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) today was a confession of failure. As has already been pointed out to the House this is a Prime Minister who has been in office for a record term; a Prime Minister who, after a massive publicity campaign, came into office in 1975 telling the people of Australia that the problems of unemployment, the problems of inflation and recession were all domestic problems and were in no way related to overseas economic factors. For this Prime Minister, controlling inflation and providing jobs-let us quote him-'for all who wanted to work' was simply a matter of sound conservative economic management. It was as simple as the campaign theme of the Liberal Party; it was as simple as turning on the lights. That was the simplistic assertion, expensively mounted, lavishly sold, that not only gave the Prime Minister his electoral majority but also gave the people of Australia expectations that were as false as the political prophets who mouthed them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1975 any assertion that the Australian economy was interdependent with the rest of the world was dismissed by this Prime Minister and by every Minister who sits behind him and by his mealy-mouthed back benchers, who today were reduced to gloom and graven images as they heard the despondent message of the Prime Minister. As far as they were concerned, any suggestion to the Australian economy being economically interdependent could be dismissed as sheer Labor propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA> And so we come to today. For years we in this House have lived in a situation in which the Prime Minister, confronted with any economic problems at all for the first five years, was prepared to blame the Whitlam Government, although he had a record majority in both Houses. He had no problems with numbers; he had no difficulties with legislation being held up. He had the game before him and, day after day, confronted with problem after problem, the solution was simple. All honourable members on that side of the House had to do was to get up and say: ' But it was all the fault of the Whitlam Government'. After a period had passed, that excuse was no longer politically plausible. Even the blue-rinsed old ladies who comprised the Liberal Party's State councils and who loved the Prime Minister could no longer regard that statement as having any truth in it at all. He had to find someone else to blame and so for the last two years he has been blaming the trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Who are these trade unions, these demonic forces that ravage the Australian economy? The fact is that the average Australian trade unionist is the average Australian worker. If he is in a situation in which he is continually fighting to make ends meet, in which he finds his living standards continuously eroded and the only way he can maintain those living standards is by being prepared to resort to industrial action, if he cannot produce increases to maintain his standard of living by negotiation with his employer, then of course he is subjected to this continual demeaning by this Government. When Ministers of this Government talk about trade unionism and trade unionists it is as though they are talking about men from Mars, outside invaders whose only intent and purpose is to destroy the whole basis of the Australian economy. What they are talking about, and they always seem to forget it, is that the average Australian trade unionist is nothing more or less than the average decent Australian who goes to the football on Sunday and whom one might meet at his bowling club--</PARA>

So what has happened? The Prime Minister had an opportunity less than a fortnight ago on a motion of censure, which no Prime Minister who operates under the Westminster system anywhere in the world would have refused, to take up the debate and to defend the lack of confidence expressed in the motion, his economic policies and his government.

<PARA> Let us look at the Prime Minister's record of achievement. When the Labor Government went out of office in 1975, inflation was barely above 11 per cent and falling; it is now in excess of 11 per cent and rising. In 1975 the unemployment figure was 310,000 and falling; it is now 437,000 and rising-the highest level of unemployment in the history of Australia. In 1975 the average trade unionist was paying 59 per cent in pay-as-you-earn tax; he is now paying 66.3 per cent. The interest rate on home loans in the last years of the Whitlam Government was 10 per cent and falling. It is now 12 1/2 per cent and rising. If one wants first mortgage money, one is lucky if one can get it at 18 per cent, and one will probably pay 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The attack on the living standards of the average wage earner, the Fraserisation of the pay packet, has meant that the average worker is faced with increased health costs, increased interest rates, and increased costs for basic food commodities and clothing. The average family is now about $30 a week worse off. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of the new federalism-that glib term which was tossed around in the circles of the Liberal Party-has turned sour in the mouths of Liberal Premiers. The Prime Minister, the national leader of the Liberal Party, is now so popular that his Liberal cohorts in his own home State of Victoria have told him that the greatest single contribution that he can make to the return of a Liberal Party Government in Victoria is to stay out of the State. He can go overseas or to other States, but the one thing that they do not want him to do is to go to Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> We have today the spectacle of this Prime Minister reading to us what must be the sorriest statement, which purports to pass for an economic document, in the history of Australia. It is a sad confession of failure. Where in this document are the new promises? Where are the new visions? Where is there hope for the unemployed? Where is there hope for the small businessman who is going broke? Where is there hope for any section of Australian society?</PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) and those other speakers from the Opposition benches who have said that of course one cannot regard the Australian economy as being able to be cut off from any decline that takes place in other parts of the world, particularly in the Western world. But it is equally true that we are an exporter of food and, given our wealth and resources, an energy-rich country. We are rich in mineral resources. There is probably no nation in the Western world which was better equipped than Australia to withstand the problems of economic downturn or economic recession. All that it needed was effective political leadership. But what I find extraordinary in this document is that the Prime Minister concedes economic depression and failure in Great Britain, and concedes the problems in the United States. But does he learn from them? The economic problems that confront Great Britain and which are dividing English society from top to bottom are postulated on the same economic doctrine as Malcolm Fraser is posing for Australia. It is the same kind of economic nonsense that is mouthed by Mrs Thatcher, the Iron Lady. It is precisely the same kind of economic nonsense that is mouthed by the Prime Minister of Australia. If he continues with that philosophy, what has occurred in Great Britain will occur in Australia. The President of the United States is another exponent of small government, of the private sector, of letting the rich get richer and making certain that the poor get poorer. The economic doctrine of the President of the United States is now a matter of concern in all journals of economic repute in the United States. It takes more than a jaded film star to solve the problems of the United States, and it takes more than a jaded grazier to solve the problems that this Government has created for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are now confronted with is a situation in which, looking at the same problems-they are in different dimensions, admittedly-there are gross economic downturns in the United States and in Great Britain-this Australian Government and this group of back benchers that sits behind it are unable to reach a conclusion which any 12-year-old kid studying economics might well reach. That is that when two Prime Ministers and one President are all saying the same thing in terms of economic philosophy and in all of their countries there are grave economic crises and downturns, perhaps the philosophy is wrong. That is not what comes through from this document. The only question is whether he is going to be honourable enough to resign and hand over the reins of leadership or whether he will wait for the people of Australia to say: 'For God's sake go and go quickly so that this nation can start on a course of economic recovery'. </PARA>
<PARA> This document is Malcolm Fraser's farewell to Lowe. The only serious political question, on any analysis that anyone in the Press Gallery has now got to make having in mind that there will be no change in economic doctrine-this is what we are all worrying about and putting our bets on-is whether there will be a change in the Prime Ministership. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) is loose, and even the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Sir Phillip Lynch)--</PARA>

<PARA> Let us get right down to the point here and now. On the Opposition side today there are-of course I do not in any way look at you, Mr Deputy Speaker, when I say this-those who have had a very great influence in the trade union movement, a very great influence. They come along here, some as the pensioned-off leaders of trade unions and some with, no doubt, an intent to do something to help their country. Some, no doubt, have an intent to help the welfare of the unionists they used to represent. What do they do in this House? What do they do when Wran 's fleet, as I have heard it described by the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards), is tied up off Sydney? What do they do to try to help the country and get those ships going again? They do nothing. They sit in this House and do nothing. Why? Because they are playing their own cheap political game. They do not want to get ships moving. These bully boys I refer to have no regard for the welfare of ordinary, decent Australian people, male and female. That is what the Government is on about and that is why so many pious utterances have come from the other side today. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of the argument in the last three weeks has been what? From the other side it has been cries of 'falsity', 'broken promises' and 'liar, liar'. It is a very unfortunate turn of phrase when it is used unscrupulously. There is a deliberate attempt to denigrate and single people out in a most unfair method that I think would not bear any comparison with what happens in any other democratic country in the world today. That is what some of the Opposition members are doing to the parliamentary system of Australia. That is what they are doing to the democracy of Australia today. When I first came into this House many years ago there were some elements of decency and friendship on both sides. That situation cannot persist today when the alternative Prime Minister of this country drives people out of the House when he gets up to speak. He drives them out because he makes unfair, unfounded charges based on gang warfare, based on ' liar, liar, liar' and based on things that do not make this House work. That is a serious matter. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to deal with four major items tonight. The first one is that, thank goodness for this country, the first Prime Minister and leader of a democratic nation I know of in the free world who saw that the world increase in costs was going to continue was Prime Minister Fraser. Two years ahead of any other country we took a deliberate decision as part of an economic strategy because we saw what was going to happen next and realised that we must cut down on costs if the taxation base in the future was to be such that we would be able to pay our way. That is what we did. Eighteen months or two years later Prime Minister Thatcher came along. Years after that, Mr Reagan came along. This Government, contrary to the oversentimental nature of some well meaning members of the Labor Party, realised that the taxpayers of this country would not be able to pay the bill unless some rationalisation took place. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable members realise that it took seven years for the Fraser Government, with all the best will in the world, to overcome the deficit caused by the Whitlam Government? This year for the first time we managed to balance the books. What a mighty effort that was and how fortuitous that was, given any blowout that we may see in the Budget. Would anyone say that it was the fault of the Fraser Government that crude oil production in Bass Strait ran into strikes? Are members of the Opposition serious about that? If they are, I would be surprised. Would anyone in this House say that it was the Fraser Government's fault that the world price of crude oil came down and cost this Government revenue? Of course we are pleased about it, but it has cost the Government revenue. Would anyone in this House say that the state of the economy of the United States of America is this Government's fault? I ask honourable members those questions because they are the three reasons why there could be a blowout of the Budget. The Opposition tonight, led by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), has quite unfairly and unobjectively tried to say that those three things are the fault of the Fraser Government. Of course they are not. The big thing I am so pleased about in relation to the 1981-82 Budget is that we were able to budget for a domestic surplus. Thank goodness we did. What did the Labor Party say about that in the Budget debates? It performed left, right and centre on every little pinpricking item and said that the Government should be expending more money. Thank goodness we budgeted for that domestic surplus because it is very important that we did. We have that safety valve that will benefit this nation over not one year but over many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very surprised that with the exception of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) there has been no appreciation at all tonight of what the Government has been about. I criticise some members of the Opposition today as an alternative government. I criticise them for their lack of economic responsibility. They have not put their minds to the real issues which this country will face in the future. They have not attempted to put their minds to them. I am getting very fed up-as some honourable members may have gathered tonight-hearing what I regard as political expediency flowing from the mouths of the members of the Opposition. It does not do credit to the Leader of the Opposition or his party as an alternative government. Whether in a by-election atmosphere we hold the seat of Lowe or the Labor Party takes it really is a matter of temporary political judgment by people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the honourable member for Lalor, with his great exuberance, will know what he is talking about. I do not know but he may be referring to the world leadership that the Prime Minister has given in the Commonwealth of nations. I am not very concerned about that one way or another but I am deeply concerned about the future of this country. I invite honourable members opposite to apply their minds to the future of Australia. It is not just a matter of additional expenditure here there and everywhere because people are saying that they need more money for this, for that, for the arts and so on. Governments cannot say yes to everybody. It is a matter of looking responsibly at the future of this country and the direction in which it is heading. I congratulate the Prime Minister on his statement. I support it wholeheartedly. I suggest that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will not find too many chinks in the armour of honourable members on the Government side of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the speech of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Giles) had been made in support of any other government but this Government one would have felt some sympathy for him as a supporter of the Government. The honourable members who sit opposite remind me of those figures discovered in an Army vault at Sian in China-a full regiment of porcelain soldiers there to defend the emperor in his tomb. They think as loudly and as actively and they put forward solutions in defence of the Government in about as imaginative a form. The statement today by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is typical of the type of waffle and nonsence that we have come to expect in this Parliament from the Liberal and National Country Party Governments. It almost equates, although not quite as badly, that which comes from the Victorian Government. The Victorian Government probably has only one major achivement-that it has put forward a number of proposals for solving the economic problems but has spent more money on advertising the Minister who put them forward than on the proposals themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We heard pious nonsense-that is the only way I can describe the previous speech -to the effect that the Opposition should do this and that. It is interesting to note that the Government accepts no responsibility for industrial disputes or other activities which occur under federal awards. The Prime Minister displayed an amazing capacity for failing to recognise responsibilities for national leadership but he has no problem whatsoever in blaming the New South Wales Government, his favourite aunt sally, for those disputes which occur under State awards and especially those disputes which involve State and federal awards. I recall that it was this Prime Minister, as the shadow Minister for Labour and Industrial Relations, who prevented going through this Parliament legislation which sought to solve problems associated with Federal and State awards, problems which could be solved by legislation and on which a report was brought to this Parliament in 1974. Both inside and outside this Parliament we hear Government Ministers making statements about the terrible labour relations in Australia, the lack of legislative authority and how the Government is unable to act, but never, do they mention the role they played in preventing this Parliament passing legislation to deal with industrial disputes resulting from conflict between industrial laws. The Liberal and National Country Parties in this Parliament voted against fixing up problems which have been around since the 1960s as a result of the Moore v. Doyle case, thus creating an enormous number of industrial disputes in this country. Outside this Parliament it was those honourable members who now sit opposite who successfully campaigned against the provision of powers in the Constitution to give this Parliament the right to legislate in respect of wages and prices policies. They lament the lack of powers, they created the problems and they then seek to use those problems for their own political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem Australia faces today and the problem which I think the Western world faces is the lack of credible leadership. Australia unfortunately has no one who speaks on behalf of Australia and Australians. This country has no one who can be looked to as a national leader in whom trust can be placed, no one who can be accepted as meaning what he has said or as being credible. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5J4">Mr SCHOLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us consider the last three elections. Who on the Government side is prepared to stand up and say that any of the commitments which arose out of the 1975 election-and may I mention the most inportant of them, taxation-were kept? The Government promised, firstly, that it would retain Medibank, which is now a standing joke in the whole of the Australian community. The Prime Minister in this Parliament, as the Leader Opposition and as caretaker Prime Minister, having been placed in office by a dishonest act, stated that taxation by stealth was not a policy which could be accepted by the Australian people and that in order to keep governments honest his Government would index taxation, thus requiring governments openly to raise their income tax revenue and other forms of revenue in a manner which could be seen and understood. That is what he said in this Parliament when he was in opposition and when he was seeking election. Of course, income tax has not been indexed fully. In the last Budget the Government at last abandoned even the pretence of indexation. It has said that there will be no further indexation. The reason for this is that the Government does not want to have to acknowledge publicly the level to which it is increasing taxation on the Australian community with the exception of that section of the community which it favours, that is, those people on the 60c in the dollar bracket. They are the only people in the Australian community on comparable incomes who will pay less tax this year than they did last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at how the Government fulfilled its promises to the pensioners. In the statement the Prime Minister said that the Government had indexed pensions. How many honourable members recall that on one occasion only a couple of years ago the Government saved $30m in revenue by amending the increase in pensions from twice to once a year? Where in the Prime Minister's statement today, in this state of the nation address, is there anything which will ease the worry of pensioners who in three months' time will have to pay tax on income over $6.50 a week after they receive the increase resulting from the most recent cost of living figures? Where is a statement that the minimum tax level will be raised so that their earnings above the pension will be protected? I refer to another section of the community. There are a number of means tests on pensions but there is one which is the most restrictive of all. I refer to pensioners who are paid rent assistance. Any income over $2 that they receive is means tested for their pension. On the basis of the current tax minimum, a pensioner who meets fully that minimum $2 a week income pays tax on his rent allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the extent to which the low income earner is being served by this Government. That is the extent to which the Government is meeting its commitments. The Government talks in totals and in gross figures about climbing social welfare bills. Let us look at the relativity between the social welfare bill now and what it was when the Government came into office. Firstly, the bill for unemployment has doubled in real terms because the Government has failed to do anything to cure unemployment and has openly admitted in this House, in the Prime Minister's statement, that it has no concern for the unemployed of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one part of the welfare bill. Another area in which a false extension took place was when family allowances were created. No one objects to family allowances, but what happened was that a deduction allowed under the taxation system was replaced by an entry in the welfare outgoings column. It was a straight transference of money from one pocket to the other. Family allowance payments add to the welfare bill but the abolition of the tax deduction for children has resulted in an increase in taxation but a reduction in tax foregone . The Government is able to say what it wishes about welfare but the facts of Australian life are that under this Government those on the lowest incomes- families with incomes under $15,000 a year, families struggling to pay off a home, pensioners and people on fixed incomes-have suffered a greater loss than that which is generally spread across the whole of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's economic policy is based on depriving those people who work for wages, who have no other source of income and no means of avoiding their liabilities for pay-as-you-earn taxation and consciously seeking to reduce their standard of living whilst transferring additional profit, additional incomes to those in the community who have the most money and therefore are least in need. That is the basis of this Government's policy. It has talked and talked about how it is cutting back on government expenditure and practising small government . But this year this Government, which professes to be a small tax government, will collect in taxes a greater proportion of the total income of this nation and will devote a greater proportion to public expenditures than has any government in history. If the aim of the Government is what the Prime Minister said it was when he came into office in 1975-that is, to reduce government expenditure, to reduce taxation and, as one of those sweet sounding phrases we once heard in this Parliament says, to allow the people to make decisions on how they spend their money-it has been a case of great phrases and great sloganising . The facts of life are that Australian people in general have less money to spend now than when the Government came into office and the Government spends more of their money than ever before in the history of this country. The general community receives less in return because of the incompetence of this Government and because of its penchant for making decisions not on the needs of the Australian community but on the perceived ideological program of a government which is bereft of any conscience and bereft of any sense of integrity in is actions towards the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> This Prime Minister and this Government have created greater divisions in the Australian community than has any other government in Australia's history. The Government has done more to divide the Australian community than has any other government in Australia's history. In Australia today there are more people than ever before in our history sleeping in the streets, deprived of adequate income and of a roof over their heads and more people whose homes are under threat because of the Government's inability to cope. Most importantly, a nation which is in crisis needs leadership. It cannot be provided by the Prime Minister who made the statement today. He is incapable of engendering trust and of obtaining the trust of the Australian people because he has deceived them on too many occasions. On too many occasions he has told them solemnly that his Government will do this and that. We all remember the promises; they are a legend. Too often he has been found wanting in his delivery of the trust that the Australian people have placed in him. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs leadership. It needs leadership desperately. It will never obtain leadership from a Prime Minister who believes that the next political trick, the next political deception, the next point scored is a plus for his administration. A Prime Minister who practised the policies of this Government, who honestly put them forward before this Parliament and who was prepared to stand up to the consequences of his policies would earn at least respect even if he did not earn votes. But, of course, the facts are that on each occasion when this Government has been under threat it has made promises that it knew it could not keep, made statements that it knew it could not honour, and has now spent the total accumulation of trust and respect which is due to a Prime Minister and national leader in a government. The only service which the Prime Minister could now place above his own personal interests and in the national interest would be to get out of this Parliament as fast as he can so that we can start to repair the damage that he and his Government have created. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser ) for a concise position paper on Australia today. He has opened debate for all to express an opinion and all will get an opportunity, without needing to interject, I am sure. Whilst he, the Prime Minister, presented a balanced report , the Opposition has given us gloom. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes ) has just informed us of the need for leadership. I guess he is of the opinion that it might come from somewhere on the Opposition side of the House. I disagree entirely and I thought I might let him know what the public of Australia thought of that possibility when they were asked about the abilities of the Government and the Opposition to alter the interest rate market as it exists in Australia today. I quote from a Morgan gallup poll published in the Bulletin of 9 February. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, they-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the people interviewed-</PARA>
<PARA>were asked: If the ALP was now the Federal Government, do you believe interest rates would be higher, the same or lower? Forty-seven per cent said they believed interest rates would be the same, 14 per cent said higher, 21 per cent said lower and 18 per cent could not say. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, 61 per cent did not think that the Australian Labor Party could do anything about it and 18 per cent were not sure. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Forty-eight per cent of ALP voters said interest rates would be the same if the ALP was now the Government compared with 46 per cent of Liberal-National Country Party voters. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, a higher percentage of Labor voters had less faith in their party to achieve interest rate changes than did the Liberal voters. We are talking about leadership. That clearly shows the public's opinion of Labor's rantings about spending more while taxing less. The Leader of the Opposition told us about the good times of 1972 to 1975 and the bad times of 1976 to 1981 and produced the usual statistics. He failed to tell us that the period 1972-75 was when Labor threw a party and took all of Australia out to celebrate. </PARA>

He failed to say that the growth figures of 1976 to 1981 that he quoted were heavily retarded by the cost of paying for that party. It is time that the Leader of the Opposition, along with some of his colleagues, particularly the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) discovered how much faith the public has in his rhetoric. The item which I have just drawn to the attention of the House is as important in that regard as any to which I could refer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills chose to quote Sir Charles Court. He had to look beyond his own party for a quotation of note, and chose one by a top Liberal. He did so to substantiate a great political truth, that no law can be effective without public support. I say that no democratic government can lead a reluctant population even to prosperity. The original Australian, the Aboriginal , and our early settlers were unable to generate any sort of standard of living until they commenced to trade internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia cannot consume the products of its industries and its resources; it must export. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) told us today that it was just a matter of good luck that we had any trade at all. In one respect I agree with him. Australia has tended to be priced out of international markets as a result of the activities of union leaders who have encouraged workers to reduce production and demand higher wages at the same time. I wonder what the average unionist's attitude would be if one of our champion cricketers walked off the ground after he had made 50 runs, saying, 'That's enough; there is no need for me to make a century any more'; or if a champion goal scorer walked off at three-quarter time, saying, 'I have got my five or six goal total for the day ; that should be enough'. When we stop to think about it, what is the difference ? We are either working for Australia or we are not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have employed up to 100 people. Some of Labor's union confederates see the word ethic as a dirty word. We are well aware of the value of human endeavour in the less resource-rich countries. Some of this endeavour is imported to Australia, sometimes by way of refugee boats. An example of Australia's treatment of such enthusiasm was clearly demonstrated recently when a group of refugees found employment in the production line of an electronics factory. The supervisor placed these people-being new-at the beginning of the line, performing a simple task. This soon created great ruction as the part- finished goods were leaving the refugees too quickly and longer term workers were coming under pressure. To avoid industrial strife the supervisor transferred the refugees to the top end of the line where they sat twiddling their thumbs waiting for the product to reach them. That is a recipe for annihilation. Australia's economic performance will match the efforts of its work force. The proportion of total world trade that Australia needs to employ 250,000 people represents a mere fraction of that trade. It need only compete in a world context-not kid itself about protection and about creating jobs, by reducing working hours. Examples available all over the world show that if working hours are increased employment will be increased because the country is made more productive and more competitive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to some of the hyprocrisies of the Opposition's case, as presented today . Its leader expressed concern for investors in the stock market-the arch capitalists. That is absolutely astounding. He tried to suggest-he has twice done so now-that the average Australian has all of his savings tied up in the share market. What a lot of rot! He is much more likely to have them tied up in cash savings where the returns have at last reached a level which will allow him to live off his savings and retain the real value of his investment. But the Leader of the Opposition did not want to tell us that. He told us a hard luck story about an individual who had invested his sole $100,000 in the share market . He can introduce me to someone like that. I have never met anyone who was so foolish. Perhaps it was a personal experience of the Leader of the Opposition; I do not know. The share market experience has purely demonstrated that there is now a direct profit in lending money; that the capital gain sought in the market is no longer so necessary. When cash lending is no longer attractive, the investor will probably return to the share market. In the meantime, industry can improve the price of its shares by increasing its return on investors' funds; in other words, getting out and making more profits. That will put share prices up. It can do this when it discovers that it must be efficient and highly productive . It will not do it by making wages and hours deals which price its goods off the market. As Australians choose to save their money to gain higher interest income they will not buy this overpriced production. The work force will suffer and the honourable member for Wills will blame this Government for greater unemployment and, I suppose, suggest more Regional Employment Development schemes. He will then, of course, choose to forget his quotation of Sir Charles Court's remarks, which suggest that perhaps people govern themselves to a greater degree than at other times he chooses to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not long ago that honourable members received a letter from the Geelong Trades Council. Amongst other things, it called for the Government to increase spending power within Australia and suggested that for this purpose a levy should be applied to our presently ailing mining industry. These people overlooked the fact that the levy had already been applied by a greedy work force which, by an excessive wage and hours structure, had already creamed off money that might otherwise be distributed more evenly in the way proposed. However, at least that money has reached the community and it will circulate. </PARA>
<PARA> But what of the other great burden that all Australian industry must bear-the strike? The cost of waterfront strikes this year was estimated to be $550m. No doubt the cost of all other strikes would exceed that amount. The cost of strikes represents a direct, self-imposed extraction of spending power from the Australian economy. The billion-plus dollars to which I have referred can multiply many times as it moves through the system. Through industrial activity the Australian Council of Trades Unions and its affiliates impose much greater control on the money supply than the Reserve Bank ever did. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to some of the hypocritical claims made by the Opposition in this debate. It has expressed concern about home ownership levels and home interest rates. Yet it promotes policy after policy aimed at increasing government expenditure and reintroducing the 20 per cent inflation rate over which they presided during their last attempt to govern the country by handouts. Such inflation will affect the cost of homes. If lenders are to retain the value of their investment, interest rates must exceed the rate of inflation. When that happens, do not bother about the price of money because, as in 1975, no one will want to borrow, no one will want to invest in Australia. If Labor's philosophy was really directed to home ownership, why will not the Government of New South Wales sell State houses to its tenants? The Labor Party does not believe in home ownership. Its socialist philosophy sees a home as something to own during one's lifetime and then return to the State, preferably directly but if not, by way of capital gains tax or death duties. The greatest hypocrisy of all must be the recent announcement that the Labor Party will no longer support these types of taxes. I find it hard to decide who are the biggest hypocrites-those who saw the political reality or those who have denied their genuine socialist philosophy and have gone quiet on this issue. They are a disgrace to the socialist cause. I , as a capitalist-an agreed and admitted capitalist-say, thank you very much; but I do not have faith in the Labor Party sticking by its decision if it is ever given the chance to implement it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member will tell me all about capital gains tax! He believes in a capital gains tax but he has welched on the people who elected him because he promised it to them. The Labor Party talks of helping the small businessman yet it proposes for him high inflation and price fixing. Price fixing is something which I recollect, as young as I might appear to be. Price fixing has only two results: It either sets prices at the highest common denominator or it turns honest men into dishonest men.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Opposition really likes small business, why does it not suggest to this House that we sell Canberra's ACTION buses to the men who drive them and create another 400 or 500 small businessmen? They could operate as subcontractors to the authority which now controls them. No doubt they would supply a very efficient service. They could choose the number of hours they wanted to work and I am sure they would be able to profit by such an arrangement. I suggest that the Opposition would go to the barricades if such a suggestion came from the Government, as good as it might be for the workers concerned. It would give them profit and it would give them the right to decide their own future. But the Opposition believes that everyone should be a wage earner, and preferably a wage earner of the Government. So why does it express concern for small businessmen? Maybe it needs their votes to get elected, but I hope the small businessmen have long memories. Honourable members might talk of bankruptcies and things of that nature but I have been a small businessman for 20-odd years and I know this Government has always made life better for small businessmen, principally because it let us make up our own minds as to how we went broke if that was what we chose to do. As I said, when we made profits we broke our necks to go out and spend them, which in turn almost always created employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees inflation as the principal enemy and its strategy is to keep the money supply in line with the goods and services that Australians can produce and afford. It is interesting that we so often talk of the effects on the world economy of the decision of the member nations of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase dramatically the price of oil and then steadily increase it further. Nevertheless, two or three years ago I heard one of that organisation's senior people admit to the huge burden that they had imposed on their own economies when they increased oil prices. They found that when they exported their oil at this wonderful new price they so affected the economies of other countries that those countries had to increase the prices of the goods that the oil exporting countries wanted to buy back. The total effect was that they were not doing so well. In terms of tonnes of oil, their purchasing power was not much better than it was before. Yet now, when the world has taken the message, which Australia will take on its labour force in due course, and has refused to buy the product any more, they find themselves still paying the overseas price for the goods they wish to import while the price of their own product is going down. It is a warning for all Australians: If we do not produce, we will die. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have witnessed in the Parliament today a speech on the state of the nation by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) which admits that his Government has failed the Australian people. He has attempted to turn what should have been a speech of resignation into a paean of praise by comparing the disastrous economic performances of other European countries with the very poor performance of the Australian economy. In other words, he has compared bad with bad. In recent speeches around the country the Prime Minister has emphasised the theme that Australia is doing well despite a continuing world recession. How hollow these words sound in relation to the Governor-General's Speech of 18 months ago which heralded the forthcoming policies of this Government. We all remember the following words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Government will give particular attention to encouraging the growth of the private sector and to increasing the freedom of choice of taxpayers in spending their own incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>After the 18 months since that statement was made, that part of the private sector which employs over half of the Australian work force-namely, small business-could not be in worse shape. An indication of this is the increasing number of bankruptcies, rising from 2,196 to 1976-77 to 5,112 in 1980-81, an increase of 133 per cent in four years. In discussions with me a number of small business proprietors in my electorate of La Trobe have expressed their concern at the lack of spending power of the general public and excessive interest rates , both of which mean that profits are hardly covering overheads. Many small shopkeepers are working for a net return which is far less than average weekly earnings. The Government claims that there have been large increases in real disposable household incomes in the past year but this claim is totally untrue. Increases in taxation, in interest rates and in health insurance premiums have all combined to reduce disposable household incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Another policy statement included the claim that the Government had a commitment 'to assist homeless persons, to assist low or moderate income earners in house purchasing and in the strong commitment . . . to welfare housing'. But, as has been pointed out in this House on a number of occasions, next to unemployment housing is the most serious social problem in Australia. However, Commonwealth funds for public housing have dropped from 3.9 per cent of the total Budget outlays in 1974-75 to one per cent in 1981-82. This represents a reduction in real terms from $1,413m in 1974-75 to $399m this year. This reduction is particularly noticeable in the outer eastern region of Melbourne in which my electorate is situated. The lack of rental housing, both public and private, has reached such an acute stage that many estate agents no longer advertise rental vacancies. The Youth Emergency Accommodation Group of the outer eastern region has provided figures in relation to requests for emergency accommodation for the 10-month period July 1980 to April 1981. In that period, of a total of 672 requests for accommodation from homeless youth in the region, accommodation could be found for only 193 young people. Over 479 young people had to seek accommodation elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> In such circumstances hundreds of young people are forced to find shelter in railway stations, empty buildings, cars, parks and bus shelters in the hope that they can obtain a night's rest. Caravan parks in the area, which are normally expected to provide temporary accommodation for itinerant workers and holidaymakers, are now full of permanent residents who have no other housing options. It is also important to remember that unemployed young people under 18 years of age still receive only $36 per week but are expected to pay weekly rentals of $50 to $65 for a two-bedroom house in Bayswater or Boronia, in my electorate. In the outer eastern region of Melbourne rents have increased by 20 per cent in the past year. In Victoria as a whole 30,000 families are on the Housing Commission waiting list for homes to rent or buy. </PARA>
<PARA> Private housing is in a similar crisis situation as a result of the rise in home loan interest rates from 9.5 per cent in February 1980 to 12.5 per cent now . This increase of 3 per cent has meant an increase in home mortgage repayments of $65 per month, to a total of $327 per month. In addition, many home buyers are paying up to 20 per cent interest on a second mortgage. Members on the Government side of the House point to the fact that few people are selling their houses because of increased mortgage repayments. Whilst I would question the argument that home buyers are not being forced to sell because of threatened foreclosures, it is a fact that selling the family home is the last step to be taken by families experiencing financial difficulties. They will cut their costs on education, health, personal necessities and even food before they will place their home on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> An increasing number of people are coming to my electorate office to seek my help in interceding with building societies and other relevant institutions to enable them to meet their mortgage and rental commitments. As for the young would-be home owners, there is no hope for them unless both partners are working in permanent and well-paid jobs. This is the housing situation 18 months after the Government's announced policies, which it stated would assist people who wanted to own their own homes and who needed cheap rental accommodation. As in all other areas of Government policy, Australia has moved backwards, not forwards. The Prime Minister has stated that living standards have been improved . Such a statement would be a joke if it were not so tragic for Australians, the greater majority of whom have suffered from the past 6 1/2 years of Liberal- National Country Party government. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn to some of the comments contained in the Prime Minister's statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the area of social welfare the automatic indexation of pensions has given income security to a very significant number of people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that this statement is nonsensical because I have talked to many pensioners over the past year who are desperately searching for some way of keeping up with the cost of living. Even automatic indexation is six months behind rising prices. Why should pensioners have to wait six months for cost of living increases? Time and again in this Parliament I have brought up the matter of threshold levels which are disadvantaging pensioners both in the receipt of fringe benefits and the reduction of pensions as a result of small amounts of additional income. These threshold levels need to be adjusted so that pensioners can receive more income before their pensions are reduced and before they are taxed on the modest incomes they receive. The threshold levels for fringe benefits must also be increased because rising inflation has meant that only pensioners who are well below the poverty line can receive fringe benefits. The only answer the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has given to the calls from the Opposition for a raising of the threshold levels is that it will all depend upon the capacity of the Government to make the adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister claims that his Government has given income security for pensioners but the pensioners know that that statement is untrue, as any reader of their newspaper, The Australian Pensioner, will surely know. In the context of Government statements one must not forget the recent utterances of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) who said, in effect, that too many rich pensioners are dipping into the public purse and something must be done to stop the process. Of course, his statements have been repudiated by the Prime Minister because of the Lowe by-election. But the statement was approved by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and it does not take any imagination to realise that what has really happened is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for his own good reasons, has revealed future Government strategy. The Government will attempt, as usual, to fool the electorate prior to the next election into voting it into government. Only if it can gain government again will it move against the pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Another statement by the Prime Minister which would be funny if it were not so tragic for the average taxpayer is this comment:</PARA>
<PARA> I want to reaffirm that it is the policy of the Government to make further income tax reductions when it is economically responsible to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>How many times over the past six and a half years has the Prime Minister made such comments? But instead of reducing taxation he has increased it. Since the Fraser Government came to office revenue from taxes has increased by 24 per cent in real terms. However, the burden of taxation is falling not on those who can most afford to pay but on the wage and salary earner who cannot obtain concessions and subsidies and who cannot avoid taxes as can the rich supporters of this Government. The wage and salary earner has seen taxes bite heavily into pay packets as inflation pushes incomes into higher tax brackets but there has been no relief from the Government. Instead the Government took away the half indexation provisions which would have reduced the effects of inflation and went on to increase sales taxes substantially. It is against this background of tax increases that the Prime Minister has the gall to come into this House and to talk about further income tax reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> It was noticeable that the Prime Minister and the Ministers who followed him in this debate had little to say about unemployment. As I mentioned earlier, unemployment and housing are the two most serious social problems in Australia today. Yet the Government has no answers to those major problems. Since 1976 the Government has seen unemployment figures, as published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, grow from 301,600, or 4.9 per cent of the labour force, to 386, 400, or 5.7 per cent of the labour force. The figure is even higher today. As has been pointed out by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research of the Melbourne University, supported by the Victorian Chamber of Commerce, unemployment is likely to become even worse during 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures are deficient because they do not record the numbers of people who would want to work but know that it is a waste of time to register for employment because of a lack of job opportunities. Reliable estimates by several university departments have established that for every one person registered for work there is one other person who is not registered but who would also like a job. It is only over the past seven years that hidden unemployment has become a problem but it is a phenomenon which should not be ignored. So the total number of people seeking work is probably over 800,000. The worst aspect of unemployment is the demoralisation and apathy which it generates in young people. Our young people represent Australia's investment in the future and this Government has nothing to offer them. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaker after speaker on the Government side of the House talked about the present prosperity of Australia. But it is all words. Ask the average taxpayer, the pensioner, the home buyer-the unemployed whether we are prosperous. Ask the three million Australians who are underprivileged whether we are prosperous. Let me remind the House again of the Prime Minister's words:</PARA>
<PARA> It is an undoubted fact that as a result of our policies Australia has prospered in recent years while the rest of the world has been stagnating. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that some people have prospered-tax avoiders, overseas investors, and the recipients of capital gains, for example. It is the blatant hypocrisy and deception which the Prime Minister's statement indicates which makes a mockery of this Parliament. If there could be some honesty and sincerity from the Government the Australian people would have a greater regard for politics and the processes of the Parliament. When the Prime Minister makes blatantly dishonest statements such as 'the living standards of Australia's families have been improved' it is inevitable that the debate in the Parliament is described 'as a piece of theatre', as it was by a commentator on the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program P.M. tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> In my maiden speech in the House over a year ago I pointed out that government planning and control could prevent the dislocation of our economy but that Liberal philosophy, which believes in the free flow of market forces unhindered by government regulation, will cause a deterioration in the lives of the Australian people. Unfortunately my words have proved all too true. As I also pointed out at that time, only the policies of the Australian Labor Party can alleviate the effects of the economic crisis which has been developing in this country for the past six and a half years. Our great mineral wealth has insulated us from the worst effects of the recession which has spread from the United States of America. But our mineral wealth has been squandered by this Government and it can no longer insulate us from the insane economic policies of the Reagan Administration. We need a public planning framework within which development plans can be formulated which will benefit all Australian people. We need a restructuring of our taxation system so that wealthy individuals and corporations contribute their fair share to government revenue. We need to revitalise public enterprise so that the public sector can really achieve its objectives of serving the Australian people. Only the Australian Labor Party can provide these initiatives. The Prime Minister's statement can only serve to strengthen the ALP vote in the Lowe by-election and, inasmuch as the statement also reflects the views of the Victorian Liberal State Government, it will help the ALP to win government in that State on 3 April. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So much has been said in this House regarding youth unemployment that I feel I should refer to two publications launched on 26 February by the Youth Education Advisory Committee of the Whittlesea Shire. I do so because I believe the Government lacks depth of understanding of the problem. These reports illustrate this. The publications are entitled: 'Youth Employment and Unemployment in an Outer Suburban Area: A Survey of Employers' and 'Youth Employment and Unemployment in an Outer Suburban Area: An Overview'. The study was carried out by the Youth Education Advisory Committee. It was analysed, compiled and published by the Melbourne State College and was funded by a grant from the Northern Region transition Education Advisory Committee. Whilst the report applies to the Shire of Whittlesea I suspect that it would apply also to the other municipalities in my electorate of Scullin, namely, the Shires of Diamond Valley and Bulla and the City of Preston which are areas of high youth unemployment and youth problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can only quote some of the findings, recommendations and conclusions of the report so that the ordinary decent Australian citizen to whom the Prime Minister so often refers can draw his or her own conclusions. Firstly, there appears to be only a minority of firms which employ no young people. That is scarcely remarkable. There are significantly more young men than young women employed in the region. Yet later the survey shows that there is quite a marked preference and need for young women to have employment close to their home area. There are likely to be few vacancies available for young workers in the next 12 months. The vacancies that are available will be replacement vacancies, not new positions. A large proportion of these vacancies will occur in a few big firms but also a large proportion will occur in the many small firms which might, by virtue of their numbers, be more difficult for employment services to cover. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, small firms are more likely to have experienced difficulty in filling positions in the past. A small number of vacancies may be expected among firms that have not previously employed young people. This suggests that youth unemployed groups should consider extending their activities to include firms that previously have not employed young people, and also, may I add, to a concentration on small firms. But then comes the crunch. The main reasons for not employing more young people have more to do with the structural and economic factors than the shortcomings of individual applicants. I think that is significant. It is a reflection on the state of the economy. A strategy for a reduction of unemployment that focuses on training and improvement of young applicants would appear to offer only small scope for alleviating the problems of youth unemployment. Yet this is the very strategy which this Government offers. The Government tells us that it will alleviate this youth unemployment by focusing attention on the training and improvement of young applicants. That is the very thing which the survey of employers indicates is not satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to some of the observations that were made in this survey of employers. Whilst it was found that the Commonwealth Employment Service was well respected by employers, it was felt that the Service did not advertise its services adequately nor did it communicate enough with employers. In the brief time which is available to me it is not possible to deal with this rich source of information and the recommendations. Yet we find the Minister in Victoria, Mr Brian Dixon, advertising in the St Kilda electorate campaigns for the employment of young people. Thousands of dollars of public money have been spent on advertising, which is obviously election advertising. Up to six photographs of the Minister have appeared in the one advertisment. That was paid for by public moneys and by his Ministry. Yet here is an area of high youth unemployment which is receiving no assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members may recall my speech in the adjournment debate on 17 November last year in which I discussed the unsatisfactory position with respect to the establishment of computerised legal information retrieval systems in Australia. Unfortunately, the situation appears not to have greatly advanced from what I then described and indeed in some respects it has got worse. Since my earlier comments both the Victorian and New South Wales governments have issued invitations for proposals to establish computerised legal information retrieval systems in their States. Each invitation envisages the granting of a monopoly licence to an operator to establish and run a system in and for the State concerned. This seems to me a retrogressive step. Quite apart from the uniform principles of the common law, much State legislation is uniform. The laws of this Parliament apply to all States, apply throughout Australia. In these circumstances, naturally, we find a strong body of opinion among members of the legal profession and other likely users that the CLIR systems should have databases which are national in scope and run on an all-States basis for the benefit of the country as a whole and not confined to the interests of a single State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A lawyer should be able to research in a simple, efficient way so that by using a single search command on a terminal he would be able to do an across the board search of the whole of this country's current legislation or of the whole of the superior courts' reported case law. Against this background the current proposals of New South Wales and Victoria are not in the public interest. Firstly, the dissemination of legal material in this country will be fragmented between the States. Claims that the various State systems could be compatible are no answer because there is no guarantee that the systems will remain compatible as political and budgetary priorities change. Secondly, the interests of the less populous States-all but the eastern mainland States-will be substantially disadvantaged. Thirdly, the State proposals have all the evils of State sponsored regulated monopolies. Under monopolies no incentive exists for an operator to provide services over and above the minimum stipulated by government. The incentive to provide comprehensive, economical, efficient and friendly services is provided by the spur of competition, not by the dead hand of regulation. Fourthly, as I stated last November, governments have a well known unsatisfactory track record in the provision of comprehensive, up to date and consolidated legal materials. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent letter in the journal of the Law Council of Australia, the writer observed that the copyright argument, favoured by governments and apparently being advanced on behalf of all governments, that a system cannot be set up without the involvement of governments is a specious one. Governments can easily waive any such rights and place statutes and judgments in the public domain where they naturally belong. The Commonwealth Government holds a responsibility to the nation as a whole. The Commonwealth cannot condone the current situation and in particular the grant of State monopoly licences. It should amend the Copyright Act to allow statutes, regulations and cases to be freely disseminated . In the meantime it can fulfil its obligations by allowing those capable private organisations which wish to disseminate legal information through electronic media to do so without unreasonable restriction. That is not the position at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House the implications of an incident which occurred on 25 February at the B. F. Goodrich chemical plant in Altona, Victoria, when leaking vinyl chloride gas caused the evacuation of 500 workers. The gas leak, which took more than six hours to bring under control, caused the threat of a devastating explosion, according to fire brigade officials, and exposed workers at the plant and people in the surrounding community to grave risks of cancer from the highly toxic gas. That the leaking gas did not ignite, as happened in a similar incident in Mexico in 1975, causing the death of 50 people, is an example of monumental good luck. That the gas leak occurred in the first place is a reflection on Victoria's archaic occupational safety regulations-a situation which will be remedied by the Cain Labor government after its election on 3 April. The leak occurred because the storage tank for the vinyl chloride monomer was installed with only one safety valve rather than a double valve system which is a standard safety requirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After evacuating workers from the plant, the company was anxious to play down the real danger from a potential explosion. It stated that there was no danger to the general community from the leak. The lie to the statement was given by the authorities which cleared an area two kilometres either side of the factory- an extremely large area-which suggests that a massive explosion could have occurred in Altona, taking with it petrol storage tanks in the vicinity. A car engine could have ignited the highly flammable gas. All this occurred because the company neglected to install an adequate safety valve system and the Victorian Liberal Government regards the enforcement of adequate safety standards an unnecessary intrusion on private industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A second and equally serious aspect of this incident is the toxic effects of exposure to the leaking vinyl chloride on the workers involved. Only in the last decade has research revealed vinyl chloride to be a potent carcinogen causing a well-known liver cancer called hepatanas and angiosaroma, a rare type of the same disease. The extent to which these diseases have already occurred amongst workers in the plastics industry is not known. Nobody knows the full costs to the health of workers in the plastics industry but isolated examples occur. For example, B. F. Goodrich of the United States of America revealed that three PVC workers in its Louisville, Kentucky factory had died of that disease of the liver between 1971 and 1974. Yet Goodrich was one of the major firms in the industry to oppose the introduction of regulations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States which would control exposure levels of vinyl chloride monomer to workers in the industry. The United States regulations passed in 1975 allow a permissible exposure level of one part per million. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria companies are generally allowed to undertake their own monitoring of air quality. We therefore do not know the full extent of exposure caused during this incident but certainly maintenance workers close to the storage plants must have experienced very high exposures. An article in the Age on 27 March reported that later measurements showed a peak level of about 100 parts per million. A scientist from La Trobe University said that a single exposure to VCM could initiate cancer. And yet this company, B. F. Goodrich, is known to regularly release vinyl chloride, and has done so at least 17 times in the last five years according to the Environmental Protection Authority. It is a national scandal that adequate regulations on the effects of hazardous chemicals such as VCM are not available. </PARA>
<PARA> At its October conference last year, the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party adopted a new and comprehensive policy on occupational health and safety. It will provide a sound legislative program for the incoming government after 3 April. Let us all be clear why the Labor Party will win a victory in Victoria. It is because the Party has spent a great deal of time and effort in developing sound policies in areas such as economic management, transport and so on. The Party's policy states that Victoria's laws on occupational health and safety are an embarrassing disgrace. The ALP policy states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is far too much law. Much of it is out-dated and unrelated to modern conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>When the Cain Labor Government has had time to sort out the mess created by successive Liberal governments, it will introduce an occupational safety and health Act which will at least provide some government controls. The Act will rationalise the existing chaotic administrative arrangements, provide for and enforce standards related to the causes of work-related injury and disease, give workers and their unions a say in safety policies and establish effective licensing systems for toxic substances and hazardous chemicals. The Victorian Labor Government will act. The national Government ought to act to establish overall standards in relation to environmental and occupational health. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) in lamenting the passing of Professor W. E. H. Stanner who died on 8 October last year at the age of 75. It had been our intention to make our contributions on the same evening but unfortunately that was not possible. Professor Stanner held distinguished appointments at the Australian National University where he was Professor of Anthropology and Sociology from 1964 to 1970. He was made Emeritus Professor and Honorary Fellow of the Australian National University in 1971. He held important appointments with government through his membership of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs and he worked directly with this Parliament through its committee system. In 1968 he delivered the Australian Broadcasting Commission series of Boyer lectures entitled 'After the Dreaming'. I recall the extraordinary effect that those lectures had on me and thousands of other Australians. The lectures were lucidly written and he spoke beautifully when delivering them. Those lectures represented a turning point in contemporary community attitudes as far as Aboriginal Australians are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I first came into contact with Professor Stanner during 1974-75 when he was an adviser to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs , of which I was a member. The Committee was then involved in its work on the conditions of the Aboriginal people at Yirrkala, the housing conditions of Aborigines in New South Wales and the conditions of Aboriginal people in south- west Western Australia. I was immediately struck by Professor Stanner's dignity and his wisdom and the fact that he was incapable of ever being overbearing or self-important. But behind the quiet, gentle and occasionally wry exterior there existed a burning passion for Aboriginal people and their awful circumstances. This had a huge effect on me. Here was a man, twice my age, who had been involved in Aboriginal issues for over 40 years, who had held academic posts and government posts and who was respected widely by black and white Australians, a man who must have been immensely discouraged by the lack of progress during all that time, and by the lack of response to his own extraordinary efforts, his reasoned arguments, his occasional display of heartfelt anguish about what he saw. Yet despite all of this he was still fighting inconspicuously, still undertaking arduous travel to the country where Aboriginal people still lived, putting up with and persevering with ignorant white attitudes, still ploughing on and never giving up. His attitude and his example provided me with a focus and a framework with which to approach this great issue. </PARA>
<PARA> His knowledge was immense, though modestly and carefully imparted, and was of enormous benefit to me and those of my colleagues who cared to listen. Although there must have been many disappointments for him, I am quite sure that he had a central impact on what is now a widely held respect for Aboriginal history and culture evidenced throughout Australia. He helped Australians to face up quite squarely to the feeling of collective guilt which we should all experience when we think of the disgrace of the last 200 years. This is a necessary cleansing process which we all must endure in order to plan a decent future of co- operation between all Australians. His part in this national awakening was probably best explained by his friend and colleague, Dr H. C. Coombs when he was writing in the ANU Reporter, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> There are few more influential words in the formation of contemporary attitudes than those which Bill embodied in his Boyer Lectures After the Dreaming. If at long last greater justice is achieved for Aboriginal Australians it will be due, in no small measure, to the changes in human understanding and compassion which those words have set in train. </PARA>
<PARA>He was a founding member of the Aboriginal Treaty Committee and the greatest monument which we could provide in memory to Professor Stanner would be to persevere with and conclude that treaty which would secure a future for all Aboriginal Australians. Aboriginal Australians have lost a great friend and champion and we have all lost a very gifted scholar, a generous and compassionate humanitarian, and a truly remarkable Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently I received an invitation to attend and address a rally to support local child care services. Several child care centres were involved in the rally such as the centre at St John's Avenue, Springvale; the centre at Noble Street in Noble Park; the Family Day Care program; the Keysborough Freedom Club, and so on. The invitation said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If you value child care services, pack a picnic lunch and bring your family to Burden Park as a demonstration of support for the continuation of federally funded child care services in Springvale. </PARA>
<PARA>And indeed, this was a demonstration with a difference. There were no marchers and no police. Concerned mums and dads turned up with their children, sitting on picnic chairs and blankets, eating their picnic lunches and listening to the Mayor of Springvale and other speakers. Many of those present have worked for years to improve the quality of child care services. They expressed their opposition to the Government's intention to subsidise commercial child care centres. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of clear evidence that high quality care and education during pre- school years is of critical importance to the development of each individual, one can ask: What is the Fraser Government's real intention in this field? If one looks at the last Budget of this Government it is obvious that it did not intend to maintain or to improve the services for children and their families. The amount allocated for child care programs in the 1981-82 Budget was the same as the previous year. This in fact means a reduction of approximately 15 per cent in real terms because of high inflation caused by this Government's own policies. In its true style, to dupe the electorate, the Government found some money for the funding of the child care program before the 1980 elections. It also invited further applications for child care funding, only to reject most of over 400 applications. Yet it finds hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Minister to pump into private child care centres. When it comes to boosting private profits, the Fraser Government always finds the money. It pickpockets the taxpayer, the ordinary Australian family man, to finance the opulent. Since Fraser grabbed power in 1975--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PH4">Mr KENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. Since the Prime Minister grabbed power in 1975, there has been a gradual but consistent redistribution of wealth directed by the Prime Minister from the poor to the wealthy, a reallocation of resources from the public sector to private profits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not one who will denigrate the private sector in child care. I acknowledge that private child care facilities fill an enormous gap, even though most of those involved in the profession of providing the services question the profit motivation of private child care and consider that there is a clear conflict of interest between the provision of a good service with trained staff and profit making. I, for one, know people who, side by side with profitability, have a human interest in providing a good service. I can assure the many parents who are forced to use private facilities because there are not enough community child care centres that, in most cases, their children are in good hands. However, I urge them to take more interest in the management of these centres and to insist on the employment of fully qualified staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I am not opposed to private child care centres, my first responsibility is to the public, to community child care. After all, we are dealing with public funds, and therefore we have to provide for the public sector. The Fraser Government, of course, has a different philosophy. It milks the people and subsidises its rich friends and the services for them. It takes away funds from State schools and gives them to rich private schools so that children of the rich can frolic in expensive swimming pools built by wealthy schools on public money, while the children of workers are crammed like sardines into portable classrooms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government is fond of the expression 'user pays'. So it wants to raise the fees in community child care centres to price the ordinary families out of child care facilities, while at the same time children of wealthy parents attending pre-school sections of prestige private schools have their fees subsidised through the Schools Commission. This Government wants to turn the clock back. It wants us to return to charity kindergartens for the poor and disadvantaged, with no service for the rest of the community whatsoever. We on this side of the House believe that our greatest assets are our children, the future citizens of Australia, and we pledge ourselves to look after them. We will first restore our spending on child care to the 1975 level and increase it gradually as soon as we get rid of this reactionary government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter which was referred to briefly by the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins). It concerns a practice which is very widespread and one which is out of character with the general philosophy which is being expressed by this Government and by other governments. We will all be aware that an election campaign is taking place in Victoria. Certainly we are all aware that a by-election is taking place in New South Wales. I think that the tenor of a number of activities in this Parliament indicates that. What I want to draw to the attention of the House and the nation is the manner in which duplicity is occuring in respect of the funding of elections in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A little over a year ago it was decided in New South Wales that public funding of election campaigns would become the policy of that State. The conservative parties made noises which indicated that the use of public funds for election campaigning was an improper practice. I think we should examine what is going on in Victoria. The honourable member for Scullin drew attention to the fact that youth employment schemes for areas of Victoria in which there are high levels of unemployment were not able to obtain funding. In some instances these schemes, which are of assistance even though they do not provide a great many jobs, have not been funded because the Department has claimed that it lacked funds. Over the last six months in Victoria there has been in local or limited distribution newspapers a long series of advertisments carrying multiple photographs of the particular Minister, Mr Brian Dixon, which newspapers are distributed mainly throughout his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many-I repeat, many-local newspapers which circulate through electorates in which there is high unemployment and the need for information. But, of course, the advertisments are not aimed at informing the community of the Government's policies. There was a time when communities knew what governments were doing because they were doing something, and the community understood what they were about. But when we have a government which governs through an office of a public relations firm, which invests more public money in public relations than it does in actually doing things, we have a situation in which public funds are being diverted to purposes for which it is not proper that they be expended. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be arguable whether public funding of election campaigns should take place, but at least where the offer is made to all sections of the community that are genuinely contesting an election, it is known that that money is being made available for election purposes. But in the State of Victoria, the State Electricity Commission, the conservation ministry and other ministries are preparing and presenting material in highly professional, costly television advertising campaigns which have been designed to dovetail into the Liberal party's election campaign exactly. The moralists, the people who claim that they represent the public interest, who claim that taxpayers' money should not be spent in supporting election campaigning by political parties, are spending more money on advertising themselves, the Ministers of their Governments, as Ministers, than is being spent on the support programs which they are supposed to be advertising. In one case a department prepared a massive advertising campaign which was $10m over committed before the scheme was even advertised in the newspapers. It is a means by which a government can put forward its election propaganda at taxpayers' expense, a means by which a government which would throw up it arms in horror at a suggestion of public funding is misappropriating the funds of the State of Victoria to purposesd for which they were never collected and never allocated, and they should not be used for these purposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC) recommends support for medical research projects on the basis of scientific merit as assessed by a careful peer review process. There were 424 applications which were not supported in 1981, comprising 335 which did not reach a sufficiently high level of scientific merit to achieve support and a further 89 which were supportable but for which insufficient funds were available. All applications for Project Grants are made on a confidential basis, and it would be a breach of privacy to publish in Hansard the names of the unsuccessful applicants.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. Each year there are a number of one year grants awarded, but the proportion in 1981 was significantly above the average of 33 per cent. The higher number of one year grants in 1981 was attributable partly to the financial arrangements for forward commitments for grants supported from the Medical Research Endowment Fund and partly to the need for the retention of some future budgetary flexibility for the NH &amp; MRC.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has agreed that $25.15 million be made available for medical research in the 1982 calendar year. This represents an approximate standstill position in real terms, and has enabled the NH &amp; MRC to continue all programs and initiatives undertaken in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Provision of funding for research and development within the Department of Health over the next decade is a matter for consideration by the Government in the context of budgetary allocations and relative priorities of the Department's overall activities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, upon notice, on 13 October 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it a fact that for the 7th successive Budget the grant-in-aid to the Australian Council of National Trusts has remained at $60,000 for 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) If so, does this represent a reduction of $26,500 in real terms for 1981-82 .</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Does the Government's expenditure through the National Estate Program now stand at only 15 cents per head of population.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Does the Government recognise the importance of the National Trusts in the enhancement of the National Estate.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In view of the Government's stated commitment to Australia's heritage, will he take steps to review its funding of the National Estate Program and specifically to secure urgently a supplementary grant of $26,500 for the Australian Council of national Trusts to ensure its viability and effectiveness.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. This has been necessary because of the continuing need to restrain government expenditure in order to combat inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The real money value of the grants will have reduced but this is an inevitable consequence of the need to restrain expenditure in many areas, including the heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The figure of 15 cents per head of population should be seen as only one element in an overall contribution being made at the national, state and local level, and by voluntary organisations throughout the community. The role of the Commonwealth in the National Estate Program area is basically one of partnership in assisting the States and community groups in the overall national effort to identify and conserve our heritage.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. The National Trusts perform a most important and valuable role in various activities related to the conservation and enhancement of our national heritage.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Possible increased Commonwealth assistance for heritage activities including funding of the National Estate Program and of the level of the grant to the Australian Council of National Trusts will be considered within the context of the 1982-83 Budget.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) To provide comprehensive answers to the honourable member's questions would consume more resources than I am able to commit to the task. The statistics required to answer some of the questions are not kept presently although the Government is fostering efforts to improve the coverage and comparability of apprenticeship statistics, through the Commonwealth/State Apprenticeship Committee. I draw your attention to 3 tables prepared in my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> Table 1 provides data on the number of apprentices in training in Australia at 30 June each year from 1971 to 1981, by State and Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> Table 2 shows the age of apprentices at the commencement of training in New South Wales in 1979-80. New South Wales is the only State for which such information is readily available.</PARA>
<PARA> Table 3 shows the number and proportion of females in apprentice intakes in New South Wales between 1971-72 and 1979-80. New South Wales is the only State for which such data is available over time.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Studies known to my Department that provide information of the type sought by the honourable member include:</PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Fitting and Machining Trade Course Review Committee (1980) by the New South Wales Department of Technical and Further Education.</PARA>
<PARA> Learning a Trade: Studies in Apprentice Training and Career Paths of Tradesmen (1980) by H. Hocking and K. Burns, Education Department of Tasmania, Research Branch.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) I am familiar with the details of the document to which you refer.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I confirm that what you say is generally true. I am informed that the Memorandum of Arrangements was tabled in this House late in 1974 by a former Minister for Defence.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) These arrangements provided as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 7.4 If the USN PF program is suspended, reduced to a total ship program of less than 12 patrol frigates, or there is a significant change in cost factors, or if trials of the lead patrol boat frigate indicate to Australia that the RAN ships as constructed will not meet the basic characteristics annexed hereto or the performance requirements agreed to at the time of the acceptance of the letter of offer, Australia may withdraw from the program. In that event, should Australia so request, the United States shall consider accepting the RAN ships and associated equipment with equitable reimbursement to Australia. Otherwise, normal FMS cancellation procedures will apply.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Broadly comparable umbrella arrangements covering the acquisition of the new tactical fighter aircraft and its associated support and weapons were agreed with the US Department of Defense in September 1980. They cover the respective responsibilities of the US and Australian Departments of Defence and describe, in general terms, the arrangements to be followed in the implementation and management of the program, including the associated Australian industry program. The actual purchase instruments, the so-called Letters of Offer and Acceptance ( LOA) will contain the more detailed conditions which govern the purchases.</PARA>
<PARA> Among the many general conditions of the above-mentioned arrangements, there is a provision that would enable Australia to cancel, suspend or significantly reduce its purchases for one or more of the following reasons:</PARA>

<PARA> (e) If Australia'a national interests so require.</PARA>
<PARA> In the event of any of the foregoing arising, the US Department of Defense will , to the extent practicable and subject to authorisation and appropriation of funds by the US Congress, endeavour to apply any material cancelled by Australia towards the satisfaction of its own approved requirements in order to minimise cancellation costs to the Australian Government.

<PARA> (1) and (2) The Melbourne-Tasmania subsidy was introduced on Ansett and TAA services following consideration of the Holcroft Inquiry on Domestic Air Fares. At that time the Government decided to restructure the air fare formula by which fares on the network of TAA and Ansett are set, which had the effect of sharply increasing short distance fares. The subsidy was introduced to alleviate the effect of the increases in air fares to passengers travelling between Melbourne and Tasmania where there were no land-based alternative forms of transport, and hold these fares at about the average network increase.

<PARA> Regular transmissions from a Bureau of Meterology automatic weather station on Tasman Island commenced in October 1976 and ceased in June 1980. There were some maintenance problems with this station, which was an old model purchased in 1970 .</PARA>
<PARA> The size and shape of Tasman Island is such that it is not an ideal location for taking of wind observations, and a better site was found nearby at Palmer's Lookout, on the western side of Port Arthur. The Bureau of Meteorology had intended to install a new and more reliable type of automatic weather station there in preference to replacing the station at Tasman Island. However these plans were abandoned when a suitable weather obserer was found in the area.

<PARA> The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The face to face phone facility to which the honourable member refers is what is known as the pay station at the Melbourne GPO which has been operating only from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on 7 days per week.</PARA>
<PARA> This pay station will cease to operate as from the close of business on 26 February 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that no special facilities were provided at the pay station for migrants or handicapped people.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is conscious of the need to provide full access to its network with public phone facilities but the heavy use of ISD and STD facilities has now made the provision of the type of manual assistance at the pay station uneconomic because of the high overheads still involved.</PARA>
<PARA> There will in fact be an extension of the facilities for public phone use made available at several centres in close proximity to the former GPO pay station. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Telecom establishment-175 Elizabeth Street (directly opposite GPO). A total of 12 internal and 2 external public telephones with ISD, STD and local call facilities are now available 24 hours per day, seven days per week.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that this centre is in fact a face to face type of facility because it has a counter that is manned 24 hours per day, seven days per week to provide assistance to the public as required. It will also shortly be equipped with a public telex.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Philatelic Centre (cnr Elizabeth and Little Bourke Streets). Eight public telephones will be converted to ISD. This conversion should be completed by late March this year.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Telecom Business Office-142 Elizabeth Street. The existing public telephones within the Telecom Business Office will be converted to ISD and one additional facility will be installed. Service advisers at this centre will also be providing a face to face service to assist the public during normal working hours.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of special facilities for migrants or handicapped people, Telecom has converted a number of public telephones for handicapped people's use, including one at 175 Elizabeth Street, and any Telecom office can advise on the location of others of these special facilities. Telecom also has a telephone interpreter service available. ISD's dialling direct system also simplifies calls to a migrant's former home country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 November 1981 (Hansard, page 3000) the honourable member for Fadden asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the recent case in the High Court of Australia known as Shaddock v. City of Parramatta in which the Court has ruled that many individuals and companies providing information to others as part of a service will be liable for any negligence in providing the information if another has suffered loss by relying on it. Has the Minister considered the application of this decision to members of parliament and their staffs who are continually called upon by constituents for advice of a sometimes delicate nature which, if relied upon and incorrect, could cause a loss.</PARA>
<PARA> At the time I provided the honourable member with a precis of the decision to which he referred and undertook to refer to the Attorney-General for further advice on the application of the decision to members.</PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Before the Shaddock decision the Privy Council had held in Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Co. Ltd v. Evatt (1970) 122 C.L.R. 628, that a duty of care in respect of the making of statements of fact or opinion is cast only on a person who carries on a business or profession which involves the giving of advice of a kind calling for special skill and competence, or on persons who, while not carrying on such a business or profession, nevertheless profess to have a comparable competence. The essence of the judgments in Shaddock is that the duty of care is not so narrowly confined but will arise whenever a person gives information or advice to another upon a serious matter in circumstances where the former realises, or ought to realise, that he is being trusted to give the best of his information or advice as a basis for action on the part of the other party and where it is reasonable, in all the circumstances, for the other party to act on that information or advice.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of any reason why the duty of care in those circumstances, as expounded by the High Court, should not be found to be cast upon members of Parliament to the same extent as it is cast upon other members of the community . I note that liability for damages may be avoided by issuing, at the time of giving the information or advice, an adequate disclaimer of liability for any loss or damage that may arise as a result of acting upon the information or advice. Should the honourable member require advice on appropriate terms for a disclaimer of liability or on the application of the decision in particular circumstances, he should consult his own legal advisers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Section 212 (a) (4) of the United States Immigration and Nationalities Act includes sexual deviants as a class of aliens ineligible to receive visas and excluded from admission into the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Regulations issued pursuant to the Act define sexual deviance as including homosexuality. I understand that, in implementing these provisions, United States' policy is that officials should not initiate any inquiries to discover whether an applicant for a visa is a homosexual. The Australian Government does not intend to raise the application of Section 212 (a) (4) of the United States Act with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The Australian Government has however traditionally supported constructive initiatives aimed at protecting the rights of social minorities.</PARA>
