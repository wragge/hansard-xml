<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to the findings of the Home Finance Survey, conducted by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, which was published by the Victorian Housing Ministry in December 1981? Is he aware that 45 per cent of first home buyers surveyed had household incomes in excess of 150 per cent of average weekly earnings? Is it a fact that, since no means tests have been applied to the tax rebate for first home buyers during the past five years, some $100m of the $230m allocated for the first full year of the scheme will go to households which are in the top 25 per cent income group in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has not been drawn to that survey specifically. I thank the honourable gentleman for drawing my attention to it. I will have a look at it. The thrust of the honourable member's question is that in some way the tax rebate that the Government has chosen to give, in assisting first home buyers, is inappropriate. I am reminded of some of the things that were said by the honourable member and his colleagues some years ago when tax rebates in other areas were introduced. In particular, he was pleased to say some years ago, when he was a Minister in the former Government, that there can be no deception when each claimant, whether rich or poor, gets exactly the same rebate for education expenses. I suggest that the honourable member could apply that argument with equal force to housing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague the Deputy Prime Minister has already, on a number of occasions, drawn the attention of this House to the effect on export earnings- and therefore the international trading standing of Australia-of industrial stoppages. There can be no doubt that one of the contributing factors to the poorer than expected trade performance of Australia this year, and therefore our weaker balance of payments, has been the high level of industrial disputation. The fact cannot be denied that, in the three months to November 1981, working days lost in all industries were 60 per cent higher than in the previous three month period and two and a half times those lost in the three months to November 1980. That statistic alone illustrates the enormous contribution that industrial disputation has made to Australia's sluggish trade performance in this financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it also a fact that taxes paid by wage and salary earners have risen approximately 40 per cent faster than have wages and salaries, while company taxes have risen by less than the rate of rise in company income? In the light of this situation, does the Treasurer regard a cut in company taxes as having a higher priority than tax cuts for wage and salary earners?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not propose to be drawn into any speculation as to what ought to be done in particular Budget areas. I will make but two other comments. Firstly, I understand that the remarks of my right honourable colleague were directed to a number of matters in the corporate area and were in the context, in part, of the Industries Assistance Commission examination which is being undertaken in this area. Secondly, many factors account for the fall in corporate tax receipts as a proportion of total tax receipts. My understanding is that the figures cited by the honourable member are substantially correct. I would not seek to dispute them, but they can be attributed to a number of factors and not, as the honourable member's question implies, simply to the appropriateness of the current levels of corporate taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member is well aware, I have never been in the habit of giving assurances about future levels of interest rates, and I do not propose to depart from that practice now. The only alternative to the monetary policy which the Government is following at present would be a policy that in the short term might purchase some relief from the current level of interest rates but in the medium to longer term would give us much higher inflation and unavoidably much higher interest rates. The Government, in the housing package I announced last Thursday, addressed itself to those areas in which people are experiencing a burden as a result of increases in interest rates and also increases in the price of land which, in part if not in whole, are due to the effect of inflation in the community. The only real alternatives to the policies being followed by the present Government are policies which, even if they bought some short term relief, would produce in the medium and longer terms much higher inflation and much higher interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has consistently opposed apartheid and has given continued support to the Gleneagles Agreement on sporting contacts with South Africa. It is for this reason that the Government has viewed with concern the current participation by 15 first class English cricketers in international matches in South Africa. We are particularly concerned that the success of the Commonwealth Games could be threatened by the actions of first class cricketers from England or, for that matter, from Australia. I understand that the English Test and County Cricket Board has announced that the English cricketers currently in South Africa and any who might join them will be disqualified from selection for the English test side for a period of three years. The TCCB has also stated that any English cricketer who plays in South Africa in international teams will also be ineligible to play for England.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Australian Cricket Board, in the event of an invitation as described by the honourable member being made, would need to take very careful account of all these factors because the attitude of the ACB in respect of Australian cricketers will be crucial in maintaining the unity of test match playing countries. There is a very real danger that the events described by the honourable member could wreck test cricket and the very popular international one-day series as we know them. That, in the view of many people including many cricketers, would be a tragedy. If the sorts of offers mentioned by the honourable member are made, I urge all those involved to give most careful consideration to their decision. What they do could affect not only their own careers but also the future of many young Australian athletes and the future of young cricketers all over the cricket-playing world.</PARA>

I ask firstly: Why is the Prime Minister, having had the report since 18 December 1981 of the royal commissioner inquiring into the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia, still refusing to give effect to the urgent recommendations contained in the third interim report that the Income Tax Assessment Act and the royal commissioner's terms of reference should be amended to enable the royal commissioner to investigate and expose the ramifications of the tax avoidance industry which he identifies as the fastest growing industry in Australia? Secondly, how does the Prime Minister reconcile this continued refusal to act on the recommendations of the royal commissioner with his unfounded criticism in this House on 18 February this year of the Victorian Leader of the Opposition? Thirdly, why does the Prime Minister give priority to amending the social security legislation because less than a million dollars may have been diverted to wives and children of men on strike, while refusing the royal commissioner's request for legislative amendments aimed at smashing the tax avoidance industry which is costing billions of dollars a year? Finally, as this question directly involves the integrity of the Prime Minister, will he answer it himself?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General and the Treasurer are deciding what matters should be put to us in relation to the extension of the terms of reference and access to taxation records. The honourable member is slightly off beat when he says that this access is critical to the fight against tax avoidance, because the nature of the scheme which was outlined in the report was outlawed by this Government 18 months ago. It was a scheme that involved massive evasion and, as I say, it was outlawed by this Government 18 months ago. This Government has acted against tax avoidance more vigorously than any other government and it will continue to do so. Once the recommendation of the Attorney and the Treasurer is ready to be taken by the Government, it will be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Is the Prime Minister aware that, in fact, the most recent figures show that the growth of income per head in other industrial countries has been more than twice that of Australia and that the latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development bulletin of economic indicators, which I have, shows that the growth of real product per head grew by 2.7 per cent in western industrialised countries between 1975 and 1980 but only 1.3 per cent in Australia?

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1230" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the basis of a one day a week shutdown I have had some calculations done. We must all be concerned that there is a belief now that a shutdown for one day a week will not be adequate unless power supply in New South Wales can improve markedly. This matter has gone far beyond party political contention because it is a major blow to the Australian nation. What is happening in New South Wales is, in a very real measure, a national calamity. It will harm hundreds of thousands of Australian families who will lose wages and purchasing power over the coming months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the calculations that have been done by my Department, if 500,000 employees each earning average weekly earnings lost one day's work a week, the loss of wages would be $32m a week or $416m a quarter. The loss of after-tax household disposable income would be $22m a week or $286m a quarter. The loss of final output would be $60m a week or $780m a quarter. At this point it is worth noting that if the power zoning were to extend to two days a week the loss would therefore be $1.5 billion a quarter. That is the prospect, at worst, ahead of New South Wales in the coming period. Obviously, the loss of taxation receipts and the flow-through effects throughout the whole economy on sales, profits, prices and employment in many other industries would be massive indeed. This has not just come about through the consequences of maladministration in New South Wales; it is now a matter of major national concern and a major tragedy for this nation.</PARA>

Whitford's Beach Pty Ltd, is it a fact that the requirement of identity of property that has dogged the application of section 26A of the Income Tax Assessment Act to many transactions does not apply to the second limb of this section dealing with the profit from profit making undertakings and schemes? Therefore, will he instruct the Commissioner of Taxation to take proceedings under section 26A against the Bell group of companies for recovery of the tax payable on the share and property transactions involved in the Elder Smith Goldsborough Mort takeover?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to that particular case. I would like to say two things about it. Firstly, generally speaking, the judgment of the High Court of Australia does indicate something of a different-may I say welcome- attitude in regard to tax avoidance matters. I think that honourable members on both sides of the House who are interested in practical measures to strengthen the arm of the community against tax avoidance practices will welcome that particular development. So far as this particular case is concerned, let me say to the honourable gentleman that I have no capacity to instruct the Commissioner of Taxation nor, indeed, does any Minister have any capacity to instruct the Commissioner to take particular action against individual taxpayers. Frankly, I hope the day never comes in this country when the actions of the Commissioner of Taxation in regard to individual taxpayers will be at the whim of ministerial discretion. Because of the provisions of section 16, the Commissioner cannot tell me whether section 26A in its newly interpreted form applies to the particular case. I can assure the honourable member that the Commissioner of Taxation would, in my very firm belief, be applying that particular section in those areas where he believes it should apply.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Recently, the Department of Finance issued a directive to Government departments and statutory authorities to cut out overtime. Will the Prime Minister tell this House whether any department or statutory authority is exempt from this provision? Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that this is a financial decision with no consideration of efficient management or morale of the Public Service? Will he explain how service departments can operate without overtime? Does he anticipate that any work that cannot be carried out in the regular hours will be carried out by public servants above the class 8 level who are not entitled to paid overtime?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be very surprised if any blanket instruction has gone from the Department of Finance in relation to all overtime-saying that overtime cannot be worked and cannot be paid. In our Cabinet and Government discussions on these matters we have obviously had a very particular concern for the departments and offices that are supplying services to people-the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service to name but two. Whilst there has certainly been an injunction to cut out unnecessary overtime, I do not believe that any instruction has been given to cut out all overtime, to bar it absolutely. Since the honourable member has asked a question in relation to that matter I will see whether there is anything that I need to add to this answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI7">Sir PHILLIP LYNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for the question. When he reads the full text of the address which I gave to the Bureau of Industry Economics he will see in particular the point that was made therein and the general theme of that address. What I said there and what I am very happy indeed to repeat in this House in simple economic propositions is this: Non- inflationary growth is the key to improved living standards in this country, to job creation and to the Government's capacity effectively to care for those who are in real need. Of course, economic growth is dependent upon continuing and high levels of investment in business and in Australian industry. Investment itself is determined by industry's competitive edge and overall corporate profitability, which comprehends issues such as the investment allowance, depreciation allowances and those other matters which are before the Government at the present time. These are issues of which honourable members on both sides of the House should be very much aware because they are on public record. They are issues which the Government will face in making decisions on the Industries Assistance Commission's report on budgetary assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me be perfectly clear. No business constituency is unaware of what I am about to say. Given the need for this Government to maintain the tightest rein on Commonwealth expenditure patterns-that has always been made clear to the business constituency-this is certainly no time for any suggestion of business largesse. Equally, in announcing the date of the IAC report on budgetary assistance to industry, the Government made the point that it was not out to reduce industry support. The critical question here, a question not easy for the Government to answer in due course, is in fact one not of quantum but of priorities: How to develop the most cost effective programs for industry and how to respond to the particular needs of Australian industry at the present time. Also, in that speech I made the point which other senior Ministers have made recently, namely, that the impact of the international trading environment on industry is creating an extraordinarily difficult situation. The cost pressures which are mounting at the present time impose very serious problems on the capacity of industry to continue its present momentum of employment growth.</PARA>

I also refer to the speech he made to the Bureau of Industry Economics , in which he indicated that a reduction in corporate tax would bolster Australia's sagging economy. Is it not a fact that the present problem is a lack of demand for products rather than a lack of investment? Would not a cut in corporate tax simply increase the after tax profits of the companies which, because of the depressed state of the economy, have no inclination at all to invest?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI7">Sir PHILLIP LYNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is based on a total misinterpretation, in fact a complete misreading, of what was said in the speech to the Bureau of Industry Economics. I think the honourable gentleman, whom I would regard as fair and objective in making assessments beyond the scoring of party political points, would be very much aware that I said, in the context of the IAC report, that these were matters which the Government would need to address. I think it is important to make this clear: The official figures for manufacturing investment remain very strong. In 1980-81 they were some 46 per cent greater than in 1979- 80, with a further growth of 26 per cent indicated during the current financial year. Most official indicators available to me from Commonwealth sources indicate that the situation remains strong, although one early indicator, manufacturers' sales, suggests that a slight downturn did take effect in the December quarter. But this Government does not rely simply on official figures. I have indicated that, on the basis of early information available to the Government from industry sources, there is a softening, certainly in the industrial scene. The international economy is depressed and manufacturers' exports fell 5 per cent in the seven months to January 1982. At the same time manufactured imports increased by over 22 per cent in the same period. There is no doubt whatever that the currently strong position represented by official figures in the investment area is the result of decisions taken some years ago. I state without qualification that I expect that there will be some descaling of those decisions and some deferments in the decision-making pipeline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If honourable gentlemen opposite have any care or concern for economic activity , investment and jobs in the Australian community they will focus their attention on the competitive edge of manufacturing industry. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is seeking to interject, knows full well that our competitive edge and this country's capacity to survive in a very difficult trading world at present are critically determined by the pressures for wage push, by a reduction in working hours and by the use of industrial muscle. These are the matters that ought properly to be the focus of concern of the honourable gentleman.</PARA>

The communique which was issued by Ministers at the conclusion of that meeting drew attention, amongst other things, to the fact that the only-I repeat the word ' only'-way in which the problems of unemployment can be tackled is by an attack on inflation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply say to the House that the Ministers said in their communique-by a remarkable coincidence I have it with me-that these efforts to combat unemployment 'could only be pursued with success in the framework of a concomitant and effective combat against inflation, as well as in the context of active international co-operation and open trading relationships bearing in mind the conclusions of the OECD Council at ministerial level'. Therefore, it is apparent that the conference has endorsed the policies of this Government which, of course, take exactly that approach, namely, that it is important to resolve the underlying causes of unemployment before one can expect to see an achievement in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In further answer to the honourable member might I say that Australia's performance in employment and unemployment compares very favourably with other OECD countries. It should, however, be brought home very firmly to this country that there are loose in Australia some forces which should give cause for concern so far as unemployment is concerned. There is no doubt that the increasing cost of labour in Australia poses a very serious problem for the future of employment growth in this country. It is simply becoming far too expensive for employers to employ more people. The claims for shorter working hours without matching increases in productivity have, likewise, priced many employees out of the labour market, as this country has been priced out of markets overseas by the same forces. Furthermore, the continuous industrial disputation has, likewise, been an inhibiting factor on employment growth in this country. One might well ask: How can one ask an employer in New South Wales today to take on additional employees when there is not even power for him to conduct his enterprise or factory? It should be appreciated that those factors are very basic, that they pose a continuous threat to employment growth in this country and that unless they are faced squarely and tackled by the community as a whole we will not see the increase in employment that I hope we would all want to see.</PARA>

<PARA>That statement is an utter falsehood. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, a well-attended civic reception was extended to Vanessa Redgrave in Newcastle, but I was not present at it. Secondly, I asked the Current Information Section of the Parliamentary Library to provide me with copies of any Press reports of Ms Redgrave's visit to Newcastle on 19 February 1982. The only reports that it could locate were two items from the Newcastle Herald of 20 February 1982. One was a page 2 feature in-depth interview article entitled 'The Two Women called Vanessa Redgrave', written by reporter Anne Coombs. The other report was from page 13 entitled 'Vanessa Redgrave draws crowd'. It referred to the near capacity crowd that attended the showing of the film Occupied Palestine . It correctly stated that Ms Redgrave was introduced by Mr Morris, M.H.R., Shortland. Neither report uses or infers the words stated by the honourable member for Wentworth, nor did I use such words in my speech introducing Ms Redgrave. </PARA>

We believe that there can be no settlement, no peace, no future in the Middle East without full recognition of the human and political rights of the Palestine people.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr THOMSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the four years since the Government announced its decisions on the independent inquiry into the CSIRO many changes have taken place within the Organisation. It is an appropriate time to inform the house of some of CSIRO's activities and policies and to outline CSIRO priorities for the rest of the 1980s. Firstly, I will explain the relationship between CSIRO, a statutory authority, and the government and parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The general business of the CSIRO is conducted by the Executive which consists of both full time and part time members. Under the Science and Industry Research Act, the Executive may make recommendations to the responsible Minister on policy, work and funding. The Minister may give a direction to the Executive on any matter of policy in the carrying out of scientific research. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his statement concerning the independent inquiry clearly stated:</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO's autonomy in the setting of research project objectives will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister also stated that CSIRO's activities must accord with the policies of the government. It should be emphasised that although CSIRO has considerable policy and operational independence it is ultimately responsible to parliament and the elected government through the Minister for Science and Technology. This is important because of the widely felt need to relate science and technology policies more closely with social, economic and industrial policies. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important mechanisms for doing this is the Parliament where the attitudes, fears and aspirations of the Australian community are reflected. Parliament must be consulted about the type of science and technology policies being developed. I urge honourable members to become more involved in science and technology issues, and to raise the level of community debate on government, industry and academic policies in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO has a direct link with the community and the users of its research, through the CSIRO Advisory Council and CSIRO State committees, each consisting of informed representatives with varied areas of expertise. The Opposition spokesman on science and technology, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), is a member of the CSIRO Advisory Council. I might say he is an active and very good member of the Council. This Government has encouraged CSIRO to develop its contacts with industry to ensure that its programs are relevant to industrial problems, and that the results are known by industry. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO does not operate in a vacuum divorced from the realities of society or the economy. Nor can CSIRO be regarded as a sacred cow simply bcause it is a scientific organisation. It is important that there is close contact between researchers and industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Research Priorities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has reaffirmed that the main role of CSIRO is scientific and technological research in support of Australian industry, agriculture, community interests and other perceived national objectives and obligations. The type of research to be undertaken will be longer term research for the community benefit which industry and other research organisations are unable to carry out. CSIRO will also undertake fundamental and short term problem oriented research if it is related to the role of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already announced some of the research priorities identified by the Executive for CSIRO in the 1980s. In addition to the traditional areas of high priority such as agriculture and minerals, there are now six areas nominated for expansion. They are: Water and soils, manufacturing industry, biotechnology, energy, oceanography, and plant pathology. </PARA>
<PARA> These areas are of particular relevance to Australia and its economic future. They have not been developed in isolation. Rather they have been identified through CSIRO's ongoing review programs, consultation with the community and industry and naturally interaction with the Government. I believe CSIRO's research effort is now finely tuned to the future needs of Australia. Although it is not difficult to re-assign research priorities quickly, the research effort of CSIRO cannot be redirected anywhere near as quickly. For example, there is no magic wand with which radio astronomers can be turned into biochemists. </PARA>
<PARA>CSIRO Finances</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO is an organisation of more than 7,500 people, including 2,000 scientists in about 40 divisions located in more than 100 laboratories across the country. The Government is regularly asking CSIRO to take on new responsibilities on its behalf or approving new initiatives of special interest to the Government. Recent examples are the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory; an oceanographic research vessel and research for the Australian fishing zone; Project Aquarius which is concerned with aerial fire fighting; greatly increased computing responsibilities; and, more recently, responsibility for energy research previously conducted by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, although the latter has not yet been absorbed into CSIRO's budget. So despite the general reductions by which the Government has contained public expenditure, which have affected CSIRO like any other department, CSIRO's budget has actually increased by 10 per cent from $260m to $286m, not including $29m for the new superannuation commitments and the $5m for the extra pay day last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate the calls that have been made for more money for research in CSIRO . But they have to be seen in the light of other important Government projects and commitments and the Government's policy of public sector restraint. In times of budgetary restraint it is simply not possible to fund all research projects considered to be both nationally important and scientifically rewarding. </PARA>
<PARA> At such times the criterion of relative scientific merit must be balanced carefully with community need and national interest. Without an ever expanding budget it is therefore obvious that lower priority programs can no longer be funded at a meaningful level. The CSIRO executive has emphasised that for most scientific projects there is a threshold level of funding below which the work should be discontinued. Therefore, rather than apply across the board cuts, the executive, after rigorous analysis of existing programs has decided to terminate or amalgamate some of the lower priority activities. To quote the Chairman of CSIRO, Dr Paul Wild, the organisation is grasping the nettle of change. </PARA>
<PARA> The efficient use of resources is a prime essential in today's difficult economic climate. With the given total of funds to work with, CSIRO must simply concentrate on the most important things. These are not always the same as in the past. Changes over the past year include a new institute of energy and earth resources, new divisions of energy chemistry, energy technology, cellulose research and tropical animal science, and an industrial microbiological unit. To make these additions possible divisions have been closed down. This included the divisions of mechanical engineering and chemical technology. I would add that the total direct Commonwealth funding of research and development in all areas increased from $620m in 1978-79 to $940m this financial year. CSIRO accounts for about 30 per cent of this. This 10 per cent increase in real terms over four years demonstrates the government's commitment to science and technology in a time of severe financial restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>Water Research</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> An example of the need to co-ordinate science and technology policy with the national interest is in water management. Because of the great water problems facing Australia, water and soil research is now a high priority area for CSIRO. A number of new proposals are being drawn up to focus and improve research into water resources. The CSIRO has just completed a review of the Organisation's water resources activities. The aim was to identify priority areas for future research, resources required to undertake research, and organisational and co- ordination arrangements. The review has concluded that research should be expanded in three main areas-salinity and other quality aspects, groundwater, and catchment hydrology. The Government hopes to make announcements shortly on new divisional and co-ordination arrangements to enable effective management of this important area. </PARA>
<PARA>Highlights</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The year being reported on has had its crop of notable achievements by CSIRO. I might mention just a few that show special promise. CSIRO scientists discovered a naturally occurring protein which shows promise of yielding a practical biological method of defleecing sheep. They have developed a vaccine for increasing the lambing rate of ewes. A major advance has been made in the long battle against tick fever of cattle. The water weed salvinia which menaces Australian waterways has been completely eradicated by biological means at a test site at Mt Isa. Highly successful computer-controlled management techniques for growing cotton have been put into operation in the Namoi Valley. This venture, called siratac, in which the New South Wales Department of Agriculture is collaborating, has been welcomed and widely adopted by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time a range of esters has been developed that act as highly effective insecticides but are non-toxic to other wildlife. The year has seen the world-wide launching of the sirospun innovation for the spinning industry, and the construction of the first full-scale sirofloc water purification plant, which now supplies 5 per cent of Perth's water supply from bore water. These are just a few of the many CSIRO achievements which have surfaced during the year. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I take the opportunity to thank the Chairman and the executive, the advisory bodies and the staff of CSIRO for their efforts over the past year. I applaud their pursuit of excellence. In CSIRO, Australia has a first rate research organisation of world renown, a leader in many areas of industrial and scientific research. I believe that now, more than ever before, CSIRO is strictly enforcing a policy of selectively and carefully chosen priorities. The national interest must always come first, but we should not become obsessed with looking at the short term to the exclusion of planned strategic science. Good science is a very subtle thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I end by quoting from Thomas Spratt, the first historian of the Royal Society. This was written in the year 1667:</PARA>
<PARA> It is stranger that we are not able to inculcate into the minds of many men the necessity of that distinction of my Lord Bacon's, that there ought to be experiments of light, as well as of fruit. It is their usual word, what solid good will come from thence? But they are to know that in so large and so various an art as this of experiments, there are many degrees of usefulness: Some may serve for real and plain benefit, without much delight: Some for teaching, without apparent profit: Some for light now and for use hereafter: Some only for ornament and curiosity. If they will persist in contemning all experiments, except those which bring with them immediate gain and a present harvest, they may as well cavil at the providence of God, that he has not made all the seasons of the year to be times of mowing, reaping and vintage. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the CSIRO annual report to the House. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The part of the statement by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) that I agreed with most of all was the long quotation from Thomas Spratt, the historian of the Royal Society, and I suggest that the Minister should take the quotation, have it embroidered on a sampler and give it to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Then, if he has some skilled craft workers who can add to that, he can have one made for the Treasurer (Mr Howard), who is sitting behind him, and perhaps a third for the Secretary to the Treasury. One of the reasons that Thomas Spratt's vision has not been carried out in this statement or in this annual report of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is that the Treasury has, over several years, taken a confrontationist view towards the Department of Science and Technology and CSIRO. Because of its abhorrence on doctrinal grounds of any kind of interventionist policy, it sees its philosophy- -</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer says he loves them. That will be news for CSIRO, news for the House and news for everybody who is interested in the development of proper standards of science and technology. The Treasurer should tell that to his colleague the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) in view of what has happened in the last few days about the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Grant scheme which seems to be very much under threat. If the Treasurer wants to participate in the debate, I suggest that he follow me. That would give him an opportunity to put the Government on record as to what it intends to do, and show just how dinkum it is, about government intervention in this important area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1926 when the CSIRO was founded as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-CSIR-it put a very heavy emphasis on research related to an agricultural base-soils, water, plant industry, animal health, food research and forestry. Now, 56 years later, 33.3 per cent of CSIRO's total research expenditure is devoted to rural industries, with a further 2.3 per cent being devoted to water resources. In 1926, CSIR had a Radio Research Board and a Division of Mineragraphic Investigations, as it was then called. The first of these evolved, over 56 years, to the Division of Radiophysics with its major contribution to radio astonomy and astro physics. The second became the Division of Mineralogy and Process Technology. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fairly safe generalisation to make that the areas in which the CSIRO is strongest and has the most adequate funding today are those in which it has been strong for the last half century or more. Without denigrating the enormous contribution of agriculture to our economic history and national development, it is fair to say that Australia's contribution to research and development through CSIRO has been essentially conservative. It has put a greater emphasis on serving the Australian economy as it has evolved historically than assisting in the development of new employment areas which will grow in the 1980s and 1990s. This makes CSIRO a conservative organisation. Its annual reports show how much of its budget services the areas of its traditional strength. But science and technology, like the Australian labour force, are changing with dramatic speed. The Scrooge-like approach of the Treasury has inhibited CSIRO's capacity to adjust and adapt to the winds of change which are blowing--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unkind; but it is true-with tornado strength throughout the technologically advanced world. Although CSIRO's total funding for pure and applied research is far greater than that applied to universities, the universities have proved to be more flexible in adapting to new scientific areas , and have probably produced a greater output relative to the total research and development funds available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rigidity of government control in past eras has impeded CSIRO's development in new areas. The most obvious example was the disastrous decision of the Menzies Government in 1952-I exempt the Treasurer from responsibility for that decision- to cut back on funds available to CSIRO for research and development in computing. CSIRAC, Beard and Pearcey's computer, was probably the third or fourth stored memory computer to be developed anywhere in the world. It was essentially constructed by 1949 and by 1951 was fully commissioned. At that stage only the United States and Great Britain were ahead of Australia in this field. The Menzies Government felt-and made the political decision-that computing did not have much prospect of being very significant in the future world. It diverted available funds from the computing project to the cloud- seeding project which, of course, folded in 1981 after 30 years of almost continuous failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are some new areas in which CSIRO has established a world reputation. We salute the enormous contribution that it has made to radio astronomy, in which it has been a world leader. The Opposition looks with sympathy upon the proposed construction of a synthesis radio telescope. I draw the attention of the House to the section of the report, on pages 85 and 86, where reference is made to the construction of a synthesis radio telescope as a major initiative. CSIRO asked in 1980-81 for funds for this purpose but received nothing. It has now been asked to make another submission for the year 1982-83. I should add that the Australian synthesis telescope is a new generation radio telescope which would provide Australia with front-line research tools into the 1990s, the year 2000 and beyond. It is called the synthesis telescope because it has a range of antennae of approximately 20 metres diameter. By changing the relative distances between the antennae it is possible to synthesise an image of part of the sky. This picture has the same accuracy as that obtained by a simple antenna whose diameter is equal to the length of the array, namely 6 kilometres. So we will have the equivalent of a traditional telescope with a lens 6 kilometres wide. The capacity of this telescope is staggering. It would be a tragedy of major proportions if this Government, led by its Prime Minister, through its mean-minded approach were to allow this project to collapse. The Opposition would regard that with absolute horror. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the only major astronomical project that has to be looked at. In a sense it illustrates some of the problems in the area of science and technology. There is what some people would see as a rival project, but which I see as a complementary project and which also has tremendous value, that is, 'Starlab'. It is part of an international consortium between Australia, Canada and the United States of America. This is an orbiting telescope which will operate from outer space. It will be put into outer space by the United States and Canada will construct the telescope. The instrument package, potentially very significant for Australia, will be constructed by Australians, that is, if the Government is prepared to provide support for it either through existing funds or some special grant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is concerned that we recognise that if we do not take up the opportunity, others will. The French firm Matra S.A., one of the great aerospace firms of Europe and owned by the French Government-a practical example of a socialist enterprise-has indicated that if we do not pick up the tab, it will. That would mean that the advantage of that enormous project, with the opportunities that it has for future employment in producing super-sophisticated instrumentation, will not go to Australia, it will go to France. I regard this as a matter of great national importance. For obvious reasons CSIRO is committed to its own project and not to the Starlab project, which is one put up by the Australian National University and by the Mount Stromlo Observatory. I think it is a matter we have to look at very seriously. It is not a matter of preferring one project over the other. I think they have to be looked at as complementary projects but I put a very high national priority on them. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO was shaped in a time when primary industry dominated Australia's economy. But since then Australia has moved into an industrial era; an era which has been dominated by the foreign ownership of technologies. The commanding heights of high technology industries in Australia are entirely in foreign hands -motor manufacturing, oil, computers, electronics, chemicals, plastics and pharmaceuticals. This has led to that major disincentive by industry in Australia to invest in research and development which the Minister has complained of before, an area in which I entirely agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA> In Sweden industry invests eight times as much as government in research and development. In Australia industry contributes only 63c for every dollar from government. Australia passed through a technological revolution in the 1970s with comparatively little contribution from CSIRO. I do not say that in denigration of CSIRO but I do say it in denigration of the Government. In a sense, CSIRO has been funded to maintain its traditional base, there has not been much movement in other areas. I am struck, for example, that if we take some of the new techniques of the 1970s, such as computerisation and the development of CAD-CAM techniques-that is, computer aided design and manufacturing-and miniaturisation based on low-cost silicon chips with the development of information as a factor of production, there was very little contribution from government research in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that CSIRO has set up a very large-scale integrated circuit project in Adelaide under the Division of Computing Research and under the directorship of Dr Mudge. Very able people are involved in the project. It has hardly been funded with the wildest of generosity. The funding for this enormous project over a three-year period is $1.5m. I understand it has got the factory to set up the plant in Adelaide. It has the chairs all ready and I understand it will have a table at any time now. I hope that something more can be done to push this project along because it is enormously important. One must remember that in the computer area Australia spends $13.90 on imported computer equipment for every dollar that we spend on locally produced products. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that CSIRO be maintained free from Public Service Board control. We want to see CSIRO extend its range of activity in a number of new fields such as information technology, safety, transport and environmental research. We think it is also very important that CSIRO be encouraged to extend its role as a public information reference source, as it used to be. As my time in this debate is rapidly drawing to a close and I have only got about half way through what I want to say, I want to draw the attention of honourable members to the words of the Chairman of CSIRO, Dr Paul Wild. He is a very eminent scientist, a Fellow of the Royal Society and holder of the Royal Medal of the Royal Society. I seek leave to incorporate his Introduction to the Report in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA> At the back of this volume the reader will find a chart that shows how CSIR and CSIRO evolved through the years. For the most part the evolution has been gradual and, until the 1970s, took place within an expanding organization. The year of this annual report, 1980/81, saw the start of a new phase in our evolution: a deliberate policy to stop certain activities and switch the resources to new activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Executive's current policy may be summarized as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Whatever we do me must do well. If resources are reduced then we must reduce the number of our activities, not the quality. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. We must be selective in our fields of research and concentrate on nationally important and scientifically rewarding areas. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. We must maintain our tradition of scientific excellence and remember that the maintenance of excellence depends on the performance of and the encouragement given to the individual. The needs for controlled objectives on the one hand and the scientist's freedom to follow his nose on the other must be carefully balanced. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we choose the problems we work on? Our first boundaries are set by our Act which makes scientific research on behalf of industry and the community our main role. At all levels of the Organization we maintain close links with representatives of industry and Government agencies, State and Federal, and our objectives are largely determined by interaction between our scientists and these representatives. In addition, we have the CSIRO Advisory Council and State Committees comprising eminent persons from all walks of life. We interact constructively with the Australian Science and Technology Council which advises the Prime Minister. We have our own Planning and Evaluation Advisory Unit which analyses the total scene and seeks out long-term trends. Finally, it is our own Executive, comprising four scientists and leading figures drawn from primary, secondary and tertiary industry that makes the final decisions on broad objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Our current areas of research include many that have formed our traditional base and continue to be as important now as in past decades; the whole fields of agriculture and earth resources are examples. These continue at roughly constant levels. In addition, we have a short-list of research areas that we have singled out for potential expansion as resources become available. These (in no special order) are:</PARA>
<PARA> energy-with emphasis on the development of alternative liquid fuels and the conservation of existing stocks;</PARA>
<PARA> water and soils-the Australian continent's greatest need and most critical factor limiting its growth is water;</PARA>
<PARA> oceanography-vital to Australia, yet neglected in the past;</PARA>
<PARA> manufacturing technology-for an important branch of industry that urgently needs to become more innovative and self reliant;</PARA>
<PARA> biotechnology-an expanding field with boundless possibilities; and</PARA>
<PARA> plant pathology-with the aim of reducing diseases that are a scourge to agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979/80 we set in motion major new initiatives on behalf of oceanography and manufacturing technology, as described in the annual report for that year. This year we have tackled energy and biotechnology. Next year we intend to focus particularly on the problems of water and soils. </PARA>
<PARA> The reorganization and intensification of energy research has resulted in the formation of an Institute of Energy and Earth Resources. An important part of the reorganization was made possible by the decision of the Government to redeploy approximately one-third of the staff of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission Research Establishment to CSIRO to work on non-nuclear energy research. Most of the scientific staff to be transferred will form a new Division of Energy Chemistry based at Lucas Heights (Sydney). At the same time, the Division of Mechanical Engineering is to be closed down and the majority of its staff redeployed into a new Division of Energy Technology based at Highett ( Melbourne). </PARA>
<PARA> Other structureal changes include the decision to close the Division of Chemical Technology and redeploy its staff to a new Division of Cellulose Research and a new Industrial Microbiology Unit. The latter will form part of our intensification of effort in biotechnology. The latest initiative in the agriculture sector is to form a new Queensland-based Division of Tropical Animal Science from resources taken mainly from existing Divisions. This new Division will provide a focus for livestock research in the tropics and sub-tropics and provide a more direct liaison with the existing Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures while maintaining close scientific links with animal Divisions in the south. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope, through these examples, to convey the vigour with which the Executive of our Organization, restructured following the Independent Inquiry in 1978, is responding to ever-changing national needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The efficiency with which we can adapt and respond to the needs of the time depend critically on consistent and dependable funding for the Organization. A 2 % cut in staff resources largely depletes each Division of its redeployable vacancies for a year and so prevents the recruitment of new specialist staff to tackle new problems as well as depriving the Organization of an injection of young scientists. As a result of a decision arising from the Review of Commonwealth Functions (RCF) in 1980/81, CSIRO will be subjected to a cut of 2. 16% in 1981/82. </PARA>
<PARA> Across-the-board cuts mean that each time the Government makes a staff ceiling cut in the Public Service, CSIRO receives a cut of a similar magnitude to that imposed on Government departments. We believe a distinction should be made between an organization such as ours, on which the future growth and prospects of the nation vitally depend, and the administrative arms of government. It is the Executive's belief that the national interest requires a larger government commitment to science and technology rather than a reduction. </PARA>
<PARA> Another RCF decision, taken without consultation, was to close our Scientific Liaison Offices in London and Washington, ending a long history of dedicated service to Australia. These Offices provided a valuable means of keeping Australia abreast of developments in science and technology policies in these countries and facilitated the operation of science agreements. They also undertook a variety of important tasks such as recruiting senior scientific staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Our principal function is to undertake strategic research on behalf of industry and the community. Research programs span many years, even decades, as one thing leads to another. To describe a single research result in isolation from the work and ideas that have led up to it can often be rather meaningless. Beginning with this annual report, we are therefore introducing accounts (Chapters 12-16) of some main themes of our research work, their past evolution, the present work and future prospects. Some years of annual reports will be needed before all such themes can be comprehensively covered. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, the year 1980/81 has had its crop of notable achievements that have come to fruition during the year. On the side of the biological sciences, these include:</PARA>
<PARA> the discovery of a naturally occurring protein (Epidermal Growth Factor) that, by modulating the thickness of the wool fibre, shows promise of yielding a practicable biological method of defleecing sheep;</PARA>
<PARA> a vaccine for increasing ovulation rate of ewes by some 40 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> a killed vaccine to immunize cattle against Tick Fever; work is under way to isolate the specific protective protein that, with the aid of genetic engineering techniques, will enable the vaccine to become a commercial reality;</PARA>
<PARA> the development and marketing of highly specific substances (monoclonal antibodies) for the diagnosis of human and animal diseases (in collaboration with the Garvan Medical Research Centre and Bioclone (Australia) Pty Ltd);</PARA>
<PARA> the eradication of the water weed Salvinia (which causes serious blockages in Australian waterways) at a test site at Mt Isa by the introduction of a specific variety of weevil from South America; and</PARA>
<PARA> the implementation of a computer-controlled management technique (SIRATAC) for the application of insecticide and irrigation water on the cotton crops in the Namoi valley; the system, operated by a non-profit company, is being widely adopted by cotton farmers and may be extended to other crops in due course (in collaboration with the NSW Department of Agriculture). </PARA>
<PARA> On the side of the physical sciences, highlights of our research include:</PARA>
<PARA> the development of esters which act as highly effective insecticides but are non-toxic to other wildlife;</PARA>
<PARA> the world-wide commercial launching of SIROSPUN, a new system of spinning worsted weaving yarns involving a single-stage production in place of the conventional two stages (in collaboration with Repco Ltd and the International Wool Secretariat). </PARA>
<PARA> construction by Austep of the first full-scale SIROFLOC water purification plant, now supplying about 5 per cent of Perth's water supply from bore water and recently recognized by the 1981 'Plant of the Year' award of the Society of Chemical Industry of Victoria;</PARA>
<PARA> installation of the first commercial gas drainage system in Australia which prevented the probable closure of a highly efficient and valuable coal mine on the NSW south coast;</PARA>
<PARA> the development and commercial realization of a microfiche reader that brings reading within the scope of handicapped or disabled people; and</PARA>
<PARA> the development of a device that detects wear and faults in steel reinforced conveyor belts used by the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA> These are but a few of a much longer list that could be given, but they serve to illustrate the diversity of our research activities. Most of our research is of the kind that leads to foreseeable application. A small part of it contributes to basic knowledge with no application in sight. One of the most significant fundamental discoveries of our time was the discovery at the University of Cambridge in 1968 of pulsars, which proved that stars can finish their lives by collapsing to small spheres (neutron stars) of fantastically high density-thus revealing a new state of matter. Up till recently, all known pulsars were located in our own galaxy (the Milky Way) but astronomers eagerly speculated that they might be discovered in other galaxies, which would open new paths of investigation. This discovery was made during 1980/81 with the CSIRO radio telescope at Parkes, thanks to one of our scientists in collaboration with two colleagues of the University of Tasmania. Using innovative data processing techniques, they succeeded in detecting a number of pulsars in our nearest galaxy, the Magellan Clouds. This is a notable achievement of importance to basic science. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO continues to enjoy the highest respect and confidence of the Government and the Australian people. Yet it is clear that the decade we have now entered is proving to be more difficult for CSIRO than former, more expansive, times. Nevertheless, the Organization will continue to adapt to changing circumstances; and through its policies of selectivity and concentration it will continue to strive to improve its response to as many of the strategic research needs of industry and the community as resources allow. </PARA>

It is not any more the era of continuous growth. He does not use these words, but it really is the fear that CSIRO is entering a new era, the era of stagnation. Dr Wild said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> We believe a distinction should be made between an organisation such as ours, on which the future growth and prospects of the nation vitally depend, and the administrative arms of government. It is the Executive's belief that the national interest requires a larger government commitment to science and technology rather than a reduction. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to remember that if, as we find at the moment, our per capita government investment in science and technology is half that of France and if, as President Mitterrand has said, France will double its investment in his seven-year term, it means there would need to be a fourfold increase in our spending to keep our position relative to France. That is the situation that we face. Dr Wild points out, for example, that in this era when we need the greatest degree of international co-operation and exchange of ideas the decision was made by the Review of Commonwealth Functions to cut out Australia's scientific representation overseas. I ask honourable members to note that Dr Wild said the decision was 'taken without consultation'. It was forced on the Organisation. Dr Wild said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's monetary policy is disturbing and worsening in the shambles it inflicts on the community. The Australian Government is stricken with a bout of monetarist madness, soaring interest rates, the symptoms of a runaway monetary policy-policies that give every indication they will run the economy into the ground if they are not quickly brought back under control. Yet, the Government's monetary policies today, as they have been for all the days last year and for too many days of the last 6 1/2 years, are a shambles. The Government does not know what it is doing or where it is going. It is thrashing about like a blindfolded fool. Neither the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) nor the Treasurer (Mr Howard) seems to understand that he cannot hold together a set of widely contradictory policies with safety pins and stickytape. Both of them are trying to defy the fundamental logic of enforcing fiercely contractionary monetary control policies but are still wanting low interest rates in politically sensitive areas, such as housing . It does not work, it cannot work, it will not work, no matter how often the Prime Minister says that it must be made to work. It seems as though the Government is determined to start a new school of economics, the levitation school, that defies all the economic equivalents of the laws of physics. If the Government's economic commitment is to tight money, tight money means scarce money and there is a high price for scarce commodities. The high price for scarce money is high interest rates. It is as simple as that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government cannot have it both ways. It is a breathtaking display of blind faith and economic illiteracy for the Government to rig the money market in the way that it has and for it then to expect that interest rates for essential social factors, such as housing, will somehow stay low and that economic growth will be promoted. The Government, by its own deliberate policies, has distorted the interest rate yield curve in favour of short term money market operations to the disadvantage of medium and longer term growth investment. No sensible person would park his money anywhere for more than a few days with the present condition of government monetary policies. The Government's economic policies simply do not last any longer than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made those criticisms, at this point one ought to start with an outline of what ought to be done and give justification for a radical departure from what the Government is doing. The first thing I assert is that there must be a devaluation of the Australian dollar-a clear, decisive, firm devaluation-as an effective demonstration to the money market and to the international economy. As conditions stand at the moment there has been a persistent slide in the value of the Australian dollar. A psychology has been developed in association with that slide. The expectation will drive the slide beyond what is a proper level for the Australian dollar in the international money market. A clear, decisive, once -only devaluation as a demonstration of the firmness of control of government economic policy will arrest that. It is highly likely, in fact, that it will allow some recovery of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the dollar sliding and why are interest rates so high? Why are these two things interconnected? The facts are that with a persistent slide of the Australian dollar on international money markets the implication is quite clear: People will not bring their money to this country and those who have their money here will not keep it parked here unless there is a system of compensation, a system which will offset the losses that they suffer on exchange rate operations . The way in which the Government is doing that is to wriggle interest rates in this country. We now have the highest real interest rates of any industrialised country. </PARA>
<PARA> It was always argued by the Treasurer and by his faithful followers, no matter how few, in the government ranks that the reason for the high interest rates was the high interest rate structure in America. The American interest rate structure is sliding but the Australian interest rate structure stays, in real terms, the highest in the world. Why? The reason is that the government is rigging the money market. It is using interest rates as a compensation mechanism to provide compensation for those who have brought their money here from overseas, or those who are considering bringing it here. They will not bring it here and they will not keep it here while the Australian dollar continues to slide. The cost of that, of course, is met by the rest of Australia-by Australian householders trying to pay off their houses, by Australian business confronted with ever spiralling costs of working capital, by Australian farmers. It also means that monetary policy in this country is dramatically severe and is contracting economic growth. To support that claim one has only to refer to the report of the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Bank of New South Wales on the outlook of business for the year ahead. It is the gloomiest report in the best part of a decade. Business knows, as any moderately informed person understands, that with a continuation of present policies next year will be tougher than this year. This year is altogether too severe. The severity, as I pointed out before, is a direct product of domestic economic policies. It has little to do with international conditions. It is being inflicted on this community by a complete misunderstanding of the interrelationship of various aspects of monetary policy and fiscal policy, particularly our external account. Australians are paying, with excessive costs for their houses, with excessive costs for business working capital, with excessive costs for farm operating capital and with lost economic growth because of severe monetary policies, so that the Government can compensate overseas investors, people from overseas who have their money in Australia and who otherwise would not keep it here or bring it here. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the way to run a sensible economic policy for a country at times of economic difficulty. A decisive once-only devaluation of 3 per cent perhaps, certainly not higher than 4 per cent or 5 per cent, would have an indisputable, demonstrable effect. It should be associated with an easing of the money supply. In that way spiralling interest rates can be arrested. In that way, with a series of other fiscal and monetary initiatives and a prices and incomes policy without which there can be no successful, no credible, no practical economic package, we can put Australia into a much healthier economic condition than it is now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is argued in some quarters that it is preferable to borrow overseas to patch up the gaps, the very big gaps, which are in our balance of payments-the balance of trade and the balance on current account which continue to blow out in deficit. That is a fine proposition. It is one that I have argued in earlier years. I stress that it was in the past because it is only a fine proposition when there can be confidence that the performance of the domestic economy within the performance overall of the international economy is such as to guarantee a sense of confidence that the balance of trade and balance on current account deficit can be wound back. I do not believe, given international conditions as they are now and as they portend for the near future, that we can be that confident. </PARA>
<PARA> It would therefore be, in my view, an act of great folly to encourage further larger overseas borrowings. There are in the pipeline borrowings overseas of an additional $500m overseas by the Government at this level. I am not talking about the State level. That will lift total overseas borrowings under this Government to some $5,500m or nearly 4 per cent of gross domestic product. In 1975 overseas borrowings were less than $1,000m and only a little over one per cent of gross domestic product. One cannot keep putting the country into hock when one has serious economic difficulties. One needs sound economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in the market? There is a complete flight of confidence in the Government's ability to handle monetary policy. I quote the Australian Money Market Weekly of 15 March, no more than a little over a week ago. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> AMMW's advice to money market participants and institutions is to avoid the bond market completely as Australia is now being run by a lame-duck government. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Faced with the abysmal market conditions, there is no prospect of recovery in the bond market, and also no guide from the monetary authorities as to where the market is heading. </PARA>
<PARA>One can pick up a half dozen or more of the more authoritative, persuasively substantial and informed money market newsletters which are saying exactly the same thing. If these sorts of sources are telling investors: 'Don't put your money into bonds. Hang on to it. Overnight and in the very short term at the most', it means that money is not going to go into the development of this country. It means that money is going to go into the overnight operations. It means that interest rates will be pushed up higher and higher on the short end until the Government moves on the medium to longer end. That is what is wrong today. That is the consequence of applying the policies that the Government is applying but doing it with a frail heart. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should either apply the policies fully or change the whole thrust of its economic policy, which is what I have been proposing. Again, if one makes interest rates on the very short end of the market higher than they are on the medium to longer end of the market, as they are-that is, if treasury notes are running at between 18 per cent and 19 per cent and bonds are running at about 15 per cent to 16 per cent; bonds represent the money that is collected for the development of capital works in this country and treasury notes are just a holding operation-people, at least the moderately informed ones, are going to put all of their dough into the short end of the market, and that will keep pressure on interest rates to go up and up. Why are they doing it? They are doing it because they do not believe that the present structure of interest rates, given the nature of the Government's economic policy, can be sustained. They are demonstrating by voting with their cash that the Government's interest rate policy on medium to long term operations in this country, private as well as public, is not believable. That is a savage repudiation. </PARA>
<PARA> It means that important things such as roads, communications, harbours, railways, educational institutions and hospitals-a whole range of capital works- are not proceeding as they should be because the Government's interest rate structure has been rigged-I use the term advisedly; it was completely stupid to do it; one would have to be thoroughly illiterate in economics to do it-in such a way as to discourage people from putting their money sensibly into the development of this country. The Government has achieved the unparalleled result of destroying all confidence in the future of this country under its management.</PARA>
<PARA> Does the Government know what it is doing? On Friday morning the nation woke to read in the newspapers of the Government's brave new breakthrough in housing policy, which is directly related to this matter. There was an increase of $300m in housing interest repayments for home buyers-a great deal! There would be no relief for three out of four home buyers. But the battling banks would pick up an increased $100m in profits. That is how things stood on Friday morning-a one per cent increase. The weekend allowed the Government to sober up. On Monday morning the community read in the newspapers that Mr Keith Campbell, an inspirational force to the Treasurer, was declaring that interest rates on housing would go up another 1 1/2 per cent. So the Treasurer has in the pipeline , post-Victoria, another $450m in repayments for Australian home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that semi-government raisings are a flop. There was the $50m raising for Telecom which got only $17m less than a fortnight ago. Bonds are sagging with the official market rate at 15 1/2 per cent but the secondary market is collecting 17 per cent to 18 per cent. That means that, because of the spiralling interest rates, people are now selling bonds which they bought earlier at a lower interest rate for, in layman's terms, a lesser capital value. In that way they give a greater rate of return to those who buy them. That, in turn, is the mechanism by which the market signals to government that its raid on bonds is unbelievable. How can one believe a government when the official money market has a rigged rate on bonds of 15 1/2 per cent and the secondary market is pushing the rate up to between 17 per cent and 18 per cent? Who would put money into the private sector, into shares, when the rate of return for the past 16 months has been only about 5 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by commenting on the corporate sector. A very grim situation has arisen in this sector. Under the articles of association public corporations , large and small, are restricted to the amount that they can borrow as a ratio of their asset backing. They borrowed 12 months ago and more when interest rates were high and share values were high. Share values have collapsed by more than 35 per cent. They do not now have the asset backing to sustain the level of indebtedness-borrowings-that they had at very high interest rates. There are large corporations in Australia today flogging off assets in a desperate bid to get liquid, to get viable again. All of this is a product of the Government's incompetence, its foolishness, in handling the monetary policy. I call upon the Government to rethink where it is because if it does not rethink it, if it does not haul back from the savagery of the credit squeeze that we are now confronted with, we will see corporate failures on a very disturbing scale. </PARA>

<PARA> DISCUSSION OF MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE-Mr Hayden (Leader of the Opposition)-</PARA>
<PARA>No less, today-</PARA>
<PARA> The disturbing and worsening shambles of Government monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought that by coming here I would hear the Opposition's alternative monetary policy. As I listened to the Leader of the Opposition, I found that after two minutes he said: 'I am proposing a radical departure'. But during his quarter hour speech, he said not one thing, and he gave the House not one idea, about those areas in which, in the conduct of monetary policy, the Labor Opposition, if it were in government, would do anything different. The only thing that the Leader of the Opposition said that was different from the policy that is being followed now by the Government was that he trotted out his hardy manual of a once only devaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition is still living back in those old days of fixed exchange rates when it was imagined that one could have such a thing as a once and for all variation in the exchange rate. He has not learnt the lessons of those days. He ignores the fact that there is nothing more destabilising and disruptive to business and consumer confidence than very major movements in the exchange rate either way. But apart from that remark-and we are all familiar with the views of the Leader of the Opposition on that subject-there was not one word, not one scintilla of any suggestion from him, as to what the alternative monetary policy ought to be. One the one hand, he said that our policy was not tight enough; on the other hand, he said that it was too tight. In the dying moments of his speech, he talked about a credit squeeze; in the early part of his speech, he said that interest rates were too low. The Leader of the Opposition cannot have it all ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition is proposing, in his own words, a radical departure. What is that radical departure? Where does the Leader of the Opposition differ from the Government? What changes would he have us institute in the conduct of our monetary policy in an environment in which the conduct of economic policy is far more difficult than it has been for a number of years? No one pretends that the interest rates being paid by the Australian community at present are anything other than extremely uncomfortable. The Government is very conscious of the effect of interest rates on many areas of the Australian community. But the question that we must ask ourselves-and the question that the Leader of the Opposition left totally unanswered in a speech which was full of rhetorical slogans but little else-is: What is the alternative monetary policy of the Australian Labor Party at present?</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Labor Party's monetary policy one of artificially holding down interest rates? The Leader of the Opposition did not tell us that. Does he believe that, by artificially holding down interest rates, we can sustain our international economic position? Does he not realise that, if one artificially holds interest rates, one will provoke a balance of payments crisis the like of which this country has never seen? Does he advocate that? He has done so on other occasions . Some of his colleagues have advocated that. But he was strangely silent on that alternative monetary policy today. We shall give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he is not in favour of doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the Leader of the Opposition, therefore, secondly, in favour of the good old Labor Party remedy in the face of difficult decisions in the area of monetary policy of simply printing money? Does he believe that one can increase the deficit, not allow one's monetary policy to be adjusted accordingly, and simply print more money? Once again, there was deafening silence on that matter. That is not surprising, because the Leader of the Opposition knows from his earlier experience, and he knows from his understanding-I hope-of the present situation, that such an approach, such a scenario, would be to produce in present circumstances a much higher rate of inflation. Does he believe that we should not, therefore, as a third alternative, use monetary policy at all, so far as inducing a more rational environment for the conduct of wage negotiations? Does he really believe that the answer to the present situation is to allow the wages explosion to go--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a third alternative, perhaps, is the Leader of the Opposition's monetary policy one of simply saying that in the face of a wages explosion, which is undermining the international competitiveness of the Australian economy and visiting a great deal of disadvantage and suffering on the entire Australian community, his answer would be simply to say: 'Forget about monetary policy. Let the wages explosion rip. Let our international competitiveness be destroyed, and cure it all by a once only devaluation'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the domestic economic policies followed by this or any other government at present are relevant to the extent to which international economic adversity flows through into Australia. Of course, we are not impotent to have an influence on the effects of international economic conditions on the Australian economy. This government and I have never asserted otherwise. What we can do by our own domestic economic policies is either to aggravate or to reduce the harmful effects of the world economic situation. What I put to the House is that to adopt a substantially different monetary policy at present would be to aggrevate the adverse international economic conditions that the world is experiencing. Does anyone really imagine that the effects upon Australia of high interest rates in the United States, which are in turn caused by an unsatisfactorily high deficit in the United States, will be improved by the Australian Government running a higher deficit? Does anyone imagine that we shall be able to reduce the effects of American interest rates on Australia by turning a blind eye and, like King Canute, pretending that we can artificially hold down interest rates, as apparently on other occasions the Leader of the Opposition has imagined that we could?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During his speech, the Leader of the Opposition tried to pretend to the House that American interest rates were coming down and that therefore all the problems in Australia would be solved. Everybody with any degree-if I may borrow the Leader of the Opposition's phrase-of economic literacy will know that the American interest rates have an influence on the level of interest rates in Australia over a period, and that Australian interest rates do not simply go up and down like a yoyo every time American interest rates go up and down. The average Australian prime rate over the last two years has been 14.82 per cent. The current prime rate in Australia is 16.25 per cent, and the current prime rate in the United States averages 16 per cent to 16.25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the face of those figures, can you really believe the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Deputy Speaker, when he says that American interest rates are coming down and therefore Australian interest rates ought to be coming down? He does not even understand the current figures, yet he comes in here and says that this is part of his radical departure in the brave new monetary policy world. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the Government is facing one of the more difficult tasks of economic management that it has had over the last six years. Since the time when the Budget was brought down there have been a number of adverse economic developments, and it does not profit anyone to ignore them and to ignore their consequences. We have seen, particularly but not exclusively in the wages area, a serious undermining of the international competitiveness of our economy. We have seen a significant worsening of our balance of payments. We have seen in particular a deterioration of the trade account which is due in no small measure to the fact that world economic activity is very subdued. In turn, that has had a very adverse effect on commodity prices. Once again, anybody with an elementary understanding of the situation would know that our balance of payments are bound to be affected if international commodity prices are down. Therefore, demand for the goods that we export abroad will be down. They are facts of economic life and economic policy has to be adjusted accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The last prescription that I would hope that this House or the Australian nation would want us to adopt would be a prescription of loosening policy, of adopting an attitude that looser fiscal or monetary policy will solve the problem. No policy imposed at present will remove some of the uncomfortable features of our present economic life. There is simply no alternative at present to a degree of discomfort and a degree of economic adversity. What we have to ask ourselves is whether an alternative economic strategy-in particular the alternative monetary strategy of the Leader of the Opposition, which he would not tell us today but which I have tried from earlier speeches and statements of his to piece together-will create an improvement; whether it would be better, according to his economic prescription; whether his monetary policy of a slacker approach to monetary control, of a larger government deficit, of a looser fiscal stance of inevitably much higher government expenditure and, inevitably, therefore, either a looser monetary policy or much higher taxation, would better suit the economic environment in which Australia now finds itself in the first half of 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the House that that is the crucial question that has to be asked. It is not to be denied for a moment that the present level of interest rates is anything other than very uncomfortable. We would wish them to be lower. We would wish that there were realistic alternatives to the present monetary and economic environment; but there is no alternative to the monetary policy that the present Government is following that does not involve, other than in the very short term , much higher inflation and, in turn, much higher interest rates. Of course, if we wanted to we could rapidly expand the money supply. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) is a little more candid on this subject than the Leader of the Opposition. He at least in these debates is prepared to stand up and say that what the Government ought to be doing is expanding the money supply. That is what he says and at least he is frank about it. The Leader of the Opposition squibbed it today. He talked about his radically different monetary strategy but when it came to laying it out and putting it on the table, he ran scared on the subject. At least the honourable member for Gellibrand is honest in saying that if he had the responsibility, he would simply print more money. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course if we printed more money at present we would be able to buy a reduction in interest rates for a while. We would be able to kid everybody that we could print more money and underwrite more inflation, and that nothing would happen. Perhaps for a few months everybody would say 'Ah ha, we have found the solution. With interest rates at 16 per cent in the United States and high interest rates all around the world, Australia alone has been able to insulate herself from that and has found the solution; simply by turning the handle of the printing press we are able to print our way out of difficulty and by underwriting inflation we are able to solve the problem'. It would be absolutely marvellous for a while but sooner or later the truth would out; sooner or later the realisation would come home that buying in the very short term a reduction of interest rates at the cost of much higher inflation and in turn even higher interest rates, would be a very poor bargain indeed, not only for a government that was foolish enough to do it but also for the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I first state my unqualified endorsement of the matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden)-namely, the disturbing and worsening shambles of Government monetary policy-as a matter of grave and increasing public importance. If the people listening to this debate were seeking confirmation of any belief that the Government's economic policies might be correctly formulated and effectively applied at present, those people now must feel shattered. There is no way in which the Opposition can or will stand idly by while this Government's incoherent obsession with discredited monetarist doctrine inevitably drags the Australian economy and the Australian people deeper into the mire and closer to the brink of economic disaster. For six years this Government has been saying to the Australian people: 'Batten down the hatches, cop it sweet and things will be better and brighter tomorrow'. They have not been better and brighter, and they are not and will not be better and brighter tomorrow if this Government persists with its dogged determination to pursue the discredited economic policies it has pursued for the last six years. It is simply not good enough for the Government to claim that our economic troubles are externally induced, as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has attempted to do today. This represents a repudiation of the vital role of national economic management and it reflects the economic incompetence and ineptitude of a discredited government, of a discredited Treasurer and of a discredited Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If ever monetarism were to have a major test, the opportunity for such a test was provided in the spring of 1979 when the rag-tag government behind Mrs Margaret Thatcher was elected in Britain. It was committed to the pursuit of firm monetarist policies. After three years, the economy of Britain was in tatters. I give some evidence of that. Gross domestic product fell by nearly 4 per cent and industrial production dropped below 1973 levels. Unemployment surged past three million, more than twice the 1.25 million unemployed when the Thatcher Government took office. Profits dropped in 1981 to an estimated 2 per cent return on equity. Record bankruptcies and liquidations were the order of the day. Business investment in 1981 fell 3 per cent in real terms. One of the chief economic architects of the Thatcher policy, Professor Alan Budd of the London Business School, has now publicly repudiated the monetarism that he helped to design. He has stated that such drastic tightening should not have been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> In the face of this massive confirmation of the failure of monetarism as it was being applied in Britain, what did Britain do in the last Budget? This Government is at least six months behind in connection with changes that are taking place in national economic policy and management throughout the whole of the Western world. I make no attempt to justify or excuse the mismatch of monetarism and supply side trickle-down economics, tempered with a little bit of political and economic opportunism, being pursued by the Reagan Administration in the United States. Posterity will indicate the effectiveness of that. What does the most recent Budget in Britain do, amongst other things? First of all, it provides for the injection of an additional $1.36 billion into the economy. It provides tax relief. It provides for a higher value added tax threshold and, quite pertinently, the most recent Budget in Britain provides for an easing of money supply growth targets to 8 per cent to 12 per cent this year compared with 5 per cent to 9 per cent last year. So, the one nation which followed an almost exclusive monetarist policy-in addition to Australia-has now repudiated it and changed direction. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one bright spot in the economic record of this present Government . That occurred in 1980-81, when economic growth in the non-farm sector increased by about 4 per cent in real terms. We well remember how the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer sought to take credit for that. A number of things happened during that year which this Government could not and should not have sought or taken any credit for at all. Some of that growth resulted from the fact that the Government had ceased momentarily to pursue its stated policy to rein back on government expenditure. But in the run up to the 1980 election it released the purse strings, it increased its spending and as a result of that there was an improvement in economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason those improvements occurred was because the Government simply was not achieving its economic objective, it was not achieving the sort of strategy it wanted to provide. Fundamental to that strategy, of course, was its claim, which it persists in repeating, that its economic measures are not going to be successful until the real value of wages are reduced. So it pursued that objective. But during 1980 in particular, for the first time in the period of this Government, there was an real increase in the level of wages. That brought about an increase in consumer spending, business confidence and production and helped to hold down increasing unemployment. So that was the second reason for those improvements in the one year in which there was any bright spot in the policy pursued by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the third reason? The third reason was that things happened over which this Government had no control, things happened which improved the Australian economy which this Government deliberately set out to sabotage. During that period there was an inflow in foreign investment to Australia in order to take advantage of resource development. This Government was responsible for sabotaging the State governments in their attempt to undertake necessary public investment in public infrastructure in order to support those developments. So the improvements which occurred in the one bright spot in this Government's record in no way could be or should be asserted as having resulted from the policies being pursued by this Government. The only one thing which is keeping the Australian economy afloat at the moment is investment decisions that were made in 1978, 1979 and 1980. If they were firm investment decisions, if commitments were made, those investments are being carried on. If they were not firm, if there were no commitments made they are either being delayed, modified or abandoned. What has happened with the Rundle oil shale project? What has happened with Stage 2 of the North West Shelf project development? What has happened with the aluminium smelters? What has happened with the coal mining projects which are being abandoned right across the nation? These more recent investment projects are being abandoned wholesale. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the position to which this gaggle of incompetents on the Government benches has brought this nation? Let us go through them. They are as follows: The lowest level of consumer and business confidence since the Depression of the 1930s, the highest rate of bankruptcies since the Depression, the highest level of unemployment since the Depression, and an unemployment level which is still growing; an increase from 1 million to 3 million people in the Australian community living below the poverty line-that is, one person in every five or 20 per cent of Australians; one of the lowest levels of economic growth on record and a rate of economic growth which is falling; the Australian dollar which yesterday plunged to its lowest level for five years against the United States dollar; and, as the Leader of the Opposition quite clearly indicated, the highest interest rates ever recorded in the history of the Commonwealth. What is the prospect for the half a million people unemployed? Just to hold that level and absorb the increase in the labour force into employment we would need a growth rate in Australia of between 3 per cent and 3 1/2 per cent. The Treasurer targeted for that figure in the Budget Papers this year. We are not going to reach it. We will be lucky to get to 3 per cent. What is going to be the growth rate next year? It is going to be 1.2 per cent. As a result we will not even absorb those new people into the work force. Unemployment will grow. It is now 7 per cent and by the end of next financial year it will be 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government sought first of all a consumer-led recovery. That did not happen. Then it sought an export-led recovery. That did not happen. Then it sought an investment-led recovery. That did not happen. It has now reached the final absurdity-a recession-led recovery. The Australian community is becoming increasingly aware of the deficiencies of this Government and the policies that it is pursuing. It will increasingly turn its support to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating a matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) concerning monetary policy. The Australian economy is facing an era of great pressure on interest rates. Australia, like other developed countries, cannot isolate itself from the effects of monetary and interest rate developments elsewhere in the world. Moreover, there has been a heavy demand for funds in Australia from companies, from individuals and from governments resulting from growth in the economy. The pressure on interest rates would be even greater if the Government had not acted to limit the public sector demand for funds, both through borrowings for infrastructure development and through containing government outlays. If a resurgence in inflation is to be avoided, control must be maintained over the rate of monetary expansion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition, in proposing this matter for debate today, talked about areas of public expenditure that were going ahead and which he felt ought to go ahead with greater expenditure. In this respect the Leader of the Opposition, as in so many other respects, is inconsistent if one looks at the context in which he makes statements about economic matters. When he was Treasurer and was bringing down the Budget for 1975-76 he had quite a lot to say about the deleterious effects of excessive public expenditure on rates of inflation and on the welfare of the community. Let me quote from the Treasurer's Budget Speech of that year. The Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Federal Treasurer, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to provide more and more government services or transfer payments from the Budget without ultimately having to pay for them through cutting back after-tax earnings via increased taxes. It is not possible to get quarts out of pint pots. </PARA>
<PARA>That was what the Leader of the Opposition had to say when he was the Commonwealth Treasurer in 1975. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If inflation is to be curbed there are no soft options-only a choice between more or less difficult ones. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, as Leader of the Opposition he likes to choose the soft options but he has not recanted as far as I know from those statements that he made in 1975. He has not said: 'Sorry, I was wrong'. But as Leader of the Opposition he says that the Government ought to indulge in more and more government expenditure in all sorts of areas that are, on the face of them, popular and would be well received by the public. But the difference is that he was then in government and now he is in opposition and feels he can afford the luxury of those sorts of statements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition said, as I recall his words: 'Who would put money into shares when the rate of return is as low as it has been recently?' This is another respect in which the Leader of the Opposition and Opposition spokesmen contradict themselves when it suits them. Australian Labor Party spokesmen, including the Leader of the Opposition, like to have it both ways. They like to condemn so-called excessive company profits when it suits them, branding them as rapacious and rip-offs. But when the Leader of the Opposition makes another analysis of the economy for another purpose he points out that company rates of return have been low and that there is a disincentive for people to put their money into that sort of investment. We on this side of the House believe that a profitable private sector is necessary for productivity growth, for employment and for rising living standards. This provides the tax base for all the desirable public expenditures which we would like to see. But for that to take place we cannot have the public sector imposing too high a burden on the private sector, on the ordinary taxpayers, in a way that would stifle incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> Slower world demand for Australia's exports and strong demand for imports of machinery and other investment items have resulted, as the Treasurer pointed out , in a large current account deficit. Sluggish growth overseas, low business profits and high interest rates have led to slow or nil growth in many of Australia's overseas markets. There was, for example, a 20 per cent fall in international commodity prices in the year to the last September quarter and flat or falling prices for our agricultural produce. Australia's economy is thus constrained by its interdependence with the rest of the world. It is influenced by the present slackness in world demand. It is certainly influenced by the high cost of funds which is expressed in interest rates. It is influenced by increasing protectionism overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with these influences has been a rapid growth in the current account deficit, squeezed profitability for export industries and some reappraisal of resource projects. However, investment is still strong. Australia's achievements and aspirations must be measured and tempered by the world picture. Australia has swum against the tide with living standards rising, although not as much as we would like, and the economy has been prospering while the world has stagnated . This has been a result of Government policies which created the conditions in which industry had the confidence to develop our resources. The keys were the constant assault on inflation and sustained restraint on government spending. This restraint has been virtually unrivalled in the world and we have seen the Budget deficit cut from almost 5 per cent of gross domestic product under Labor to less than one per cent in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also eased the pressure on domestic capital markets by curbing its own borrowing requirements and promoting industrial expansion, competitiveness and productivity. It has managed the exchange rate without disruption. I might say that that responsible management of the exchange rate is not assisted by irresponsible speculation by the Leader of the Opposition or other senior public figures in Australia who publicly advocate a devaluation. It is an irresponsible attitude to take and it does not assist a proper and responsible management of the exchange rate. We have sought to secure improved access and new markets overseas for Australian products. We have encouraged industry with research and development initiatives. We have encouraged industry with the accelerated depreciation allowance and adequate notices of changes in the level of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> These achievements have been based on some economic growth-as I have said, not as much as we would like and certainly not without problems. There are a number of problems in the Australian economy that we still have to overcome. Challenges to that growth must therefore be met if Australians are to continue to rise to their full potential. The Government must be ready to adapt, especially to fundamental changes in the world economy, if the foundations are to be laid for future growth when the upturn in the world economy comes and if Australia is to be carried through the intervening downturn. Today Australia's economy is under challenge from the growing efficiency, productivity and price competitiveness of the restructured industries of some of our competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect we must acknowledge that in the Australian context our productivity, our competitiveness, is not being assisted by the industrial situation that we presently face in this country. What can we say about the competitiveness of industry in New South Wales in view of the present power dispute? What can we say about the employment situation in New South Wales? Monetary policy managed by a Commonwealth government is only one part, albeit an important part, of the total management of the economy. Other parts of the economy, other influences in the economy, are also important. It would be worth while to see some contribution to growth in Australia from other sectors of the economy. New South Wales is presently the strike capital of Australia with almost twice as many working days being lost last year due to industrial disputes as was the case in Victoria. If certain developments are to take place in Victoria as a result of the program of the Labor Opposition in Victoria, we will see a repeat of that performance in the Victorian context. The Victorian Labor Opposition has stated that it will repeal the Vital State Projects Act used for the hastening of the completion of the Newport power station. In view of present power restrictions in New South Wales, affecting also the Australian Capital Territory, where would Victoria be-indeed, where would New South Wales be-if the Newport power station had not been completed? In recent times New South Wales has been relying on the Victorian power grid for the drawing of its energy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has also committed itself to repealing the secret ballots legislation in Victoria which enables the new industrial relations commission to order a secret ballot on its own initiative. The early success of this measure was evident in the speedy resolution of the strike at the Broadmeadows plant of the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd. The Labor Party has also committed itself to repealing the Essential Services Act which was invoked by the Premier, Mr Thompson, in July of last year to ensure that milk was delivered to the Australian consumer. </PARA>

<TITLE>Perth Airport</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Right Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that total annual aircraft movements into and out of Perth Airport are expected to more than double over the next fourteen years.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners note that this will produce a dramatic increase in noise pollution in the surrounding suburbs, particularly those directly beneath flight paths.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners further note that unlike Great Britain, Australia has no legislation to allow payments of compensation for injurious affection.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That the Minister for Transport implement a curfew banning traffic movements at Perth Airport between 11.00 p.m. and 6.00 a.m.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) That legislation be introduced to allow payment for injurious affection, including compensation for cost of insulation of private and public buildings.</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners note that in the surrounding area there is a very high proportion of pensioners. Many of these people do not have cars and some have difficulty using public transport.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners further note that since the costs associated with running such a post office agency are very low Australia Post will make only small savings at the expense and great inconvenience of its customers.</PARA>

<TITLE>Aboriginal Land Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as has already been the case with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That if, as is likely, the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests .</PARA>
<PARA> That it is also quite clear, on past evidence, that these interests will have the full backing of the Queensland government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government .</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people under its constitutional powers since amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it failed to act in 1976 and thus, failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self management.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland.</PARA>

<TITLE>Mr Yuri Shukhevych</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Yuri Shukhevych, a Ukranian prisoner of conscience in the Soviet Union, has renounced Soviet citizenship and expressed a desire to emigrate to Australia to join members of his family.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Shukhevych was first arrested as a minor, for being the son of Roman Shukhevych, commander-in-chief of the Ukranian Insurgent Army, and has served nearly thirty years of sentences totalling thirty five years for refusing to denounce his father.</PARA>
<PARA> During a brief period of release between 1968 and 1972, in which he was forbidden to return to Ukraine, Mr Shukhevych married and had two children. He and his family have been granted entry visas to Australia following special consideration by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> As latest reports indicate that Mr Shukhevych is in poor health and is partially blind, and that the whereabouts of his wife and children have become unknown, your petitioners pray that the government direct its officers to take whatever urgent action is in their power both to establish the whereabouts of Mr Shukhevych's wife and children and assist in enabling them to emigrate to Australia forthwith.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I continue my remarks from where I left off on Thursday , when I was so rudely interrupted by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and sundry other honourable members, on the matter of housing. It would have been justified to have interrupted those very pertinent remarks I was making on the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1982 had the announcement been worth while but we were subjected to three hours of debate on a pretty worthless measure. I am glad that we are now in a position to get back to discussing the Opposition's very necessary amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I was interrupted I was talking about the substantial contribution we were making to Malaysia's internal politics in the situation which existed prior to 1979, when no fees were charged to private overseas students studying at Australian tertiary institutions. I remarked that, because of the constraints of internal Malaysian politics, an agreement had been reached between the various communities in Malaysia which meant that persons of Malay origin in Malaysia were favoured for entry into universities in Malaysia to the exclusion of persons of Chinese origin. The effect of that agreement, of course, was to create some substantial tensions in the Chinese community. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was involved in student politics I was aware of the very considerable significance placed by the Chinese of Malaysia on the fact of their ready access to Australian universities. For a very large number of them-those who were competent students but perhaps slightly less so than the very brilliant students who could run the gauntlet of the restrictions imposed upon them in Malaysia-it was their one chance to obtain a decent tertiary education. The students who came here by no means reflected the most wealthy sections of the Chinese community. I had a large number of friends among the overseas students at the time. Whilst some of them certainly were of a very wealthy background in Malaysia, others were not. I heard a number of stories from students whose parents and relatives had made very considerable sacrifices to enable them to get to university. It is really to those students who, since 1979, have been disadvantaged by this legislation that the Opposition has addressed its amendment, which we hope the Government will take on board. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not one of those people who believe that we ought totally to divorce our aid program from our foreign policy. I know that is sometimes argued. It is often argued from this side of the House. But any nation ought to take the opportunity, at least through some aspects of its aid program, to encourage particular political developments or particular political relationships that the country deems important to its national security. There can be no doubt at all that the Association of South East Asian Nations powers-Malaysia is one and the Philippines is another-from which we draw a number of private students, are of very considerable significance to this country. It is a shame in many ways that over the last decade we have come to neglect our relationship with the ASEAN powers. We do have substantive disagreement with them over a number of economic matters. We have substantial disagreements with Indonesia over certain features of Indonesian domestic policy, in the main, and we have disagreement with it over attitudes towards the situation in Vietnam, although the disagreement there is somewhat more marginal than it is in the other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact of those disagreements, those countries remain extraordinarily important to us; the good will of the people of those countries is very important to us and the internal stability of those countries remains very important to us. The fact that the students went back to those countries, to Malaysia in particular, and subsequently exercised a considerable degree of authority, in the Chinese community at least and sometimes in the general Malaysian community as a whole, was of very considerable benefit both to those countries and to Australia. It is very unfortunate that the fairly niggardly amount of money that this surcharge raises should have been imposed to the detriment of a foreign policy objective that is worth a great deal more to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the way in which the Government intends to amend this legislation-that is why the Bill is before us on this occasion-is an indication of the extent to which Australia has shifted its foreign policy interest in the regions which our Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) is want to describe as areas of our strategic concern. I think the fact that the Government is extending to students from Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific the exemption from paying these fees is an indication of the extent to which for the moment this Government has assigned higher priority in Australian relations to that area than it has assigned to areas of previous interest in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted last year a statement made by Mr Loh, the Director of the National Overseas Students Services, which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 12 September. In it Mr Loh expressed his understanding of the reasons that the Government should have engaged in this shift. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Your Government has obviously decided to treat a specific region with special care. The presence of the Soviet Union offering fishing agreements and other aid packages has obviously spurred on this decision. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure whether this decision was in fact spurred on by the Government's concern with Soviet activities in the South Pacific, although on numerous occasions Government Ministers and Government back benchers have expressed concern about Soviet activities in that area. But undoubtedly Mr Loh is correct in that obviously there were certain political objectives behind our interest in the region and those political objectives called forth this decision to be generous specifically to students from those areas as opposed to students from Asia. We can see a shift also in Government policy towards this area; for example, in the decision to purchase the aircraft carrier. The aircraft carrier is not particularly valuable for the defence of Australia, but if Australia were ever to take it upon itself to pressure or in other ways to intimidate nations, or movements, in the South Pacific region, an aircraft carrier certainly would be useful for that purpose. If that is underpinning the Government's decision to exempt students from that area from the charge while still imposing it on students from other areas, the Government is mistaken. There never will be a substantial security threat to Australia from that area that has not already emerged in South East Asia and there will never be an occasion when those fairly unpopulated areas will be as significant to us as our relations with the ASEAN powers. I think that the Government really ought to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Government's policy there may also be an element of competition with New Zealand for numbers of students from this area. As honourable members would probably be aware, the New Zealanders do not charge this additional tuition charge. That, naturally enough I suppose, is one of a number of factors which encourage a large number of students from the South Pacific region to opt to do their studies at New Zealand universities. I realise that this funding comes from the pocket of the Australian taxpayer. I am not attempting to make a party political argument in respect of the action that is being taken. I am thoroughly aware that if it boiled down to that it would not be unnatural in these straitened times in the general Australian community for the Australian taxpayers to opt for imposing a charge on students who come into this country rather than having to meet out of their own pockets the whole of the bill for their education here, and it would be a perfectly reasonable position for Australian taxpayers to take. All I can say is that if the Government were to take this matter a step further and see it as part of the Government's general aid package, as I believe it ought to, there may well be other areas of Australian foreign aid that could be reduced somewhat to take up the amount of money that would be taken out of another area of government activity by virtue of the fact that this surcharge was removed. I think it is arguable that the service that we perform in taking care of these students in this country and providing them with educational opportunities is of materially greater benefit to their societies than some of the other things that we do. </PARA>
<PARA> When this surcharge was introduced it was argued by the Minister at the time that a very large number of the students who came to Australia on a private basis remained here and had the benefit not only of an Australian education but also of Australian living standards and participation in the Australian economy and were not contributing the results of their education to the development of their own countries. If that was the situation pertaining then, and I have no doubt that it was, it is not the situation which pertains now. The Government is increasingly insisting that students who come here to study on a private basis return home prior to any attempt by them to return to Australia. That is not, I would submit, an entirely unreasonable decision by the Government. But it does change the circumstances in which the surcharges were originally introduced. It eliminates entirely the argument which was put for imposing the charges at the time they were introduced. In the light of that, I think the Government really ought to take very serious notice of the proposition which has been put forward by the honourable member for Fremantle. In the light of the fact that these students will now return to their home countries to make a contribution to their own societies, we really ought to look at the significance of the assistance that we provide to a large number of Asian students in permitting them entry to Australian universities, take it seriously as an aspect of our aid program and permit the needier of the students in that position to come here. I think the Malaysians will have very good reason for thanking us if we do that. It can only be to the very considerable long term advantage of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be brief in my response to the remarks of the honourable member for Swan ( Mr Beazley). The honourable member did range far and wide in his contribution, including his reference to the purchase of an aircraft carrier and other aspects of foreign policy. It is true that this debate has some important foreign policy implications but I shall confine myself to those parts of his remarks that concern the overseas students charges legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts in respect of students in Australia are that, in 1979, 32.6 per cent of the students were from member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, principally from Malaysia, and in 1980 that had actually risen to 42.2 per cent. Again, the students were principally from Malaysia, and very often from fairly wealthy families. By contrast, in 1979, 633 students or 13.7 per cent of the total were from the South Pacific and in 1980 this number dropped to 537 or 10 per cent of the total. Therefore, the House will see that we have had a sharp drop in what was a fairly small percentage of the intake from the South Pacific. So the explanation which was mused upon by the honourable member for Swan is not really so hard to find. We really do have a geopolitical obligation towards both South East Asia and the South Pacific, which I know the honourable member shares wholeheartedly. Quite frankly, our reason for exempting South Pacific students is, if you like, to discriminate positively in their favour in much the way we did in respect of South East Asia and Malaysia in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> I had very full discussions on this matter with the then Minister for Education , who is now the Deputy Prime Minister, Datuk Musa Hitam, who fully understands our policy. I am sure that my predecessor had similar discussions before the program was introduced. What we are doing by this legislation is effectively maintaining the real value of the charges which have already been set. They were set for a combination of reasons, not the least of which are simply our own budgetary reasons, which I will come to in a moment. But no offence is taken in Malaysia or elsewhere in ASEAN to those charges. On the contrary, there is an appreciation of the effectiveness of the Colombo Plan and subsequent education plans. I think there has been a recognition both here and in ASEAN that most of the things which the honourable member for Swan said have been achieved have been achieved to the benefit of the countries in our region. One of the pillars of our relationship with ASEAN has been built on the Overseas Student Program and the subsequent refugee program has consolidated that relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure the honourable member for Swan was not saying that we should not assist the South Pacific. He mused about the various reasons why we were assisting students from that area. Quite frankly, not one of the ASEAN countries is concerned with the level of charges. They are still infinitely lower than the charges that students have to pay in other countries for similar standards of education. Of course, as a result of their own efforts primarily but also with some assistance from ourselves, they now have a very high level of education in their own institutions, which cannot be said to be basically the case in the South Pacific. So there is still a question of our having to assist the South Pacific as part of an overall responsibility in the area and to do it in a way which encourages more of that region's students to come here. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Swan did not seriously criticise our policy of obliging people to return home for two years. The last thing we would want and the one thing which would damage our relations would be a brain drain. But if after two years people feel that they cannot make any greater contribution to their country of origin they are, of course, free to apply to migrate. We have no sense of guilt about that policy. The Ministers of the governments concerned also feel that if somebody does not want to stay after a two-year trial on his return from Australia he is quite welcome to migrate. Many of those people add a very important character to Australia, but the worst thing we could do would be to train them and keep them without asking them to go back and contribute to the country from which they came. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the debate was adjourned last Thursday the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) made a couple of requests which I shall comply with. First of all, he asked that an explanation be given to the Parliament on the effect of the introduction of the charges in relation to the Overseas Student Program. As was stated in the House by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs at the time of the introduction of the original legislation, the Overseas Student Program helps to promote better understanding of Australia, its people and attitudes. That has been confirmed by the contribution which has been made by the honourable member for Swan. It is an important contribution to international cultural exchange and good will on a global basis. It is particularly beneficial to developing countries, particularly those in the region in which we live. The Government considered carefully the nature and the objectives of our Overseas Student Program at the time of the introduction of the overseas students charges legislation in 1979. Whether the charges would deter or prevent overseas students from coming to Australia to study was a matter that was specifically taken into account. Very careful inquiries were made overseas. From the estimated figures of overseas students at universities and colleges of advanced education over the last three years-that is, those who would have been subject to the charges-one can conclude that the introduction of the charges has not adversely affected the Overseas Student Program. </PARA>
<PARA> These estimated figures are that in 1979 about 6,500 were at universities and colleges of advanced education; in 1980, there were 7,200 -that was when the legislation came into effect-and we expect the final figure for 1981 will be a little over 8,000. So, there has been a fairly steady climb, and the level of charge has certainly not deterred people from coming. It is a bit like immigration and refugee policies. We cannot take everyone who wants to come, but we find that the level of charges introduced, and being maintained here, is not a deterrent. The total overseas student population is, of course, much higher that those figures reflect, but those who attended senior secondary colleges, colleges of technical and further education and other training institutions were not subject to the charges. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fremantle also asked about the rationale for exempting students from certain developing countries, particularly in the South Pacific region, and not from others. I have partly answered that in respect to the honourable member for Swan, but I stated also in my second reading speech that the exemption of charges in favour of students from Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific region is consistent with our special relationship with and our obligations towards this region by virtue of Australia's geographic location , historic ties and relative economic strength. Australia, of course, also values its relationship with other developing countries, but Australia does not possess unlimited resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case-and this is most important-the charges that we are making represent only about 40 per cent of the cost of overseas students' education in Australia. In other words, Australia has already subsidised 60 per cent of their education costs. Unlike Australian students whose families contribute to their education through tax, overseas students make no such contribution. So it is our view-it is a view understood and respected for those reasons by the governments of the Association of South East Asian Nations-that it is not unreasonable, having regard to the state of the Australian economy and the demands on the Australian taxpayer, that we should make a charge covering about 40 per cent of the costs of the students' education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also the question of selection procedures. Before 1979, the criteria for entry were based mainly on the non-availability of courses in the home countries of overseas students. This sometimes led to students proposing to undertake courses of little relevance to their home countries. Since 1980, new private student criteria have enabled more students to be accepted from a wider group of countries. These criteria take into account the training capacity of Australia-that is, without displacing Australian students-and such other factors as academic ability of overseas students, the relevance and value of the proposed courses to students as well as to their home countries, and, of course, what courses are available in their home countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Opposition amendment, one would have to say that the level of need or poverty varies from one country to another. It would be most difficult to determine objectively whether needy students from one country deserve more special assistance than those from other countries. That is what the amendment implies. The matter, however, is more relevant in terms of foreign aid of various kinds rather than in terms of student charges. I have referred to the foreign aid reasons in our consideration. But in any case, under the existing legislation, under section 7 of the Overseas Students Charge Collection Act 1979 , special arrangements can be made for the discharge of liability in favour of an overseas student. It seems to me that this meets the Opposition's objections. These arrangements include an arrangement between the government of an overseas country and Australia under which that overseas country undertakes to pay the charge or the charge is met by Australia. Scholarships by a department or authority of the Commonwealth to assist an overseas student to undertake or continue his study are again quite a common device adopted in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons the Government does not accept the Opposition amendment and I commend the Bill as it stands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to delay the Committee, Mr Drummond , but I remind honourable members that, when the second reading debate took place, it was considered that there was a problem with the time, because we were waiting for a Government announcement about housing and, therefore, on that occasion I did not use all the time available to me. I want, briefly, to take up a number of matters with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee). I am delighted that he is here-unlike a number of his colleagues who do not see through the passage of their legislation. I am indebted to the Minister for having responded to a number of points which I made and which the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) made, but there are couple of small matters to which I should like the Minister to respond, either now or subsequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to us that very little information seems to be held by the Government in relation to the operation of this program. The Minister was kind enough to make available to the Opposition an official from his Department to discuss some of the aspects of the proposals and the development of the overseas student program over the last few years since the introduction of these charges. But it is clear that very little is known about the sorts of students who come here and about the overall effect of the impact of these new charges on the kinds of students who are coming here. The Minister has said that the numbers, except in relation to the South Pacific, have not declined. I understand that they have increased. That may well be so. But we do not seem to know very much about the socio-economic background of the students concerned. When the Minister spoke a few moments ago, I think that he said that the majority of the students came from relatively rich families. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many. Whether it is many, a substantial minority, or a majority, the point is that I should like to know on what the Minister's information is based and whether there has been any change in relation to the socio-economic background of the students as a result of the introduction of these charges. I do not know whether the Minister holds that information or whether that is a sort of seat-of-the-pants guess by him. If he knows it, I think that it would be useful for us, in considering these matters, if he would let us know. Indeed, I go so far as to say that it might not be a bad idea for the Government to produce some sort of paper to present to the chamber on the operation of this program and the sorts of changes which have taken place because I think that circumstances have changed substantially.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has explained that the Government said, when it introduced these charges, that it was trying to cope with the fact that most of the students-I think that 75 per cent was the figure used at the time-who came here to study remained here and did not, as was originally intended, return to their home country. As I have pointed out, as the honourable member for Swan has pointed out and as the Minister has confirmed, a very much greater proportion of the students now do return to their home countries and therefore in a sense a large part of the original justification for the introduction of the charges has been removed. That leaves the Government with only one other peg to hang its policy on, and that is the question of wanting to raise some revenue; that is, making the overseas students who, as the Minister rightly pointed out do not contribute to the taxes of this country, contribute to the cost of their education. I acknowledge that they make only a minority contribution but that was not the original justification for the scheme, although obviously the Government did mention it at the time. That has now really become the sole justification for these levies and, indeed, must be the single reason for increasing them at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point which is not clear at all is that whilst we know that in this year something like $12m will be collected as a result of the imposition of this charge, we do not know-at least I do not know; I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me-what the net figure is. We know that those students who are supported under, for instance, an Australian Development Assistance Bureau program or some other government sponsored program, do not pay the charge themselves. In the case of ADAB, it would pay the charge. There would be a transfer of funds to ADAB so that it could pay the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs the charge in respect of the student whom it supports. So, whilst the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs may well collect $12m this year , it is not clear how much of that money is a book entry coming from ADAB across to the Minister's Department and distorts the level of revenue which the Government is receiving. I know that the use of this mechanism makes our aid program look that much better but at the same time it distorts the other purpose of the Government's intention-that is, to show that it is receiving a healthy amount of revenue in respect of the cost of educating these overseas students. </PARA>
<PARA> Those matters are important. The point is-the Minister has made much of this- that if this is part of the aid program, if we are trying to make a contribution to the education of people particularly from developing countries in our region, then we need to know the sort of information which at the moment does not seem to be available. It could not be provided to us in our discussions last week with officials from the Department. It seems to me very important that we know the socio-economic background of the students who are having to pay these fees. Whilst it may be that, as the Minister has indicated, the numbers from South East Asia have not declined-in fact, they have gone up-maybe a different kind of student is coming here now and others who may have been able to come before the charges were imposed are now not able to do so. There is no suggestion that those people who cannot come now have educational opportunities available to them in their home countries for, amongst other reasons, the sorts of reasons which the honourable member for Swan mentioned-those relating to internal matters in countries such as Malaysia. If we are trying to provide educational opportunities for those people who otherwise would not have them, then it is important that we know a little more about the people who have been affected by the imposition of these charges. </PARA>
<PARA> I know it may not be possible for the Minister to respond to these matters now but I ask him to consider having his Department prepare a paper on the operation of the Overseas Student Program so that we are in a better position. It is not as if the Opposition is at absolute loggerheads with the Government on this question. It seems to me to be a question of defining the objectives of the program and really working out whether or not those objectives are being met. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter to which the Minister did not respond-I know it is one with which he has been involved over the last few months-is the problem relating to health care arrangements for overseas students. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) did not respond to that matter on Thursday evening. I know it is still a matter of very great concern to overseas students. I do not want to repeat what I said last Thursday but I ask the Minister to make some sort of statement, or respond to us in some way about those problems and what the Government is doing to sort out the confusion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the health care arrangements, I have had some correspondence with the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and I shall pass on the request of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) that as soon as possible the position be made public. My recollection is that the Minister has made a public statement but if he has not I will ask that he does so. I think the request of the honourable member for Fremantle is a reasonable one. This is one of those programs that cuts across many departments and which in many ways does not belong with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It involves largely a foreign policy objective, and in many ways it is a matter of education policy as well because one of the benefits-especially where some of the wealthier students go to private schools-is obviously felt by Australian educational institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The overriding objectives are stability of the area and a closer understanding between the countries of the area, including Australia. Within those objectives, we certainly do have evaluations. The honourable member is right in observing the shifts which have taken place in the purpose of this policy. They have been reflected in this debate. It ought to be possible to get him quite firm information on those net figures that he refers to, including the book entries, the actual level of revenue and Australian Development Assistance Bureau and other sponsorships. We also should be able to get a reasonably accurate socio- economic profile, though of course we do not interfere with the selection methods of private institutions when families are paying the way of the students . Our most intimate knowledge comes where there is government sponsorship by another government or by ourselves of a student who cannot pay his or her way and who has moved to undertake the courses. I would be delighted to speak to the various departments involved in this program and obtain a document with the objective of either tabling it or at least writing to the honourable member about it. </PARA>

The honourable member said that this was false, that he had introduced Miss Redgrave at a showing of her film but that he did not use the words I had quoted, further he could find no Press report on which I could have based my statement and therefore I had misrepresented him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other evening when debating the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission we covered a great deal of ground as to the future of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I have just a couple of points left that I would like to bring to the attention of the House. One of those points concerns the fact that the Dix report made it very clear that the ABC should in fact be in charge of its own transmitters. It would seem to me that this is one particular area that has been of some very great concern in recent years to the Commission. In fact, if we do little more than place those transmitting facilities under the control of the ABC we will be doing the Commission a great service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another point that came to light through the Dix Committee was the amount of Australian content that has been screened by the ABC. Over the years we have seen imposed on the commercial broadcasters around Australia quota systems, time systems and suggestions of expenditure systems to encourage the making of Australian programs. Indeed, I believe that the ABC should, along with the commercial organisations, have due regard to the manufacturing of Australian television programs and that if any imposition is put on the commercial television industry that same encouragement for the production of Australian programs should be given to the Commission as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point along those same lines is the fact that the ABC does not need to pay regard to certain censorship requirements that are made in respect of the commercial television industry. Therefore, the other thing I think we should be bringing into line in this regard is the point that any censorship classifications that apply to the commercial organisations should in fact apply to the ABC as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating the report of the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission which was presented in May of last year-that is, the report has been around for nearly a year. I want to make the point that this is a very unsatisfactory way for the Parliament to be dealing with a report such as the one before us. The Dix Committee report should have been debated very much earlier. The whole point of having a parliamentary debate on a report such as this is that the Government can be given some indication of the range of views which exist within the Parliament before it makes its formal response to the report. But we are now in the situation where the Government, having delayed for too long making its response to the report, must, I suspect, be very close to finalising its views about the recommendations of the Committee. So I suspect that this debate on the Dix Committee report will really not have any influence at all on the Government 's decision-making process in relation to its response. I think, therefore, that the value of a debate such as this will be diminished substantially. However, we have to be thankful for small mercies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just as we welcomed the setting up of the Dix Committee, just as we welcomed its report, whilst not agreeing with all of what was said, we do, of course, welcome this opportunity, brief as it is, late as it is, probably unproductive as it is in a sense, to respond to the report. What the Dix Committee really did was provide a fairly substantial criticism of the operation of the ABC. But regrettably the report was in short, a bit disappointing in terms of the sorts of remedies which it proposed for correcting the problems which, as I said, it correctly outlined in many cases. I should say that the Opposition has formally responded to the Dix Committee's report in a paper released earlier this month by Senator Button, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and the Opposition shadow Minister for Communications. I will refer very briefly to some aspects of the Australian Labor Party's response as enunciated by Senator Button. We were anxious that there be substantial debate about these questions. Of course, we were also keen to try to do what we could to encourage the Government to come forward with its formal response as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, we are conscious of the criticisms which the Dix Committee has made but we do not believe that the major focus should be on those criticisms. We believe that the opportunity should be taken to revitalise and strengthen the ABC because we recognise, as the Dix Committee does, that the ABC is a great national institution which really deserves fortification and continuing broad community support. There is a need to indicate the importance of the ABC because we basically believe that the ABC is of vital importance in articulating some notion of Australia's national identity. There are very few opportunities for that sort of process, that articulation, to occur in this country, divided as it is into six States which are often at odds with each other and which are led by Premiers who are often at odds with each other and, indeed, with the nation itself. Therefore, it is important for whatever vehicles there are at our disposal to continue to remind the Australian people of the importance of Australian nationhood and to articulate what that really means in the broadest possible way. That is why a great deal of our emphasis has been placed on the Parliament's coming up with a bipartisan statement about the role of the ABC, a statement with which we can all agree; that is, not a statement which the party which might be in government for the time being believes is convenient for it and advances its particular cause, but one which will be enduring and with which we can all agree, regardless of who is in government and of who happens to be running the ABC at any particular time.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the ABC has an immensely complex role. It has, at the one time, to be a quality broadcaster catering for specialised interests within the community and, at the same time, to compete for audiences in what one might call mass entertainment, but mass entertainment of the highest possible standard. Because of the complexity of that role and because of the importance of the ABC in articulating this sort of national purpose, it is important that the Parliament does agree to the proposal which has been put forward by the Australian Labor Party that there should be a statement from the Parliament which indicates, in a bipartisan way, the role of the ABC as seen by the representatives of the people in the Parliament. In the absence of that sort of bipartisan statement, in the absence of that sort of agreement, the ABC will always be vulnerable to political heavying of one kind or another, whether it is in relation to the stacking of the Commission with tame friends of whichever happens to be the party in office, whether it is in relation to some of the staff appointments within the ABC, or whether it is just the haranguing by politicians of the ABC, accusing it of all kinds of bias which, when it boils down to it, is accusing it of not always agreeing with whatever particular prejudices the critic happens to possess. </PARA>
<PARA> We need only to go back to 1975 when the current Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) decided to appoint himself as the then Opposition's critic-a very vocal and damaging critic-of the ABC. At that time he accused the ABC of all kinds of bias and misconduct which were totally baseless but were also very damaging for its organisation. Indeed, what he did to the ABC at that time, and what the Government has subsequently done, has really weakened substantially the organisation. The ABC consists of very creative people who need sufficient freedom to pursue their talents and to provide the best broadcasting available. That sort of baseless criticism, and indeed the response from some of the weaker administrators of the ABC, has not helped it to be a strong and vital organisation in recent times. That is why it is important that we sort out in a bipartisan way the role of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> On a related matter, we must ensure that whoever is running the ABC enjoys, as far as can be established, the support of the Parliament as a whole. That is why we have proposed that, in relation to a seven-man Commission, the appointees to that Commission should be appointed on the recommendation of a parliamentary committee. The parliamentary committee would comprise members of the Government and the Opposition. The Government would have the majority of members and, in a sense, of course, if it were determined to, it could use its members on that committee to get its appointees. But we believe that there would be a presumption on the Minister who would be receiving the recommendation and, in effect, making the appointment that he would not use the brute force of numbers on that committee to get his way. We would call for applications for members of the Commission and have those applications vetted in a public way by the committee. In that way, we believe we would be more likely to get people of talent, people with relevant experience and skills and people who are likely to enjoy the confidence of both sides of Parliament, which can only strengthen the ABC and the way in which it goes about its task.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission thus appointed would be responsible for making senior staff appointments, including that of the general manager or director-general, whatever the title is. This apparently seems to be one of the issues on which the Government is stymied at the moment. It cannot make up its mind, particularly in relation to the retirement of Sir Talbot Duckmanton, whether it should make the appointment or whether the Commission should make the appointment. Our view is that the appointment is not one which ought to be made on political grounds; rather it is one which should be made on quite neutral grounds-a vitally important appointment which should enjoy wide community support. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention very quickly a matter which I took up with the Dix Committee in my submission to it. It relates to the management of the ABC in the various States. I return to the point I made initially of the national importance of the ABC in articulating a national identity, a national consciousness. What has happened in the administration of the ABC at the State level is that in far too many cases the State management has taken a far too parochial view of its role and has overlooked and downplayed the national objectives and the necessary national outlook of the ABC. In Western Australia, we had the example where the ABC did something with which the former Premier, Sir Charles Court, disagreed. He had the gall to carpet the State manager of the ABC and abuse him for some story or program which the ABC had run and with which the Premier had disagreed. That was a totally inappropriate action for a Premier to take but it was an action which he felt quite free to take because of the operation of the State management at the time. Happily, the State manager who was then in office has now departed; but it does raise a very serious question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dix Committee's recommendations in relation to State management do not necessarily overcome the problem. What it proposed in relation to each of the functions of the ABC was that the people in charge of those functions at the State level should be responsible to national heads of those functions and not to a State manager-not that, in many respects, they are at the moment. But that does not necessarily overcome the problem unless arrangements are made for a regular and compulsory turnover of the people heading those functions at the State level. I think it is very important that the ABC be organised in such a way that that matter can be taken up; that whoever happens to occupy the important positions which influence content and programming at the State level ought to be rotated in some way so that he does not become too parochial. That is not to say that there is not a very important role for the State management of the ABC to convey to the organisation nationally the interests and the concerns of the local community. Of course that is important; that goes without saying. But it must not override the national purpose of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter that I want to refer to briefly. The Dix Committee indicated that it was of the view that there should be an increase in activity by the ABC in relation to the employment of Aboriginal people. I concur absolutely with that view but I think the Dix Committee was far too timid in the recommendations that it made in that regard. The point is that the ABC does represent a vehicle through which Aboriginal people can enjoy a much higher profile than they do at the present. The most visible Aboriginals in our community are those political activists who get involved very promptly in campaigns for land rights or whatever other aspects of the Aboriginal campaign might be pursued at any time. That is the type of Aboriginal of which people are particularly aware. The other type of which people are conscious is that minority-but nevertheless substantial part of the Aboriginal community-which is smitten by urban poverty. It seems to me that a huge number of Aboriginal people in the community are doing extraordinarily important things extraordinarily well . They are the sorts of people who must be given a much higher profile in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC has here a very important role; it is that of actively seeking and recruiting Aboriginals to go before the television cameras so that people can see their artistry and other abilities. An increasing number of our Aboriginal artists, many of whom are proceeding under very great difficulties, could be very fruitfully employed by the ABC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the Government for bringing on this debate on the report of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission before announcing its own response to it. With this elegant and persuasive report from Mr Dix and his committee, we reach a milestone in the broadcasting and cultural history of Australia. The Parliament has before it the reactions of all interested parties, including the ABC. I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) that it is up to us to proceed to achieve as much bipartisan agreement as possible. The quality of our response to this historic opportunity will have a profound effect on the enrichment of Australia's intellectual, cultural and recreational life in the decades ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before proceeding, I pay tribute to the present General Manager of the ABC, Sir Talbot Duckmanton, who has announced his intention to retire later this year. He has had the unenviable task of managing for 17 years an almost unmanageable organisation. Indeed, the nature and extent of the organisational and legal constraints on the ABC management have only now become clear under the searching analysis of the Dix inquiry. Despite those difficulties, Sir Talbot, together with other talented people, has led an organisation that is shown by the Dix Committee's surveys to be highly regarded by a very broad section of the Australian community. I hope that Sir Talbot will carry into his retirement the appreciation and best wishes of all honourable members of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> In the limited time available, I will touch on three matters: Firstly, the overall shape of the proposed organisation; secondly, the question of commercial sponsorship; and, thirdly, the proposals for the administration of music. In regard to the overall structure of the organisation, there is always a danger, when one has a carefully argued and internally consistent report, such as the Dix report, that the really critical recommendations-those determining the capacity of the organisation to meet its public responsibilities-will be obscured in the welter of conflicting arguments put forward by various interest groups. Therefore, the Government's first responsibility is to carry out the principal organisational changes recommended by the Committee. It is not important to argue over the name-which is perhaps best left as it is-but it is important to establish a board of directors as recommended by the Dix committee, and to give to it the powers and financial wherewithal to get on with the job. It is also important to separate the managerial and representative functions. Therefore I support the establishment of the Broadcasting Consultative Council as a separate body. I am in strong disagreement with the views expressed in the statement by the present commissioners rejecting this separation of functions under a common chairmanship. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Commission is effective neither as a representative body nor a policy body. Its defensive response to the Dix proposals makes it clear that it does not appreciate its organisational shortcomings. I do not reflect in any way on the personal capacities of the commissioners, rather on the structure, which makes them neither fish nor fowl, neither managerial nor representative, but with a greater capacity to interfere than to initiate, and therefore disappointing to the management, the staff and the customers. Thus, I believe that the Government should adopt the carefully constructed proposals of the Dix Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> However, let me take issue with one aspect of the organisational recommendations. While agreeing with the Committee's proposal to have the directors appointed by the Government, I disagree with the proposal to allow the directors to appoint the Director-General. In theory, this system seems to ensure a greater independence for the ABC. The honourable member for Fremantle has argued that point. In practice, I believe that the best way to ensure the appointment of Directors-General of the highest calibre and acknowledged independence is to make it absolutely clear that the responsibility lies with the Government to make a good appointment. Just as the appointment of a Governor -General is a test of the quality of a government's advice to the monarch, so too should the choice of a Director-General of the ABC be a test of the Government's capacity and willingness to adopt a bipartisan approach on a matter of great national importance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Director-General is the most important person in the proposed organisation, more important as an individual than the Chairman or any of the directors. It will be his or her intellectual stature, managerial capacity and leadership qualities that will shape the philosophy and style of the ABC. It is unfair and unwise to allow such a critical appointment to be left with a board that is not elected and may well have been appointed by a previous government. Who then would be held responsible for an unsatisfactory appointment? No, the buck must stop with Government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of commercial sponsorship, let me say that the Dix Committee has recommended allowing the ABC to accept what it called corporate underwriting under strict guidelines. The present Commission welcomes this proposal and even suggests that the guidelines should not be as strict as recommended by the Committee. I am totally opposed to corporate underwriting. It is not central to the Dix Committee recommendations. Indeed, the expected proceeds are so small that one wonders why it is worth risking some of the possible consequences for such a limited return. I oppose corporate underwriting because, firstly and most importantly, it provides a means for governments to evade their responsibility to finance a national broadcasting organisation on an adequate basis. Increasing pressure can be put on the directors to find more and more money from other sources. The directors' job is to achieve excellence in broadcasting, not to plague corporations for funds in competition with all the other bodies who are obliged to do so. There is a difference, for example, between the Australian Opera, which appeals to a narrower audience, and the ABC, which serves virtually everyone. If we want an independent national broadcaster, we must face up to paying for it. Once again, the responsibility must be crystal clear. It must rest with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is already a heavy drain on the finite pool of corporate funds available for the kinds of purposes envisaged by the Committee. The Australian Opera, for example, has managed to tap corporate sources of finance with some effect, but its task is already difficult enough without competition from the ABC. Thirdly, whatever the initial guidelines for corporate underwriting, there will be pressures to extend it. I believe that it would have a corrupting influence within the ABC. There is a danger of progressive encroachment occurring on the independence of program producers. One of the reasons for having a national broadcasting organisation is to provide an environment for creative effort that is not subject to the commercial pressures one accepts in the private sector of broadcasting. There is also a danger that producers with greater capacity to attract sponsors but with inferior creative talents might be favoured by management in the allocation of resources and air space. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, and finally, I object to the blurring of the distinction between the market sector of paid advertising and the taxpayer-supported availability of what is essentially advertising space, even if it is initially of a somewhat limited nature. Eventually, one runs the risk of taxpayers' funds being used to provide at least a proportion of the private benefit derived by the sponsor. For those four reasons, I urge the Government not to accept the corporate underwriting proposal. I stress that it is in no way critical to the effectiveness of the Dix recommendations. Not implemented, it is a side issue. Implemented, it could be the precursor of a dangerous slide in the professional standards of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the Music Australia proposal. Many people, including the ABC 's Music Advisory Committee, have expressed alarm at the ultimate direction suggested by the Dix Committee for the concert and music activities of the ABC; that is, the eventual transfer of the symphony orchestras to the individual States. They quite rightly worry about the possible dismantling of a national asset, albeit one that is not receiving the kind of attention it should within the present ABC structure. I can understand their worries about the fate of the respective orchestras under these proposals, and also their concern that the organisation of concert tours Australia-wide would become very much more difficult if the orchestras were under individual State control. However, I would urge those holding these views not to oppose the essential first step, and indeed the only definite step recommended by Dix, that is, the formation of an organisational entity to be called Music Australia, under a managing director reporting separately to the Board of the ABC and not under the control of the Director-General. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me perfectly logical to separate the broadcasting and music organisations, so that each can be given its proper emphasis. An outstanding person can be appointed to head each function. Music Australia can then develop its strength unfettered by a broadcasting organisation struggling to rebuild its standing and morale, yet sheltered by its association with the organisation that gave it birth. Then let events follow their course. Total separation from the ABC could be a future option if that seemed wise; transfer of the orchestras perhaps a distant yet unlikely option. </PARA>
<PARA> So I ask those friends of the orchestras and of the tradition of music in the ABC to not, like the present commissioners, reject a thoroughly sensible and desirable reorganisation because of fears of some vague, down-the-line possibilities. I say to the Government: Press ahead with the formation of Music Australia within the ABC framework, let it develop and prosper, but take no further steps without a full public inquiry into music as opposed to broadcasting. There are other matters on which I would like to comment, but in the time available I have had to be selective. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, may I urge the Government to invest this historic opportunity with the distinction it deserves. Not since the foundation of public broadcasting in Australia has there been such a moment of decision for this unique national institution. The recent changes to the Broadcasting and Television Act, important as they were, were nonetheless limited to providing a framework for corporate decision-making in broadcasting. In reshaping the ABC the Government is dealing with an organisation for which it has the sole responsibility. It must decide for the whole nation, not just sections of it. It must decide in such a way that in 30 or even 50 years people will look back and say: 'That was a rebirth of national broadcasting and of music in Australia, a transformation of which both sides of this House and this Parliament can be proud.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes this debate on the report of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. We believe that the ABC should be politically and financially independent, funded from the public purse and under the scrutiny of a permanent parliamentary watchdog committee. We also believe that the name 'Australian Broadcasting Commission' is synonymous with 50 years of distinguished service to the nation and we would be most unenthusiastic about the proposition to change the name of this instrumentality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Dix Committee report, with its 273 recommendations, is an extremely comprehensive one. It is five volumes in all. It is not only a sound diagnosis of the problems affecting the Australian Broadcasting Commission but also a good basis for the revitalisation of this once great instrumentality. The organisation has, in my view, fallen from its previously exalted standing and status. It has lost some of its self-esteem. There has been the ungainly spectacle of frequent industrial disputes with blackouts of both radio and television. It has previously been innovative, imaginative, enterprising and even inspiring. However, in recent times, sensing the vindictiveness of some sections of this Government, smarting under the Fraser Government Budget cuts and writhing under the corporate carping criticism of some Government members- particularly National Country Party members-the ABC has become sullen and resentful, intimidated and inhibited and in many ways unfulfilled, having regard to its great potential. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent of public interest in the ABC has been indicated by the enormous response to the call for submissions. That over 2,220 written comments were received from members of the public, from ABC staff as well as from unions, from the ABC itself and from political and community organisations, is an indication of that widespread interest. That 830 individuals and organisations gave evidence recorded in 5,500 pages of transcript represents a warm community response. In the general conclusions of the report there is this significant statement:</PARA>
<PARA> The ABC has become slow moving, overgrown, complacent, and uncertain of the direction in which it is heading despite the efforts of many talented and dedicated people who work for it. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the 20 questions asked was:</PARA>
<PARA> Should the ABC get more public money?</PARA>
<PARA>The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . financial problems . . . have gripped . . . public imagination and widespread concern was expressed . . . about the inadequacy of resources available to the ABC. There is no question that money and staff shortages have at times had a detrimental effect on virtually all areas of the ABC in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the unstable budgetary situation has contributed a great deal to the decline in the standard of performance of this organisation. There can be nothing more important in such a great federation as Australia than to sustain a truly national media and cultural organisation such as the ABC. Adequate government funding is basic to this objective. By this process all Australians can have the benefit of news, entertainment and exposure to cultural experience regardless of where they live and notwithstanding regional profit and loss factors involved in the delivery of such a service. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course commercial broadcasting, both radio and television, can certainly not be discounted and must be acknowledged as an effective co-partner in fulfilling this national obligation. The ABC must be afforded the opportunity to maintain its dignity as an equal partner with the commercial media. There must be no concession which would have the effect of relegating the ABC to catering for cultural minorities while hiving off mass broadcasting as the exclusive prerogative of the private sector. The ABC will have to unburden itself of its low audience acceptance mentality, which has eroded staff morale and undermined public condifence. This instrumentality must see itself as wearing many clothes. It must wear the garb of a quality broadcaster with an orientation to mass audience appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button, the shadow Minister for Communications, said in his publication 'The ABC After Dix':</PARA>
<PARA> The true role of the ABC must be truly comprehensive-it is about serving specialised interests, at a high standard, and competing for audiences in 'mass' entertainment of the highest quality. </PARA>
<PARA>Equally important is the fact that Senator Button has committed a future Labor government to the objective of securing parliamentary endorsement for a definitive statement, clearly identifying such a role for the ABC. While the Dix Committee has proposed that the ABC statutory body should be replaced by a national broadcasting organisation, my Party would prefer to retain the title ' Australian Broadcasting Commission', as I previously mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to the proposal about the Board. We accept that a board of seven people should be drawn from areas of appropriate expertise. We are not at variance with this proposal. Areas of speciality should include broadcasting and communications and cultural, technical, financial and managerial skills and expertise of that type. I want to say a few words with respect to the proposal to establish a national broadcasting consultative council. The Dix report proposes that such a council should be established and that it should be made up of 20 members. The Opposition takes the view that that would be an over- competitive arrangement and that it would even prove to be troublesome and negative. We believe that it would be an unwieldy organisation. As an alternative, we propose that commissioners should be assisted to maintain public contact with the community at large rather than have to depend on an intermediate consultative or advisory committee. Our alternative proposal includes the suggestion that we should provide each commissioner with professional assistance independent of management so that that professional assistance could be deployed in a special area of interest which the commissioner would seek to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition accepts the concept that there should be an advisory secretariat . The Opposition believes it should report, however, not to the Chairman but to the Commission as a whole. It should not be allowed to assume dominative proportions nor should it assume a subordinative role to the Director-General, forever toeing the line and distinguished more by sycophant acquiescence than positive contributions. The Opposition would want that secretariat to be made up of non-career members of the Commission staff with allegiance to the Commission rather than to the Chairman of the Commission or the Director-General. The secretariat should be limited to about 12 members, with appointments being made on a dual basis by the Commission itself and each commissioner making one nomination to the secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to refer to the appointment of commissioners. Partisan appointments to the Australian Broadcasting Commission under successive governments have been criticised over the years. In an attempt to redress the practice of partisan appointments my party proposes that a parliamentary committee, a watchdog committee, be given the task of calling applications and making recommendations for appointments to the Minister. By this process the Minister of the day would ensure that his nomination would be submitted and supported, no doubt, by government members who would comprise the committee majority. This process would cause the Minister to refrain from making a nomination on purely political grounds. I believe the process would afford an opportunity to the Opposition to question the nominee and thus, in all likelihood, to concur with an appropriate nomination. It would be a process of sorting out unsuitable nominations. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the question of management and staff. The entire question of management and staff is inseparably interlocked. Often today's management is little more than the junior appointees of yesteryear who have served time in the interim. The unrelenting transmission of status quo thinking is often characteristic of large corporations-both public and private. The enterprising are often the vulnerable. This produces a climate unconducive to dissent, initiative, individualism and creativity. They are the qualities that are so important to replenish ABC vitality. The atmosphere of mutuality, a kind of corporate spirit, pervades the organisation with its old boy network and obligation to uphold the system at all costs. So far as the appointment of the General Manager is concerned, the recommendation of the Committee that the board rather than the Government should appoint the Director-General has the support of the Opposition. In my view it would be unwise for the Government to flout this good advice. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G7">Mr LES JOHNSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The seven-year term for the ABC Board proposed by the Dix Committee should be supported on the basis that a seven-year unrenewable appointment would break the old-boy network syndrome and provide for a periodic infusion of new blood. This may produce some unavoidable casualties, including people who are innovators and are creative. However, there is no shortage of skilled personnel and the authority can engage in body-snatching, if you like, for competitors both in and out of Australia and from both the public and private sector. By this process the top 30 positions could be the pick of the industry, cross fertilised into kindred interests and organisations. The ABC has a great deal to benefit from this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the matter of funding, the Opposition accepts unequivocally the recommendation that the greater part of the ABC budget should come from parliamentary appropriation and that licence fees should not be reintroduced. We reject proposals for commercialisation of the ABC, including corporate underwriting. We would not want to see the independence of the ABC threatened in any way by the need to consider the attitude of sponsors. Journalists and program makers should not have to look over their shoulders, inhibited by the prospects of offending a sponsor. To have one broadcaster free of such handicaps is little enough to ask, and therein lies the main virtue of Australia's dual system-the system of private participators on the one hand and a public participator on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Already enough scope exists for advertising. Everything the ABC does is paid for and the only fair and equitable way financially to sustain the organisation is by the proceeds of uniform taxation. In any case, high costs in advertising exclude small businesses and even though it is said that ABC viewers constitute a Mercedes market, if that is true there might also be a group-I think there is a large group-which prefers the ABC because it does not have advertisements. Although only $5m a year out of the Budget of $250m is to be raised, governments would always be under pressure to lift the amount. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other matters that I will not have time to talk about. I would have liked to talk about the ABC being the main innovator and initiator in respect of translator and transmitter services. It takes the initiative, both for itself and for the private sector. I certainly would have liked to talk about the need to retain the ABC news service. There is a proposal to draw on the facilities of other news services. The ABC could ultimately lose its independent news service. In this respect, the Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA> In these times of financial restraint and staff ceilings, the ABC could be forced to meet a reduction in resources by cutting back on its own news gathering activities which ultimately could result in only one source of news in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I regard these proposals as most significant. I believe that the most important thing is to ensure that the independence of the ABC is preserved. As far as news services are concerned, as far as dependence on sponsors is concerned, to resort to any of the recommendations to any degree would, in my view and in the view of the Opposition, prove in the end to be a retrograde step. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate tonight in the debate on the review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, a review which I believe was most comprehensive and undertaken most painstakingly by Mr Alex Dix, Alex Castles, Pat Lovell and Brian Sweeney. The Committee was established in 1979 by Mr Staley when he was Minister for Communications. That was at a time when, as chairman of the back bench committee on communications, I was involved in this area. At that time there was considerable discussion about the need for such a review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ABC, to my knowledge, had not been subjected to such an independent, impartial and professional review in its 50 years of existence. Indeed, some concern was expressed by the Government, and I believe also by the Opposition, about the efficiency of the Commission and the efficacy of some of its procedures and administrative processes. It was for these reasons and others that the Committee of Review was established. I have found a perusal of the summary report and also sections of the major report most interesting. It is interesting to note that the ABC and the Sydney Harbour Bridge are both 50 years old this year. I think that the ABC has come in for considerable criticism and examination, much more so than the Sydney Harbour Bridge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bridge perhaps is in better shape, although I notice that the New South Wales Labor Premier will soon have to increase the tolls to cover the cost of maintaining the bridge. The Committee was not at all reticent in being very frank about its findings of what might be called the approaching senility, or perhaps more unkindly the self-perpetuating inertia, which is seen in some sectors of the ABC. If listeners doubt that, I read from certain sections of the summary report, in which the Committee stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ABC is now nearly fifty years old, and in the last decade its record has faltered. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It has stood on its dignity and independence when pressing priorities cried out for attention. It has tried to maintain an idea of Australian society after that idea has undergone change. Its energies have been sapped by often bitter industrial conflict. It has not only slipped from the forefront of change but threatens to be eclipsed by it. The ABC has become slow moving, overgrown, complacent, and uncertain of the directon in which it is heading despite the efforts of many talented and dedicated people who work for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dix Committee, having said that, went on to examine some of the specific areas in which it saw problems. It first of all questioned some of the assumptions. I think we heard mention of one of those tonight when the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), who spoke before me in this debate, said that the ABC catered for a Mercedes market. He was referring to the widely held view that the ABC is elitist and that it provides only programs which are readily accepted by minority groups within the community. The Dix report has pointed out that this is not the case. In fact, only 7 per cent of the community does not at some stage tune in to the ABC. Indeed, 93 per cent turn to it selectively for programs, particularly those on current affairs and news. The normal indication of popularity used by the television industry, the ratings system, does not take into account the frequency with which people turn to a particular radio or television medium. On that basis the ABC does provide a dominance of quality programs, particularly news and information programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee went on to examine some areas in which it believed the performance of the ABC had declined. I am particularly interested and gratified to see that the first-mentioned area is the ABC's performance in relation to non -metropolitan audiences. That is the first of the committee's findings. It points out that there are inadequacies in the service to country and outback people. I will come back to that in a few minutes. The second point the Committee made was that the ABC, in broadcasting for the whole Australian community, fails to reflect certain realities of Australian society, particularly contemporary Australian society, when it does not adequately fulfil the needs of non-Anglo-Saxon Australians and Aboriginal Australians. The Committee believes that the ABC's performance may have declined in that it has been over-emphasising overseas programs, particularly British popular programs, and that this may have been at the expense of Australian-produced programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point the Committee made is again one that interests me. The Committee believes that the ABC has failed to use effectively its decentralised resources in the States and the regions and thus has not as adequately as it may have reflected the interests, characteristics and concerns of the whole country, with particular reference to those who live outside the major metropolitan complexes. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I should return to the point of the adequacy of the ABC broadcasting in non-metropolitan areas. I was interested in a submission from the Northern Territory Government which drew attention to the narrow range of national radio and television services available in the Territory and the need, with the Territory's economic and political development towards separate statehood, for a similar situation to be enjoyed by the Territory as is enjoyed by the other States. The Territory's submission put the highest priority in planning for the ABC's development on this matter. The Dix Committee again drew attention to this . It recommended strongly that a second regional network be developed. There would be many people in country Australia who would agree wholeheartedly with that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommended that the high quality frequency modulation stereo services be extended to country areas. It did not suggest by any means that the extension of FM stereo services to rural areas should in any way diminish the priority attached to the establishment of a second regional network and the concept of localism or regionalism within the ABC. But there should not be any reason why country listeners and viewers should be denied the opportunity of enjoying some of the better quality high fidelity broadcasts that are available to their metropolitan counterparts who enjoy ready access to high quality live concerts, jazz programs, folk programs, drama and whatever. I support the Committee wholeheartedly on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> On the issue of decentralisation, the Committee suggested that the States and regions should have a firmer place in the ABC organisation and in its broadcast output. I point out that the regional offices of the ABC vary widely in their facilities and staffing. For example, it is interesting to note that the ABC station in my area-2CR Orange-has five staff to service a population of 260,000, which is approximatley 58,000 people per staff member. By comparison, other centres with an ABC regional station and office are much better off. For example , Albury has one staff member per 36,000 people; Tamworth has one staff member per 32,000 people; Toowoomba has one staff member per 36,000 people; Broken Hill has one staff member per 10,000 people; and Cairns has one staff member per 13, 000 people. Darwin has one staff member per 2,000 listening audience. Obviously special circumstances apply in Darwin. Nevertheless, at present it would seem that the office in Orange is one of the more disadvantaged as far as staffing is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make some comments on the most controversial aspect of the Committee's report, which relates to corporate underwriting or the general principle of whether the ABC should accept advertising in some form. The Opposition and other groups are firmly opposed to this concept, although I think there has been quite a bit of confusion as to what the concept would involve. It would not mean that advertising would interrupt programs, as it currently does on commercial television and radio. A process of sponsorship would simply mean credits at the beginning or the end of a program. That may be a pointer for the commercial television industry because most viewers, I believe, are frustrated and disenchanted with the frequent interruptions that occur during television programs, often with a repeat of the advertisement that people have seen only a few minutes earlier. The commercial television industry, which has opposed the idea of corporate sponsorship or underwriting for the ABC, may well look to its own area and may well find that its ratings go up if it does not have continual interruptions to its programs, with slots of commercials and advertising segments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has pointed out that any income from corporate sponsorship or underwriting should not be offset against the ABC's parliamentary appropriation. I would agree with that in principle. Nevertheless, that would be affected by the amount of revenue that the ABC could gain by entering into corporate sponsorship. I believe that many furphies have been raised over this issue as proposed, accepting the fact that the Committee has recommended very strongly that there be strict guidelines and that clear-cut principles be followed. The idea of corporate sponsorship is not as horrific as has been portrayed by the Opposition and by other groups, such as Friends of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dix Committee paid some attention, albeit briefly, to the concept of the televising of parliamentary proceedings. We know, of course, that the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings is required under legislation and that it must be carried out by the ABC. No such legislation is applicable to the televising of parliamentary proceedings. I refer the House to the report of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, which was brought down in 1974. Incidentally, that report has not yet been debated in either this chamber or the upper House. That Committee looked very carefully at the pros and cons of televising a portion of the proceedings of Federal Parliament. It is interesting to note that 80 per cent of the submissions received on that subject were generally in favour of the televising of proceedings. The frequency of the arguments that were brought forward with the submissions were as follows: Firstly, that the public should have the right to know more about the day-to-day business of parliament and be able to have a better understanding of parliamentary procedures. Secondly, that the televising of the proceedings should reduce the communications gap between parliament and the people, enable people to participate more directly in the political process and also eliminate possible selectivity in the media. We have seen for so long that what happens in this place is portrayed to the public, except through direct radio broadcasts, through the eyes of commentators and journalists. That is one of the reasons why the televising of parliamentary proceedings was introduced in Canada. The Speaker of the Canadian Senate, Madame Lapointe, said:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the most effective arguments heard in Canada from televising Parliament' s business was that the time had come to take Parliament to the people. Far too long its debates and crises had been filtered through the mouths and eyes of others. Not all those others were impartial, detached or objective observers. </PARA>
<PARA>I can assure the House that the televising of parliamentary proceedings in Canada has been extremely successful. It has been introduced into the United States. Some 20 countries now televise in some form a portion of their parliamentary proceedings. I feel the Dix Committee should have addressed itself a little more energetically to that question. In conclusion, I believe the Committee has conducted a very useful review. I congratulate the members of the Committee for their most comprehensive and professional review. I recommend to the Government those recommendations from the Committee that apply particularly to non-metropolitan viewers and listeners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission-the Dix Committee -is a very good and comprehensive report. The report in front of us tonight, which is the main report, constitutes nearly 1,000 pages. It has 273 recommendations. It has probably been one of the most comprehensive reports to the Parliament on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. However, I might say at the beginning that one wonders about some of the recommendations as various newspapers reports during the inquiry had Mr Dix going to the Government and asking whether, in fact, certain recommendations the Committee wished to bring down would be acceptable to the Government and if they were unacceptable they were not pursued .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only way in which the Australian Broadcasting Commission will have an effective overall restructure, if that is required, is by a complete independent inquiry. I do not believe that the Committee did itself justice in that regard. I do not believe that an independent inquiry into a subject that is as comprehensive as this should be seen to be evaluating the Government's attitudes on particular issues. The Committee would have had awful egg on its face had there been a change of government and attitudes. That criticism of the Committee I would like to put at the beginning of my speech, as I think that it has marred several recommendations, not least of all the corporate sponsorship recommendations, and while it was also recommended by the ABC, in its submission -which completely astounds me-one would have thought that such a recommendation from the Committee would obviously have been approved by a conservative government. </PARA>
<PARA> But what would that recommendation have been if we had had a federal Labor government? Would we have seen the reverse situation occur? Questions such as this must arise, if we are to believe Press reports-which I believe are accurate -that on occasions the Dix Committee sounded out the Government on some of the possible recommendations and thoughts that it had throughout the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, first things first: Perhaps I may make a few points in regard to some of the recommendations. The recommendation of changing the name from the Australian Broacasting Commission to the National Broadcasting Organisation I find a little peculiar. I do not really see any reason. No good reason is put forward by the Committee for that recommendation, and therefore I reject it. I think that 50 years of broadcasting under the name of ABC is enough reason in itself to keep that name. Therefore, I sincerely hope that we have an ABC-that is, the Australian Broadcasting Commission-for a long time to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The operation and structure of management are possibly one of the biggest areas in this report and one of the most comprehensive recommendations-and controversial. The Committee has recommended a three-tiered management, of a board of directors-which is now the Commission-a consultative council of about 20 members, and State and regional committees. I believe that the set of proposals put forward by the Committee is a little too cumbersome. I do not think that we should be increasing management; if anything, we should be decreasing it. The problems in the program areas will not be solved by an increase of committees and bureaucracy. However, no matter what set of proposals we finish up with-and I am not wedded to any particular proposal-the Commission and commissioners should be backed up by a secretariat. This is one point that has become increasingly clear in debate on these recommendations outside Parliament. An independent secretariat of a high professional ability in the broadcasting industry would be a great strength behind the Commission. Perhaps I may say at this point that the directors or commissioners should know the industry, whether or not they be business people, and they should be people who have experience in the industry. That is a very important part of the future of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the ABC in its response to the Dix recommendations that it needs an upgrading of the present committees with advice coming through to the Commission and to the secretariat. As one who spent 16 years in the industry, to my mind the recommendation that the consultative council and the committees should preview Australian Broadcasting Commission programs in pilot form and productions from other sources before purchase is ludicrous. The ABC used the word 'impractical'. However, I should have thought that it would have been a rather nice way of putting it. I just do not think that it is a viable proposition in any way, shape or form. In my experience in the industry, the more people involved in previewing and reviewing particular programs, the worse the final result usually finishes up. </PARA>
<PARA> In the entertainment and broadcasting industry, which is what the ABC is in, one usually finds many cooks who like to have a finger in the pie. Unfortunately not all of them really know what they are talking about. The whole object in the entertainment and broadcasting industry, as the commercial people have found out , is to get good people, and really one good person is worth a thousand others who really do not know about the industry. If we build ourselves sets of committees and councils involving several hundred people, many of those people will not be expert in the industry, and many of those people will have a very narrow sectional interest. Generally speaking, this will not add a great deal to the ABC's genuine output and quality of output in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> Appointments to the Commission have always been a bone of contention with many people considering that political appointments were being made by successive governments to the detriment of the Commission. Obviously, the method of appointment must be looked at, and this is where I disagree with the Committee. An alternative method must be found. I think that the only solution is a joint parliamentary committee, possibly one emanating from the House of Representatives. My thoughts in this matter are that there should be six members of the Committee-three from the Government and three from the Opposition, with the chairman, who would be a Government member, having a casting as well as a deliberative vote. However, this Committee should not hold public inquiries. It should operate more or less like the existing House of Representatives committees such as the Standing Committee on Expenditure and the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts, by which subjects are investigated and recommendations are then reported to the Parliament. It is a lot to ask a person to nominate for a job as a commissioner or to take a post on the board of directors and then put him or her through the grill of a public hearing, at which some people, including members of this Parliament, are likely to grandstand in order to score a few political points. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporate sponsorship area is the one that is probably the most controversial and, as I said earlier, I am surprised that the ABC has in fact recommended it in its submission to the inquiry. The recommendation is rejected by me on the grounds that it must impair the impartiality of the Commission. This is where I agree with one member, at least, from the Government side-the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). While we may have plain sailing for a few years, it must be evident to everyone that somewhere along the track the ABC must be compromised. If the ABC is terribly successful in attracting corporate sponsorship-and it may be; there may be $20m or $30m coming into the bickie tin-somewhere along the track a government, of no matter what political persuasion, will be seriously tempted, in a tight budgetary situation, to say: ' Well, there is only so much cake available and we need that $20m or $30m to go into some other area, such as pensions, and, because the ABC estimates that it will receive that money from corporate sponsorship this year, we shall lop that same amount off the normal appropriation funds for the ABC.' That must happen. It is just a matter of practical application, and I think that we are kidding ourselves, the Committee members were kidding themselves, and the ABC, too, if we all think that that will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thought that comes to mind in the corporate sponsorship recommendation is the possibility that the ABC may find itself compromised in the program context. Again, we have seen that the ABC will bring corporate sponsorship only into areas of non-political shows, such as orchestral tours and musical tours, operatic tours or something of that ilk. However, there is raised the possibility again that, if particular companies are pouring a lot of money into an orchestral tour, they may well say to the ABC: 'Look, we will pour that money and more into next year's tour so that it will be bigger and better than ever. However, we would like a favour in another area.' There seems to be a simplistic view that corporate sponsorship and the sponsors thereof can influence only the area in which they are sponsoring. Of course, that is not true. Because someone is sponsoring one area, that does not mean that the screws cannot be put on in another area, and I believe that the ABC will rue the day when it recommended corporate sponsorship to be a part of the ABC in the future. I reject that recommendation of the Committee and I sincerely hope that the Government does not act in kind, because if any government is going to compromise the ABC, it will be this particular Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, many other aspects of this report that one could mention, such as programs. There is an excellent comprehensive chapter on programs, but that will obviously have to wait for another speech. The recommendation for a second radio network is fully supported. On industrial relations, I believe that cutting the ties with the Public Service Board is a very good idea, and I fully support that recommendation. In fact, I would be monitoring that over a number of years as an attempt to loosen up the public servant and bureaucratic ties. I think that the ABC must function in a broadcasting and entertainment industry rather than in a Public Service atmosphere. I seek leave, Mr Deputy Speaker, to incorporate in Hansard a section from page 645 of the main report, paragraph 22. 196, which succinctly puts my thoughts and the Committee's thoughts on the industrial relations area. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> While linkages between ABC and Public Service pay groups have been established for a great many ABC staff categories, we understand that some linkages are, at best, tenuous. Our industrial relations consultants have provided a detailed breakdown of ABC jobs showing their Public Service alignment. However, they point out that 'this breakdown does not clearly indicate functions', concluding that jobs such as those of Sound Effects staff and Property, Set and Accessory Makers are more closely related to program than to clerical duties, or contain strong artistic components not recognised in a straight-forward linkage with physical trades. Taking into account these inadequacies of categorisation they have concluded that approximately 30 per cent of ABC staff could be classified as clerical/administrative/professional, 10 per cent as physical grades, and 60 per cent as program-related staff. If this assessment is correct then the ABC is more closely aligned to the broadcasting industry than to the Public Service. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GF4">Mr CHARLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. In many areas, the report fails to make the hard decisions. One wonders what the Government will now do in bringing forward legislation in order to react to this report. One thing is abundantly clear, however. Government funding must increase for the ABC to compete in its own right in the ever-increasing and complex area of broadcasting. Talking of funding, I mention that it is very interesting to note that the last Labor appropriation for the ABC in 1975, in the last year of the Labor Government, was $132.1m. After three years of Fraser Government appropriation, that had risen to $141.5m. That is an increase of a fraction over 7 per cent in three years. I would guess that inflation over those three years would have been around 33 per cent. Against that figure of 33 per cent we have an appropriation increase to the ABC of 7 per cent. That is the scandal of the funding situation brought about by this Government, and this Government must take some of the blame for the position in which the ABC finds itself today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, no ad hoc large increase in funds should occur. I do not believe in throwing money at the ABC, or any organisation. I do not believe that that alone will fix everything. However, a planned increase of funds is required to enable planning over a period of time. If the ABC knows that x amount of money is going to come in from government funds it can sit down and really have no excuses for planning a future and planning a truly national broadcasting organisation that will benefit everyone in Australia, one which will entertain people in the large mass audience area, one which will have general community appeal, one which will entertain people and inform people in news and current affairs programs, in gardening programs, sporting programs and in the sectional interests that we all have. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very important subject is that of a second ABC national television channel. That is one area that should be looked at. However, it has to be looked at in the whole context of the broadcasting industry. I think ultimately a second national network, no matter how it is structured, will come into effect. I know money will always be a problem but I think that a second national television network, along the lines of the two national radio networks-with one possibly being more of a general entertainment and one specialising-is inevitable in Australia. People in the regional areas will welcome that, too. It is only a matter of time. Whatever government is in power must look at the possibility of how it is to come about and whether subscription, or pay television of any description, should be part of any future ABC advancement. That is something that will affect not only the ABC but also the entire broadcasting industry and a decision such as that cannot be made in isolation from the commercial section of our industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall this country has a very good broadcasting make-up with a good, strong commercial industry and an excellent government-funded network running alongside it. We have the best of both worlds. However, at present I believe the ABC and its management are being made scapegoats in certain areas by this Government. That is a deplorable situation. The Dix report is a comprehensive report but it has failed in some areas. However, I do hope that the Government is sincere and honest in its deliberations because changes that are made now will have a telling effect not only on the ABC but also right across the entertainment and broadcasting industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I close, as I have a minute to spare I revert to the program section of the Dix report. It was a very comprehensive section and many people would have missed some of the submissions put forward by various groups. In particular, I allude to the Australia Council's submission. Whilst some people in the Australia Council may think that they know the industry, some parts of the Australia Council's submission could have been written by a plumber. They really have no comprehension of the media set-up in the area in which the ABC must work . The area to which I specifically allude recommended strongly that the ABC have live and direct broadcasts of events, such as plays, on stage. The Australia Council thought that that was a terrific idea, when in fact any professional in the industry would be able to tell us that one part of the industry cannot be transplanted into another part of the industry and be made to work properly. One cannot transport; that is, one cannot directly televise a play on a stage and make it good television. If one is to put a play on television screens or on film, one must shoot it as such. It must be done in studios and shot as a television play. Some of the submissions put forward by the Australia Council could really be looked at and as a result the Australia Council should have a good look at itself in the future. The Dix report is a good, comprehensive report. I am sorry we did not have twice as long to debate it as we have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is the result of the most wide-ranging inquiry ever made into the ABC. However many of its recommendations are adopted, it will remain an essential reference work in any discussion of the ABC and of the media in general. Mr Dix and his committee deserve the public congratulations they have received for their work. The sheer physical scale of the inquiry is impressive, with its 831 witnesses and 61 hearings, ending with 276 recommendations. Perhaps more important is the fact that the report has not been afraid to make enemies, or at least critics, which is one test of the honesty of any inquiry. It has criticsed and earned the criticism of management and unions, of the commissioners and of the Public Service Board, and of conservatives and innovators. To the extent that it has deliberately sought support, it has been from what can be called the creative elements in the ABC. Whilst this brings its own difficulties, it is an emphasis that must be welcomed .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ABC is one of Australia's great institutions and the vast majority of Australians use it in one way or another. Its news and information services enjoy tremendous standing in the community, as do so many of its other programs, from music and sport to, may I say it, parliamentary broadcasts. It has served the country more than well for about 50 years. Yet, today, the Dix inquiry finds that 'the ABC has become slow moving, overgrown, complacent, and uncertain of the direction in which it is heading'. So it is certainly time for the root-and- branch inquiry of the kind the Dix report gives us. Many of the principal recommendations of the report have already been referred to and discussed. I refer to the proposed structural reorganisation, the tenure proposed for the Chief Executive Officer and the method of appointment, the greater degree of financial accountability, the greater use of contract staff and the adoption of commercial sponsorship of the kind already used by most public broadcasting radio stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The part of the report that I want to discuss is the section on bias-political and social bias-in some of the ABC public affairs programs. The issue arises coparatively rarely in news programs, which consequently enjoy a high public standing, as of course do some current affairs programs. I concentrate on this section of the report for two reasons. The first is that bias arouses such widespread anger in the public, and the second is that the report recommends a solution which I do not think is a satisfactory solution at all. I refer to the proposed amalgamation of the news and public affairs departments. I say at once that public complaints about bias are obviously not confined to the ABC. Obviously the same complaint is made about many of the commercial stations' public affairs programs. Nevertheless, the public indignation is greater when or where the public perceives political bias in the ABC. In the commercial stations , investment, profits and losses are matters for the private sector but the 300 to 400 journalists of the ABC are paid by the public which feels cheated when it sees or hears, or believes it sees or hears, distortions caused by political bias or malice. It is not a simple matter and attitudes of listeners and viewers range from those who see no bias at all, to those people, to pick one example, such as Mr Max Harris, the Australian columnist, who belabour the ABC's ' dominant, insistent and tedious bias towards left-wing radicalism'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dix report approaches this question rather gingerly. This is shown by an interesting variation in the two texts of the report-the first one, presented to us when it was first printed, and the final one, delivered later. The variation or alteration in the text occurs in paragraph 10.19 on page 189 of the final text. The first text did not have page numbering. The first text, referring to alleged deliberate distortions of a leftist kind in public affairs programs, said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence that the situation does occur. </PARA>
<PARA>Most people would agree with that and critics such as Mr Max Harris, and many rank and file members of the Liberal Party, would add that it occurs repeatedly or routinely. In the next edition, on page 189 the text is altered to read:</PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence that the situation does occur occasionally. </PARA>
<PARA>The adding of one word, the word 'occasionally' of course changes the emphasis entirely, from something that occurs perhaps often to something that occurs rarely. I do not know what meetings, agreements or disagreements led to this small but very significant change in the text between the two versions, but I mention it to indicate the sensitivity-the almost explosive sensitivity-of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is no doubt that the report acknowledges the problem in the ABC' s public affairs programs. The report gives evidence of bias and plainly rejects the familiar argument that, say, leftist bias in one program is balanced by conservative bias in another. To quote the report:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to us that our society will be better informed and better able to make intelligent progress if ideas are seen to compete with each other, if they are presented within a reasonably short interval of each other, and at similar times of the daily broadcast schedule. We are accordingly unimpressed by arguments that programs giving prominence to committed left-leaning views such as those talks and documentaries sometimes produce are balanced by others produced in other areas, which are sometimes alleged to have a bias the other way. </PARA>
<PARA>The report recommends that programs of the Lateline, Broadband, Double Take series become less tedious and more controversial by incorporating disagreements with their dominant radical stance. One would, of course, make the same point if programs were tediously biased the other way. </PARA>
<PARA> The report does not analyse how this state of affairs came about. It does not quote from the recent book by the former Deputy General Manager of the ABC, Clement Semmler, on this point. The book is called The ABC-Aunt Sally and Sacred Cow. On page 106, Clement Semmler writes:</PARA>
<PARA> In the last ten years there has been tremendous pressure to enter ABC broadcasting-especially in the glamour area of public affairs broadcasting; hundreds of applications are received for a single vacancy. This has meant the aggregation of lively and independent-minded young people, in a social climate where there has been a rapidly changing standard of behaviour and morality, both personal and public. And at the heart of all this is the fact that, for all the variety of views and opinions among these young producers, editors and reporters , there is a kind of consensus, a pool of shared social and political assumptions, which on many subjects-abortion, divorce, censorship, drugs, immigration, promiscuity, the environment, war, capital punishment, penal policy , capitalism, education, social legislation-are at the best, partisan opinions, and at worst, the opinions of a small educated middle-class left-wing minority. </PARA>
<PARA>These lively spirits are entitled to their ideas and to their Labor Party prejudices, but in broadcasting the public is entitled to professional reporting and not partisan propaganda, otherwise these lively spirits simply reinforce what Brian Hogben said in his recent Paton-Wilkie-Deamer Memorial Lecture at the Journalists Club in Sydney. Mr Hogben is a former editor of the Daily Mirror and is now Group General Manager, Editorial, of News Ltd. Referring specifically to the Press, but in fact to the media in general, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It boils down to this: For all too many years a handful of us has been endangering the freedom of the Press by abusing it, and lowering the prestige of the profession by cuckolding it. We're approaching a point at which people will wonder seriously if we're worth preserving. </PARA>
<PARA>The Dix report confronts this problem. It espouses the principle adopted by the Annan Committee in Great Britain of 'due impartiality' in all public affairs programs. 'Due impartiality' is much the same as balance but the principle of balance can sometimes be applied in a mechanical way. We are all familiar with that device. Sometimes a sensationally false allegation is reported without any real inquiry into it or judgment on it and then at the end, for balance, there is a denial. Due impartiality on the other hand requires the reporter to exercise judgment and sensitivity and not just to report mindlessly or perhaps maliciously. To encourage this sort of professionalism, the report makes two major recommendations. The first is an increased emphasis on professional training, firm policy guidelines and effective supervision. The second is the gradual amalgamation of the news division and the public affairs department, a recommendation supported, incidentally, by the Australian Journalists Association. </PARA>
<PARA> The first recommendation is obviously desirable. The second is controversial and I find myself opposed to it. The first recommendation is the real step ahead . Professional training to minimise knee-jerk bias, to encourage due impartiality and the exercise of judgment, to raise standards-this is what the public affairs programs need. It will not come cheaply and will make a dent in the Budget, but it would be money well spent to overcome the most serious weakness in this side of the ABC's performance. When due impartiality is achieved, it may be time to consider amalgamating news and public affairs. 'It may be', I say. To do so at the moment could be defended in terms of economies, cost control and the avoidance of duplication of staff and equipment. But otherwise it would be mixing traditions in unproductive tension. </PARA>
<PARA> News stands in the tough professional tradition of objective reporting and commands almost universal respect and trust for that reason. Public affairs, despite some real achievements from time to time, is too often a matter of prejudiced advocacy. Amalgamation at this stage would dilute news and not change public affairs advocacy. Amalgamation seems to me an attempt at a mechanical solution to a professional or intellectual problem. I would go further and say that even when public affairs broadcasting is improved, there is a case for keeping the two departments separate, even if a closer association could be useful, as it was for a time in the British Broadcasting Corporation when both departments, while separate, came under the one head, although even that position has now been abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, I believe the ABC is going to have its hands full attempting to establish due impartiality, professional standards and professional training in public affairs without also carrying the strains and tensions of amalgamating that department with News. The Dix report has significantly advanced discussion of the problem of bias in ABC programs but I believe the Commission should carefully examine the proposal for amalgamation and, I hope, reject it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that when this Government grabbed power in 1975 one of its more determined aims was to weaken the independence and influence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Whilst there is also no doubt as to the comprehensive nature of the voluminous report of the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the value of its overview of activities and problems, there is also no doubt regarding the conservatism of the Committee members. The Federal Government ensured that the recommendations contained in the report would be acceptable to it by ensuring that the Committee members were sympathetic to the Government aim of making the ABC a clone of the existing commercial television and radio stations. How else, for example, can one view the recommendations regarding the corporate underwriting of television programs? Incidentally, the fact that the ABC commissioners, in their comments on the report, have suggested that corporate underwriting be extended to radio programs, is a clear indication to me of the commissioners' affinity with the Federal Government's views on the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The commissioners are supposed to have the best interests of the ABC and the listening and viewing public at heart. Yet they have aided and abetted the deliberate winding down of any programs which appear to criticise the Government or to indicate that there is something terribly wrong with the grossly materialistic and self-seeking nature of the social and political system in Australia. It is commendable that in the area of funding the Dix Committee recommended against the reintroduction of licence fees but it is particularly regrettable that the Committee recommended the corporate underwriting of ABC programs. Corporate underwriting would mean a complete loss of professional independence for program makers and would inevitably result in direct political interference with the content of ABC programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Some observers have stated that the attitudes of Committee members, commissioners and the Government in relation to corporate underwriting are naive . I go much further as I contend that it is a deliberate manoeuvre to undermine the integrity and independence of the ABC. Indeed, the commissioners went further in their own response to the Dix report as their suggestion was that corporate underwriting should be extended to radio. They made the additional comment that they did not believe that all information programs should be excluded. I cannot believe that the commissioners' attitudes on these matters can be seen as naive. I believe that it is their intention, acting as the Federal Government's representatives, to ensure that the public will eventually withdraw all support for the ABC as a public broadcaster. Their final support for the Committee's recommendations that revenue attracted through corporate underwriting should not be offset against the ABC's parliamenary appropriation makes pathetic reading when one considers their support of recent savage staff cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Chairman of the ABC, Professor Leonie Kramer, apparently favours the definition of herself as a radical conservative. Presumably radical conservatism in relation to public broadcasting means cutting back on radical programs and ensuring that radical staff members leave the ABC. The ABC has experienced such a debilitating loss of technical and professional staff that it is a wonder that many of its programs are able to go to air at all. Many technical and professional services are performed by contract labour because the permanent staff is insufficient to cope with program schedules. The consequence of this short-sighted staffing policy is that services cost three to four times as much as services performed by permanent staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the ABC has stated that staff cuts are obtained by natural wastage, by not replacing people who retire. Such a statement does not accord with the fact that many of the professional staff have resigned because of sheer disgust with the political interference they have experienced in the presentation of news and current affairs programs. For example, programs such as Nationwide and Four Corners are now but a shadow of their former glory. Again it should be noted that Professor Kramer has been reported as saying that she is opposed to divisiveness and combative talk and that she wants an end to this style of confrontation. It would appear that what she wants is broadcasting of the worst possible kind, which consists of sickly sweet, saccharine type programs which assure everybody that all is right with Australia provided we all accept conservative philosophies and do not waste any time in discussing alternative and opposite views. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give an example from the Friends of the ABC Committee of the sorts of things that occur with corporate underwriting. The Committee's Press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> If a corporation sponsoring a costly TV program takes offence at another ABC program, seen as inimical to its interests and image, a corporation executive may quietly intimate to the right person in the ABC that company patronage will not continue unless the offending program be withdrawn or modified. A financially weakened ABC would find such pressure difficult to withstand. Programs like Doubletake, Background Briefing, Nationwide and Four Corners would be at risk here. Corporations have little taste for controversy and are very sensitive about image. This is what they are out to sell. </PARA>
<PARA> The nervous self censorship that already operates within the ABC would become more oppressive if the Commission were beholden to both Government and Business for financial favours. </PARA>
<PARA>That was stated by the Friends of the ABC Committee. Recently Senator Button published his response to the Dix Committee's report. Several weeks ago on Nationwide Professor Kramer said, in response to Senator Button's comments, that the criticisms of ABC management were unspecific and undocumented. I will give four examples of inept management which will prove that Professor Kramer was not up-to-date in her information. First of all, some four weeks ago, TV Entertainment was set to produce a one-hour music and variety special to be called The Mike Batt Show. Mike Batt is an English entertainer who is principally a composer and who conducts his pieces and occasionally sings. His wife and daughter also periodically appear on stage with him. Mr Batt was hired by the ABC to fly to Australia to star in the special. Sets were designed and built. Costumes were designed and fabricated. An orchestra and dancers were employed. Choreography was done. All the usual preparations were undertaken. But come the day to record, with the entire cast plus star poised to perform in the Gore Hill studios and the tape about to roll for recording, the show was cancelled. The reason was that TV Entertainment had failed to seek permission from Actors Equity for a foreign star to perform on Australian soil. The whole thing fell through seconds before it would have become a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give another example. The New South Wales programs department is responsible for the Andi Ross Show, which goes out each afternoon in New South Wales on Radio 1 and Radio 3. Recently Andi did her show when Parliament was being broadcast over Radio 1. This meant that she would only be heard by country listeners on Radio 3. But, unknown to Andi Ross or New South Wales programs, most, in fact all, of the regional stations decided to take the opportunity to go local. Andi Ross's voice and records were getting no further than the Forbes Street switch room. Nobody told her. For some days she continued to broadcast to herself. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give a third example. As is well documented in past Press reports, in 1981 industrial relations in the radio public affairs section at head office had become so bad that an industrial psychologist was appointed by senior management to try to improve the situation. The result was an increasing flow of employees, mainly journalists, to commercial television programs and commercial radio, particularly 2GB. </PARA>
<PARA> Possibly the best example of incompetence was the recent publicity given to the fact that a generous bequest left to the ABC by a long time listener to ABC drama has never been taken up by the organisation. The amount is $200,000 and it was left quite legally to the ABC by this now defunct benefactor. There was absolutely no reason why this bequest could not have been processed in the normal legal way. The benefactor's solicitors, in a number of letters to the legal department, pleaded for the ABC to take some action but none was taken. Even a letter to the General Manager and the subsequent Press publicity still has not elicited a response from the ABC of any likely action. All this has occurred at a time when the ABC is desperate for cash and at a time when the drama department in particular is being starved of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given four specific examples for Professor Kramer's consideration. We had a perfect example in the Parliament today of what would happen if the ABC were subject to corporate underwriting. The announcement that the Government is to spend $100,000 of a total of $300,000 on advertising its recent housing policy package in Victoria obviously requires exposure as a blatant piece of electioneering for the Liberal Party's election campaign in Victoria. Corporate underwriting would ensure that newscasters and political commentators on radio and television would be effectively prevented from making comments on such an inflammatory subject. Such commentary could do irreparable harm to a government which ensures that business corporations get the lion's share of concessions and subsidies at the expense of the average taxpayer. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is quite correct, as the honourable member said. For corporations underwriting the ABC programs, such broadcasting would be totally against their interests. ABC Commissioners, fearing a cessation of corporate funding, would ensure that such critical political commentaries were not made. It has been suggested that corporate sponsorship would raise about $5m to $10m. It seems nonsensical to risk the independence of a great institution such as the ABC for what would be a paltry sum in comparison with the total budget of $220m. The Friends of the ABC Committee, in one of its publications, has given a number of macabre examples. One example is cited in Brik Barnouw's book The Sponsors 1978 in which a natural gas company sponsored a drama series, including a play based on the Nuremberg trials, and insisted that any reference to gas as the killing agent in the death chambers be deleted. Of course, there is also the example of the well-known multinational organisation Proctor and Gamble which insisted that any program it sponsored would contain no material that would give offence either directly or by inference to any commercial organisation of any sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members on this side of the House support the proposition that non- renewable contracts should be extended to all senior officers, except the Director-General, in the ABC. Such officers should, however, be eligible for reappointment after a thorough and wide-ranging review of their services. The proposal of the Dix Committee that the term of the Director-General should be a non-renewable seven-year term should be supported as it would ensure that the appointee has the opportunity to carry through to a conclusion innovative processes while allowing the opportunity after the seven-year period for a fresh approach from a new appointee. As indicated previously, the present Commissioners reflect too closely the aims and attitudes of the present Government and this is inevitable when the appointments are made by the Government. It is essential that there be at the very least a bipartisan approach to such appointments which should be subject to recommendations from a joint parliamentary committee. I have a personal preference for the reinstatement of a staff elected Commissioner who, as has been pointed out by other critics of the Dix report, can bring the much needed experience of a professional broadcaster to the services provided by the Commission. Apart from this valuable function, the staff- elected commissioner also serves the vital function of representing the interests of the staff on the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In more enlightened societies, it is an elementary requirement of industrial democracy that workers' representatives be present on the boards or commissions which govern institutions and corporations. The only argument is usually about how many representatives workers should have and the type of reporting procedures that is to be adopted by them. The present Government does not believe in industrial democracy. Therefore, it very quickly ensured that the staff-elected commissioner was not replaced and the position was extinguished. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, while there are many other observations that I could make about the ABC, I emphasise that I consider it to be one of Australia's great institutions. The Government has aided in its decline over the past six years but it should not be allowed to decline further. The defects in the Commission which I have mentioned, particularly the effects of government policy, must not be allowed to destroy the integrity and talent of broadcasters, producers and production staff. The decline in the ABC is of major concern to the Australian people. Steps must be taken by the Government to improve the structure of the organisation, as has been suggested by honourable members on this side of the House, and provide suitable funding so that the standards and quality of ABC programs can be restored to a level that will no longer cause concern to the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On such occasions as I am able, I watch or listen to Australian Broadcasting Commission programs as a matter of choice. This may be the result of 20 years of my life when I had no choice. However, I wish to be recorded as a supporter of the Commission. The Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission has covered many aspects of the circumstances which affect the operations of the ABC. It considers programming, independence, staff morale, financing, advertising and the Commission's leader. Such debate is really academic to those who occupy the eastern and south-eastern regions of the electorate of O'Connor, an area which is about one-third the size of Victoria. All they require is the opportunity to view an ABC transmission, warts and all. They receive no television transmission and, quite often, an inadequate broadcasting service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation becomes even more astounding when one realises that some of these people reside within 200 miles of Perth. As a long-term resident of the more remote areas, I have often pondered upon the incongruity of the national broadcasting network's choice of the most densely populated areas for the introduction of new and additional services. This government-funded service has too often been seen as having principally the role of providing competition for the commercial stations of Australia. In the cities it competes in an area in which private enterprise is both willing and able to provide all types and levels of entertainment that the public demand. Therefore, it is not surprising that, in this area of massive competition for public leisure activity, the ABC has limited support. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, I turn to sections 18 to 21 of the recommendations of the Committee, which are addressed to the responsibilities of the ABC to rural areas . I am gratifited that, through initiatives of this Government, we are fast approaching a time when the availability of television and radio will become universal, and the right of all citizens of Australia. Included in those initiatives was the policy of allowing local communities to erect national translator stations to service their local areas. This policy has already borne fruit in my electorate. The residents of Hawick and Cordinup in the shire of Esperance have already funded their translator. The possibility this option raises is that, when satellite transmission becomes available, many rural communities will find it less costly to erect a single dish aerial and translate the program so received by means of a low-cost transmitter. The total cost for a superior signal would be less than the individual purchase price of a large number of private dish aerials. However, those remote area dwellers, whose personal entertainment is severely restricted, are still confronted with the need to find substantial sums from personal finances in order to provide themselves with a service that is enjoyed by most Australians without cost. It represents yet another tax on decentralisation and I trust that at least long term planning will provide for the refunding of expenditures of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The other great difficulty in this area is the time and difficulty involved in obtaining such a licence. Although I recognise some of the difficulties in relation to the numerous applications that have been received, I feel that priority should be given to remote area dwellers. Their very remoteness should remove a lot of the difficulties, such as frequency allocation, which are involved. Most importantly, they are people who have no television service and probably very little else in terms of public entertainment. The further planning for the very best means of delivering the ABC program to these remote areas immediately the satellite is in place should be given priority now. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional large percentage of my constituents will be serviced by the construction of a conventional high-powered national television transmitter in the shire of Mount Marshall. This program has had somewhat of a stop-start progress since it was first promised by the then Minister, Mr Staley. I thank the present Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) and the Government for including provision for the planning stage in the last Budget. I hope that the Government will continue to support this group of Australians by providing funding for the construction of the transmitter in the forthcoming Budget. The cost of the station per capita shows that it is still the least expensive means of delivering the service and will demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment to providing television in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I express my support for the views expressed by the Committee in section 19 of its summary and recommendations, which state:</PARA>
<PARA> As the ABC itself recognised in its submission, the highest priority must be the provision to country areas of the range of program choice heard on the two national radio channels, which is now available only in the capital cities and Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that we should at least have a service to all Australians and preferably at the same cost to the individual as has applied in capital cities. Section 18 of the recommendations deals with the difficulties of people who receive only one program, whether it be radio or television. Most residents of my electorate have national transmission and the choice of the excellent programs supplied by the vigorous Golden West network. These residents probably have a service equal to that of any rural area in Australia. Of the remainder, those who receive a signal at all do suffer from the inability of the national station to provide a suitable choice for the wide variety of tastes that still exist in areas of low population. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these people also suffer from the delusion that only the ABC provides repeat programs. However, it must be realised that, when one has no other station to turn to in order to avoid these repeats, not only do they become more noticeable but also is there a much greater possibility of having viewed or heard a program on a previous occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Because large parts of Australia cannot attract the capital expenditure necessary for commercial viability, they are eternally locked into government television. Under these circumstances, it is imperative that programming be of the highest standard and public acceptance. When only one program is available, that program must be as popular as possible. The minority in this case is very real. However, the minority is not one with a specific interest. It is a small number of people with very general tastes. </PARA>
<PARA> If the ABC sees its role as that of being obliged to cater for specialist interest groups in the city, it must produce a separate program for distribution to areas in which its signal is the only one received. I appreciate that the minority interests of those minorities will not then be met. However, this becomes a burden that the remote areas have learned to bear. An excellent example of that occurred recently when the ABC decided to discontinue its direct telecast of night trotting and replace it with a program of European films with subtitles. This is not much help when the choice is between those films and turning the television knob to a blank screen. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of satellite transmission will allow the ABC to provide a total rural program including a greater percentage of local news and activities. Section 20 of the report refers to this issue. I hope this matter is considered by the Government and the ABC as one which should be given top priority. Naturally, the recommendations for the provision of second stations, in respect of both radio and television, will be received with gratitude by the people in my electorate. I am sure that they also see as meriting the top priority the universal transmission of high quality popular programming. In defining what is popular, let me introduce a personal viewpoint. The word 'popular' does not mean soap operas. I am sure our government station can produce high quality yet popular programs if it chooses to. Might I add that on many occasions it is my belief that it does just that. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in this rural programming I must raise the issue of international sport. The fact that such activity has now attracted the interest of commercial undertakings is only evidence of the huge appeal that such activities have to the general public. Such programs should not be denied to people who have the least opportunity to see them live. I will not accept that technical difficulties make transmission of these programs impossible for the ABC. Certainly on the advent of the satellite, ABC-only areas should be guaranteed access to these events. Considering the cost of promoting these events I would not object if the entire contents of a commercial transmission, including advertisements, were transmitted by the ABC with the revenue attracted by that greater audience remaining with the commercial station which held the rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also makes reference to the provision of frequency modulation radio to rural areas. It suggests that this transmission has probably less appeal than the two conventional stations of both radio and television, and I would agree. Nevertheless, the transmission of FM radio appears to cover a large area of my electorate and a large percentage of my constituents await the event enthusiastically. Some, including the residents of Albany, had expected transmission by now. One can imagine their disappointment when it was recently announced that due to technical problems relating to interference to other transmissions the entire program would be delayed for some years to accommodate a complete review of frequency allocations throughout Australia. Again, a worthwhile service is being withheld from country people while the real problems exist in the city. By that I refer to the crowding of the airwaves in those areas. I sincerely hope the Government will reconsider this decision and attack the problem in order of need and less of difficulty. It is quite obvious that in an area such as my electorate, which is not densely covered by any form of radio or television, the difficulty in finding slots for the FM program is not nearly as difficult and, of course, it would not impinge in any way on the east coast. If that is the case, I see no reason why that electorate or area should be included with all the great problems over here and why the problems which exist for my people should have to await the resolution of those problems. </PARA>

When the men who operate agricultural plant and machinery get out at night, as they do today, to be able to have a choice of radio stations must be a great comfort. Might I add that some of my constituents no doubt would prefer that at least a percentage of the FM transmissions that the ABC currently produces was of a slightly lighter note. Nevertheless, I would like to think that if the Government took such an attitude it would guarantee a number of Western Australians the speedy resolution of a problem, while recognising that the problem in an Australia-wide context is quite significant. In this regard I would like to thank the Minister for Communications for considering that point of view when I put it to him the other day and for promising me that he would do his best to consider it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All in all I think that this report has addressed itself to the huge problems of the ABC. I do not really want to buy into many of the technical and internal problems; I just wish to say for my electorate that the ABC will do, provided we all get the opportunity to hear it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The summary and main recommendations in volume 1 of the Dix report of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission begins with a quotation from T.S. Eliot:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A good past is positively dangerous if it makes us content with the present and so unprepared for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The difficulty with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which did such amazing pioneering work in the first years of Australian broadcasting and which put Australia permanently in its debt, has in a sense not kept up with the times . I suppose paradoxically one could say that it has kept up with the times in a sense that it has been seduced by the appeal of ratings. Because it has been seduced by the appeal of ratings it has felt that it has to provide a service not that is complementary to the commercial networks but which to a very large extent duplicates them. The ABC provides basically a first rate radio system and a third rate or fourth rate television system. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes heavy Commonwealth funding for some of the battleship companies, as we call them, like the Australian Opera, the Australian Ballet and, worst of all , the Australian Broadcasting Commission itself, has led to an extreme caution linked with a calcification of the imagination. The sheer volume of funding makes programmers feel that they have a responsibility to appeal to the largest possible audience. As a result they play safe, appealing, like the commercial channels, to the lowest common denominator rather than to the highest common multiple. In a sense they feel that the rationale for the considerable amount of Commonwealth funding that is provided in the Budget each year is to be found in getting high ratings. In other words, instead of using Commonwealth funding as an opportunity to provide innovative programs, programs that are different in quality and quantity from those that are available on the commercial networks, the ABC has tended, I think, in the last 10 or 15 years in particular, to play very safe indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk a little about programming because I think in many ways the Dix Committee let the ABC down very lightly. If one looks at the ABC annual report for 1979-80 it will be seen that the operational payments for television amounted to $86,045,229. For 1980-81 the figure was a total of $98,647,786-very nearly $100m-for operational payments for television, of which the purchase of programs amounted to only $8,750,606. So we have this extraordinary phenomenon of the mountain labouring to produce a mouse. When we look at the actual programming that is provided week by week, it is very difficult to see that the ABC has put anything like as much of a significant contribution into programming as we have reason to expect. Paragraph 11.19 of volume 2 of the Dix report points out that there is a considerable difference between the proportion of programming time allocated by the ABC and what the commercial stations provide. The following table shows that that is so:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>% of % of</PARA>

I take the Age Green Guide and not surprisingly I take the example of tonight's programming in Melbourne. I am sure it will be very much the same in Sydney for Channel 2. First of all, what is it providing for children? Let us look at what it is showing between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.. There is 25 minutes of Flash Gordon, that grand old Australian cartoon character, followed by five minutes of Don and Pete; I am not familiar with Don and Pete's work. This is followed by 30 minutes of Drake's Venture, the final of the British serial based on Sir Francis Drake's historical circumnavigation of the world. This is followed by two minutes of news.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But when we look at what is broadcast in the evening, we find this rich program . At 6 o'clock Laff-a-Bits is broadcast. I do not even think I want to know what that is. I imagine it is a variety program. That is followed by 20 minutes of The Kenny Everett Video Show. That is followed by 25 minutes of Dr Who, five minutes of Videodisc and then 30 minutes of news, sport and weather. Then there is a serious documentary called Our World which is about an aviation convention held in the American city of Oshkosh last year. </PARA>

At 9.55 p.m. there will be news and weather and at 10.5 it will broadcast a series called Rock Arena starring someone called Gillan . At 10.45 they are all tired out and they go home. That seems to me to be not a wildly exciting array of programs. It is costing zillions to put on yet one wonders where is the Australian contribution apart from the outstanding contribution made by members of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party and whoever happens to appear on Nationwide. I thought that perhaps I was being a little unjust in just picking out the one night. Let us look at the program array for the whole week, bearing in mind that the Dix report states that drama is the No. 1 area for the ABC and that it accounts for 41 per cent of total transmission time.</PARA></TALK.START>

On Saturday the total contribution in drama-I am talking about programs broadcast between 6 o'clock and midnight-is nil. On Sunday it is not nil: there is a contribution-a repeat of Jonah.

One finds that the greatest contribution, apart from the news and Nationwide, is variety. There is a total of four hours a week of Laff-a-Bits, The Kenny Everett Video Show and Dr Who. What have those programs got to do with Australian programming? Obviously, those programs are paid for out of the small figure we pay for the programs that are purchased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I begin to think at times that there is something to be said for the view that the late Robert Moore put quite often to many members of Parliament in discussions. He argued that if a high-rating program like the late lamented Monday Conference was handled administratively by the ABC and total overheads were apportioned, the overall cost was enormous, almost a multi-million dollar exercise. His argument was that if all that was needed was a little old lady with a typewriter and a telephone actually to set the thing up, then a certain amount of studio space was acquired from the ABC and the ABC turned the electric lights on, a program could be produced for a very small amount of money. He said that the ABC really had become extraordinarily bureaucratised. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about what seems to me to be the most serious challenge to the ABC. I think it has come from an unexpected quarter. I refer to the Special Broadcasting Service, Channel 0/28 which is regularly transmitting what I think is the best programming ever seen in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, especially the news service. It is producing it at a fraction of the overall cost of the news produced by the ABC. It is a great pity that that service is shared at the moment by only Melbourne and Sydney. Unless and until the ABC lifts its game, Channel 0/28 may well be used as a stick to beat the ABC because it will be said, with some justice, that it can transmit better programs at a fraction of the cost. The SBS news service is outstandingly good. In comparison with the ABC program, we can see the shallowness and the trivialising of much of the ABC news reporting. True it is that the SBS does not seem to have its primary appeal for people in the ethnic community for whom it was designed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rating very poorly because it has not been promoted to any real extent, by this Government. I wish to express some concern about the future of music in Australia. I do have some reservations about the setting up of the organisation called Music Australia. I am not sure that this has really been thought out. As we well know, this is not a Government that is prone to rush into decisions. I hope that in this particular area we will not find that a very early decision is made, a decision which takes away from the ABC its historic role in music. I think music may well be the area that has the best and the most consistent record of any department within the whole operation of the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, I will talk about the music program. I will talk also about the existing concert department. There was a period-I think it is no longer true-when the ABC was the largest concert-giving organisation in the world and even now it probably ranks as No. 2. It has built up an enormous amount of expertise. I think the anxiety that is felt in the music community is that if the Government sets up the Music Australia alternative it will depend very heavily on State funding. That would be splendid if the States could be relied on to contribute significantly to maintain the standards as they have existed in the past. Honourable members will understand that in times of financial stringency and so on an activity like high level music programming is likely to be one of the first things to collapse, particularly if the States say : 'If an orchestra or a soloist is coming out to Australia anyway we can listen to them on our crystal sets; we do not need to have them actually visit Perth, Adelaide or whatever the capital city concerned is'. It may mean too that there will be a falling off in the penetration of the presentation of musical programs in rural and provincial areas as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the ABC's record in this area is outstanding. I think it is the area in which it has been most successful. If there is anything that the Government ought to think about very carefully, I think it is that provision. I am in very strong agreement with the great bulk of the recommendations of the Dix report. I endorse the view taken by my colleague, Senator Button, the shadow Minister for Communications but, like him, I think we ought to be very careful about what we do about Music Australia. I think this may well be an area where there needs to be more investigation with the people specifically involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on two matters concerning the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges regarding an article in the Daily Mirror of Wednesday, 2 September 1981. Firstly, I want to clarify the record in respect of the debate on this report when it was last before the House and, secondly, I want to discuss the recommendation for the establishment of a joint select committee of inquiry to inquire into all aspects of parliamentary privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman), in speaking on this issue when it was last before the House, drew attention to an amendment he moved at a meeting of the Privileges Committee on 23 September last year. In fact, he had part of the minutes of that meeting incorporated in Hansard. It appears on page 2770 of last year's Hansard. I think it is unfortunate for one part of the minutes to have been discussed in this way because the minutes do not record the detailed discussion and debate which took place. Therefore many members of that Committee may now want to explain the stance they took in relation to the matter which the honourable member for Denison raised. He expressed his concern that only four members of the Committee, including me, supported the terms of his amendment, seeking to allow Mr Laurie Oakes to appear before the Committee. He went on and, in some fairly extravagant terms, denigrated a motion which I had subsequently proposed. The motion that I moved was:</PARA>
<PARA> That Mr Laurie Oakes be given the opportunity to appear before the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>I moved this motion because I believed it would accommodate the differences of opinion within the Committee, while still giving Mr Oakes the opportunity to put his case in relation to the article in question, if he so desired. I believed that it was extremely important to give Mr Oakes that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> In endeavouring to set the record straight in relation to that subsequent motion I should like to say, firstly, that the motion was passed, as I thought it would be; and, secondly, despite the comments by the honourable member for Denison about the motion, he in fact voted in favour of it. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) was the only person who voted against the motion and he has already explained in this House why he did so. Therefore, to ensure that the record is correct, I seek leave of the House to have a complete copy of those minutes incorporated in Hansard because, unfortunately-I am sure it was by mistake-the honourable member for Denison incorporated only two pages of the minutes and the final vote is recorded on the third page of those minutes . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The hearing of this reference by the Committee of Privileges was a long one because the Committee found itself continually questioning the method by which such a hearing should be conducted. The fact, as revealed by the minority report from the honourable member for Lalor and the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), they believed that the power to punish for contempt of Parliament should be removed from the jurisdiction of the Parliament and placed in the hands of the judiciary. Getting away from the difficulties involved in the actual consideration of this case, the report outlines a number of areas of concern which it believes ought to be the subject of a joint committee of inquiry. The basis of the Commonwealth Parliament's privilege is set out in section 49 of the Constitution, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Parliament has not declared its powers except in relation to a few more minor matters, we have a situation in which the powers, privileges and immunities of this House and of the Senate are those which the United Kingdom's House of Commons had in 1901. In the circumstances, therefore, it seems wise for the Parliament, through the joint committee of inquiry, to look at the whole question of parliamentary privilege to see whether we ought to review the Parliament's powers in order that they might more closely reflect today's needs and, indeed, the rights and obligation of both members of parliament and the general public. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of questions arise for consideration. I mention just a few of the most important ones which I believe ought to be subject to review. Firstly, there is the method of raising complaints regarding privilege in the Parliament. A number of suggestions have been made for the revision of our Standing Orders in relation to this matter. I refer in particular to the Revised Arrangements adopted by the House of Commons in 1978. Secondly, there is the matter of the penalties which can be imposed by this Parliament. It has been suggested, quite correctly in my view, that the House should exercise its penal jurisdiction as sparingly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter I raise is that of the rights of witnesses to be legally represented or advised when appearing before the Privileges Committee and the House if they are called to the Bar of the chamber. In the case dealing with Mr Laurie Oakes, requests for legal representation were made to the Committee by a witness and a potential witness. The Committee felt itself bound, under the Constitution, by the long standing parliamentary precedents of the United Kingdom prior to 1901. As is made clear in our report, since the 1770s the United Kingdom House of Commons Committee of Privileges has not heard counsel or solicitors on behalf of persons called before it. This is a matter which I believe ought to be considered. Even if the rights to legal representation are not agreed to, it may be appropriate to consider giving witnesses access to their legal advisers during Committee proceedings, as well as allowing such advisers to make submissions on behalf of their clients at a time determined by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to this matter, I quote paragraph 37 of our report to the Parliament, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Having carefully considered the procedures adopted elsewhere and the undesirability of turning an inquiry by the Committee of Privileges into a court type situation, the Committee feels that there are good grounds for review and reform. It sees this issue as requiring early resolution by the proposed joint select inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>The fourth matter of importance is the suggestion raised in one of the minority reports that inquiries such as are now undertaken by the Privileges Committee ought to be transferred to the courts. I believe the basis of this suggestion is that Parliament should not be, or indeed should not be seen to be, both prosecutor and judge in these matters. I have some grave reservations about transferring to the courts all or part of the Parliament's power in relation to privilege. Apart from any arguments concerning the separation of powers between the Parliament and the judiciary, I would have to be convinced that many of the findings of the 1966-67 United Kingdom Select Committee were not relevant and appropriate to our position in Australia. I quote three paragraphs from that report. Paragraph 142 of the United Kingdom report states:</PARA>
<PARA> This balance between the freedom of the individual and the essential protection of the House involves considerations of a political character which may vary according to the circumstances of the day. It is right that the House, which is responsible to the electorate, should make such decisions rather than that they should be made by an appointed tribunal, whether or not of a judicial character.</PARA>
<PARA>That Committee went on to state, in paragraph 143:</PARA>
<PARA> Once the decision has been made that a contempt has been committed, the question of the necessary penalty, if any, may again be governed by considerations of a political character. In practice, as pointed out by the Clerk of the House . . . the House has in recent years-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the United Kingdom House of Commons-</PARA>
<PARA>adopted a very much harsher approach to contempts committed by its own members than to those committed by strangers. If it has been judge in its own cause, it 'has been a very lenient judge in its own cause'. An outside tribunal-and in particular any branch of the Judiciary-would have very great difficulty in exercising a similar selective leniency and would undoubtedly be embarrassed by the need to take into account considerations of a political character. </PARA>
<PARA> If the jurisdiction were transferred to an outside tribunal, whether that tribunal dealt with both guilt and penalty or with only one of them, it would still be necessary for the House to decide in each case whether to refer the complaint to the tribunal. In order to make this decision the House would have to be satisfied that it would be proper to do so and accordingly in practice might have to give to the complaint the same consideration which would be given to it if the jurisdiction were retained by the House. There could, in Your Committee's opinion, arise embarrassment in the event of a conflict of view between the House and the ultimate tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Your Committee accordingly strongly recommend that the House should retain its penal jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>I find the United Kingdom Committee's decision to be persuasive and, as I have said, I will want to be convinced that we should adopt a different procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to privilege in relation to the reporting of parliamentary proceedings not only by the media but also by Hansard. This, in my view, also ought to be considered by the joint committee and, if necessary, the laws in relation to the publication of parliamentary proceedings should be reviewed. I support the recommendation of the Privileges Committee for an inquiry to be carried out by a joint committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives and I hope that such a committee will consider the points that I have raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have made the point previously, I was absent from the Parliament when the matter of the referral to the Privileges Committee of the question of the article that appeared in the Sydney Daily Mirror in September 1981 was first raised. I have had more than a passing interest in the privilege of parliament, the privilege of parliamentarians, the relationship between parliament and the media and the laws of natural justice concerning the activities of parliament. It seems to me to be a very complex field. It is more than just a complex field; it is almost a minefield. I think all honourable members are aware that once action is taken by the Parliament and people are found in contempt of the Parliament the only penalty which can be imposed is that of gaol, as was done once by this Parliament in the early 1950s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had in more recent times, as the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) would be aware, the powers of the Senate being used to call before it a person to answer questions. It was as if it were some sort of criminal investigation of the person. He could have been questioned by all senators who wanted to ask him questions. A good deal of notoriety surrounded the performance . I have always taken the view that Parliament is almost better off by remaining out of the field altogether. I am not greatly shaken by what people may say in the media about parliamentarians collectively. If they do so individually, there is a form of redress and many parliamentarians have followed that course quite successfully. But if a person says something about parliamentarians collectively , we have the opportunity not only to deny it in this place but also to take it further and perhaps put that person's reputation and performance to the test. </PARA>
<PARA> Once we proceed, as was the case in September of last year, to bring under discussion before the Privileges Committee the question of contempt, the Parliament really does get itself into an awful mess. No one can say that the exercise conducted by the Parliament late last year enhanced the position or stature of the Parliament. It did quite the opposite. A lot of angry parliamentarians decided that they would not put up with this sort of thing and that they would try to do something about it. It seems to me that the whole thing backfired because we happened to give the matter prominence and anybody who did not buy the Daily Mirror-that was most people in Australia, thank God- was made aware of the article that had previously been published in that newspaper by virtue of our reaction in this Parliament. I know from looking at Hansard that there were divided views and feelings among members of this Parliament about this matter but, as I said, my view would have been to let sleeping dogs lie. There is very little we can do about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we as members of parliament should try to overcome the enormous problem that we have in our relationships with the public. We cannot quite understand why members of the public think so poorly of us although we all work so hard. When someone happens to take a shot at us by saying something which is not true we tend to want to fight back in order to rectify what we think is a very imbalanced view of our role in society. But we cannot do it that way. We cannot do it via the Privileges Committee, nor can we enhance the role of the Parliament by thinking we can do what the Senate did and bring people before us to answer questions in order to make some political points. </PARA>
<PARA> There is greater freedom in other parliaments. I must say that I was amazed to find when I was in Spain last year that Press members have access to every part of the Spanish Parliament. In this building there are very small areas where only members of parliament can go. In the Spanish Parliament there is no section of the building to which the Press does not have complete access. It raises the question in a democracy of the particular role and responsibilites of the Press and parliament and how best to play our role in this regard. I think it is extremely difficult, virtually impossible, to start writing rules about how we can get even with people who say things, as outrageous as they may be, about us collectively in this place. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people who live in Australia like reading them. They happen to coincide with the view that they have of us. They do not read it all that often. Nevertheless, we rate in popularity with the public about one percentage point above child molesters and about five percentage points below starting price bookies and jockeys. Honourable members can see that our standing in the community is not all that great. When we take action such as that which we took last September people tend to side with the person whom they think the Parliament is trying to stamp on or restrict. There is no way in which we can win. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Committee met and tried to sort out what path it would follow in bringing this matter to some sort of logical conclusion it invited the author to attend its hearings but the author was not all that attracted to the idea. He just said that he was not interested in attending the Committee's hearings. But if the Committee had gone on with the matter and reached the situation reached in the early 1950s the author could have found himself in gaol because there are no other powers available to the Parliament, and again the Parliament would have been held in ridicule as a result of such action. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were mad enough to set up a group of people to go through every document that is printed in Australia every day of the week, every week of the month, every month of the year, to see how many people vilify parliamentarians we would have a non-ending session of the Privileges Committee seeing whom it should get hold of because of the things they were saying about us. The House will recall that one of the persons called before the Parliament on a matter of privilege in 1953 was a person by the name of Browne, who passed away recently. He was involved in putting out a newsletter called Things I Hear. It used to upset many people besides parliamentarians. There is also the Toorak Times, which is not a bad little journal. No one knows quite who writes for it, who owns it or who is responsible for it, but out it comes and it is circulated in the thousands. </PARA>
<PARA> It is just not possible in a democracy to do the sorts of things that Parliament attempted to do last September. We should have had more intelligence than to try to do it in that way. I am afraid that we shall have to be a little tougher, to steel ourselves against these sorts of attacks, or try to answer them here in the way in which we do. If people go overboard and attack someone personally, the avenues are open to that person. The $3,000-a-day men are always there waiting in their offices to get someone's brief. They will do their best for such a person. The newspapers in Australia, particularly in New South Wales, hate going before juries. One is almost half way home, if one has a good case, as soon as the newspaper receives the letter. So one has plenty of protection. The laws of natural justice apply outside. I should have thought that the libel laws as they exist in Australia are as stringent as they would be in most other parts of the Western world. I think that is the safeguard against personal abuse or personal misrepresentation, or an attempt by any section of the media to bring a person's political career to an end. But I do not think it is possible- and I am afraid that our most recent exercise in this matter has proved that it is almost futile-to use the instrument of Parliament to try to make it appear as though we can prevent people in any form of the media from saying what they want to say about parliamentarians collectively. </PARA>
<PARA> We are going to set up another committee, which is probably the 8,000th committee that we have had in the last 500 years in the Westminister system, to see what it can do, and I am pretty sure that it will have the same result as all previous committees. </PARA>

<PARA>The recommendation for a joint select committee emerged from our House of Representatives Committee of Privileges. I think that it is to be commended that the other place has seen fit to join with us in the examination of the basic question of privilege. There are many matters pertaining to privilege which have been the subject of debate in this place. There are others that have been canvassed outside this Parliament. I understand that the House of Westminster has recently examined some matters which have a relationship to our own interests in this matter. Obviously the matter has also been canvassed in the courts. I would hope that all of those matters might well be before the committee and that the report might give us an opportunity to consider whether any change is desirable to be made or should be made in the law of privileges as it pertains to this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the two or three minutes that is available before the adjournment motion is put, Mr Speaker, I should seek to be as brief as possible. We are all aware that the privileges of this House exist for the protection of the House and for the protection of the members of the House in the discharge of their duties It has been pointed out-and it is worth pointing it out again-that in this House our privileges are those of the United Kingdom Parliament of 1901. That strikes me as a perfectly absurd state of affairs. It also strikes me as a perfectly absurd state of affairs that notwithstanding a very eminent constitutional lawyer recommending, some few years after the Constitution came into effect, that the whole matter be looked into, it took another 30 years before a Bill was placed before this House, and that Bill lapsed. Here we are again, once more, looking at the question of privileges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From listening to what the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) has said, one appreciates that a positive case for looking at this antique branch of law was very clearly made out, since he pointed out that it was because of decisions going back to 1770-that is, before we even established any kind of civilisation in this land-that it was decided that certain rules and procedures had to be followed. To my mind it is grotesque that in this House we should be bound to follow practices and procedures laid down in quite different times, when the elementary rules of natural justice were not even considered. After all, we have gone a great distance in the last two or three hundred years. The proposition that a person who is charged with an offence-which is effectively what takes place when a person is brought before the Committee of Privileges-should not have the right to be represented by a lawyer, should not have the right to cross -examine, if need be, and should not have the ordinary rights that anybody in this country would have if a charge were made against him, is not only wrong but patently contrary to the elementary principles of natural justice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can be brief because of the time others have spent upon this subject. Whether or not we embark on such an endeavour as transferring any part of the powers to the courts is another matter. Personally, I am very disinclined to do that. But I do think that the time has arrived for us to try to come to some kind of formulation of what are the privileges of this House. It is worth while in that context quoting what a Mr Pearce had to say in 1969 in an article in the Federal Law Review. He examined the whole concept of parliamentary contempt. I quote two parts from page 253 in which he made criticisms. These criticisms were made with reference to what had been said in England in the report of the select committee of 1967:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the scope of Parliament's penal jurisdiction is too wide and too uncertain ; the press and the public are wrongly inhibited from legitimate criticism of parliamentary institutions and of members' conduct by fear that the penal jurisdiction may be invoked against them. </PARA>
<PARA>He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is too great uncertainty about the defences which may legitimately be raised by those who are subjected to the penal jurisdiction; in particular it is a matter of doubt whether a person who has made truthful criticisms should be allowed to testify to their truth; this should be an undoubted right . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by saying that in these times surely we should regard criticism by the media of the body as a whole, no matter how intemperate, how unjustified, how groundless or how unfair, as part of parliamentary life. After all, we here in Parliament are used to handing it out not only in Parliament but to people outside Parliament. So it is about time we took a look at the whole question and did it with a sense of common sense and fairness and, one hopes, not only have a report back here but also have action taken on that report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the House for more than about two minutes. I wish to support the proposition. Privilege is currently unworkable. I acknowledge the remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). This situation is the result, though, of a Constitution which is equally out of date and which unfortunately the Government is not prepared to look at in a reasonable light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two privilege sections. One is that which protects a member against intimidation in respect of the carrying out of his duties as a member and the other is that which protects the Parliament. The second is the hardest to enforce. There would seem to be a very good case for changes in some of the Acts of Parliament which are not necessarily directly related to privilege. I speak of the Parliamentary Papers Act, for instance, which in my view should be changed to a copyright type of Act. I would hope that that matter could be taken into consideration at the same time, so that the publication of parliamentary papers and other material not authorised by Parliament would become an offence against the law and could be heard in the courts rather than being a matter in which we have to go out on a witch hunt to find out who committed this offence. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that this motion covers that but it is an area in which enforcement would become possible because we would then have the offence of publication. At the moment we have to find the person who has divulged reports. That is almost impossible, as we know from an earlier case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week there was an important debate in this House in respect of the claims made by Vietnam veterans for a judicial inquiry. In the course of that debate statements were made by both myself and the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson), who was speaking for and on behalf of the Government. A Press release was issued over the weekend by members of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia which deals quite specifically with some of the points raised in that debate. It sets out their viewpoint. In order to see that the views of Vietnam veterans on matters which are of concern to them are before the Parliament so that honourable members can have the benefit of considering all the issues as the veterans themselves see them, I seek leave to have that statement incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Press Release from the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia</PARA>
<PARA> The Vietnam Veterans Association is extremely disappointed that the Prime Minister was not prepared to answer personally the charges made against him in the Parliament last Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA> The response for the Government to those charges by the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr David Thomson, was totally inadequate and factually wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Some examples of his wrong statements are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Minister said only the VVAA supports the judicial inquiry, among ex- service organisations. We wish to point out to the Minister that, on 11 August, 1981, at an RSL-convened conference in Canberra, 27 out of 28 ex-service organisations present (including the Korea and South East Asian Forces Association) voted to support an independent judicial inquiry. That inquiry has also been supported by the Senate, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Labor Party and the Democracts, among others. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Minister said that the RSL has not called for a judicial inquiry. In May , 1980, the RSL New South Wales State Congress voted, by 499 to 1, to support a judicial inquiry. The New South Wales Branch represents about half the RSL membership. This decision was put before the RSL National Executive by Sir Colin Hines, New South Wales President, on 7 September, 1980. It was not voted on because of statements made to that meeting by Sir William Keys, RSL National President. Sir Colin Hines said in ''Reveille'' (March/April, 1981, Vol. 56, No. 2) that he had been overruled. A statement was made to that meeting by Major- General (retired) D. Vincent, who was Commander, Armed Forces, Vietnam, 1967-68, that he knew the chemicals were dangerous, but he was acting under Government instructions in ordering their use by Australian forces, and that he did not realise the full extent of the dangers until 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Minister said that the Government had initiated a program of epidemiological studies. He is apparently unaware that his own Ministerial colleague, the Minister for Veterans Affairs, Senator Messner, announced on 15 February, 1982, that the Government had scrapped the major study. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Minister said that Government Departments are co-operating fully with the current inquiry being conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and Environment. Having discussed that inquiry at great length with the Committee and their Secretariat, I can quite categorically state that Committee Members have expressed considerable concern at the lack of co-operation they have had from all of the Government Departments involved (Veterans' Affairs, Health and Defence). </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Minister said that the VVAA does not represent Vietnam veterans. Without the VVAA, the RSL would not have done anything about our claims, there would be no Senate Committee inquiry, no Government-sponsored studies, no counselling centres and no public concern. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The Minister said only 63 veterans had visited counselling centres in Sydney and Adelaide since they were established. Our information is that those centres have had over 340 clients, and are having trouble handling the workload. Already they are seeking more staff. On 16 July, 1981, at a meeting in Canberra with the Minister for Veterans Affairs and his senior advisers, we proposed the type of counselling service which we believe was and is necessary. The Minister refused to accept our submission and established a much more limited service. Even though the current service is so limited, the already demonstrated level of demand indicates the problems that Vietnam veterans are experiencing, along with the effects of those problems on our families. In a recent article the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the Adelaide Counselling Service alone was receiving 10 clients a day. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. The Minister quoted two scientific reports as evidence for the Government's case that the chemicals were not linked with the long term illnesses now suffered by Vietnam veterans. The Government-appointed Repatriation Review Tribunal, in its ''Reasons for Decision'' in the recent Simpson case, found that there was sufficient evidence of these links to award a pension to Mrs Simpson. It should be noted that, in that case, the RRT only considered evidence about the US dispersal of defoliants, and only phenoxyacetic herbicides at that, and did not consider other evidence of the use of chemicals by Australian forces. We have long pointed out, on the public record, our concern about both US and Australian forces' use of both arsenic-based Agent Blue and the organophosphate insecticide, Malathion. Has Mr Thomson personally read the 1967 Midwest Research Institute report which he quoted in the Parliament? Apparently not, for he would have found, for example, the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Arsenicals, particularly the trivalent forms of arsenic, have long been regarded as either carcinogens or possibly as co-carcinogens. In either case there is reason to be wary of the widespread distribution of these materials until evidence of their long-term safety under the conditions of use has been obtained.'' (Assessment of Ecological Effects of Extensive or Repeated Use of Herbicides, Midwest Research Institute, 1967, pp. 163, 164'. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Minister said that the chemicals used in Vietnam were, and still are, commercially available and used within Australia. There is a wealth of public evidence that most of the chemicals used in Vietnam were not of the same composition as those used in Australia, the US, and elsewhere, at the time or since. As the Minister should know, both because of his own military experience and his responsibilities as a Minister of the Crown, peacetime precautions often cannot be followed in wartime. The Government's own report, ''Pesticides Used In Vietnam Hostilities and Their Use in Australian Agriculture: A Comparative Study ,'' says: ''Once again, however, it must be stressed that difficulties are encountered during conditions of war which prevent the rigid adoption of precautions that can be applied in peacetime. . . . . . . . . . . Although the regulations were designed to protect personnel from potential adverse health effects, it is impossible to determine the extent to which they were met.'' (p. 32). </PARA>
<PARA> 9. The Minister defended strongly the public servants in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The real problem, for Vietnam veterans, is the attitudes of most of the senior management in the DVA. We are not critical of DVA junior staff who are restricted by these attitudes, and who in any case do not make major decisions. The appearances of the Vietnam Special Studies Group personnel from the DVA before the Senate Committee's inquiry have been less than impressive. My Association is concerned also at the recent speech made by the DVA Permanent Head, Mr D. Volker, where he foreshadowed major legislative and administrative changes to the repatriation system. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary then, we are very concerned that the Government has still not examined the detailed evidence which we believe supports our claims. We are forced to repeat, yet again, our call for a judicial inquiry, outside the political arena, which can impartially assess that evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also disappointed that, despite mounting evidence in support of our claims, the Government's attitude to our problems is the same as it was over two years ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to raise the question of the funding of support schemes for homeless youth, particularly in Western Australia. I will outline the two major contributions of the Commonwealth in this field and, I hope, provoke some statement of the intention of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in the future. On 1 July 1979 a three-year project in youth accommodation was supposed to commence. It was going to be funded dollar for dollar by the Commonwealth and the Western Australian Government. A total of $83,500 was to be provided by each government per year to reach a project total of about half a million dollars. One per cent of this total was to be spent on evaluation. The Youth Support Services Program was to allocate funds while the Western Australian Department of Community Welfare was to provide administration . No funds were received in the first year. On 5 March 1981, $51,990 was provided, half from each government. In this financial year, 1981-82, $44,800 has been provided plus a top-up for last year of $22,700. This is a total of about $120,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The scheme is soon to end. The planned evaluation has not eventuated and, indeed, given these delays and reductions in funding no reasonable assessment could be made. However, the lack of meaningful evaluation means that very little has been learned about the best ways to house young people in need. The Youth Accommodation Coalition, a group of representatives of voluntary organisations concerned with this problem, estimates that 50 per cent of the money allocated to the scheme has gone towards administration and development, leaving only the other 50 per cent for direct spending on housing for the homeless. How accurate this assessment is we cannot say because no direct evaluation is taking place. Given this situation, there is good reason to be concerned that money so vitally needed may well have been wasted. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter of concern is the capital grant of a quarter of a million dollars through the Department of Social Security to Jesus People Incorporated. It appears that Jesus People was the only group which knew how to apply for the money. Certainly the Youth Accommodation Coalition did not know. The Minister for Social Security has advocated on various occasions the small suburban house type of emergency accommodation. This makes it all the more surprising that a quarter of a million dollars should be given to one group to house 25 to 30 young people. In my electorate there is a small group called the Victoria Park Youth Accommodation Coalition, which is a member of the broader group of a similar name to which I have already referred. Last year the Victoria Park group was given a once-off grant of $300 from the Western Australian Department of Community Welfare to provide youth accommodation. It is successfully housing five people in separate rooms in a suburban house while charging these people less rent than the Jesus People, for example, charge for dormitory accommodation . An important part of the Victoria Park scheme is an arrangement of compulsory saving that after a few months gives each young person enough to put towards a bond and the other once-off costs associated with moving into privately rented accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> This comparison leads one to ask just how this $250,000 of taxpayers' money is being spent-how much is to be capital expenditure, how much will go in wages and administration and what evaluation is to be made both of the expenditure and of the service provided. Further, it needs to be asked will any more of these grants be made? Will the Youth Accommodation Coalition be notified in the future when a grant is to be made? In particular, I wonder if this problem is occurring only in Western Australia or is money to be handed out with such apparent lack of consultation and concern for the immediate needs of the homeless young people in other States? I do not wish to attack any organisation helping to house homeless young people. They all fill a very important role. But from information I have been given I believe there is a need for much greater attention to evaluation of the effects of money spent in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We hear it from the honourable member for Burke. He says that is absolutely true. Of course, he must be forgetting about the very real example we have in front of us at the moment in New South Wales. New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory as a consequence, are suffering very real disadvantages, very real shortages of electricity because of union action. It is precisely that sort of situation which the Victorian Government has managed to prevent to a very large extent not only with better planning than the New South Wales Labor Government but also with some very effective industrial legislation which it has been possible to use at key points in order to ensure that essential supplies and services flow to the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would point first to the Vital Projects Act which was available when the Newport power station was being built. At the time of the construction of that power station we received many representations and suggestions from people who thought that this station was not needed. I think we can draw a great deal from the New South Wales experience at the present time. The present situation shows that the Newport power station was very badly needed. Indeed, Victoria would be very badly off and New South Wales would be very badly off if it were not for that power station. The Newport power station was able to be built because of the Vital Projects Act which enabled its construction to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Construction of the very large Loy Yang power station complex was started within a very short time-indeed, within one working day-of the Wrongs (Public Projects) Act being introduced into the Parliament. The Wrongs Act in this instance was used to guarantee power supplies later in this decade. The Wrongs Act enables the Minister or the statutory authority concerned to take action to recover damages which have been incurred as a result of irresponsible union action. As a result of the introduction of that Act into the Victorian Parliament, the Loy Yang power staton complex was able to be got underway after some very irresponsible blocking action. The Labor Opposition in Victoria is committed to the repeal of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we saw the use of the Essential Services Act last July when the Transport Workers Union held up supplies, including rather incredibly milk, to the Victorian community. Milk supplies had usually been exempted from previous industrial action by the Transport Workers Union. Milk began flowing to the community within half an hour of orders being made arising out of the Essential Services Act. That legislation allowed that crippling transport and waterfront dispute to be broken last year for the benefit of the Victorian community. Furthermore, we have the example of the secret ballots legislation in Victoria. We have not yet really seen this legislation properly tested. Nevertheless, it does provide a basis of protection for the rights of individuals. It gives some unions which would seek to trample on the rights of individuals cause to think carefully about any action they may take in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Labor Opposition is committed to repealing all four pieces of legislation. These three pieces of legislation have been demonstrated to be of importance to the welfare of the Victorian community in emergency situations. They are reasonable and responsible pieces of legislation which are not used often or in an irresponsible way. They are not called upon without just cause. They are available for government to use if an emergency situation arises. It is disgraceful to think that the Victorian ALP has committed itself to the repeal of the legislation. It is obviously ignoring the welfare of the Victorian community. The Victorian Labor Opposition's position is largely explainable because of the attitude taken by the Victorian Socialist Left of which some members opposite, including the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous), are a part. They have influenced the Victorian ALP to take this irresponsible attitude in response to the urgings of the Halfpennys and the Gallaghers of this world rather than in response to the urgings of responsible and moderate elements of the trade union movement and in response to the Victorian community generally. </PARA>

<PARA> Dear Mr Charles, Having watched on TV and read in the newspapers, the horrific slaughter of harp seal pups, I would like you to petition the Prime Minister to ban the import of all seal products and also all Canadian goods, until the killing of these harp seal pups no longer takes place. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is one from Beaumaris, which in part states:</PARA>
<PARA> Please try hard for the banning of the Canadian hide, leather, meat and seafood products in the interests of all Australian citizens and of the love they cherish for the harp seals. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is one from two students in Mentone:</PARA>
<PARA> After viewing the 'John Laws World' documentary on Thursday 11 March at 7.30 p. m. Channel 10, entitled, 'The Hunt Without Pity' about the slaughter of Canadian harp seals, we would like to express our deepest disgust and total abhorrence-</PARA>
<PARA>That letter continues. I have a letter from Frankston which in part states:</PARA>
<PARA> Sir, I have just witnessed the most horrific scenes that I have ever had the misfortune to see. It was the blatant killing of innocent baby animals, simply for the sake of the almighty bloody dollar. </PARA>
<PARA>I have many more letters including some that go into greater detail than the ones I have read. They are just a sample of the protests that come not only from my electorate of Isaacs but also from right around Australia and, as I mentioned , right around the world. I have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) and the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) asking them to take up with the Canadian Government this subject of the slaughter of baby harp seals. I urge them now in this Parliament to do so and I ask the Canadian Government sincerely to look at the situation so that we can look forward to the banning of this unfortunate slaughter of around 100,000 baby harp seals every year. I find the whole event-if I can put it that way; it does occur every year-a rather disgraceful blight on society, not only on the Canadian society but also on the human race. I hope that the vast majority of Australians support my petition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Almost 12 months ago I spoke in the adjournment debate about the problem of parallel scheduling of flights by the two domestic airlines. Following that, I contacted both airlines and I had responses from the managers of both to the extent that, once the new generation of aircraft were put into the air, parallel scheduling would cease. At this stage, we have not seen the cessation of parallel scheduling that I would have liked to note. In fact, there has been very little movement at all in this respect. Certainly, some flights of the two airlines leave at almost the same time, with a variation of about five, 10 or 15 minutes. But there has been nothing of note that has given me any reason to think that the airline companies have done anything in this regard. Worse still, the recent decision of the Wran Government in New South Wales to continue daylight saving for an additional month has thrown all schedules into crisis. The amazing thing is that, where parallel scheduling existed before, both companies have seen fit to take off certain flights at the same time because of the crisis. As a result, the situation for a place such as Mackay, which was serviced through to Brisbane with afternoon flights, is that all of a sudden, because of the crisis through daylight saving in New South Wales, those flights have been withdrawn at exactly the same time. In fact, in order to be here for a 2 o'clock commencement on a Tuesday sitting day, I have to leave Mackay at 11.45 a.m. on the Monday. I do not think this is good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not yet had the advantage of seeing the schedules of one airline for the coming winter session but I have certainly seen the ones for the other airline. I hope that the system that we saw introduced to overcome the crisis with daylight saving will not be continued later. Certainly, I draw to the attention of the airlines that the majority of Australians believe that there should not be the parallel scheduling that has gone on in the past. As both companies have adopted the new generation of aircraft they should commence separate scheduling. If it is not possible to that extent, perhaps each company could take turns about each month to make sure that there is a greater servicing of the Australian public through different timings. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also spoken in the adjournment debate in the past about smoking on aircraft or smoking in public places. I understand that the statistics prove that 70 per cent of people do not smoke but are allowed to suffer because of the 30 per cent who do. I do not think anybody believes that a person who smokes does not have the right do so. But I think the 70 per cent who do not smoke also have the right to be able to breathe air free of pollution by those people who do smoke. I was very interested in a letter that appeared during the week in a major Australian publication, the Bulletin, which exemplifies the problem that we poor 70 per cent feel in this regard. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I have just emerged, gasping and sore-eyed, from the smoke-filled interior of a domestic airliner. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is gratifying to see a steady increase in the number of non-smoking seats one must ask: 'When is Australian airline management going to have enough courage to ban completely this ultra-selfish habit?'</PARA>
<PARA> Please understand that I do feel considerable sympathy for smokers as a group-</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure that I do-</PARA>
<PARA>I have witnessed desperate attempts by friends to shake off this distressing addiction-</PARA>
<PARA>I have also known people in that regard-</PARA>
<PARA>but I do object to having to share their discomfort by being forced to breathe their pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> To allow any 'smoking' seats at all in aircraft only encourages the continuation of this anti-social habit and does not convey adequately to the smoking minority the disapproval which most non-addicts feel. Smoking should be placed officially in the category of those things which are done only by consenting adults in private. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the last 12 months we have seen dramatic increases in air fares as a result , among other things, of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. I believe that the compartmentalisation of the non-smokers away from the smokers is additional cost to the fare which is not warranted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make one remark about the comments by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer). I think that the Victorian people will determine quite clearly whether they prefer the confrontation nonsense approach to industrial relations that he outlined or the kind of approach based on negotiations among employers, employees and government. The result will bear out which is the best approach to achieve harmony in industrial relations. Should, by any terrible misdeed, there be a re-election to power of the Victorian Liberal Government, which I do not foresee, Victoria would be in for a period of industrial disharmony of the kind which has never been envisaged in the State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leaving that point aside, what I want to talk about is the announcement at a meeting of the Ministers for immigration and ethnic affairs in Hobart on 12 March of the decision to set up a special action plan to help migrant women who are suffering from the problems of marriage breakdown and associated welfare problems. I am rather sad that this has happened in Australia 30 years or more after the wave of migration began. The problem has been with us for more than two generations. It is somewhat late at this time for the Ministers to get together and talk about an action plan. Nevertheless, it is better later than never. I welcome the action plan and I hope that certain positive developments will come out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that it will look at is the role of women's refuges in assisting migrant women. For the Commonwealth Government at least to show some interest in women's refuges is quite extraordinary given the kind of action which was taken last year by the razor gang in which responsibility for women's refuges was completely dropped by the Federal Government and put into the hands of the States to deal with in whatever way they chose. At that time many women's groups around the nation complained bitterly that this would result in reductions in funding for women's refuges and this has in fact happened in several States. But, with respect to the problems of migrant women coming to these refuges, the fact is that in the past no facilities have been provided. The refuges have not had the funds to be able to deal with migrant women nor have they had qualified people who understand the kinds of cultural problems that arise in marriage breakdowns of people from different cultures, especially Southern European, Middle Eastern and Asian cultures. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the traditional marriage set-up is considered to be a much stronger bond amongst quite a few of these ethnic communities; yet the pressures they have had to face within the Australian situation have led to considerable breakdown in these communities. For example, in the Turkish community in Victoria there are serious problems of breakdown of marriage. The women, because they know very little about how to cope with this situation, are forced into total isolation. In my electorate, some of them have not even been provided with the facilities to enable them to get around by public transport. For various reasons the husband has left his wife and the wife has been left in the home to cope with the children without any welfare services. If the Government is really serious about wanting to do something in this area, it needs to think very hard about increasing the number of ethnic social workers and those working specifically on these sorts of problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 6 May 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to the serious design and construction defects in over 30 Canberra schools and colleges and in other public buildings in the Australian Capital Territory and that this has been the subject of hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. If so, why is it proposed that building industry regulation be reduced instead of increased.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The National Capital Development Commission, which is the authority responsible for the construction of schools, colleges and most other public buildings in the Australian Capital Territory, is aware that some minor problems have arisen because of the excessive demands placed on the natural and mechanical ventilation systems by the occupants of some of the buildings concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> These problems are not in any way related to the requirements of building regulations administered by the Department of the Capital Territory. The regulations which are prescribed under the Building Ordinance for private enterprise construction in the Territory do not apply to buildings erected for the Commonwealth by the National Capital Development Commission or the Department of Housing and Construction.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is not possible to provide the honourable member with a list of functions to be reduced. The nature and extent of the building regulatory functions of the Department of the Capital Territory, which are to be reduced as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, are being discussed by officers of the Department with building industry organisations including the Master Builders' Association, Housing Industry Association, Confederation of A.C .T. Industry and the Trades and Labour Council of the A.C.T.</PARA>
<PARA> These discussions have the objectives of examining the extent of building industry regulations applying in the Territory and making recommendations on those controls and procedures which might be reduced or rationalised.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A precondition to any reduction of functions is that appropriate safety requirements be maintained.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) All registered organisations monitor contributors' claims. I am advised that the following health insurance organisations employ special monitoring systems for the detection of overservicing and fraud by medical practitioners:</PARA>
<PARA> A.M.A. Health Fund Limited</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Natives' Association</PARA>
<PARA> Commercial Banking Company Health Society, The</PARA>

<PARA> National Health Services Association of South Australia</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland Teachers' Union Health Society</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. The particulars shown in the following table are based on information supplied by Divisional offices of my Department from an examination of their records. These records were not designed to provide the information requested but those cases located have been shown. It is possible that the table does not list every case referred by a fund, between January 1978 and September 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that any action taken by my Department in respect of doctor and referred by one of the funds is not always taken solely as a result of the referral. In many cases, my Department is already aware of apparent irregularities in a doctor's claiming pattern at the time of a referral from a fund, and appropriate action is under way.</PARA>
<PARA> NOTE: An abbreviated description of my Department's responses is included in the table. An expansion of the terms used under RESPONSE in the table is provided below.</PARA>
<PARA> Reviewed: In response to a complaint about a particular doctor, statistical data are gathered on the doctor's claiming pattern and analysed for apparent irregularities. Where it appears that fraud may be involved and further action by way of investigation is required, the matter is referred to Departmental investigation personnel. Where there is sufficient indication that overservicing may be involved, the matter is referred to a Medical Counsellor. Information arising from a review of medial benefit claims which is insufficient to justify either course of action is normally recorded and re-evaluated if additional information is subsequently received.</PARA>
<PARA> Investigated: Where the information received from the fund and that arising from a review of claims indicate that possible fraud or overservicing may be involved, the case is referred to Departmental Investigators. Following detailed examination of available information, an investigator will normally recommend one of the following courses of action:</PARA>
<PARA> the undertaking of patient interviews where fraud is suspected;</PARA>
<PARA> the referral to Medical Counsellors where overservicing is suspected;</PARA>
<PARA> referral to a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry (MSCI) where the doctor has previously been counselled, or where he has been before a Committee previously, or where there are indications of gross overservicing.</PARA>
<PARA> If patient interviews are undertaken where fraud is suspected, investigators will ascertain whether there are substantial grounds for referral of the case to the Australian Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA> Referred to AFP: Where evidence acquired by Departmental investigators indicates there are substantial grounds for referral, the case is referred to the Australian Federal Police for fraud investigation and possible prosecution. The referral indicates the alleged breaches and is accompanird by all documentation obtained in support of the allegations such as patient statements.</PARA>
<PARA> Referred to Medical Counsellor: Where a review or investigation indicates that overservicing may be involved, the information is usually referred to a Departmental Medical Counsellor for examination. If he considers that excessive services may have been rendered he will normally discuss the matter with the doctor concerned. If the Medical Counsellor considers that there was overservicing he will counsel the doctor. If the doctor does not respond to counselling (as indicated by the pattern of claims received for his services in the months immediately following counselling), his case is likely to be referred to an MSCI.</PARA>
<PARA> Referred to MSCI: Following unsuccessful counselling, or where extreme overservicing is indicated following an investigation of claims, a case is referred to an MSCI to determine whether particular services are considered to be excessive (that is, not reasonably necessary for the adequate medical care of the patients concerned).</PARA>

<PARA> (1) In Dr Mulcahy's letter it is stated that men who claimed exposure to Agent Orange were those subjected to cytogenetic examination.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The letter would indicate that Malathion and Agent Blue were not specifically considered because the subjects were self selected and the author had no control over selection in relation to alleged exposure.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Neither my Department nor I have any evidence that Agent Blue causes chromosomal damage. My Department has a number of reports of studies of the possible mutagenicity of Malathion. The results of these studies are inconsistent and do not sustain the interpretation that Malathion is mutagenic.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) None. Benefits towards the cost of paramedical services such as those rendered by chiropractors are paid from anciliary tables conducted by registered health funds. There is no specific provision in the health insurance legislation relating to the operation of ancillary tables. Accordingly, health funds, including Medibank Private, are largely free to determine for themselves the nature and extent of the services for which anciliary benefits are payable, in light of contributor demand and their competitive position in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government does not stand in the way of any health fund that wishes to increase its ancillary benefits provided that contributions are sufficient to finance the benefits payable. In this, I am guided by the advice of the Registration Committee that is constituted under the National Health Act to make recommendations to me on such matters. This Committee includes a representative of the Commonwealth Actuary.</PARA>
