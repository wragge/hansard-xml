<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does advice to the right honourable gentleman suggest that interest rates have peaked? If not, will he give an assurance that housing interest rates will be insulated from upward pressures on interest rates coming mainly from the professional money market? Will he specifically assure the Parliament that a further rise in home loan interest rates will not be postponed merely beyond the Lowe by-election and Victorian State election, just as interest rate rises were held back in late 1980 until after the Federal and Queensland elections?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="509" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Government has made it quite plain that it is giving a good deal of attention to this particular problem. Both the Treasurer and I in recent days have sought to point out that the arrangements that have served Australia well over about 30 years in encouraging home ownership and in lifting home ownership from around 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the Australian community are not acting as effectively today as they have, largely because of higher interest rates. I think we have also both given an indication that, because of the world environment, of which we are a part, and because of policies in other countries, it is unlikely that Australia will return to the economic environment of the 1950s and 1960s and therefore that the circumstances are changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we need to do is to examine very carefully policies related to housing which are designed to encourage home ownership. We have sought to point out that there are two basic problems: Firstly, how to achieve adequate money flows so that sufficient loans can be made on reasonable terms; and, secondly, how to make sure that those loans are provided at a price that people can afford. The objective of home ownership is one that Liberal governments have pursued assiduously over a long period. It is my firm belief that they would want to continue doing so. The circumstances are quite different today.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of last week's Premiers Conference, one of the things that we have asked the States to do at their meeting tomorrow is to see what suggestions they have for encouraging greater capital flows through permanent building societies and State savings banks which come within their province and are under their control. It will be interesting to see what views the States have in relation to that. It is very easy to come to the view that subsidies ought to be provided to lower the cost of housing loans. But unless consequential steps are taken to make sure that the capital for lending for housing is also increased the subsidy might only add further costs to the loan or money that is already there, thus driving up the cost of that money and providing no net benefit to the home builder or home purchaser. Therefore, we are seeking to have the States' views on these particular matters.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also relevant to try to get their views on the impact of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System as they affect State instrumentalities, such as the building societies and State savings banks - institutions that come within State law. I am not too sure that the States have given too much attention to the impact of those recommendations on their own authorities. I hope this will be addressed in their meeting that is being held, as I understand it, tomorrow. Obviously, their views will be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA> I think it ought to be pointed out that on the one hand the honourable gentleman asked that, if there were to be a change in interest rates for home loans, that not be delayed and on the other hand I think he asked that market forces be allowed to operate. That would seem to be consistent with the Campbell report. No doubt he is aware that many home interest rates are controlled at present. He would also be aware, I suppose, that his own leader does not support the thrust of his question because he advocates the control of all interest rates. The honourable gentleman cannot have it both ways; he cannot ask us to respond to market pressures in this area and at the same time support his own leader who suggests that there should be no market pressures at all in this area .</PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make is that those who have mortgages or home loans or who want to have home loans should discount totally the vastly irresponsible and unreasonable scare tactics of the Premier of New South Wales who suggested that interest for home loans would go to 18 per cent. The only thing that could give any validity to that is if Mr Wran were going to lift the interest rates of the New South Wales permanent building societies or savings banks to 18 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see a statement of the nature to which the honourable member referred; in fact a Press release issued last night by the honourable member for Wills. This was disappointing in view of the lecture we had on how this was a non-political issue and how when the Parliament was sitting matters relating to the Community Youth Support Scheme should be raised in the Parliament and not be the subject of Press releases. However, the statement to which the honourable member for Cook referred accused the Government of a lack of sincerity in this matter and announced to the world in a scare-mongering fashion that the Government was about to terminate one-third of the Community Youth Support Scheme projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, the true situation is that the Government has been taking advice from the State advisory committees and from its own officials on this matter and had decided, in fact, before the honourable member for Wills issued his scandal- mongering statement, to continue funding the projects under this scheme to a substantial extent. In fact, some 95 per cent of the projects will receive additional and increased funds and travelling allowances for the participants until the end of June when, of course, the new system comes into operation. The situation is that of the 271 projects currently in existence the Government will continue funds for 260. As I have said, the appropriation for each of the projects will be increased to the extent of about 10 per cent in most cases and a further 5 per cent for the travelling allowances of the participants. It remains for me to say that if the honourable member for Wills had been consistent with his protestations of a non-partisan attitude on this matter and had had the decency to raise the matter with me instead of issuing a Press statement, I would have been able to inform him of these facts.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, may I say that it is now a matter for the project officers and the committees to respond to the confidence that the Government has now placed in them to ensure that this system continues to work well and that the projects serve the real needs of young unemployed people in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Prime Minister to his suggestion to the Premiers last week that they should consider controlling cash management trusts in order to increase funds available for housing. In view of his qualification yesterday that he was not suggesting that the States use legislative controls, how does he intend that the States should control cash management trusts? Is it a fact that the States cannot implement meaningful controls over cash management trusts? Is it also a fact that the most effective means of controlling the activities of such trusts and redirecting funds for housing is for the Commonwealth immediately to proclaim Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act, which gives the Commonwealth wide- ranging powers to control all financial institutions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="510" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret to say that the honourable gentleman has been inadequately advised. Even if Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act were proclaimed, it would not give the Commonwealth control over cash management trusts which are established under State law. The point in mentioning cash management trusts at the Premiers Conference last week was to emphasise to the Premiers the point that changes in the capital markets had pulled money away from savings banks and permanent buildings societies and to make the point that some of this had occurred not in relation to matters that are within the legislative power of the Commonwealth but in relation to matters which are very firmly within the legislative power of the States. It was necessary, indeed, to make the point that the States have responsibilities in these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are organisations established under State law-the permanent building societies, again, and the State savings banks-which are affected by State decisions. In some States they are given some capacity to compete; in other States they are fairly rigidly controlled. But if there is to be a genuine attempt by governments to achieve a greater flow of capital for housing, so that the very high home ownership ratio in Australia can be maintained, quite plainly the States have some role in that. I believe the very fact that the Victorian Premier has called a meeting of Premiers-even though I understand that Mr Wran will not be present-is recognition of the fact that the States have a very real role. I hope that they will give us some advice as to how they believe greater funds can be attracted into their own particular institutions for house lending purposes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BJ7">Mr MacKENZIE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry, relates to the plant variety rights legislation. What has transpired since the Minister met with the Australian Agricultural Council recently, when it was reported that certain States, namely, I think, New South Wales and Tasmania, claimed that he had overruled the Council and that they required more time for consideration of the proposed legislation? Has the Minister considered any changes to the legislation, perhaps in relation to merit assessment along the lines already applicable in relation to the Australian Herbage Plant Cultivars Register? When may we anticipate that this legislation will come before the House?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr NIXON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read with some interest claims made by the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that I had overriden the wishes of the Agricultural Council in respect of a decision that I announced at the Agricultural Council meeting to proceed with the plant variety rights policy and program. At an Agricultural Council meeting some six months ago, I indicated to the Council that, if there were not agreement amongst the States, I would take the views of the States into account in coming to a decision. At the Agricultural Council meeting in Adelaide the other day it became clear that the great majority of the States wanted to proceed with the legislation. South Australia, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were in favour of it. Tasmania gave long ideological reasons-they were mostly party political-why it was not in favour and New South Wales sat on the fence. The New South Wales Minister must be feeling very sore where he sits because he squirmed around so much trying to find reasons why he could not be in favour of it. He finally came to a conclusion, after I had announced that in light of the views taken by the States I would proceed with the legislation in the House and arbitrate the issue as I said I would do. The New South Wales Minister promptly jumped on what he likes to think is a bandwagon of public appeal. He said that I was overriding the views of the Agricultural Council. The fact is that the great majority of the States wish to proceed, and as far as I am aware there is a unanimous view amongst industry organisations that the legislation ought to proceed. Even State organisations such as the Tasmania Farmers and Graziers Co- operative Society Ltd sent me a telex pointing out that the Tasmanian Minister was not expressing its view accurately if he opposed the scheme. In view of the almost unanimous approach taken by these people, I decided that the Bill ought to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the latter part of the honourable member's question, there will not be merit testing. It has never been thought that there should be. The honourable member also asked about any amendments. Having regard to the fact that Tasmania and New South Wales have said that they now oppose the scheme-I think they are using the words 'in its present form' but I am not sure what they mean by that- I have written them a letter and invited them to send amendments to me so that we may consider them on the floor of the House during debate on the Bill. When the Bill will come into the House is a matter for the Leader of the House. I will try to get an accurate answer to that part of the question for the honourable member.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A top management review of the Department of Transport by the Public Service Board has been in progress for the last 18 months and is now nearing its conclusion. At a recent meeting of the Aviation Industry Advisory Council I raised the question of a restructure of the Department with representatives of the aviation industry. They decided to set up a small sub-committee to examine the current structure and to make some input to the discussion that has been taking place within the Department and between the Secretary and myself. We have taken note of the views of the aviation industry, and those views have been taken up by the Secretary to the Department in discussions with the Public Service Board. A firm proposal has been put to the Public Service Board for the establishment of a discrete office of civil aviation which will cover the policy and operational aspects of aviation. It will be headed by a senior officer of the Second Division of the Public Service. It is intended that that officer will have direct access to the Minister but will be responsible to the Secretary to the Department, who has the statutory responsibility for aviation safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Secretary has also placed before the Public Service Board other proposals relating to surface transport administration in the Department. It is intended that it should also be an office of surface transport administration. A number of divisions will be amalgamated in the course of this review. I would expect the Public Service Board to be in a position to make some announcement about this in the very near future. I know that there will be further discussions between the Secretary to the Department of Transport and the Chairman of the Public Service Board early next week. I hope we will then be in a position to make firm announcements as to how the office of civil aviation will operate. Of course, the position of the senior officer will have to be advertised in accordance with the normal procedures of the Public Service Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that an overall increase of $20 a week in home loan repayments has been inflicted on home buyers in the past two years? Is it also a fact that Commonwealth expenditure on housing has been cut by a massive 70 per cent under this Government? Will the Government give immediate priority to Australians' desire to own their own home?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="512" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it would be possible to make an overall judgment about the increased repayments as a result of interest rate changes because it depends on the circumstances of each borrower, the time at which a borrower took out the loan and, obviously, the amount of the loan. There are people who have taken out a loan in the recent period-maybe in the last two or three years-and who could be in a worse position. But a person who took out a loan five or six years ago and made the normal repayments in the period since is probably in a better position than he would have been when he originally took out the loan. So the areas of greatest difficulty are probably those concerning people who have just taken out a loan in recent times or those who are not able to afford a loan at the current cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one is looking at the support that the Commonwealth provides for housing it is necessary to look not only at the direct payments to the States under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement but also at the $125m provided this year and the significantly greater amount that we will be providing next year in support for single income pensioners who pay rent and who have very little other income. That is obviously very real support for individuals who would obviously qualify, in most people's minds, for welfare housing. The payment is made direct to the individual and it is money laid out, I believe, under the general heading of welfare housing. In addition to this, the homes savings grants and the support for defence service homes are also funds that the Commonwealth has laid out in a very substantial manner in general support for housing. Subject to correction, I believe that the Commonwealth's budgetary outlays for housing in the last Budget increased by about 17 per cent, which is a significant increase in real terms.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman very much. I will take that as a compliment. The Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions that looked at this matter determined that there was an absolute prospect for the Australian Wool Testing Authority to carry out its function if it operated in a private sector way instead of as a Commonwealth statutory organisation. The upshot of it is that at some peak employment periods of the year there will be some 600 fewer Commonwealth public servants on the payroll of the Commonwealth Public Service. People have lost track of the fact that the AWTA is a statutory authority of this Parliament. It is a Commonwealth body set up under the Wool Industry Act. All its facilities and employees are owned and controlled by the Australian Wool Corporation which is also a statutory authority set up by this Parliament. Transferring this organisation to the private sector removes one of the quasi- autonomous national government organisations about which I have heard members of the Opposition and Senate committees complaining. It can carry out its function with all the integrity and skills that presently apply. I do not think the wool industry will even know that there has been a transfer as far as the matter of its integrity is concerned. It will maintain its international reputation and do its job just as well-a very successful operation, even if I say so myself.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fair enough to say that the Japanese are not only concerned about the shipping of steaming coal but also about the reliability of our shipping of coking coal. Our coal export performance during 1981 was not something to be admired. We had tremendous hold-ups along the waterfronts and this irritated the Japanese immensely. If one is responsible for keeping a large power station or a steel works operating in Japan, one cannot be put to the vagaries of when supplies are likely to arrive. One has to have a guaranteed source of supply and know that it will arrive regularly. I do know that as a result of our performance last year the Japanese are giving greater attention to getting their coking coal from places such as Canada and the United States of America. They are also certainly looking around to see what other sources of steaming coal there are. In the interests of developing our coal industry, be it steaming or coking coal, I hope that the unions that have caused so much of this trouble-in many cases as a result only of demarcation disputes between the unions-might realise the damage that they are doing to those industries that employ a lot of people and also to Australia's reputation as a trader. Our balance of payments situation is not comfortable. We need to maintain a high level of exports. It is in the overall interest of the nation and of our fellow Australians.

<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand, as I recall it, asked the Prime Minister whether a particular request from the banks for an increase had been received. That was my understanding of what the honourable gentleman asked. Such a request , if it had been made, would normally not have been conveyed to the Prime Minister nor to me but to the Reserve Bank of Australia which administers controls under the Banking Act and approves variations in the ceiling after consultation with me on behalf of the Government. To the best of my recollection no specific request for a particular variation has been made to the Reserve Bank in recent times. I shall, of course, check that and inform the House if my recollection is faulty. But I can simply confirm that in no way would such a request have been made to the Prime Minister and as a consequence his answer to the honourable member for Gellibrand was in all respects completely accurate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the question from the honourable gentleman because my information is that the preliminary indications are that bankruptcies in 1980 -81 will show the lowest rate of increase for some years. At the same time, to put the question in perspective, the House should be aware that new business formations continue to increase at a very satisfactory rate. The honourable gentleman refers specifically to Victoria. I inform him that actual new business registrations in Victoria in 1980-81 were 31,000, an average of around 125 per working day. This is a 6 per cent increase on 1979-80 when 29,000 new businesses were registered compared with 688 business bankruptcies. I might also say that almost 19,100 new companies were incorporated in Victoria in 1980-81 and that, for the information of the honourable gentleman, happens to be 30 per cent higher than four years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Starting a new business, of course, is no sinecure. It is a fact of life that some businesses will not make the grade. The important point to be made in response to the honourable gentleman is that only a small proportion of Australia's small business owners wind up bankrupt. On the basis of information provided to me by my Department and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, the odds against that happening appear to be lengthening. The fact of the matter is that at the present time that is an example of a strong Australian economy. It is an indication of the success of our fiscal and monetary policies. There is no doubt that at the present time more Australians are finding it worthwhile to go into business for themselves and more are making a success of it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From time to time the Government has looked at the relevance of having a migration office in Zimbabwe. So far we have not thought it appropriate to do so, for several reasons. First of all, the principal barrier to migration is the foreign exchange limitation imposed by the Zimbabwe Government, about which we can do nothing. In fact, access to Pretoria is quite easy, infinitely easier than is access to, say, Damascus from Beirut and in other parts of the world that have to put up with a similar situation. We simply cannot maintain migration offices all around the world. So far persons in Zimbabwe seeking to migrate have had no difficulty of which I am aware in going to Pretoria. They do have the problem of deciding whether to leave without their assets if they are accepted for migration. If the honourable member is aware of any cases of people who have had difficulty I would be pleased to look into them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept as accurate the figures cited by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. They do not mean that the Australian capital market is short of funds. What they mean is that if we are to have the rate of growth in the Australian economy that I understand members of the Australian Labor Party in their more rational moments also support we must have capital from abroad. As a nation we simply do not save enough and we do not have enough capacity amongst Australian corporations to provide the sort of economic growth and the sort of economic development that I understand it to be the desire of the Australian community to have. We cannot, on the one hand, run a foreign investment policy- an economic policy that depends upon the contribution by foreigners to the development of this country-and, on the other hand, deny those contributors access to loan funds from our capital market and expect them to stay here. To claim that it is possible to do that is an absolute absurdity; it does not make any sense.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Has the downturn in international airline traffic had any significant effect on the number of overseas visitors coming to Australia? Is the Minister still confident that $1 billion will be spent by visitors to this country this year? Has the downturn affected the massive expansion of hotel building programs throughout the Commonwealth?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="516" SPEAKER="Lynch The Rt Hon Sir P.R." NAMEID="YI7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="FLINDERS" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI7">Sir PHILLIP LYNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman is certainly correct in referring to the downturn which has taken place in recent years in the international tourist industry. That is having some effect upon the number of visitor arrivals in Australia. Having said that, I should certainly emphasise to the House that the increase in the number of visitor arrivals in recent years and those we expect during the current calendar year will see the arrival of one millon visitors to Australia. At the same time I put on the record that our estimate is that they will spend approximately $1 billion. Despite the downturn in international tourist flows, confidence in the industry remains very strong indeed. This, I think, is very starkly reflected in the tremendous boom which has taken place recently in planned tourist accommodation. According to the latest survey by the Cordell group, the value of projects in this area stood at some $1.5 billion in September 1981. That happens to be an increase of 11 1/2 per cent over the June 1981 total. At the same time, accommodation takings have increased strongly. For hotels, motels and caravan parks they were 20 per cent higher in the September 1981 quarter than they were a year earlier. But, for these prospects to continue to be assured, I would certainly remind the House of the need for a stable cost structure in the industry and the need for stability in the industry's industrial relations pattern. This has been an enormous problem for entrepreneurs in the Australian tourist industry during the past year or two. I believe it is important that both employers and, certainly, the trade unions recognise the need for stability in the industrial relations area because if there is one thing that can certainly interrupt the flow of tourist traffic to Australia it is the uncertainty and unpredictability caused by overseas visitors not being absolutely sure that they can arrive on time and leave according to their holiday itinerary.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, if I make an error at any time and call from one side of the House twice in a row, immediately the Whip or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will come to me and say: 'You have made an error'-because it has been the will of the House to call alternately. I think it is a reasonable proposition that the House ought to examine the question whether supplementary questions will be allowed, but I will not go against the will of the House, as expressed during the 26 years that I have been here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to inform the House of decisions I have taken not to accept two recommendations of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to revoke deportation orders against Mr Luigi Pochi and Mr Vincenzo Barbaro. I do so because of the significance for public administration of a decision to reject a recommendation of the Tribunal. The Tribunal represents a method of external review which allows people to challenge a wide range of decisions on their merits made by public servants and Ministers alike, thus affording a high level of protection of individual rights. I believe there are few countries in the world which allow people, convicted of a criminal offence, such a wide ranging review of deportation before a person of the calibre of an Australian Federal Court Judge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe Ministers ought rarely to reject recommendations after such a review, but for the reasons which I will outline, I feel obliged to do so in these two cases. My predecessor signed deportation orders against Mr Pochi and Mr Barbaro following their convictions for supplying Indian hemp. They were both charged with this offence after they were each found by police on huge marihuana plantations in New South Wales. Both men applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of my predecessor's decisions to deport them. In each case the Tribunal recommended revocation of the deportation orders. Because Mr Justice Brennan formulated principles in the Pochi case which were seen to have serious implications for following cases, my predecessor, acting on legal advice , appealed to the Federal Court. The decision of the Federal Court did not fully resolve the issues and on the basis of legal advice I sought leave to appeal to the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The High Court refused special leave to appeal. It did so on the ground that its decision in the case would not be binding on the Minister. Since the Minister is not bound to give effect to a recommendation by the Tribunal to revoke a deportation order, he is therefore left with the ultimate responsibility to determine whether it is in the public interest that a criminal be deported. In doing so, he must, of course, take into account the recommendation of the Tribunal. The High Court said that the Minister is not required to accept as correct any views as to the facts or as to the weight of evidentiary material expressed by the Tribunal. Thus it is clear that the Minister is entitled to make up his own mind as to the weight he gives to the material before him and that he may take into account and make his decision on the basis of matters which the Tribunal did not think to be sufficiently established before it. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the handing down of the High Court's reasons, I called for a detailed briefing on the cases of Mr Pochi and Mr Barbaro. In relation to Mr Pochi, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal recommended revocation of the deportation order on several grounds. The main ground was that Mr Justice Brennan considered that the material before him did not warrant a positive finding that Mr Pochi was involved in commerce in marihuana. On this basis Mr Justice Brennan concluded that the hardship to the Pochi family which would arise as a result of deportation outweighed the benefits to be gained by the community from deportation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe however that my predecessor's decision to deport Mr Pochi was vindicated by the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking, known as the Woodward report. This report was not available at the time the Administrative Appeals Tribunal reviewed my predecessor's decision. In fact since that report was published the Tribunal has in two cases referred to findings in it in the course of upholding a decision to deport. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the findings of the Woodward report are very pertinent to the question of whether Mr Pochi should be allowed to remain in Australia and consequently, it is my duty as responsible Minister to take those findings into account. In his report Justice Woodward concluded that: Mr Pochi was a member of a secret Calabrian criminal organisation; he was a Canberra principal of that organisation; the organisation was directly responsible for a large quantity of marihuana cultivation and distribution; several of Mrs Pochi's relatives were also members of the organisation; the growing of the marihuana for the organisation was supervised from Griffith principally by Mr Pochi's brother-in- law and business partner, Mr Antonio Sergi; the distribution and marketing of the drug on behalf of the organisation was supervised principally by Mr Pochi's other business partner, Mr Robert Trimboli; the organisation was responsible for the disappearance and murder of Donald Bruce Mackay. </PARA>
<PARA>What the Woodward report had to say about several of Mrs Pochi's relatives is relevant both to the risk of Mr Pochi's further involvement in the organisation and to the impact upon her of his deportation. The Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking revealed that Mr and Mrs Pochi had acquired assets far in excess of their legitimate income. The Royal Commission and indeed the Tribunal itself did not accept the Pochis' explanation as to how they acquired those assets. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that any decision to deport a person is one which cannot be taken lightly. This is particularly so when the case concerns a person who has resided in Australia for many years. In such cases I need to take special care to satisfy myself that deportation is justified. Mr Pochi was advised that I intended to reconsider the question of his deportation in the light of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's recommendation in his case and the findings of the Woodward report. Mr and Mrs Pochi were given an opportunity to reply in writing and to present his case to me in person. In particular, they were invited to comment upon the findings of the Woodward report. Nothing which was put to me by or on behalf of the Pochis qualified-in my view-the findings of the Woodward Report. Accordingly I have concluded that although the hardship to Mr Pochi and his family as a result of deportation would be substantial, I am satisfied that, in view of his involvement in such an insidious organisation, his deportation is in the best interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Mr Vincenzo Barbaro, Mr Justice Fisher was satisfied that his involvement in the operation of the marihuana plantation where he was working at the time of his arrest was probably that of a farm labourer. Mr Justice Fisher stated that if Mr Barbaro's involvement was more than that of a farm labourer the scales would be weighted heavily in favour of deportation. The Woodward report concluded that Mr Barbaro was a member of the same organisation as Mr Pochi. Mr Justice Fisher referred to the Woodward report but considered that, on the evidence before him, he should not proceed on the basis that Mr Barbaro was involved as 'a trusted member of the Griffith organisation'. Having looked both at the Woodward report and at the findings of facts made by the Tribunal, I find myself persuaded that the involvement of Mr Barbaro was much more than that of a farm labourer. As I have said, it is clear from the High Court decision that I am entitled to make up my own mind as to the weight I place on the findings of the Woodward report, and that I am entitled to differ from the Tribunal. Because of his membership of the organisation and the nature of its activities I believe that a decision allowing Mr Barbaro to stay would be against the Australian public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Deportation is never ordered as a punishment and should not be accepted as a second punishment. Its purpose is to remove from the community persons who have demonstrated by their conduct that they are unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of Australians. I firmly believe that Mr Barbaro and particularly Mr Pochi present a risk to the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it clear that I do not lightly disregard the recommendations of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There have been 30 cases considered by the Tribunal where it has been recommended that a deportation order be revoked. Of these, only three recommendations, including those concerning Mr Pochi and Mr Barbaro, have not been accepted. In the third case, deportation did not eventuate because the person concerned was killed in an accident within a few days of my decision to reject the Tribunal's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard the last few years as being an important learning process for all concerned including the members of the Tribunal and me. The review process by the Tribunal has been of specific benefit in criminal deportation cases as it has required my Department to undertake more searching investigations before recommending deportation. This has resulted in greater protection to the individuals affected by deportation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noted several comments made by the Tribunal on the Government's policy relating to the deportation of persons convicted of criminal offences. As a result, I believe that the policy is possibly in need of some modification. I have requested my Department to examine the policy in the light of the Tribunal' s comments and to report to me. Any changes to the policy that might be approved by the Government relating to the deportation of persons convicted of criminal offences will be announced as soon as possible. The changes I contemplate would have no relevance to cases such as those of Messrs Pochi and Barbaro. </PARA>
<PARA> The decisions regarding Messrs Pochi and Barbaro have been difficult ones to make. I believe however that in the interests of the Australian community, no other proper course of action is open to me. </PARA>

I think it would be better for the House to listen to what the debate might bring out rather than to have the paper circulated right across Australia, with obvious damage done to a couple of families.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My interpretation of the motion is that the statement will go out carrying all the privileges of this Parliament. I cannot avoid saying here what I would say in reply to the statement: That it seems to me that some of the things in the statement will lend weight to accusations about the two people involved which have really not been found by any court. We are not a court and we are not pretending to be one. We are not establishing some jurisdiction over this matter this afternoon. But the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) does make reference in his statement to the disappearance and murder of Donald Bruce Mackay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are talking basically about the deportation of Mr Pochi and Mr Barbaro. Both of them have been before tribunals. A massive amount of evidence was given before these tribunals. Two Justices, Fisher and Brennan, sat on the tribunals and listened to all the matters that came before them. Not one skerrick of evidence went before those tribunals which linked those people directly with the disappearance and murder of Mr Mackay. It seems to me to be taking the matter to excess to use the privilege of Parliament to print a statement of that nature which may allow the media the luxury of being able to say that the deportees in some way or another were associated with it. That may give the public, who should be discussing this matter in the most rational and responsible way, a very coloured version of what is taking place in this Parliament this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Parliament ought to debate the matter because I am quite sure that there are many different points of view on the other side of the House, just as there are on my own side of the House. Many people in this Parliament are very concerned about what we are doing this afternoon. It is the first time we have done it. I suggest that to give imprimatur to the statement in some way that allows people outside this Parliament to interpret the statement to mean that the findings on these two people are other than what has been found to be correct by the tribunals, is really to give the Parliament a licence we should never grasp. For that reason, it seems to me that it is wrong for this Parliament to edify this material by saying that we are going to print the document separately from Hansard in order that people may give this very loose and incorrect interpretation of the facts involving these two people. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking this afternoon about two Australian families. We are talking about making a decision that will break up those families and the communities in which they live. It is a very serious matter. It seems to me to be far too serious to allow anybody outside this Parliament to interpret these matters as other than what they are. The people have been found guilty. They have served their sentences under the system of justice being adhered to in Australia and now the Parliament is taking note of the convictions in the way in which the Parliament has power to do under the Migration Act. It seems to me that what the Leader of the house (Mr Sinclair) has moved will give licence to the making outside this House of allegations against these people that would not stand up in any court in any democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I feel that I should explain to members of the House the reason for my insisting on this course of action. I think all honourable members realise that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) is exercising a discretion available to him under the legislation for which he, as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, is responsible. He has exercised that discretion. It is not a discretion that can be exercised by the Parliament. It is a discretion exercised by the Minister acting within the responsibilities he has under the Migration Act. Unless he has the ability to expose the reasons he has put down for the exercise of that discretion, he is in a position where the community at large does not know why he has so acted. I believe it essential that he be given the protection of being able to expose to the public view the reasons which he has put down for exercising that discretion. It is for that reason that I have moved this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The exercising of the powers of this Parliament with respect to the substance of the issues is, of course, the product of the debate which is to ensue. The Government does not wish to contain an opportunity for public debate of those issues. However, it is imperative for the Government, indeed for anybody exercising a discretion, to be able to expose the reasons for the exercise of that discretion. It is for that reason that the Government insists on giving him the protection of the Parliamentary Papers Act which is, of course, the essence of this resolution. I therefore commend the resolution to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true, as the honourable member for Newcastle says, that some members feel more strongly about it than others. I am sure that is the case amongst Government members; that they also have sufficient intelligence to be able to dissect all of the evidence that has been put before them and that there are varying views amongst them on this case. Mr Speaker, it is our intention later on to move an amendment to defer the deportation orders against Mr Pochi and Mr Barbaro in order that the Minister can put before this House the further evidence upon which he has based his decision and in order that the coronial inquiry which is pending in New South Wales on the disappearance and death of Donald Mackay can be carried out. If one goes to the essence of the allegation in the Minister's statement that Mr Pochi may be associated with an organisation responsible for the death and disappearance of Mr Mackay, it may be that Mr Pochi will be required as a witness in the pending investigation in New South Wales. That is something that ought to weigh heavily on the mind of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These two men, if they are deported, will be the first to be subjected to this type of decision. As the Minister so rightly points out, we have to take seriously the views of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We on this side of the House do not disagree with the Minister's having the ultimate responsibility for making decisions in these cases. We do not quarrel with that. We do quarrel with the Government's ignoring what the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had to say in both of these cases. By and large we would agree with the statement made by the Minister in regard to the process of deportation, which was released to the Press on 31 January 1980. He spent some time in saying that the national interest must be considered when we are talking about the deportation of people from this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement says, and quite correctly, that the two people are to be deported following their convictions for 'supplying Indian hemp'. Supplying is a misnomer for the offences which they committed. As I understand it, ' supplying' embraces a range of offences which may have been covered by the term. In the literal sense, they were not supplying Indian hemp. They were both found on projects where Indian hemp was being grown. It is a little unfortunate also that both men have been linked in this one statement. They were not on the same property. They do not come from the same area. As I understand it, they are not related. But they are being lumped together today in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that they have been convicted, and that the penalties have been carried out in Australia-Mr Pochi has served one year in an Australian prison and Mr Barbaro has served two years-means that, as far as Australian civil law is concerned, they have served the sentences for which they were convicted for the offences which they carried out. As I said earlier, deportation is the ultimate in the penalties that can be imposed on anyone. In this country 1.3 million people who are eligible for citizenship have not yet attended any of the ceremonies that would give them that status. It is a very serious matter to write laws or perhaps interpret laws which affect those 1.3 million people but which do not affect the other 13.7 million people who are Australian citizens. This is a problem that has to be faced by Australia as it has to be faced by countries such as the United States of America to which large numbers of migrants are going. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, both men are members of quite large Australian families. Mr Pochi has a wife and three children. The children were born in Australia. Mrs Pochi is an Australian citizen and their three children, who attend Catholic schools in Canberra, are all highly spoken of by their teachers and by the community, both Italian and Australian, in Canberra. Mr Barbaro has five children, all of whom were born in Australia, and a wife who is an Australian citizen. The evidence presented to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal warranted that the offences committed by these men be treated as run-of-the-mill offences committed by Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter to which the Minister referred and perhaps may have elaborated upon in his statement was his heavy reliance upon the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking known as the Woodward Commission. It is true that the findings of the Woodward Commission were not available to Justice Brennan in the case of Pochi. But a detective, Jenkins, who was attached to the Woodward Commission for 15 months, gave evidence in camera to Justice Brennan and Justice Brennan said he would not be persuaded by the evidence given to him by Jenkins to lead him to other than the decision he made to revoke the deportation order. So whilst it is technically true to say that the findings of the Woodward Commission were not available to Brennan, certainly a lot of evidence that was given to the Commission was available to him. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of Barbaro, all the evidence and findings of the Commission were available to Mr Justice Fisher and again he, like Justice Brennan, did not find it sufficient other than to revoke the deportation order. Therefore those matters have been attended to by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Both Brennan and Fisher placed great importance on the question of national interest. This question was part and parcel of the ministerial statement that was made in 1980. It is a matter with which to a very large extent the Opposition concurs. Both Brennan and Fisher could not find that it was in the Australian interest to deport these two people, to break up their families and their homes. Almost all of Barbaro's family have now left Italy. Most of his brothers and sisters and his parents have come to Australia. In fact, he has no relations at all back in Italy. The family of Pochi looks upon itself as an Australian family. Pochi has an added problem that is not referred to in the ministerial statement. This problem ought to be referred to because it is a departmental responsibility. Pochi on two occasions applied for citizenship. On one occassion approval was given for citizenship but notice was not given to Mr Pochi that that approval had been granted. In fact, if it had not been for minor bungling in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs back in 1975 Mr Pochi would have been an Australian citizen. He would have served his sentence after being convicted for supplying Indian hemp and he would now be back among the Australian community without any great concern apart from re-establishing himself in that community. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, there are many problems associated with what we are doing in the Parliament this afternoon. I must say that I dislike intensely the reference in the Minister's statement to matters contained in the Woodward report on drugs. I do not think that anybody who has gone through the reports of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal could refer in any way to these two people as being significant figures in what is described as the 'organisation' in the Minister's statement. I do not think it is possible to find in our hearts that Mr Pochi is guilty because he married a woman whose name is Maria Sergi. A person cannot be found guilty by association with a family which might be named later-years later; almost 20 years later-in association with a crime which all of us find repulsive and repugnant. Mr Pochi cannot be guilty by association because he married a woman called Maria Sergi. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure that we are not taking this action because we cannot get at the real culprits. I am not sure that we are not taking this action in the Parliament this afternoon because we all-every member of every parliament; every decent person in Australia-are terribly upset at what happened to Donald Mackay. But will this action lessen our guilt and ease our conscience? Will deporting two people who already have served their sentences for the crimes they have committed in Australia do that? It does not seem to me to overcome the problem at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that the Minister is correct in drawing attention to the most drastic parts of the Woodward Royal Commission report in order to fulfil and substantiate the decision he has taken to deport these two men. It may be-I do not know-that the Minister has other information which has not been put before the Parliament. In accordance with the convention of the Parliament, a copy of the Minister's statement was made available to us a short time before we came into the House. We have been going through the material that has been available to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. We have been going through what people in the community and the newspapers have had to say about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not our intention, nor should it be interpreted that it is our intention, to make a political football out of this most serious issue. What we want to do is to have future generations of Australians say that this was the first occasion on which the Parliament of Australia discussed this matter; that a very proper and rational decision was made; that it could be substantiated that it was a proper and rational decision; and that the decision could be looked upon as a precedent. In this case, I do not believe that the Minister's statement outlines a good example of action which we should follow. I would be much happier if we had a lot more material before us, if more time were given to the Parliament to discuss this matter. Perhaps we should even have a cooling off period. I know that people who have been involved in this will say that the matter has been going on for four years. Personally, I do not care if it goes on for 40 years, as long as we make the correct decision, as long as people do not say that every time someone who has not taken out Australian citizenship is caught in a way that is connected with Indian hemp in Australia that person will be deported. </PARA>
<PARA> In almost every respect, except for the right to vote for members of parliament , once we extend the great privilege of permanent residence to people, enabling them to live in Australia, they are treated almost as equals with Australian citizens. That is so except in this case. I do not think anyone would interpret the offence of these two people as being a major offence, judging from the sentence both men received. Yet the consequences of such people being caught committing such an offence hangs over their heads and affects their existence, their survival, their livelihood in Australia. On top of that, we can break up their families and deport them. It seems to me that the Parliament should give these matters a little more thought before we proceed further. A lot more material could be discussed in this Parliament. Consequently, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ''That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ''this House is of the opinion that the deportation orders against Mr Pochi and Mr Barbaro should be suspended pending:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) in the case of Mr Pochi, the production by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of further and more substantial reasons explaining how the findings of the Woodward Royal Commission differed, if at all, from the evidence supplied both in open court and in camera to Mr Justice Brennan at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal hearing;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) in the case of Mr Barbaro, the production by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of further and more substantial reasons explaining how the information available to him about the nature and extent of Mr Barbaro's involvement in commercial marihuana growing differed from material available to Mr Justice Fisher at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal hearing, and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) in both cases, the findings of the pending Coronial Inquiry in New South Wales into the death of Donald Mackay.''</PARA>
<PARA>I sincerely hope the Parliament sees the wisdom of that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment. In so doing, I appeal to the House to consider this matter very seriously because it is not just a question of deporting two people; it is a question of destroying the unity of two Australian families. I think it is something we should deliberate on very carefully indeed. I think it is a very sad day for not only the Pochi family but also the other family. I am not familiar with the case of the other family, but I am very familiar with the Pochi case. I think what has happened to the members of the Pochi family is a tragedy. I think it is also a very sad day for the cause of natural justice in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Pochi has been before the courts. He was convicted of a minor offence. He won appeals in three courts. He went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and won his case. He won his case in the Federal Court and, when the Commonwealth sought leave to appeal to the High Court, the Federal Court found in his favour in refusing leave to the Commonwealth to appeal. This person has been subjected to that trauma over several years. The whole family has been held in limbo. This has placed tremendous stresses on the husband and wife as well as the children as they have been going through their school years. Having survived all that, they would have felt resonably sure that the matter was finished, that Mr Pochi had paid his debt to society and would be free to stay in Australia. Of course, what is happening today would be quite impossible in America because the Bill of Rights there prevents double jeopardy or double punishment, which is precisely what is happening in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also very concerned about the delay in this case. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) will recall that he allowed me to bring the Pochis to Parliament House to see him before we rose last November. After hearing their story and my representations on their behalf, he did undertake to give a decision within two weeks. That was some three months ago. I would hate to think that these people had been held in limbo for a further three months to serve the purpose of cheap political advantage by bringing this matter on just before the Lowe by-election to show what tough people there are in this Government in relation to drug offences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why did the Minister not announce his decision earlier? Today we have had the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) saying: 'Let us print this document before we debate it'. He is pre-empting any effect that the debate may have. The Government wants to print it first and get it out into the electorate. It is all right to complain but that is what it looks like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) has said, the whole problem here is that the Minister has accepted hearsay evidence which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would not accept as a reason for deporting Mr Pochi. I think it is very unfair to the Pochis and to the other defendant that all this information has been given to the House today as though it were fact. It is not fact. It is hearsay evidence produced before a royal commission. The only thing that has been accepted as fact is the finding of the court which resulted in Mr Pochi being given a two-year gaol term. He was found on a farm cultivating marihuana. He did not have it in his hand. He was not selling it. He was not smoking it. He happened to be on the farm. That is a fact. This is hearsay evidence and it should not be presented to this House as fact. I am astounded that the Minister can accept hearsay evidence and present it to this Parliament as fact when a learned judge has said it is hearsay evidence which he cannot accept as a basis for deporting Mr Pochi. That is the gist of the whole case. The sad part about this case is that, having been through all these legal procedures, the Minister just overrides the decisions with a stroke of the pen. I am terribly disappointed. I know the Minister has had a difficult decision to make and he has taken a long time to make it. I also have reason to believe that , whilst he may have had some sympathy, other people in the Cabinet did not and that he was under tremendous pressure to deport these people. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing in the Minister's statement which I think is very misleading is the inference that these people had a lot of money and that they lived in some sort of luxury far beyond their means. The fact is that Pochi borrowed money to build a retail outlet for wine. One can speculate on what he was going to use it for but there is nothing mysterious about that. He borrowed money to erect a building from which he was going to retail wine. He had to withdraw from that when all this blew up. The Pochi family lived in a very modest house. It was not a luxurious house. It was very poorly furnished. I have been into their house. They have since had to sell the house to meet their legal expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> These people have been under this pressure for five years. They have been under constant pressure and constant threat. They have been in and out of the courts. They have spent over $30,000 on legal fees. If he was Mr Big, which they tried to claim he was, someone would have been backing him for his legal fees, but no one has. Pochi has had to sell his house. The whole family has had to go out and accept work at every opportunity. They have done cleaning work and painting work . The kids have bucked in and done odd jobs to try to get enough money for them to meet their obligations and to preserve their dignity in the community. They had a lot of dignity in this community. When this matter first blew up a petition was circulated and within a couple of days there were over a thousand names signed on the petition supporting the good character of the Pochi family. There is no question about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this House really has to think about how this decision is going to affect the family. I ask honourable members to think of a family they know with a wife, husband and three children one of whom is at university and the other two are at school. What is going to happen to the family? It is like sending a man to Siberia. This man has not been in Italy for years. He has no relatives there. His wife has no relatives there. Yet he is going to be sent off. What is going to happen to these people? It is going to be a tremendous wrench on them all and on all of their friends and relatives. This Government is just breaking up the family. What is it going to achieve? I think the big weakness in the Minister's argument as set out in the statement is that he has not really considered the fundamental question which could have justified his deporting Mr Pochi, and that is whether Pochi is likely to offend again. I suggested to the Minister that that was fundamental to the whole case. There is not the slightest shred of evidence that he would offend again. Nothing that he has done in the meantime would indicate that he would offend again. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Pochi family have lived a very poor life, a fairly mean life, in order to meet their obligations. They have embraced every opportunity to work and they have been able to meet their obligations as they have fallen due. He has not put a foot wrong legally or in any other way. I do not see that there is any justification at all for believing that he would offend again. If he was involved, he has learned his lesson and he has learned it in a very hard and cruel way by being harassed, in and out of the courts, over five years, spending over $30,000 in legal fees as well as putting up with the strain that this has placed on his marriage and his family and on the relationships with other families and the children's school mates. Fortunately the community has been very supportive of these people. He has been punished enough and to deport him now is a vindictive act. It will achieve nothing except destroy the family and break up the unity of the family. I do not know what is going to happen to the family. It is a very serious position. I think we ought to think very carefully about this decision. I think it is a blatant denial of natural justice to this man, who was convicted on a fairly minor offence and who has served his time, to put this draconian measure on him for his deportation to a strange country, which is what this means to Mr Pochi. He is an Australian in every sense, except that, because of administrative bungling he was not made a citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the idea that he could be a Mr Big is a product of the imagination of the police. They desperately needed a Mr Big. They could not get the right man but we all know of other people who are Australian citizens and very involved in the drug trade. Some of them are supposed to be very respectable citizens. Some have even been knighted. They get off scot free. Yet they pick on this poor Mr Pochi, who, according to the court, was on the very fringe of it and try to build him up as a Mr Big. If I brought him in here now I could not convince anyone that he was a Mr Big. He is a very small man indeed. He has not been terribly successful. He is a battler and no one could look less like a Mr Big than could Mr Pochi. To suggest otherwise is a product of the imagination of the police. </PARA>
<PARA> When I first took up this question Mr MacKellar was the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. He pointed to a secret file and said: 'Mr Fry, if you knew what was in there you would not be supporting these people'. He did not know that I did know what was 'in there', because I had received a copy of the police report. Again, it was 100 per cent hearsay evidence. There was nothing substantial in it at all. It was not just my opinion that this was hearsay evidence; it was Mr Justice Brennan's view also. I cannot accept it as a basis for deporting Mr Pochi. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of natural justice, he should be given a fair go. He has not been given it, nor has his wife, nor will his children if he is deported. I plead with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) and the House to accept this amendment, which really does not resolve the issue at all but merely says: 'Let us have another look at the evidence. Do not let us make a hasty decision that will ruin two families and achieve nothing. Let us have another look at it. Let us defer it pending the acquisition of better information by the Parliament and the people concerned'. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that further legal action may be taken. It is very unfair to these people that this information has been given out today. I refer particularly to that which came from the Minister, in quoting hearsay evidence while not making it clear that it was hearsay, and putting it before the Parliament as fact. I want honourable members to be quite clear that it is merely hearsay evidence. It has not been accepted as fact, not proven in a court, and was positively rejected by Mr Justice Brennan of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is the grossest miscarriage of justice to deport the husband and father of citizens of Australia, when there is no evidence that he will offend again, thus destroying his family. I ask honourable members to consider this amendment very seriously indeed. It merely delays action; it does not dismiss the matter. Let us be sure that we are doing the right thing and that we are not committing a gross miscarriage of natural justice in regard to people who are Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that any sensible Australian would question the need for power to deport. I do not believe that has been questioned by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). Although I did not agree with everything that he said, I rather tend to agree with the spirit in which he approached what is unquestionably an important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When a decision is made to deport, the Minister who has the ultimate responsibility must go through two processes. Firstly, he must make up his mind upon the facts. That is not an easy matter, in complex cases in particular. Then he must exercise a discretion. Having formed his view upon the facts, he determines whether it is in the interests of the country that the person whose case is before him should remain or should go. </PARA>
<PARA> As I believe the honourable member for Port Adelaide has acknowledged, these are difficult decisions. We all know that in making difficult decisions it is possible to come down on one side or the other. That having been said, I believe it worth while that the House examine one or two matters which relate to the case of Mr Pochi. I can understand that the honourable member for Port Adelaide would not have had time to examine the matter exhaustively. I am in the same position, but some points should be examined, and drawn out. </PARA>
<PARA> First, for the purpose of getting the legal record straight, I remind the House that Mr Pochi appealed to Mr Justice Brennan, as he then was-he is now in the High Court-and His Honour made a decision that was favourable to him. It was made upon the facts. Mr Justice Brennan's approach to the question of fact- finding, according to my very hasty reading of his decision, was somewhat different from the way in which the Royal Commissioner approached the same question-which again illustrates the kind of difficulty that these matters throw up. There was an appeal by the Minister from His Honour's decision, on a point of law only, to the Federal Court. It was disallowed. The Federal Court did not go into the facts. Then an application was made for special leave to appeal to the High Court. That Court, after examining the matter, decided that it was not a case in which special leave should be granted. That again did not involve an investigation by the High Court of the facts. So we should have those points squarely in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also have in mind, quite contrary to what the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) has said, that there is no question of double jeopardy involved. Nor would the position be different in the United States. The two issues, conviction for criminal offences and deportation, are quite different. As to hearsay, we should put that argument to one side, or at least clarify it. Hearsay evidence is taken into account for the very good reason that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act provides in section 33 (1):</PARA>
<PARA> In a proceeding before the Tribunal-</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence but may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>That includes looking at hearsay evidence and giving such weight to hearsay evidence as is thought appropriate. Those of us who have spent a long time kicking around courts of different kinds learn after a while that hearsay evidence, while often excluded, frequently-not always-has fairly high probative value. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I am bound to say, in answer to one thing that the honourable member for Fraser said, that it is quite contemptible to seek to divert this argument by referring to the kinds of things that he was talking about-that some individual who is a knight has been involved in the same sort of business. It may be that his own involvement in the case of Mr Pochi-I understand from one of the decisions that his office prepared a petition which was presented to this House-has somewhat overtaken his judgment in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine one or two of the things that were said by the Royal Commissioner about Mr Pochi. I confine myself to Mr Pochi for the very good reason that I have not had the chance to read what the Royal Commissioner said about the other gentleman or indeed to go fully through to the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment on some of the aspects of the debate that have risen this afternoon in this House. I do not want to comment specifically on the merits of he cases before us, especially the case of Mr Pochi, which has been quoted at some length by a number of honourable members who have participated in the debate. Firstly I want to compliment the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who led for the Opposition, on the way in which he responded to the statement of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee). He put a different point of view, but it was a view that ought to be expressed in a debate of this nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has exercised a discretion available to him under the Act which he was required to exercise and I think it is the sort of discretion which ought to be the subject of review by this chamber. So I think the honourable member for Port Adelaide approached this matter in a very responsible and moderate way and that this ought to be acknowledged by the House. I am disappointed that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Young) has not participated in the debate because he made it clear by way of interjection that he disagreed with the approach being taken by the Opposition. I had the clear impression from the comments he made by way of interjection that he agreed with the decision that the Minister had reached. So if there is time for him to participate I would like to hear what he has to say on the subject because that would ensure that this matter is fully reviewed by this House. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak in more detail about one or two comments made by other honourable members. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) said that the Minister shouls stay his hand and allow the subject to be looked at in further detail. The fact is that I am aware that the Minister has been exercising his mind on this subject for many months. Indeed, we ought to acknowledge, as I have already said, that the legislation is framed in a way that allows the Minister a discretion to reject a recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if he feels there are sufficient grounds for him to do so. I think we ought to dwell on that point because if the Minister has a discretion which is vested on him by both Houses of this Parliament we ought not automatically say that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has made a recommendation in a certain direction that Minister ought to accept that recommendation without question. He has, by virtue of legislation of this Parliament, a responsibility imposed upon him to review the decision or the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to see whether there are other grounds, other factors, which he should take into consideration in reaching a decision about whether to deport. </PARA>
<PARA> His involvement in the marihuana industry was promoted by more than a mere love for horticulture. He was, like the others, involved in it for what he could make out of it. One could reasonably assume that he had already made some money from it. In those circumstances he was, like his associates in the industry, in possession from time to time of money for which he could give no truthful and acceptable explanation. It therefore had to be laundered. Two of the practised methods of doing this was by organised 'betting wins' and 'loans' from relatives and friends. This is just what Pochi did. $65,900 he attributed to such loans and $24,448 to betting wins, much of the latter becoming available at a time when needed. </PARA>
<PARA>To interpolate, one could only wish for such friends and for such luck. Page 677 continues:</PARA>
<PARA> If one considers the situation in reverse based upon his allegations, the result is interesting. All money accretions, upon his story, came legitimately. So he received nothing from the marihuana industry. He was not involved in it. He was wrongly convicted by the jury. He was unaware of the true position at Coleambally. </PARA>
<PARA>That is where the property in question was situated. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> He, a resident of Canberra, had come to Griffith for a social visit in the course of which for the purposes of enjoying a picnic or barbeque (without benefit of wives or children) he and a number of other males travelled approximately thirty miles into unattractive country on a made road and then some further ten to fifteen miles on unmade roads through paddocks and eleven locked gates to the farm where much of the 'picnic' involved 'chipping parsnips' in the heat of the day at a time when flies were plentiful. At the place of the picnic it was obvious that there was provision available for reasonably comfortable living in a caravan supplied with electricity and air conditioning. </PARA>
<PARA>I go now to the conclusions the Commissioner expressed concerning Mr Pochi, who was represented by Mr Murphy of Queen's Counsel. The Commissioner stated:</PARA>
<PARA> My conclusions concerning Luigi Pochi, expressed in short form, are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. He was undoubtedly involved in the growing of the crop on the Coleambally farm in November, 1975, and could be expected to share in the proceeds. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. No direct evidence is available to involve Pochi in the production of the earlier year. There is evidence, however, of him receiving financial benefits which could not be attributed to the pursuit of any legitimate occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. That he is a brother-in-law of Antonio Sergi, that Antonio Sergi and Trimboli were involved in one or more earlier marihuana cultivations, and that Pochi was 'invited' to become a substantial shareholder in Vignali Wines in Canberra. Because of his involvement, it is not surprising that such an invitation would have been issued to him. Pochi did not receive any money either from gambling or from loans made to him by friends or relatives. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The monies therefore that came to him from these sources in the early part of 1975 were contributions emanating from an earlier crop or in anticipation of his share in the 1975/76 crop. </PARA>
<PARA>In the very short time available, and taking account of the honourable member for Port Adelaide's point that it is very difficult to conduct any kind of trial in this Parliament, it is worthwhile referring to one point that arises from the decision of Mr Justice Brennan. Mr Justice Brennan, who came to the conclusion that in all the circumstances Mr Pochi should not be deported, did not accept what he had to say about the source of funds since Mr Pochi, the fortunate recipient of loans and gambling wins, had got together very quickly a large amount of money for the purpose of purchasing a business. For those who want to look at it at a later stage I refer to page 263 of volume 26 of the Australian Law Reports. After detailing the way in which Mr Pochi allegedly got together $ 100,000 for the purpose of purchasing an interest in a business, Mr Justice Brennan said:</PARA>
<PARA> It may thus be seen that the contribution to the purchase of the Vignali Wines premises was funded by loans of the order of $61,000 made by close relatives or friends, cash of $5000, betting wins of the order of $11,500, a bank loan of $15 ,000, savings or business income of the order of $6000, and proceeds of sale of the shop and stock of $19,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe much of the applicant's account of assembling this finance, partly because I do not believe some of the accounts as to the particular items, and partly because I do not believe that a commitment to the payment of $117,000 or thereabouts would have been made prior to 4 June 1975 without knowing that the money was available. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, a commitment was made and the money then came into Mr Pochi's hands. After examining Mr Pochi's history of betting, this goes to one of the points which is obviously central to the mind of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee)-the Judge summarised, on page 267, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The history of the applicant's betting with Crawford--</PARA>
<PARA>Crawford was a bookmaker-</PARA>
<PARA>was remarkable. His credit betting opened on 18 January 1975 when he lost $1400. Thereafter, his winning days produced funds which were used to assist in the payment of the deposit, the payment of the stamp duty and the balance of the purchase price. He then had a losing day in August and, at the time when the first period of the bank bridging advance was expiring, he had another winning run. His betting with Crawford ceased in April of 1976. Although he was not a regular race-goer, he won $28,500 on 26 bets, and lost only 32 bets which cost him $4910. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope I can be excused for making this comment: If one believes that story-the judge obviously did not-one will believe anything at all. The question therefore must be asked: Where did the money come from? I put it that that question supports very strongly the conclusion which has been reached by the Minister. I conclude by saying this: I think all of us look to the right result being reached in deportation cases. Every honourable member of this House is concerned with the interests of this country and when it comes to whether or not people should stay or go I do not think party affiliations have any influence on our views. Certainly they should not and I do not think it applies to members of either side of the House. I said at the beginning that minds can differ on a case such as this but, looking at Mr Pochi's case, must we not ask ourselves, if he did not tell the truth about this matter; where did the money come from, what was the likely source? And, is it not a case where bipartisanship in terms of approach to these matters should prevail? If we are to seek to try every single case where differences may arise irrespective of who is in office, it will not do very much for the furtherance of the interests of this country as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The matter before the House is a grave issue because, although deportation is not in itself a criminal punishment, the consequences of deportation may often be far more destructive to the lives of the deportee and his family than any sentence of imprisonment. Therefore, when we consider the facts of this case and the arguments presented by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee), there are a number of important principles about which I think all honourable members can be agreed. There can be no doubt-there is no doubt-of the Minister's right of discretion. But I believe, and I believe the Minister would agree, that that right and its exercise must be tempered and applied within the established principles of law and in accordance with the principles of natural justice. The Minister himself has recognised that fact. I turn to the seventh page of his statement, where he states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Deportation is never ordered as a punishment and should not be accepted as a second punishment. Its purpose is to remove from the community persons who have demonstrated by their conduct that they are unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the criterion that the Minister has put forward to this House. I believe it is a proper and appropriate criterion, and I believe it is upon the basis of the Minister's own criterion that we should ask ourselves whether the Minister's discretion has been properly applied in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say right from the outset that I do not believe there is any sympathy at all in Australian society, nor in this Parliament, for the professional drug trafficker who is prepared, for the sake of personal gain, to destroy the lives of young Australians. This Parliament and its members should say to the people of Australia and to the international drug trade that the full force of the law will be applied to protect the lives of young Australian citizens. I believe that we are all agreed on that. But in asserting these positions we must not abandon other principles which are of equal importance to our society. In our adherence to the rule of law we must remember that we are a society made up of immigrants. The development of our society has depended upon immigration. Therefore, when the Minister exercises his discretion, he must do so in a way which is in accord with well established legal principles and concepts so that there can be no doubt in the minds not only of the immigrant community but also of the whole broader Australian community that this discretion is not the exercise of some whim or of some preferred political preference, but is in fact applied objectively, sincerely and on the basis of all the relevant evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Having applied that test, let me say this: I was unfamiliar with the details of this case until I became involved earlier this morning. Our former colleagues and present colleagues representing this area-I refer to the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry), the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) and a former member for Canberra-are on record as having supported the arguments put forward by a large number of residents in Canberra that Mr Pochi ought to be allowed to stay in Australia. That is something that I think undoubtedly the Minister would have borne in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned in terms of the application of principles and the way in which the Minister has today put his case to the House. He has recognised the importance of the findings of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and he has also recognised, as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, that it is a serious matter of principle when the Minister exercises a discretion which flies in the face of a decision of that Tribunal. I believe that when the Minister acts in that way he must be prepared to come into the House and justify the basis upon which that decision was reached. </PARA>
<PARA> To date the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) has endeavoured to justify that exercise of discretion, as indeed has the Minister, by reference to the findings of the Woodward Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking. I put this to the honourable member for North Sydney and to the Minister: Commissioners, in their findings in royal commissions, will adduce facts produced on the basis of evidence that comes before them. But the mere finding that a man has not told the truth, the mere finding that a man may have been involved in the drug trade and the mere fact that he may have been convicted for that do not of themselves entitle one to argue, on the basis of those findings alone, that that person-in this case, Mr Pochi-is someone whose continued presence in Australia represents a threat to Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that if we were to ask Mr Justice Woodward, but we cannot, he might well say: 'Pochi has been sentenced, he has been tried, and he has discharged his debt to Australian society. On all the evidence that I have before me I do not think he constitutes a permanent threat to Australian society '. That is the standard and criterion. I remind the honourable member for North Sydney, as I would remind the Minister, that that very issue was fully examined. It was the subject of a full judicial assessment by Mr Justice Brennan. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was asked to determine the central issue. It was not asked to examine the applicant's role in drug trafficking. It was not asked to examine whether it was a good or a bad thing that he may or may not have laundered money. It was asked to make the critical decision, on all the evidence available, whether it would be a better or a worse thing for Australian society that this man be deported, that his existing Australian family be broken up or faced with that most terrible of conflicts of whether his wife, who is an Australian citizen and his children, who are all Australian citizens, all vouched for by their own ethnic community and by the broader Australian community, should have to follow this man into exile. That is the issue. What we as a House are therefore entitled to expect from the Minister are not references to general unspecified allegations in the Woodward report. What the House is entitled to from the Minister is the very specific allegation that, having examined the judgment of Mr Justice Brennan, for very specific reasons the Minister is unable to join Mr Justice Brennan in his conclusions and the Minister is therefore satisfied that that man's continued presence in Australian society constitutes a threat to our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spent some hours examining very carefully the legal processes that were followed by Mr Justice Brennan, his view of the evidence and the way in which the evidence was adduced. Again, I remind the House that his was a very specific responsibility. There can be no doubt in my mind that any member of this House who is prepared to trouble himself to read this judgment in full will be impressed not only with the application of legal principle but also with the high and appropriate standards which His Honour applied in that case with determining this very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The great issues of civil liberty are never determined on the basis of exemplary characters, the perfect citizens. They always arise in this sort of case. It is the application of those principles and our capacity as a community to maintain those principles in respect of someone about whom many of the allegations made by the honourable member for North Sydney can be sustained, that test the very fabric of our society and the very principles to which we adhere. What did Mr Justice Brennan say? I cannot do any better and I do not believe I can more eloquently examine the evidence. As my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) has pointed out, in considering this evidence Mr Justice Brennan did not regard himself, as indeed he is not legally bound to, as bound by the formal laws of evidence. He was concerned to pursue the truth in order to answer the very real question: Does this man's presence in Australian society constitute a threat? In order to pursue that question he had before him a senior member of the New South Wales Police Force who was deeply involved in every aspect of the drug investigation. That evidence was given in camera, with Mr Pochi's lawyers present. That is how concerned His Honour was to see that all the evidence was before him. He realised the gravity of the decision he had to make. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to refer to a finding made by Mr Justice Woodward in respect of another matter. Mr Justice Brennan said when referring to the funds, upon which the honourable member for North Sydney rested so much of his case--</PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence to connect the applicant with marihuana prior to his arrest in November 1975. It is unknown whether the clandestine funds, whatever their source, belonged to the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Brennan goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The evidence given to me in camera--</PARA>
<PARA>He was clearly searching for the evidence-</PARA>
<PARA>did not live up to the expectations in that it lacked the cogency which would support a finding of fact against the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> There are ample grounds for suspecting that the applicant was so involved, but the evidence does not prove it. When an alien who is an established resident becomes liable to deportation under s 12, the general rule must be that the conduct which is relied on to show that a deportation order is in the best interests of Australia must be proved, not merely suspected. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat those words: 'must be proved, not merely suspected'. Mr Justice Brennan goes on to say that on the basis of all the evidence before him, onus of proof had not been discharged and therefore he found that the order in respect of Mr Pochi should not be granted. He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> It is certain that deportation of the applicant would destroy or gravely damage a growing Australian family and it would be a grave detriment not only to them but to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The burden that rests upon the Minister, for whom I have great respect, is to be able to conclude and to the satisfaction of honourable members to say: 'I have additional evidence which indicates that, for all of his integrity, for all of his application of judicial principle, that was a finding in which Mr Justice Brennan was in error'. If the Minister can discharge that obligation-and I think that is the obligation-I for one would be prepared to say that the Minister has not merely acted responsibly in this matter but has applied the principles of natural justice and that I am satisfied that all the principles have been applied. Having looked at the judgment and having heard the Minister's statement , I do not believe that, on the basis of the decision that has been made, and on the basis of the importance of maintaining judicial principles, the rule of law and the principle of natural justice, any member of this House can be satisfied that the Minister has moved the burden that rests upon him and that this man ought to be torn from his family and his family ought to be confronted with the choice of following him into exile. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that this man would not be in that position-to adopt the simple phraseology of the High Court-if his earlier application for naturalisation had not been bungled by the Minister's Department. This is not a situation in which we should apply anything other than the basic rules of justice. I doubt whether they have been properly applied in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to debate this very emotive matter which has been brought forward by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee), there are one or two areas on which I should like to touch and which have, I believe, not yet been raised. But before doing so I should like to make one or two comments in relation to remarks of previous speakers. The Minister, in taking the action that he has, has made it quite clear to the House that it was not a hasty action. It is an action which I think even the Opposition has acknowledged has been taken only after many months, possibly years, of investigation. As Opposition members have acknowledged, he is a very competent and responsible Minister. He certainly would not have taken such action without the very best of recommendations and the assurative that the action he was taking was correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having acknowledged that point it would be fair also to mention-I do not say this lightly or in any complimentary manner, but simply mention it-that the Minister is well known throughout the ethnic community of Australia as a very compassionate Minister. I do not think that would be denied by any honourable member. His approaches to all matters in relation to immigration have been made in a very forthright and open manner. I know that he has taken every action to weigh up all the problems relating to this matter. There would be no doubt in my mind and, I am sure, in the minds of other members on this side of the House and , I hope, honourable members on the other side, that the Minister would have taken into consideration the heartbreak and tragedy that is occurring in the families connected to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the facts are that we have a situation, outlined in the Minister' s statement, which calls for deportation. Deportation is not a very nice thing. In fact, it would have to be the ultimate action to be taken in a specific case. In taking that action, the Minister is also aware that he is taking an action to protect in a large way the good name of the Italian community and other ethnic communities in this country who unfortunately, perhaps because of media response -I do not know-or whatever, whenever there are any allegations against a member of their particular ethnic group, are generally labelled, all or many of them, as being associated or mixed in with such activities. By taking this action the Minister is making it quite clear that the very responsible and respected ethnic groups in this country will know the full facts, that they will have the opportunity of supporting-indeed I believe they will do so-the Minister's action because, after all, it will help to clear their good names and their reputations in this country. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="037">Mr BOURCHIER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not rot; it is a fact. The other fact is that there has been a growing, widespread concern in this country, ever since the terrible tragedy concerning Mr Mackay which was mentioned by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), which has led to a great call for greater penalties in regard to all sorts of drug abuse and drug trading. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) also mentioned that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The people in the country areas have noticed that there has been a growth in the growing of marihuana in remote farm areas. This growth has been caused by people being brought into the country, financed to come here, and financed to go on to farms when they probably did not have the financial backing to do so. Once on the farm the proviso was that they would provide a crop of marihuana. Police records exist in Victoria, New South Wales and probably South Australia to support what I am saying: That there has been a lot of discovery over the last few years by the police in their efforts to wipe out this practice. But what is happening is that the relatively innocent, in the sense of being newcomers to the field and being put on a farm and being caught, suffer the penalty of a small fine or alternatively, if gaoled, they find the farm is kept going for them in their absence or that the fine has been paid by the organisation, so called. There is no doubt that this organisation, that most people know better by the name of the Mafia, does exist. The Minister is making it quite clear in his actions that this country will not tolerate that. It is a tragedy for the people concerned who are the innocents associated with the particular people. </PARA>
<PARA> But surely we must not overlook one simple fact: The people to whom we are referring today were invited or allowed to enter this country to become good citizens at a future time. They were given all the opportunities to taking whatever benefits they could of this country in every proper and legitimate manner. Instead they chose to take illegal attitudes to try to make money in the quick and easy way, to breed by the crime of providing drugs to the families of Australian citizens. That point must not be overlooked. They must accept the responsibilities that go with the actions they have taken. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to stand here and be concerned about a certain section, but let us be a little concerned about all those others, the families throughout the country that are heartbroken and have had tragedy thrust upon them because of the action of certain people in providing drugs. I congratulate the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Port Adelaide for their very rational approach to this matter. I am sure that the Minister will do as they have asked; that is, give the matter the most serious consideration and make sure that the proper decision is reached. I am sure those honourable members would agree and hope that in reaching that decision consideration will be given not only to the people who have been involved in the criminal activities-unfortunately their families, innocent as they may be, may be associated with it-but also to the many tragedies that might be prevented in the future by taking this action. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Port Adelaide mentioned that very point when he said that future generations of Australians may well look back on this first action in this Parliament in relation to deportation. I agree with him. But they may well say that that action has stopped a course of progress which may have been to their detriment or to the detriment of this country in the future had that step not been taken. I know that the Minister has given this matter his absolute and most serious consideration. He has looked at it in every possible way. He received the best information and proof he could before he took such a drastic step. The honourable member for Port Adelaide and, I believe, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports have indicated that, whilst the Opposition calls on the Government and the Minister to be very careful to make sure that the right decision is reached, when this decision is reached the Opposition will also support it in the very best interests of the future of this country. I hope that is so. </PARA>

For these people the double jeopardy very clearly exists and they are obviously paying twice. Not only the guilty parties but also their entire families are paying twice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intend to stick very closely to the facts, a thing which I think my friend should do in future. The point is that these families can raise this sort of money from friends and relatives. We are talking about only a very small amount of money-a mere $46,000. At the moment I am mediating in a similar sort of deal in the goldfields in which money was lent within families and now there is a hassle over it. The sum of money involved far exceeds this rather small amount. The honourable member for North Sydney blithely said: 'Can you believe the story about racing'? He entirely discredited it. I admit that it is an unlikely story. But did the honourable member for North Sydney ever question the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Ray O'Connor, who had seven consecutive wins on a double-up basis at the Belmont course and took out of the ring half a million dollars? Did he ever question that? Is he prepared to say in this House that that is a likely story? Of course he is not. That is the sort of sophistry I have come to expect from the honourable member for North Sydney. However, I will say that if I am ever guilty of a crime I will certainly seek him as a lawyer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We must now look at the national interest. It must be the overwhelming consideration. Is the national interest of this country served in any way by denying natural justice? How can it be? The cause of natural justice is one of the things that, in our society, we hold most dear. There is no way that national interest can be served if it appears to or in fact does impinge on natural justice. How about the hardship to the family? Trauma will obviously be inflicted on this family. How can this be in any way in the national interest of Australia? It could well be in the national interest of a section of the community which seeks to divert attention from the real issues and to claim the front page of the newspapers with this sort of thing when these pages should be devoted to the real issues that beset this country. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the speakers on the Government side talked about the Mafia. He thinks we can control the Mafia in this country by deporting two obviously small fry. How would that affect the mafia? What is wanted in this country is a full parliamentary inquiry into drugs. This is something that the Australian Labor Party has consistently supported and called for. It would do far more good than this punitive action which is being taken so that the powers that be can appear to be doing something. It is clearly the case that the government is looking for a scapegoat and it has found it. By all accounts these men are two very small Mr Bigs. </PARA>
<PARA> We in this House have been subjected to and bombarded by the emotive issue of drugs and the shock horror of drugs. We are talking about marihuana. The fact is that there are many honourable members opposite whom I would not mind naming who would be a damn sight better off if they stuck to marihuana and left alcohol alone. Alcohol is far more damaging to them. The truth is that this is a drug that does have a very large amount of public acceptance, whether honourable members opposite like it or not. It is not seen by the mass of the people in this country in the same terms as heroin, cocaine and all the other very dangerous drugs. But the Government does not hesitate to lump them together in one emotive thing-a drug dealer. I have no doubt that the man was guilty. He was convicted and he paid his price for his guilt. Mr Justice Brennan, in his summing up, recognised all these facts and all this evidence. In his wisdom he decided that deportation was not an appropriate course to follow. I think that it would serve us all very well if a stand was made by this Parliament against the authoritarians who exist in our society, many of whom pervade the corridors of the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard mention of how the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ( Mr Macphee) is a good and honourable man. I do not question that. All I say is that by their deeds you shall know them. I think the time will come when this decision will be seen as an exercise in authoritarian, bureaucratic power to hide the bunglings of not only his Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs but also the police investigation. What have we asked the Minister to do? We have simply asked the Minister to withdraw the deportation order pending further inquiries so that he can make known to us the information that he purports to have, the information to which, in a free society, I think we are entitled. Is that too much to ask the Minister?</PARA>
<PARA> We have the case in New South Wales of a coronial court inquiring into the disappearance of Donald Mackay. We have heard this case linked very emotionally with that case. There is not a shred of evidence to connect them but people may think so. In fact, I am surprised that honourable members opposite did not actually say that either of these gentlemen murdered Mr Mackay. I think it would be a very proper course to follow to wait until this inquiry is finished. To me the Mackay case has many of the hallmarks of the Azaria Chamberlain case. This is something I am sure the Minister does not want on his conscience if subsequent events prove that to be true. All we are asking is that the Minister stay his hand. After all, the Minister stays his hand for great lengths of time on other occasions. Why, is it too much of a hardship to do so now to avoid the unnecessary hardship that the members of this family will face, or in the view of the Government, are the members of the family guilty by implication? It is true that there was a connection by marriage with the Sergi family. Are we all to be guilty because of our relations and our in-laws? That is the implication of the Government's proposed action. I appeal again to the Minister, in the name of natural justice and the Australian concept of the fair go, to hold his hand until he can produce to this House the additional evidence upon which he makes his judgment and until we can have the benefit of the inquiry currently taking place in New South Wales. I do not feel that this is a lot to ask and I do not believe that the people of Australia will feel that it is a lot to ask. </PARA>

On that fact, and the further information which the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) includes in his statement to the House, the Minister has made a practical decision concerning the effect that the deportation will have on the national good. It is quite wrong-and in fact the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) does not elevate this debate by doing so-to talk of scapegoats.

He does not want to take notice of them and, of course, he cannot look to the origin of that commission to throw any blame on the part of the Government, so he talks of scapegoats. It is quite irresponsible of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to talk of scapegoats when the Minister quite clearly has taken the overall view, correctly, that these two gentlemen were deeply involved in the drug culture in Australia. This is not an isolated crime. They were members of organised crime. There is a great difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the greatest threats to the social fabric of this country comes from organised crime and any member of this community who has anything to do with a large city understands the unprovable but known things that are occurring in those communities in relation to the spread of organised crime. It is an enormous threat to the community. I commend the Minister, not for issuing or being involved in a double penalty, but for removing from Australia these people who could conceivably still be influential in the drug culture of this country in the future. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie referred in his speech to the fact that marihuana is less than something or other; I have forgotten his exact remarks. Prosecutions are now pending in many cities where drug dealers are being charged for the sale and commercial involvement in marihuana and harder drugs. They go together in the drug culture so far as their spread and dissemination throughout this community is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the honourable gentleman to existing charges which are being laid. One should not comment further on them because they are not settled. But it is a well known factor. The honourable member has not studied the reports of the commissions and the various pieces of evidence that are available to him. In South Australia, we have seen large efforts at drug growing and the production of marihuana. As I have said, people in the community are not so concerned with the single one-off operation. It is the organised factor which is so damaging and so frightening. Within the last several months there was a find to the south of Adelaide of a marihuana plantation which was reputed to have a street value of $60m. To my knowledge, no arrests have yet been made with regard to that find although the plantation was known to exist about three weeks before the police went there and destroyed it. It was an extremely well organised operation with land clearing, irrigation systems and attention given to the plants through their formative growth months. I understand that no arrests have been made because of the intricacies of the lease arrangements which had been set up. The lease had been passed from one person to another and, as I understand it, the final operators are not known by the law. It seems to me a rather tedious excuse but that is what is said and, of course, it illustrates the sophistication of organised crime which has developed in this country. These two gentlemen have been a part of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no point in anyone opposite saying that these two people are one-off operators who have operated individually. I repeat: They are part of organised crime. As far as I am concerned, and as far as the general community is concerned, the penalties for the original crimes were not severe enough for that organised factor. People do serve their time or pay their fine. They spend, say, a year in prison or pay a fine which is quite minimal compared with the rewards of being a drug grower or a drug distributor. Something will have to be done in this community to increase the penalties for such offences and to make sure that the deterrent is of a sufficient size or effect to have some influence in the depression of drug growing and drug distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a sad fact that their families will be affected. But the administration of the law or of Government policy is not confined simply to these families. Every imposition of a gaol penalty produces a very sad effect on the family of the convicted. Therefore, why should we select the families of these two men for special sympathy compared with the thousands of other families in Australia of people who have been convicted of criminal acts? No satisfaction was given by members opposite as to why these families should be selected for special sympathy. The families I would select for sympathy are those who are affected and sometimes destroyed as a result of the drug trade. They are the ones that have the sympathy of most Australians. But I do not want to develop that highly emotive issue. That is the sympathy I want to express. For that reason I give my wholehearted support to the Minister for his action in protecting Australia in this way. Whilst I have represented many migrants and their families with their problems over the years, and I welcome their entry into Australia, I do not welcome anyone from overseas who comes here, does not take up citizenship but maintains citizenship from elsewhere, enters into criminal acts and believes that he or she can use this country and abuse its hospitality. Surely, we are not so subservient that we can take that view. I commend the Minister on taking a firm position and supporting the community which does not want anyone who is not a citizen of this country and who has been guilty of a criminal offence to have the opportunity to re-enter organised crime and the drug trade. </PARA>

Unlike many of the people who have spoken here today and given their views, judgments and assessments of the Pochi family, I have met and spoken to this family. I make an assessment, as the member representing them in this Parliament, of what I believe is in the best interests of Australia. My assessment of this case is that it is not in the best interests of Australia to break up this family, to send Mr Pochi back to the country where he was born but where he has no relatives and no ties. His ties now are with his new country and his family who are all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt and no debate that Mr Pochi committed a crime. I do not condone, and as no member on this side of the House and I am sure no member on the Government benches would condone, that behaviour. But that man has paid his price. He was convicted and served one year in gaol. Since 1975 he has gone through three courts of appeal which have come out in his favour. Judgments have been made in his favour. It was the judgment of the law that that man serve his sentence and that, although he was not an Australian citizen, he still had the right to remain in Australia. Yet the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee), a Minister for whom I, like other members of the Opposition, have a great deal of respect, has brought down a decision today that that man must be deported and his family broken up. I hope that when the Minister replies he will be able to give this House additional information on the reasons for the deportation because, frankly, I cannot see them in the statement he has submitted to this House or in the material that I have read in relation to this case. It seems to me that the basic reason Mr Pochi is being deported is that it has been found in the Minister's view to be against the interests of Australia for this man to remain in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the House a little bit about Mr Pochi's family. My colleague, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry), told the House some of the personal aspects of this matter. I just want to reiterate them briefly as I know them. Mrs Pochi works in an office adjacent to my electoral office. I would see her probably on a weekly basis just as a working woman in my electorate. I have seen some of the children. They are hardworking kids who have often had to work part- time to try to help pay for the additional financial burdens that have been imposed on that family because of the court cases that they have had to fight. It has cost the family about $30,000, it has cost them their home and it has meant incredible hardship. A lot of obvious pressure has been placed on the family. I believe that over the last few years the family has done no harm to the Canberra community. As I said earlier, I know that the father of the family committed a crime and I believe he has paid for that crime. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic question is whether the continuing existence of that man in Australia is a threat to the future of this country. Some statements have been made, in particular by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), about organised crime in Australia. I deplore organised crime just as do the honourable member for Boothby and my colleagues in this place. But I cannot believe with the personal knowledge I have of this family and that man, and on the evidence that I have read in transcripts of the appeals to the High Court and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that that man is the centre or even part of organised crime in Australia. I hope the Minister will be able to give me additional information on that. I am not just giving an emotional reply on this matter and I suppose I could be forgiven if I have. I know that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) would forgive me as he forgave my colleague the honourable member for Fraser. I conclude by reading a statement that is not mine but that of Justice Brennan. The first point I want to raise is that Justice Brennan had before him evidence from a detective which provided information on what was going to emerge from the findings of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. Justice Brennan concludes from that evidence:</PARA>
<PARA> But the evidence given in camera before me did not live up to expectations in that it lacked the cogency which would support a finding of fact against the applicant. In part that evidence was hearsay, and hearsay inevitably lacks the cogency inherent in evidence given by a person who has personal knowledge of the facts to which he deposes. </PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> In this case, it is certain that deportation of the applicant would destroy or gravely damage a growing Australian family, and that would be a grave detriment not only to them but to Australia. His deportation, separating him from his Australian wife and children or requiring them to accompany him to a country that the children do not know, would be destructive of their prospects in life as well as his. Such a consequence is not justified by evidence-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat the words 'not justified by evidence'-</PARA>
<PARA>which fails to prove that he was engaged in trading in marihuana, but which raises only a suspicion that he was so engaged. </PARA>
<PARA>Can my colleagues who are sitting opposite me in this chamber today truly, and in all conscience, from the knowledge they have of the case and from the time that they have put into examining the case, make an assessment that this man is a threat to the future of Australia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment on some of the aspects of the debate that have risen this afternoon in this House. I do not want to comment specifically on the merits of the cases before us, especially the case of Mr Pochi, which has been quoted at some length by a number of honourable members who have participated in the debate. Firstly I want to compliment the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who led for the Opposition, on the way in which he responded to the statement of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee). He put a different point of view, but it was a view that ought to be expressed in a debate of this nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has exercised a discretion available to him under the Act which he was required to exercise and I think it is the sort of discretion which ought to be the subject of review by this chamber. So I think the honourable member for Port Adelaide approached this matter in a very responsible and moderate way and that this ought to be acknowledged by the House. I am disappointed that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) has not participated in the debate because he made it clear by way of interjection that he disagreed with the approach being taken by the Opposition. I had the clear impression from the comments he made by way of interjection that he agreed with the decision that the Minister had reached. So if there is time for him to participate I would like to hear what he has to say on the subject because that would ensure that this matter is fully reviewed by this House. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak in more detail about one or two comments made by other honourable members. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) said that the Minister should stay his hand and allow the subject to be looked at in further detail. The fact is that I am aware that the Minister has been exercising his mind on this subject for many months. Indeed, we ought to acknowledge, as I have already said, that the legislation is framed in a way that allows the Minister a discretion to reject a recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if he feels there are sufficient grounds for him to do so. I think we ought to dwell on that point because if the Minister has a discretion which is vested in him by both Houses of this Parliament we ought not automatically say that because the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has made a recommendation in a certain direction that Minister ought to accept that recommendation without question. He has, by virtue of legislation of this Parliament, a responsibility imposed upon him to review the decision or the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and to see whether there are other grounds, other factors, which he should take into consideration in reaching a decision about whether to deport. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a point in that respect has been overlooked by many honourable members who have participated in this debate. The Minister in his opening statement pointed out that the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking, better known as the Woodward report, was not available at the time the Administrative Appeals Tribunal reviewed a previous decision of the Minister 's predecessor, the previous Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Indeed , since the report of the Woodward Commission has been available, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has in two cases referred to the findings of that report in the course of upholding decisions to deport people. That is a very important point. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time Mr Justice Brennan reviewed this matter in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal a very basic document which the Minister has available to him was not available to the Tribunal. I suggest very strongly to this House that when the Minister has vested in him a responsibility to exercise discretion he has to take into account not only the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal but also any further evidence or information that is made available to him. I suggest that if he did not take account of the findings of a royal commission there would be very real grounds for members of this House to criticise him for not having taken adequate notice of such information at the time he made his decision to deport. </PARA>
<PARA> I also comment on something the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) had to say. He said that the Pochi case-he referred specifically to that case-had been upheld on a number of occasions in the courts. He referred specifically to the High Court. I think it ought to be emphasised very strongly that anything the High Court had to say did not relate to the substance of the case-to the facts of the case-but to a legal point that had been brought to the High Court. The High Court stated that the Minister was not required to accept as correct any views as to the facts or as to the weight of evidentiary material expressed by the Tribunal. The High Court refused leave to appeal. It did not do that on the basis of an assessment of the facts of the case before it. It did not review the evidence of the case. What it did was state that the Minister in any event is not compelled to accept the recommendation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; in fact, he has a discretion under the Act which he is fully competent to exercise; therefore, in effect, there is no real point in the High Court reviewing the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I think that fallacious aspect of the argument put forward by the honourable member for Fraser should be noted and should be nailed very strongly. The High Court did not review the case. It did not find in favour of Mr Pochi in any substantial sense. It found that there was no need for it to review the recommendation of the Tribunal because, in fact, the Minister had available to him a discretion to decide in a direction other than the direction of the recommendation of the Tribunal if he so wished and if he had further information available to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Minister, when you became the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, as I at that time was the shadow Minister responsible for immigration and ethnic affairs on this side of the House, we had occasion to have quiet chats on a number of issues of some significance. Despite the surroundings here, which are not very personal, I would like to try to conduct this discussion between you and me. You will remember that we did have a talk about the practice, which had been pursued until you became the Minister, of deporting people who had been imprisoned for crimes committed in this country . They were deported after they had served their sentences. Despite the fact that we acknowledged that perhaps one could gain political capital out of pursuing that line because one could argue that we ought to be rid of criminals- there has been a hint of that sort of argument in some of the discussion this afternoon-we agreed that the penalty of being committed to gaol was enough. We agreed that the choices before you were either to deport someone found guilty of a crime or, alternatively, to put that person in gaol. We agreed that once that person had served the gaol sentence that was the end of it, that that person had paid his debt to society, such as we see it, like everybody else, and that that person should not face any further hazards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I further remind you, Mr Minister, that in making these comments I am acknowledging that we have a problem. A couple of times I had occasion to talk to you about information that had come my way. I could have used that information to make political capital for my side of the House, but I chose not to do so because I felt that we had a problem. I will treasure the letter you sent to me acknowledging the help I gave on one of those occasions. You acknowledged that the help I and my staff had given and were able to give because of our contacts in the ethnic community had in fact helped you and your Department finally to nail a criminal organisation. I make that point because what I now wish to say is at that sort of personal level. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a problem. In your statement, Mr Minister, you have acknowledged that these people, found guilty of a crime of whatever it was, were held in gaol and presumably paid for that crime. That is not what the problem is about now. It is not about whether they were guilty of a crime and whether they have been sufficiently punished. The issue now is whether they belong to a secret organisation, and whether, as members of that secret organisation, they are involved in lots of things which obviously society does not like. Of course, that is not the only secret organisation of which we are aware. Some organsiations, which are not all that secret, indulge in all sorts of anti- social behaviour. The solution to the problem with this man or with anybody belonging to any of those other organisations that are not seen as based overseas is not to deport. If this man had been an Australian citizen you could not have deported him. It is purely an accident that he is still not an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I move on to a further aspect of that, given that you are acting partly on the suspicion that that man is a member of this secret organisation and that you have listed some of the crimes, including the possible murder of Mr Mackay, it seems odd that you should be contemplating deporting him. I know from experience of cases of people being deported and of our subsequently having discovered that those people may have had evidence that would have helped in an investigation. I can call to mind one such case, but I will not specify it in the House. I am sure you recall it, Mr Minister. It was a case of someone who was prepared to sign and in fact signed a statutory declaration. We deported that person and, regrettably, then could not use him-I think it was a male-for the purpose of further investigation of a crime which I am convinced and you are convinced is being committed. I do not know how far you have got on that because I have not been in touch with you on this matter since then. It seems to me that as a result of the coroner's inquiry there may well be a possibility of the matter of Mackay's disappearance being pursued. If one or both of these people are associated with the organisation that is held to be responsible, it strikes me that it is not wise to deport them at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that-I take that as a slightly opportunist point-I come now to the heart of what worries me. It is only a suspicion that these men belong to this organisation; it has not actually been proved. That is the first doubt that must weigh on your heart, Mr Minister. Next, even if they are members, as I have said , that is not the only secret organisation conducting criminal activities in this country. For all the other organisations the choice of deportation is not there; it is not a solution. If we find that someone belongs to one of those organisations, we still have to prove that that person belongs to it and that he in fact has done something of a criminal nature. If that is proved the penalty has to be a prison sentence, not deportation. But we do not have proof that these people, without any shadow of doubt belong to this secret organisation. We have no proof that the secret organisation in fact has done these things. Everybody has his suspicion and I share that suspicion. </PARA>
<PARA> On those grounds, Mr Minister, I think you-not the Government, but you-in your heart are facing a dilemma. I think you will come to regret the decision which it would appear you have made. I do not believe that on that suspicion sending these people out of the country will solve for us the problem of that secret society or perhaps the crimes that have been committed. One thing is certain and that is that by making this decision we are instrumental in damaging the families of these people. Surely the members of these families should not be held responsible for the actions of the father and husband, at least in respect of one case; I do not know enough of the details of the other case. I reiterate that deporting these people will not solve the problem that is basically confronting us. I do not know what will be the outcome of the inquires that are going on into the whole drug business and I do not want to enter into the arguments for and against drug trafficking. I have views which are different from many which have been expressed in this House, but that is irrelevant. I just do not believe that, in his heart, the Minister will rest content in making this decision in the light of the doubt that exists. I think the persons concerned are entitled to the benefit of the doubt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I would like to thank all honourable members for their constructive and concerned contributions to this debate. I can assure the House that I have already taken into account each of the specific points which have been raised and also many of those which have been alluded to in the debate, and I include in that all the references to considerations of natural justice and the various arguments which were advanced by several speakers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would particularly like to say to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) that I understand exactly how he feels. We did have that relationship of which he spoke and it has continued between his successor and myself. I believe, frankly, that Australia has benefited from the capacity which we have to sit down and discuss these matters of mutual concern. It is certainly true that there are proceedings before a court in Sydney at the moment which are the result of information given to me by the honourable member for Maribyrnong which enabled the police and the departmental officials to get to the bottom of a very serious immigration racket. I might also say that there are other members of the Opposition, not just in this House but in the Senate as well, who have co- operated with me in the same way, and I am most indebted to them. I think there are really no political points to be made in this sort of area. Certainly it has never been in my mind, although there was a suggestion from at least one speaker , that this matter had some political relevance. I do not think anyone else took the suggestion seriously. It certainly does not have political relevance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong has said, that he and I have discussed many issues, including the practice of deportation. I have had very healthy discussions with the Department about that and there is a division of opinion about the relevance of deportation on some occasions. I think on occasions it has the effect of being a double penalty. On other occasions I believe that it is appropriate. I believe it is appropriate in these cases for reasons which I shall refer to again in a moment. Recently I had discussions with the New South Wales Minister responsible for the criminal institutions, Mr Jackson, at his request and we have worked out an arrangement whereby he will on occasions release people for the purposes of deportation well before they have finished serving their sentences. I hope that that will be a practice we can adopt in other States, on which can be adopted for Commonwealth offences and one which therefore mitigates the occurrances when it can have the effect of being a double penalty. I say the effect of it because it is not, of course, the theory behind it. I think the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) said that my decision was a practical one. It is certainly a pragmatic one. It is based upon what Mr Justice Smithers has called reasonable suspicions which go well beyond the references which the honourable member for Maribyrnong made, but I understand his view. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, I am satisfied that there does exist an organisation concerned with the cultivation and marketing of drugs and that Messrs Pochi and Barbaro are members of that organisation. I believe that I would be naive if I did not expect them to continue to be so. That is where the aspect of public interest comes into their deportation. The activities of that organisation are contrary to the interests of the Australian public and they outweigh the undeniably serious harm which will result to the private interests of the two families concerned. Their membership of the organisation is contrary to the interests of the Australian people and justifies their removal from the Australian society. It really is irrelevant that some other persons who are also members of the organisation cannot be deported by virtue of the fact that they are citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course it was not an easy decision to reach. One thing that I want to repeat to the House is a point made in my opening remarks and by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) as well, but obviously not fully grasped by some members of the Opposition, and that is that the Woodward report was not before Mr Justice Brennan. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) both quoted Mr Justice Brennan as though he had before him that report and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) positively asserted that Mr Justice Brennan did have it before him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hansard will record that the honourable member said quite categorically by interjection to the honourable member for Boothby that he had it. In any event, the fact is that he did not have the Woodward report before him and the learned judge chose to take a view of the role of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. But what is very clear is that the role of the Minister at least is not fettered strictly by the laws of evidence and the probity of material. I remind the House of what I said in my opening remarks, which was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The High Court said that the Minister is not required to accept as correct any views as to the facts or as to the weight of evidentiary material expressed by the Tribunal. Thus it is clear that the Minister is entitled to make up his own mind as to the weight he gives to the material before him and that he may take into account and make his decision on the basis of matters which the Tribunal did not think to be sufficiently established before it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr MACPHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to live with it, and I accept the fact that I have to live with it. As the honourable member for Casey has said, this Parliament has obliged me to make a decision. It is not a decision taken with a stroke of the pen, as the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) has suggested. He also observed that it had taken me three months longer than I had hoped it would take me to reach a decision and that, frankly, was because of the number of times I looked at the file, put it away, mulled over it and looked at it again. I would say that in the past two years in looking at all of these drug related Administrative Appeals Tribunal deportation cases, including the Pochi and Barbaro ones, I must have spent personally hundreds of hours quite apart from the time of the officials. So the decision is certainly not one that has been taken with a stroke of the pen. It is a decision which, nonethless, I believe is a correct one. It was not a decision for this Parliament. It was appropriate that it be aired in this Parliament, but it was a decision which the Parliament had given to me to make. It was never a decision of Cabinet. One honourable member suggested that it was in fact a decision imposed upon me by Cabinet. It has never been discussed in Cabinet. It was my decision alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that one is balancing public and private interests and in my view, as I have said in my statement, the public interests on this occasion outweigh the private interests which have been the particular concern of those honourable members who have spoken against my decision. I repeat that if I were in their situation and had not spent the length of time I have spent on these matters I might well be at least expressing my remarks in the way that the honourable member for Port Adelaide has done. But in fact, having spent the time I have spent on it, I am convinced that my decision is correct. </PARA>
<PARA> Having reached the decision that I have on the material before me in accordance with what the High Court has said, and what the Act clearly states, I do not find any great difficulty in relying upon what might be an administrative error regarding the application for citizenship. The bigger decision was as to whether deportation was appropriate. When one decided that it was, by comparison the other decision was really not a major one. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) spoke of possible legal proceedings. If there are to be any-and I would not be surprised if there were-my decision and the entire file, with my reasons stated therein, will be open to scrutiny by the appropriate court-as too will be the hearsay assertions advanced on behalf of Mr Pochi by the honourable member for Fraser. I remind the House that, if those proceedings are undertaken, the cooling-off period which has been referred to will certainly be available, but in order to found any other legal proceedings a decision has first to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one other point in relation to that. A report in this morning's Canberra Times suggested that the Department had given the Pochis 72 hours in which to leave the country. That is not so. It is normal to ask people, when they are told that they are to be deported, to let the Department know their plans for departure. I would never have contemplated asking people who had been here for the time that the Pochis have been here to consider departing in 72 hours. I think it reasonable that they inform us what plans Mr Pochi, at least, is making for his departure. One would expect that any reasonable time that they asked for thereafter would be granted. </PARA>
<PARA> My final observation is to remind the House of my opening remarks regarding why I brought the matter before honourable members. I regard the public interest in the relationship of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Executive as of the utmost importance. To some extent it has been alluded to by honourable members in acknowledging its importance. Nevertheless, the debate has tended to focus on the personal case of Mr Pochi rather than the really significant principles underlying the relationship of the Tribunal to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I have taken into account all of the matters raised by honourable members. I am convinced that my decision is the appropriate one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The latest Fraser health scheme is now five months old and we can make the first assessment of the rents and cracks that are appearing in it. The costs are clearly accelerating despite all the talk of cost constraint. The confusion is growing, particularly where we predicted it would grow, that is, the provision of cards for the disadvantaged. The ramshackle structure becomes more inequitable with each day that passes, primarily because of the increasing costs falling on individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me take costs first. On 1 September, as a result of Commonwealth Government policies, the States were compelled to raise their basic rate hospital bed charges by 60 per cent from $50 a day to $80 a day, in most cases-a quite massive increase in charges. Barely three months under this new scheme had passed when the Government of New South Wales, as a result of increases in nurses' salaries, was compelled to make a further large increase-a 20 per cent rise in bed charges, to $96 a day. </PARA>
<PARA> The response of the Federal Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) to these decisions of the New South Wales Government is illuminating. Firstly, he accused the New South Wales Labor Government of electioneering, in not providing in its pre-election Budget for the rise in nurses' salaries. I want to know from the Minister today, and I hope I get a response, whether he will accuse every Liberal Premier-now desperately staving off further rises in hospital charges until he gets his election out of the way-of electioneering when, later in the year, he too will be forced to raise charges?</PARA>
<PARA> He then accused the New South Wales Government of having little regard for the effect of its decision on the cost of insurance. Again I ask him whether he will accuse the Liberal State governments of a similar disregard when inevitably in the coming months their hospital bed charges are raised. Finally, the Minister huffed and puffed about the responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government in the area of health insurance and its keenness to keep health insurance available at reasonable cost. But what did he do? The Minister, in fact, acquiesced in the rise in hospital bed charges in New South Wales. Indeed, he formally approved them. Now, as a result, he has approved the consequential rises of between $1.20 a week and $1.50 a week in health insurance charges in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt with this response in detail because the lesson of this story is that the Minister has simply lost control of hospital charges in this country, yet remains responsible for the insurance increases that flow from them. That is the dilemma with which the Federal Government is now faced. It cannot control hospital bed day charges effectively, yet remains in control of the health insurance system and will receive the blame for the increases that follow. Indeed, the activities in some of the State treasuries now must certainly be alarming the Minister. Twelve months ago we warned the Minister, as did the Jamison Committee, that to abdicate responsibility for hospitals, to divorce responsibility for hospital charges from responsibility for health insurance would lead to disaster. I think that the Minister and the Government, in their latest scheme, are now upon that slippery slope that will lead to the extinction of the fifth experiment in health insurance by this Government. The flow-on of increases in nurses' salaries will inevitably affect hospital bed charges in other States besides New South Wales, as will other efforts by the State governments to use hospital charges to deal with their own budgetary problems. For instance, it was announced this morning that Victoria is clearly considering rises occurring prior to the increase in nurses' salaries taking place. No doubt there will have to be increases afterwards. Mr Borthwick implied quite clearly this morning that his Government is already contemplating the raising of hospital bed day charges. There will be further rises in doctors' fees before the end of the year. The competitive pressure noted by the Opposition four or five months ago, to keep contribution rates down, so that the health insurance funds could attract as many new members as possible, is already beginning to affect the reserves of those funds. Thus, health insurance rates are bound to rise this year, well in advance of the rate of inflation. A conservative estimate-this is a conservative estimate; most of our estimates last year were conservative and proved to be accurate-is that by the end of the year, basic health contribution rates will average $12 a week per family, across the nation. I stress that that is a minimum estimate of average figures for the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is already clear that the latest charges are useless as cost containment measures. They might save the Government some money, although even that is becoming increasingly dubious, but clearly they are leading to an escalation of health costs to the community. Moreover, the latest changes made to the health scheme on 1 September have directly fed inflation and inflationary expectations flowing from the consumer price index increases. Over one-third of the December CPI increase stemmed from changes to the health scheme. That 1.3 per cent increase attributed to the health area in the December CPI was almost twice the level predicted by the Government in the Budget papers. So much for the credibility of this Government. There is no need to worry about Government comments on any health figures because it cannot even get its own figures right. The Government predicted a three and a quarter per cent impact and it got 1.3 per cent impact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the cost problem and we will return to that in a moment. We will give the Minister his opportunity. I now turn to the bureaucratic morass around the health care cards. We predicted there would be problems. The scheme has been going for five months and at the moment only about one-third of those whom we were told would be eligible have been granted cards. The latest figures I have are for 12 February 1982, when the estimated number of accepted claims totalled 170,000. The Minister told us some five months ago that it was anticipated that some 460,000 individuals would be eligible to make claims for these cards. So, after five months, we are running well behind the eligible level of claims for health cards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think, too, that every honourable member in this House can tell stories- horror stories-about the problems ranging around these cards. I refer to one such problem I have encountered this week. We all know that the income level neces- sary to be eligible for a health care card, for a couple, was raised on 1 November from $160 to $165 a week. However, this rise is deceptive as the increase is only partially indexed. In the long run eligibility for the card will decline if partial indexation for the card continues as provided for in the amending Act; that is, fewer and fewer people will be eligible for the card while this system of indexation continues. Fewer people will be eligible for the card at the end of 1982 than at the beginning of the year. The confusion over entitlement to the card is compounded by the department that issues the card. I know that, in a sense, the Minister for Health is not really responsible for the Department of Social Security; no doubt he has enough problems in his own Department. Let us look at problems arising in the Department of Social Security . I refer to a form letter sent out to claimants for the card. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Your present health care card tells you how much income you are allowed to have during any four weeks before you lose your eligibility to the card. From 1 November 1981 this four weekly amount of income has been increased to the value shown below. </PARA>
<PARA>What is shown below is, for a married couple, an amount of $825 per four weeks; that is, $206.25 a week. I would not blame somebody who received this letter for believing that the Government had suddenly been struck by extraordinary generosity and had raised the figure on 1 November from $160 to $206.25. That is what the letter appears to say. We here who know about the complex details of this measure know that that is simply a reference to temporary eligibility for the health card once a person has it. It has nothing to do with the level for initial eligibility and it has nothing to do with the continuation of the card after six months. It is simply a statement of what happens within the six month period so that a person does not lose the card. The constituent who received the letter to which I referred and no doubt many others simply believed that at these income levels one would be eligible to secure a health care card and continue to hold it at the end of the six-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the very least the Government can do is to explain lucidly and simply the complexities of the scheme and stop putting out clearly misleading information such as this which any ordinary, intelligent elector could not but perceive was a statement that eligibility had been raised to $206. 25 a week, when we know that eligibility, for a couple, is $165 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The increasing values of both the pensioner health benefit card and the health care card are forcing people into even more desperate ploys in order to retain them. Given that the loss of the card compels a couple to a minimum of $10 a week for basic health insurance payments the desperation of these people is understandable. Indeed, the health care card, coupled with a notch effect-that is, an arbitrary single cut-off point for eligibility-may well act as a poverty trap, discouraging the pursuit of extra earnings for fear of the risks involved.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally on the critical side, the inequity of the present arrangements stemming from the payment of flat rate money contributions for health insurance, unrelated to income and paid by all except the very poor needs no further stressing. It should be noted that as flat rate money contributions rise inexorably, as they will do this year, that inequity is simply compounded, as it will be through the rest of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has announced an alternative to the present medi- muddle. Firstly, it is obvious and little questioned by anyone that tying payments for health cover to income is a fairer way of providing health cover than flat rate money payments. Secondly, no one doubts that universality will be guaranteed through the operation of the health levy. Thirdly, there seems general agreement that the Labor plan is simpler than the present complex plan- not that that would be difficult; I do not make great claims that we have managed to achieve anything particular in that respect. Fourthly, the income- related levy will minimise if not completely eliminate the problems around the cut-off points for pensioner health benefit cards and health care cards. It may not completely eliminate all the problems but it will go a long way towards minimising them. Finally, the scheme announced by the Labor Party provides much more effective instruments for cost constraint if governments are prepared to use them. </PARA>
<PARA> The only serious criticisms advanced relate to the costing of the Labor plan. The costings have been carefully worked over by experts both within and outside the Labor Party and we are confident of their accuracy. I seek the leave of the House to have incorporated in Hansard a detailed breakdown of the costing of both the outlay and revenue sides of the plan. We have tried to indicate to the House the source of all those figures. Most of them are Government figures, and of course we have had to rely on their accuracy. It is a very detailed breakdown which I hope will facilitate intelligent discussion of the plan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The specific criticism of the costing is that the 0.75 per cent levy on taxable income is pitched too low. The related question is also asked: Why is the health levy distinctly lower than that contemplated for the original Medibank? The general answer is that just as health insurance today does not cover the full cost of the provision of health care but simply that which is left over after all the subsidies have been allowed for, so the health levy is designed simply to fill the gap that remains on the revenue side once the extensive subsidies in the system already have been fully utilised. The beat-up front page story of the Australian simply discredited those experts who failed to make that kind of distinction.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with that now. We do not intend to take away any of the extensive subsidies already in the system. We intend to rearrange them in a more efficient, more direct and more equitable way. This rearrangement permits us to have a relatively low levy and to reduce the direct weekly costs for additional private insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem of the proposed levy being lower than that of the original Medibank has been raised, but the answer is simply that the subsidies in the system are now far greater than pre-1974. I will list four of those major extra subsidies. Firstly, prior to Medibank 1 the pensioner benefit was only 60 per cent of fees and did not apply to private specialists. The moneys for 85 per cent cover and specialist cover for pensioners-an increase of at least $200m on 1981-82 figures -are now in the system. Indeed, further moneys are there providing such cover for the disadvantaged. Secondly, the Commonwealth subsidy for medical insurance is more significant today than in pre-Medibank days. In 1981-82 the Commonwealth will meet about 50 per cent of the insurable medical bills. Thirdly, the tax rebate for health involves a significantly greater amount of forgone revenue than did the pre-Medibank tax deductibility system. Fourthly, and above all, the Commonwealth today, even this Government, is contributing much more to hospital costs than was the case pre-Medibank. Even this Government is meeting about 35 per cent of all public health costs compared with only 13 per cent in the pre- Medibank period. Thus, because of the greatly increased subsidies within the system-over $1,000m in real terms over pre-Medibank-it is possible to construct a responsible health system with a much lower levy than contemplated in the earlier period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the honourable member's reticence in answering the question because it is one of tremendous significance. He has ducked for cover, as I would expect him to do, because it is the question which all the Australian people will be asking and it is something which naturally enough the Australian Labor Party will have to explain in the very near future. But once again we see the Opposition searching for some feasible line with which to criticise the Government's health scheme. I would say at this stage that this is a scheme which has been readily accepted by the people of Australia since its introduction on 1 September last year. I think it can be clearly seen that the scheme has been accepted by the fact that nearly all of the population of this country is protected in some form or other for health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I fully realise that the honourable member for Bonython has been running around the country trying to stir up discontent with the population over the Government 's health scheme. As recently as last week he was interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Commission armed, as usual, with incorrect information, saying that up to two million Australians were not covered for health insurance. I should like to lay out the facts of the situation. As at 30 November 1981 over 70 per cent of the population had hospital insurance, with about 66 per cent of the population having medical insurance as well. The hospital insurance figure provides a better estimate for insurance coverage as a number of people would have chosen to take hospital only insurance, either because they have chosen to meet medical costs out of their own pocket, to receive medical treatment at an outpatients clinic and/or are happy with a hospital doctor should they require surgery. Over 20 per cent of the population is covered by the Commonwealth's free health arrangements which look after those in special need. Again we have this tired old argument trotted out by the honourable member for Bonython that the figures of those who have actually taken out the cards do not correspond with those who are eligible for the cards. The fact of the matter, as I have been putting forward time and time again, is that people do not have to take out those cards until it is necessary for them so to do. There is a retrospective element in the issuing of those cards which conveniently is forgotten always by the spokesman for the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Over one million people in Queensland, or about 7 per cent of the total population, have not taken out any insurance cover. The principal reason is that the State's traditional free public hospital system still operates. I should like honourable members to keep that point in mind when we have a closer look at a later stage at the modestly named Hayden health plan. I am sorry that it is not called the Blewett health plan because I acknowledge that he did most of the work involved. Nevertheless, he does not seem to rate too highly in the naming stakes. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of persons in New South Wales may not have insured because of the decision by that State Government to provide free public hospital treatment to certain categories of people. For example, over 100,000 pensioners who are not eligible for a pensioner health benefit card are covered by the New South Wales State Government arrangement. A number of these persons could be expected to have decided that health insurance was unnecessary for their purposes. Also, about one per cent of the population is covered by commercial insurance arrangements. So if we add all that up, it can clearly be seen that despite the propaganda emanating from the honourable member for Bonython, and other Labor Party spokesmen, there is no confusion in the minds of the public as to what the Government's health scheme is all about. In fact, one could make the observation that the only person who seems to be confused about the Government's health scheme is sitting opposite me at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned in this House last year, and it is still true today, the attitude of the Australian Labor Party towards the Government's health scheme is , 'To blazes with the best interests of the people. Let us create confusion; let us try to convince people that something is complex,' when any calm, considered analysis of the arrangements would refute that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency of Hospital Administration highlighted considerable waste and inefficiency in the States' public hospital systems and identified a range of areas in which performance could be improved dramatically. That is a fact which the Opposition conveniently overlooks. In fact, the New South Wales Minister for Health, who is not a conservative, acknowledges that there is inefficiency. I quote from the Sydney Morning Herald of 13 February this year:</PARA>
<PARA> If we just run around in circles and approach the problems by tipping the usual bucket on Canberra, while not doing everything we can to get our own house in order, we are bound to fail. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is at least one Labor Party Minister acknowledging that there is a great deal to do in order to clean up the inefficiencies which exist in State government situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry also pointed out that there is an oversupply of hospital beds, wasteful duplication of facilities, inappropriate geographic location of facilities, an apparent lack of sound management principles and that some hospital administrators and State governments do not exercise proper control over expenditure. Significantly, from the Commonwealth's point of view, it found that the divided responsibility between the Commonwealth and the State governments arising from the hospital cost sharing agreements was a contributing factor. In the face of this evidence the Government could not just stand by and allow the then funding arrangements for State health services to continue. We could not allow taxpayers' funds to be used to underwrite waste and inefficiency . We therefore undertook a thorough review of those arrangements. That review culminated in my statement to Parliament in April last year in which I announced a number of major changes to the present health financing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes have resulted in full constitutional responsibility for the provision of health services and for determining priorities for the allocation of funds to the different parts of the health system being returned to the States. They have resulted in all Australians becoming more responsible for their own health care needs and lifestyle and more aware of the full cost of the health services available to them. They have resulted in special assistance being available only to those in special need. They have resulted in people in the community who can pay their own way contributing to the cost of their health care. They have resulted in health insurance being available to all at a reasonable cost and on a community rating basis. In fact, health insurance today is cheaper than at the same time last year, once the tax rebate of 32c in the dollar is taken into account. Again the honourable member for Bonython always fails to acknowledge that point. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes have also resulted in the Government offering general assistance towards health care costs only to those who are willing to help themselves by taking out health insurance. They stress the important role of the private sector in the health care system being fully recognised and providers of health care services becoming more aware of the costs which they generate. Finally, they have resulted in a slowing in the rise in the costs of health care and the health cost burden of the general community. I find it somewhat difficult to understand how those on the Opposition side can complain about mounting costs, given their performance in the Whitlam years. Total health care costs rose substantially in the Labor years of government. The only substantial halt to the cost increases came with the advent of this Government. I quote the figures. In 1972-73 total health care costs were $2,505m; for 1973-74 the figure was $3,012m an increase of 20.2 per cent; for 1974-75 the figure was up 37.7 per cent; and for 1975-76, it was up 35.1 per cent. Then this Government came into power and the figure decreased to 14.7 per cent. In 1977-78 the figure decreased to 13.1 per cent and in 1978-79, 9.8 per cent. A similar pattern applies to gross operating costs of public hospitals. The dangers of a reintroduction of a recycled Medibank under the guise of the Hayden plan are clearly evident for Australian taxpayers, given that record of cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's political opponents have been attempting to claim that the new health policy will limit people's access to health care because some individuals will not have sufficient income to pay for health services or take out insurance , that somehow the Government's arrangements are inequitable. This claim is patently incorrect. As part of the Government's aim of ensuring that all Australians have proper access to high quality health care, it has decided to introduce special assistance arrangements to help those in genuine need. It is claimed by the Labor Party and some academics who should know better, that the Government's health policy is inequitable as all people who insure pay the same premium, irrespective of their income. We have heard that cry frequently from the honourable member for Bonython. What he and those critics fail to acknowledge is that people on high incomes will bear a larger burden of the cost of government assistance in the health area than people on lower incomes. This is because the Government's subsidies provided for health are financed through the taxation system, so those on higher incomes are already paying more towards financing the health care. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bonython has made a great deal of noise about the costs to the individual of the Government's health scheme. Once again, I feel it incumbent upon me to advise him of the facts. The Government has recognised that for community rated health insurance to operate effectively it is important that insurance contributions should be set at levels that most people in the community can afford to pay. With this in mind and with the objective of assisting those willing to assist themselves, the Government decided that contributions for basic hospital and medical insurance with registered health insurers would attract a tax rebate of 32c in the dollar; that Commonwealth medical benefits be restricted to those people who have at least basic medical cover with a registered insurer and be payable at a flat rate of 30 per cent of the scheduled medical fees; and that the Government's payment to assist health insurers to pay hospital benefits for the chronically ill be set at $100m this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's critics claim that a principal aim of the new health policy, namely, the containment of health costs, will not be achieved-we have heard that today-principally because that policy promotes the use of services provided by the private sector of the health care delivery system. That claim basically amounts to a criticism of 'fee-for-service' payment arrangements and the operation of private hospitals. Put another way, it is an argument in favour of the expansion of the public sector of the health care delivery system. I think the honourable member for Bonython would agree that what he is essentially after is an expansion of the public sector at the expense of the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that any health care delivery system operating in Australia can be abused. Because we do recognise this, we have taken and will continue to take strong measures to prevent over-use and abuse of the health care delivery system. We have taken action to reduce the incidence of abuse by those few people in the health care professions who may seek to misuse or defraud the system for their own gain. A vigorous attack on medical fraud through collaboration between my Department, the Australian Federal Police and the Attorney-General's Department resulted in 22 successful prosecutions in 1981 and a further six cases are now before the courts. That effort will be sustained , and I would hope to see more people who deserve to come before the courts so coming before the courts and being charged and convicted. The medical profession had always held a high place in public esteem. Nonetheless those practitioners who abuse their position are now on notice that they will be vigorously pursued.</PARA>
<PARA> Since my original indication that the ALP costings for its proposal might be understated by as much as $150m, I have been provided with figures which quite frankly are so alarming in the extent to which they show that Labor has undercosted its plan, that I have asked that they be thoroughly re-checked by my Department. The costings I have seen so far make a mockery of the suggestion that the ALP could fund its plan through a 0.75 per cent levy. That is why I asked the question of the honourable member for Bonython, and that is why he refused to answer it. It would be a cruel deceit if the ALP were to try to convince the public that health care would be provided free or at a substantially reduced cost to the public. Without a massive injection of government funds, with its implications for taxation and inflation, the ALP plan would inevitably lead to increasing demand on the resources of the public hospital system-the most costly sector within the health care delivery system- thereby straining services to such an extent that access would be delayed or denied, people would need to queue for medical treatment, and those less able to meet the costs of services would need to compete with people better able to pay for private health services. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's scheme provides no encouragement to the general community to accept greater personal responsibility for their health care costs through the user pays principle and by promoting bulk billing the Labor plan would facilitate fraud and over-servicing. Labor's plan would take back to the Commonwealth involvement in decisions such as on hospital standards. The incentives which this Government has provided through its policy for the States to effect efficiencies in their public hospital systems would be lost. Labor's plan ignores the tremendous contribution of general practice and its cost effectiveness. It has been clearly demonstrated that general practitioner consultations result in proportionately far fewer repeat consultations, referrals to specialists and so on than do consultations conducted in hospital outpatients and casualty departments. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's plan is clearly hastily conceived and poorly thought through. No mention is made for instance, of the nursing home benefit for which the Government will be spending approximately $600m in 1981-82; and it is by no means clear on what is proposed in regard to separated people with dependants, Australian taxpayers overseas, servicemen and their families, veterans and their families and overseas visitors to Australia. It would be a disaster. </PARA>

He is still just making the threats. If that is the way in which the Department functions under him, it is no wonder that the scheme is a mess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister is disputing the number of uninsured people in the country. We claim that it is about two million, taking into account the people in New South Wales who are not insured-it does not matter for what reason-and likewise in Queensland, and there it seems to be in defiance of the Federal Government, with Queenslanders hell-bent on maintaining their free hospital system. The Minister says that there are many people who are automatically entitled, and of course that includes pensioners. They are in the 20 per cent that is the balance that we are claiming contains many people who are uninsured. But of course, the Minister does not take any notice of the fact that, sadly, an enormous proportion of pensioners take out insurance because they are fearful that if they get ill they will need to have the care which can be obtained only through private medical practice. So despite the fact that theoretically they do not need to take out cover, they do so. Therefore, we stick to our estimate that there is an uncomfortably large number of people in the community not insured. </PARA>
<PARA> As to be expected, the kneejerk reaction-that is a reaction without any cerebral effort, with no thought whatsoever-by the Liberal Government through the Minister and other members of the Goverment, and others no doubt, has been to make the most harrowing forecasts about the effects of Labor's health proposal. It was the same when we first proposed a national health scheme in 1968. We were greeted with cries of 'thin end of the socialist wedge', 'will send the country bankrupt', 'the neurotics will overload the medical profession when they do not have to pay anything under bulk billing', and 'no one really ill will ever be able to see a doctor', and similar hysterical nonsense. The answer to all that decerebrate rubbish was the response of the electorate in 1969, and through that response, the move by the then leader of the Liberal Government, Prime Minister Gorton, to introduce, in a ham-fisted way, the essence of at least one facet of our proposal-cover for the poor who had no cover under the voluntary health insurance system, and that is the situation now , too. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which this was proposed to be overcome by Gorton was by introducing what was called the subsidised health benefits plan. It required the underprivileged to apply for cover under the scheme. That is the case today. By way of excuse, the Minister says, when we make the charge that many people who should be covered are not, that they do not have to apply for cover until they need it because then it will all be retrospective. The interesting question is, why do they not apply? The answer is, of course, that for a variety of reasons such as feelings of inadequacy, resentment of characterisation as underprivileged, lack of information or plain inability to comprehend the complexities of the system, only an insignificant proportion of the population which should have been covered was enrolled in the plan and enabled to have access to the services which we offered and ultimately, of course, automatically introduced as a right under Medibank. The same situation prevails today. One can say quite glibly that it will be retrospective when the need arises, but I am sure that that is not what people are feeling. They are feeling humiliated. They may well be forced to take advantage of the system when they have to, but that is no answer to the effect on them as individuals by virtue of this, in our view , unseemly pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the cost of health care rose significantly in the 1970s, and again Labor was blamed without thought or recognition of the facts. Costs started to rise towards the end of the 1960s, standing at about 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product in 1968-69 and rising to 6.78 per cent of GDP in 1974-75. This was occurring before there were any changes to the basic system by Labor because Medibank was introduced in July 1975. I obtained those figures from reports of the Commonwealth Department of Health for 1974-75 and 1977-78. With the introduction of Medibank in July 1975 costs continued to rise in the same way and, after the destruction of Medibank by the Liberal Government, costs for health services to the whole community still continued to rise. Preliminary estimates for 1978-79-they are the latest figures available and they are still only preliminary estimates-indicate that we are now up to 7.5 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> Medibank did not arrest the trend nor have the changes the Government has made. All that the changes to Medibank by the Liberal Government have achieved is an apparent reduction in the cost of health services to the Federal Government. By saying 'the Federal Government' one is implying 'the taxpayer' because there is less taxpayer revenue going via the Federal Government. But that in no way is a comfort to the average person. Along with the theoretical possibility of reduced taxes due to the reduced Commonwealth responsibility for health care costs there has been a significant direct increase in costs to the individual. Now we all must take out private health insurance cover, compared with Medibank days-that is, Medibank I. The contribution rates are inequitable in that they are independent of the indvidual's income. Thus we are back to the situation which existed before Medibank whereby the poor subsidise the rich for health services.</PARA>
<PARA> Tax reduction remains a theoretical possibility only. In fact, the burden of taxation has increased significantly for low income earners whilst it has reduced or at least stabilised for the rich. I am not blaming all that on the health services but in general terms I am making the point that the changes the Government has made to the health scheme, which supposedly were to reduce the cost, in fact have not meant a reduction in cost in terms of either the taxation people are paying or the actual out-of-pocket expenses for individuals in the community because all are expected to pay benefit contributions to the benefit funds. In the way it is done under the private health insurance system the poor, in essence, are slugged at a much greater rate than the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> With the population now divided into the underprivileged and the rest, with stringent assessment criteria being imposed on the poor to enable them to qualify for health care without having to pay contributions to private health funds, we have confusion heaped upon indignity for the less well-off in society. I am sure that no one in this chamber would like to have to expose himself to the embarrassment associated with seeking to establish one's needs and lack of resources under the present Liberal Government scheme to qualify for health care with no cost in terms of contributions to health funds. It is an insulting poorhouse approach which surely should not be imposed on anyone in this country in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> I will return to the ostensible aim of the Liberal Government in changing Medibank, particulary the more recent changes. As I have said, the apparent aim was to reduce the cost to the Commonwealth, never mind the public. Even this deplorable aim has not been achieved. This is the reason we are able to propose a modest levy of 0.75 per cent on taxable income with generous exclusions for low income earners, particularly those with dependants, and we would be able to provide universal access for all to medical services with a rebate of 85 per cent of the fee if the doctor decides to bulk bill. If the doctor bulk bills the patient pays nothing and the doctor is satisfied with the 85 per cent. In any case, whether the doctor bulk bills or not, we would provide a maximum payment of $10 for any service. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is this possible? The Minister for Health questioned us about what we would do if the levy did not cover it. Let us look at what has happened under this Government. Let me elaborate on the matter of the Commonwealth contribution because this is the basis of our calculations. The Commonwealth, the Liberal Government, now puts in much more money than it used to in pre-Medibank days. A large part of of the additional cost of Medibank I, which had to be met from the then proposed 1.35 per cent levy, was due to a decision to increase pensioner benefits from 60 per cent to 85 per cent of fees and to extend these to specialist services because previously pensioners were covered for general practitioner services alone. No one would propose that we go back on that. The Liberal Government would not and we certainly would not. The cost of that was $ 200m, looking at it in 1981-82 values. In other words, it is not now necessary for us to find that money. It is there. The Liberals have retained the 85 per cent benefit and extended it to the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981-82 Commonwealth benefits will meet about 50 per cent of all insurable medical bills. In other words, we have to raise only about 38 per cent to replace the present private insurance benefits. Adding to that the tax concessions which we would give, not in the form of tax concessions which again favour the rich but in the form of direct benefits, that would cover easily the loss of revenue by reducing hospital charges to patients going into private hospitals or extending free treatment. The Commonwealth Government is now putting much more into hospitals via State grants than it did pre-Medibank, so again we would not have to raise those funds. The Government is already putting them in there. We are not suggesting that we would cut back on Commonwealth spending. We are simply saying how we could reorganise the present expenditure to fit in with our proposal and still fund it all with a modest 0.75 per cent levy. I am sure that when the Minister looks into it he will find that that is true. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to join this debate. It is an excellent opportunity to support the Government's initiatives of the last year and to comment upon the Australian Labor Party's policy recently announced. Australia spends approximately 8 per cent of its gross domestic product on health care. That is a proportion which has increased very greatly from the early 1970s. The expenditure of the Department of Health exceeded $3.25 billion last year. It is essential that public money of this kind be spent in an efficient and effective way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In discussing the present scheme it is instructive to remember what existed before. For many years there was general concern about whether we were getting value for money in the health area. This concern grew as the proportion of the expenditure on health increased. This concern led to the establishment, amongst other things, of the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals. The Commission highlighted considerable waste and inefficiency in the States' public hospital systems and identified areas where performance could be improved dramatically. In particular it pointed to the over -supply of hospital beds, the duplication of facilities and the inappropriate geographic location of facilities. There was an apparent lack of sound management principles and there were some hospital administrators and State governments that did not exercise proper control over expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extraordinary that the Opposition should now bring on a matter of public importance alleging mounting expenditure when the previous inefficiencies arising from its own free spending past have been so thoroughly documented and condemned. The Commonwealth Government could not allow taxpayers' funds to be used to underwrite such waste and inefficiency. The Government, therefore, undertook a thorough review of the then existing arrangements and closely considered a number of options aimed at overcoming the problems revealed. This review was carried out within the context of the Government's overall health policy. The health care delivery system in this country is extremely complex and no one part of it can be considered separately. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter included in the review was the relationship between Government financial assistance and the health insurance system. The combination of free public hospital treatment for all people irrespective of their income and the existing Commonwealth medical benefit arrangements had caused a gradual erosion of health fund membership. As a result of the community rating principle, whereby the burdens of ill health are shared through a common contribution rate, those most dependent upon health insurance-the aged, people with chronic illness and families with children-would have been seriously threatened had the Government permitted the trend away from community rated insurance to continue. Those people would certainly have had to pay much higher health insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, one of the Government's objectives was to establish an environment in which all Australians would become more responsible for their health care needs and more aware of the full cost of health services provided to them. When patients have to make a personal contribution, however small, for the health services they receive, they are likely to question doctors about the need for and the likely benefit of the procedure and treatment. Further, the Government recognised that, if those who could afford to pay were required to contribute towards their health costs, taxation could be lower than would otherwise be the case and Government financial assistance could be directed more towards those in genuine need. </PARA>
<PARA> Last April, the Government announced policies designed to achieve a number of objectives, including that all Australians should become more responsible for their health care needs and more aware of the full cost of the health services provided to them. The policies provided that special assistance be made available only to those in special need and that people in the community who could pay their way should be encouraged to do so. Health insurance was made available to all at a reasonable cost and on a community rated basis. It is interesting to note that the gloomy forecasts by the Opposition on the cost of health insurance in the event were proved quite wrong. Contribution rates for health insurance are at the lowest rate relative to average weekly earnings for approximately five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of these measures can readily be judged by the wide acceptance of the new arrangements throughout the community. On the information currently available, as the Minister has already indicated, well over 90 per cent of the population are now covered against health costs. Indeed, over 70 per cent have taken out private health insurance. The remaining 20 per cent are essentially covered by Government programs such as those for pensioners and those in special need. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XD7">Mr HARRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish the interjection was relevant to the point I am making. The fact is that the vast proportion of the Australian populace is covered. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) tried to suggest that those who have not taken out a health card have not done so because they may have been embarrassed about it. That seems a most unlikely explanation. There seems to be no reluctance on the part of those eligible for pensioner health benefit cards to take them out. It seems unlikely that persons of younger years would be any more embarrassed. The probability is that, knowing that they do not have to take out a card before they have treatment, they have simply not troubled to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite Opposition allegations of inequity, there is one area of spending in which the Government has a clear and unequivocal commitment; that is to the needy. We have maintained the protection now afforded to eligible pensioners and their dependants. They are eligible for free public hospital accommodation and treatment and for bulk billed medical services. The Government has guaranteed the same protection for all migrants and refugees during their first six months in Australia and for unemployed people, special beneficiaries and others who meet the income test. It is worth noting that that income test is a fair one, having regard to the current level of income earnings. The income limit of $165 a week for married couples is equal to almost 60 per cent of average weekly earnings. The allowance of $20 a week for each child is equal to approximately 7 per cent of average weekly earnings. For example, a married man with three children can earn $225 a week, which is almost 75 per cent of average weekly earnings on the latest figures, and still qualify for special assistance. I repeat: A man with a wife and three children and who earns 75 per cent of average weekly earnings will still qualify for special assistance. These eligibility levels are adjusted twice yearly. </PARA>
<PARA> When such cover is available, it is just not valid to allege inequity. The policies that we have implemented will ensure that those in special need are covered for health care, that the Government's expenditure on health care is well placed and that the overall goal of proper access to high quality health services at a cost that the individual can afford is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition is still wedded to the concept of Medibank, a concept which has been demonstrated not to work. The Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals set that out chapter and verse, but most Australians already knew that Medibank just did not work. Uncontrolled expenditure did not help those who needed it most. Large sums were spent on those who could have helped themselves. Public funds were wasted. As the Minister has said, a cost explosion would happen if Labor's new policy were implemented. Mounting costs, growing confusion and increased inequity are terms which are not referable to the current scheme but are referable to Labour's proposal. If Labor's proposal were implemented, we would certainly see inequities and cost explosions. We are happily not seeing them at present. </PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned by the threats to women's health and lives posed by Toxic Shock Syndrome, and urge the following steps to be taken as a matter of urgency: -</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to : (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed. This campaign of public education would necessitate multilingual distribution of the information where appropriate.</PARA>

I now move amendment No. 16:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (16) Clause 40, page 27, omit the clause, substitute the following clause: Documents concerning certain operations of agencies '40. A document is an exempt document if its disclosure under this Act-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) would, or could reasonably be expected to-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) prejudice the effectiveness of procedures or methods for the conduct of tests, examinations or audits by an agency;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) prejudice the attainment of the objects of particular tests, examinations or audits conducted or to be conducted by an agency;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) have a substantial adverse effect on the management or assessment of personnel by the Commonwealth or by an agency; or</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) have a substantial adverse effect on the conduct by or on behalf of the Commonwealth or an agency of industrial relations negotiations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) would be contrary to the public interest.'. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 40 of the Bill relates to documents concerning certain operations of agencies and provides that such documents will be exempt under certain circumstances. Criteria are given. Honourable members will notice that our proposed amendment states much the same thing, that is, that the documents are exempt. However, we seek to add the very important criterion that it is essential that exemption be granted only if the disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. In other words, we include in our proposed amendment relating to internal testing by agencies an overriding public interest test. Our proposed amendment provides that a document is exempt if there is a suggestion that disclosure would cause difficulties by way of procedures or audits, or if there would be an adverse effect on supervision, management policy or industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> That is fine, but let us talk about the public interest in respect of all those matters. I need not delay the debate too much; I merely say that our proposition is that documents certainly should be exempt if their disclosure would prejudice the effectiveness of procedures or the attainment of objects or would have an adverse effect on management or conduct by or on behalf of the Commonweath or an agency of industrial relations and would be contrary to the public interest. Unless public interest is involved in all those matters we are not helping the real concept of what we are about, that is, strong democracy with information being made available to the people who elect us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept this amendment. Without recapitulating what clause 40 provides, I can explain the background to the Government's decision not to accept the amendment. There is a concern that the inability to protect the confidentiality of documents, such as reports on efficiency reviews and staff utilisation reviews within an agency, would inhibit the full and frank co-operation which is required for those reviews to be conducted effectivley. Paragraph (b) of clause 40 of the Bill would enable the confidentiality of such documents to be protected when it can be shown that their disclosure would or could reasonably be expected to have a substantial adverse effect on review procedures or on achieving acceptance of proposals resulting from those reviews.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, a more significant problem could be caused by confining the industrial relations test solely to industrial relations negotiations. In particular instances, in practice there is no distinction between industrial relations policy and matters going to industrial relations negotiations, administration and arbitration. In the common circumstance, when authorities or departments are , like unions, conducting negotiations on the basis of a broad policy or strategy the release of policy or other material most likely would compromise the negotiating stance not only for any talks already in train but also for talks which could arise for some time to come. I think that is a very important point. If parties are conducting such negotiations or are engaged in a matter of industrial relations it would be unfair to provide under this legislation, in the name of freedom of information, the capacity for a party outside government to call for the production of documents which a government agency is relying upon them, from the very nature of things, negotiations or another aspect of the conduct of industrial relations are proceeding. I suppose one might say that there is an element of fairness in that, which in itself is a quality of some importance when trying to judge what is or is not in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> To add a separate public interest test would place an undue limitation on the exemption which is provided for in the Bill. Clause 40 of the Bill directs attention to the fact that the kinds of harm specified in the clause are themselves contrary to public interest. It is enough that those kinds of harm might reasonably be expected to result from the disclosure of documents to make a document exempt. The argument in this is not unlike the argument I addressed on behalf of the Government when considering amendment No. 15, the last amendment we considered last night. </PARA>

<PARA> (17) Clause 43, page 28, omit paragraphs (b) and (c) of sub-clause (1), substitute the following word and paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) 'or (b) information (other than trade secrets) concerning a person in respect of his business or professional affairs or concerning the business, commercial or financial affairs of an organisation or undertaking, being information-</PARA>

<PARA> (18) Clause 43, page 28, omit sub-clause (3), substitute the following sub- clauses:</PARA>
<PARA> '(3) A document is an exempt document if its disclosure under this Act would disclose information (other than trade secrets) concerning the business, commercial or financial affairs of an undertaking that is carried on by, or by an authority of, the Commonwealth, being information the disclosure of which under this Act-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) would, or could reasonably be expected to, unreasonably disadvantage that undertaking in respect of its lawful business, commercial or financial affairs; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) would be contrary to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> '(4) A reference in sub-sections (1) and (2) to an undertaking includes a reference to an undertaking that is carried on by, or by an authority of, a State, the Northern Territory or a local government authority.'. </PARA>
<PARA>I deal first with amendment No. 17, which proposes that paragraphs (b) and (c) of clause 43 (1) be omitted. If honourable members look at clause 43 they will see that it deals with documents relating to business affairs, et cetera, and provides that such documents are to be exempt in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) trade secrets;-</PARA>
<PARA>We have no objection to that-</PARA>
<PARA> (b) any other information having a commercial value . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Information (other than trade secrets or information to which paragraph (b) applies) concerning a person in respect of his business . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That would be information which, if it were disclosed, would be likely to affect adversely that person. If honourable members look at our amendment they will see that what we are saying is that we ought to be able to draft this provision better than it has been drafted. Virtually, we want to remove paragraphs (b) and (c) as printed in the Bill and to reinstate paragraph (c), which relates to the situation when disclosure would affect a person adversely. Paragraph (c) of the clause seeks to exclude material which might damage a person. Therefore, in our view, it renders paragraph (b) unnecessary. We seek to tidy up this clause by drafting it in the way we have submitted. We consider it redundant to have paragraph (b) relating to commercial value and paragraph (c) using much the same words. We are anxious to protect anybody who might be adversely affected, but we do not want too wide a definition. That appears to be the situation with paragraph (b), relating to any information having a commercial value. That is an extremely wide definition. We want to define what we are about; that is, the adverse effect. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on my feet I will speak about amendment No. 18, which seeks to omit sub-clause (3) of clause 43. Sub-clause (3) states:</PARA>
<PARA> A reference in this section to an undertaking includes a reference to an undertaking that is carried on by, or by an authority of, the Commonwealth, a State, the Northern Territory or a local government authority. </PARA>
<PARA>We of the Opposition see no reason why the Commonwealth, State or local government authorities should get such an exemption. We want to put them on the same basis as every private enterprise organisation. Therefore we seek to delete the provision which gives them an opportunity to be dealt with specially. Amendment No. 18 seeks to give effect to our proposal. I think what I have said explains the situation. The Committee will note that we agree that documents should be exempt in certain circumstances but not to the extent that commercial value is defined in this clause because it is far too wide and would exclude the opportunity for other people to have access to worthwhile information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The argument about this amendment turns on how wide or how narrow the protection of confidentiality of commercial information should go. On one side it can be argued that the public interest in making information freely available should mean that the confines of confidentiality should be narrowed and that, in a sense, is really what the Opposition is putting forward. I suppose it can be said that in this instance the Government thinks it ought to err, if that be the right word, on the side of the confidentiality of commercial information because commercial information in the hands of some people can be a very valuable commodity and can be used for purposes of self-interest generally quite apart from perhaps a more objective public desire to know what is going on within government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's consideration here has also lent upon the experience in the United States under its freedom of information legislation, which has shown that commercial interests seek to use the freedom of information legislation to gain access to business secrets of their competitors through access to information held by government agencies. I suppose in a competitive world it is understandable that commercial interests should seek to use the law to their own advantage. It is a proper consideration of government to ask itself whether that kind of access is proper. As I have said, we have judged that the protection should be tighter rather than looser. Private sector organisations did express to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs their concern that the sort of thing that happened in the United States might also happen in Australia under our proposed freedom of information legislation. Unless the Government can adequately safeguard confidential information which it receives or requires commercial enterprises to make available, there will inevitably be a drying up of the flow of information. Clause 43 has been drafted to ensure adequate protection for information of this kind. As it so happens, I was with a group of commercial people this evening and one of them, without knowing that I was invloved in the debate tonight, was making this very point to me, saying that there was a concern on the part of commercial people that where they were obliged, because of the need to get a licence, an approval or something of that kind, to supply to a government agency information which would be highly valuable to a competitor the supplier of the information should be properly protected. </PARA>
<PARA> I could explain the Government's position at much greater length but I think the Committee would understand from what I have said that we have looked at this clause very carefully and in our judgment the amendments that have been moved would not give to the supplier of commercial information to government agencies the protection that is desirable in this case. We therefore oppose the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make a couple of general observations while supporting the remarks which have been made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). I may say that the remarks of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) come strangely from a man who supports an economic policy which is based largely on the alleged merits of the free market and which, we are told all the time, says that competition and the operation of the invisible hand of the market are the best things to regulate the economy. I remind the Minister that the man who is the great father of laissez-faire economics, Adam Smith, one might say a spiritual godfather of this Government, always used to argue that one could not have the free market operating unless one had perfect information, unless all the people who were involved in the transactions-the employers, the employees, a seller and a consumer-were equally based; they had to have the same access to the free market in information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also make the point that in a number of areas of commerce now many so-called trade secrets have a relevance which evaporates so quickly that one begins to wonder what all the fuss is about. In many ways, particularly in the higher technological industries in which I have become increasingly, not to say obsessionally, interested, the rate of change is such that it is not really a matter of finding out what a particular trade secret is. One has to have the actual technology, the skills, the people and so on to bring some new stage of development to a product. I seriously doubt whether there is going to be much practical effect in providing for all these provisions with regard to trade secrecy. It is very interesting that in a number of the new high technology areas-for example, biotechnology and micro-electronics-increasingly the products and the processes are not being patented at all, there is no particular sense of having a specific property right in something. The argument is, in a sense, that if one is physically placed that one can go out and beat one of the market leaders, then good luck, go out and do it. It is not the lack of information that prevents one from beating one of the market leaders. What prevents one from doing it is the fact that one has not got the combination of capital, the technology, the years of experience and the specific skills. Once upon a time it used to be argued that the success or failure of a business could be determined by the fact that one had a whole heap of secrets that were found in a document somewhere and if one passed the document over to someone else the possession of those secrets would suddenly change the relative economic position. I think that is becoming quite an obsolete concept. </PARA>
<PARA> I just wanted to draw attention for a moment to the reference about the documents affecting personal privacy. I want to mention a case that occurred in England in the last couple of years which I think indicates that the matter can really cut both ways. I do not know whether the Minister is familiar with the long struggle of Iain Sproat-an unfortunate name, but there it is-Conservative Member of Parliament for Aberdeen South, to secure access to the papers relating to the British humorous writer P. G. Wodehouse. During the Second World War, Wodehouse was captured by the Germans and interned. During that period he made broadcasts which were aimed at an American audience and which, if one reads the text of them, were really quite satirical in nature. Nevertheless, it was said of him that he was a Nazi sympathiser, that he had collaborated and so on. The unfortunate Wodehouse was under a cloud until he received a knighthood in the last year of his life but never returned to England, remaining a virtual exile until his death. In the last years of his life, and for a period after his death , repeated attempts were made, by Mr Sproat in particular, to gain access to his security file. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument that was offered repeatedly, during all of the attempts to obtain access to the documents was: 'This is not going to do anybody any good; it cannot help Wodehouse's reputation. It is better to leave it alone. Let him die in peace. The material is so adverse to him that it will make the apprehension about his wartime record even worse.' That was the line taken. But Mr Sproat persisted. Wodehouse said that he had no objection to the documents being made available. </PARA>
<PARA> The next stage was to tell Mr Sproat that the documents were also harmful to the reputations of innocent people involved; that it would not do any good; that it would be impossible to disentangle one set of documents from another. Finally , after a struggle which went on for quite some years, Sproat gained access to the Wodehouse file and found that the documents were absolutely innocuous. Moreover, those who had interrogated Wodehouse at the end of the war had said that they were perfectly satisfied with his explanation, that he was an old man and that there were certain limitations upon how people over the age of 60 were to be treated. It was stated that there had been a strong satirical element in his broadcasts, that he had been able to pass on information helpful to other people who were interned and that there was no basis for prosecution-that Woodhouse had come out of the investigation well. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that for some 35 years some panjandrum in a department, for personal reasons had said: 'No, it would not be right to let these documents out .' This is one case where, in a sense, a concern for privacy operated in a way that was quite adverse to the individual. I should add, just to finish the story , that when the documents were to be handed over they contained one ambiguous reference to another living person, embodied in a single sentence. With the techniques available-the use of Xerox machines and so on-that reference was easy to obliterate. Thus, it was possible to hand the entire file over with but a single name and sentence deleted. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me is that in Australia we have an addiction to over-emphasising secrecy procedures. I cannot help remembering an incident which occurred a few years ago when I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee. An inquiry was being conducted concerning the enormous cost of restoration and maintenance of the ablutions block at the Air Force base near Townsville. Whenever the Committee tried to get information about how many toilet seats, shower screens and so on there were, the almost instinctive reaction of the Defence Department was to say: 'That is classified; you cannot have that information. If it fell in the wrong hands who knows what would happen to the nation's security?' We have to be very careful about this over-reliance on secrecy, and someone who is not really accountable in any public way making a decision which offers no contribution to common sense at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a brief comment on the contribution by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). To me what he said highlights the fact that in this field it is so often a matter of making balanced judgments. I suppose that I could, if I were aware of individual situations, point to cases in which, if one had complete freedom of information, concerning all of the files of Government of whatever kind, including whatever had been said about an individual, there would be some about whom things would have been written that would severely affect their privacy, if made generally available. Let us face the fact that there are people with prying eyes who would seek information for reasons that were not virtuous. So it is always a matter of judgment. Although, quite properly, the Wodehouse case can be pointed to as an example of overwhelming caution on the part of some public servant, or perhaps many over a long period, we must be conscious that there is always an argument on the other side of the ledger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I was saying earlier, in addressing clause 43, falls into the same category. A judgment is made, as best one can make it, that there are certain areas where protection must be afforded to personal privacy or commercial interest. Although the language here is pretty wide:</PARA>
<PARA> A document is an exempt document if its disclosure under this Act would involve the unreasonable disclosure of information relating to the personal affairs of any person (including a deceased person) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>However, it is characterised by the test of reasonableness which is commonly known to the law and is generally to be determined by the common sense of the person who makes the judgment. One cannot deny that in some instances it will be uncommon sense, but the Government feels that a provision of this kind does protect. We would hope, of course, that public servants, both those who perform their duties under this Government and those who do so under a future government , will be guided by that concept of reasonableness, imperfect as it is. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment seeks to omit existing clause 44 and substitute another. However, let us first consider what the Government proposes. Clause 44 is headed: ' Documents affecting national economy'. Sub-clause (1) (a) relates to documents which would be expected to have an adverse effect on the ability of the Government to manage the economy. Let me say that at the moment the Government must have that document in its possession, because it is not doing very well in the management of the economy. We would be delighted to get hold of it. We might be able to correct some of the tragic circumstances of our citizens. I cannot understand why even criticism can affect the management of the economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Everything is so hush hush that it must be left to those who are elected but who, unfortunately, seem to be making such a dreadful mess of the economy. I do not think that is a worthwhile reason for exempting a document. Moreover, paragraph (b) exempts any document which would be reasonably expected to result in an undue disturbance of the business in the community. As a matter of interest, that paragraph does not refer to the economy at all. It seems capable of applying to everything. I find that incredible. Let us try to import some sense into what is being done here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendment provides certainly a document should be exempt if it could be expected to result in any undue benefit or detriment to a person by reason of giving premature knowledge of any proposal. It would have to be contrary to the public interest. Again this evening we have heard the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) saying that the Government can do it all but does not wish to subject itself to the test of public interest at all. We are all here in the public interest. We were all elected by the public and if, in the course of any determination here, it was established by way of argument that the public interest would be adversely affected, of course any such document would be deemed exempt. Not to be prepared to go to the test really gives exclusive power to the Executive, or to the Government or department concerned, as the case may be. If we are dealing with the economy, that involves the most volatile part of our debate in this Parliament. As my colleague the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) says, the Budget is about the only thing we get a little time to discuss. Unfortunately, nobody takes too much notice of what is said. It is printed before we debate it and because the printer has printed it nobody can ever alter it. What happens in the economy, in the finish, bears no relationship to what is printed. It is an incredible result. For example, the deficit is no longer the deficit we were given; apparently it has bloomed out to hundreds of millions of dollars which obviously will have an adverse effect on the economy. None of us have been able to get hold of any document in relation to this. If we had we might have been able to make a substantial, worthwhile contribution. That is our role. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to this sort of exclusion whereby documents can be exempted because they will affect the economy, or for any reason at all that might have an undue disturbance on the ordinary business of the Community, the mind is unable to grasp what the Government intends, bearing in mind that we are seeking documents that exist. If they exist, somebody has had access to them-that is the point we make-and certainly we ought to be able to talk about, for example, proposals for expenditure, perhaps in relation to foreign investment. Today we had a report from the Foreign Investment Review Board clearly indicating all the details of the investment and all the problems associated with it, giving comments as to how all the local capital in Australia is being absorbed. It is only when we get a document such as that that we can ask questions of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> To say we cannot do it, that we cannot get access to these documents, creates a climate in which the Government always will be preserved from criticism. It is healthy for governments to be subject to criticism and it is beneficial for members of Parliament on both sides to have as much information as possible. Certainly that is the case in regard to the people who have to operate the economy. The Government operates very little of the economy; it is the greatest tax gatherer. Other people are out there trying to manage their businesses and get the economy going. They will make profits and pay taxes to the Government. They have a right-from their point of view and understanding-to absorb some of a Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation does give undue preference to some. Those who are in privileged positions of power know what government's proposals are and certainly they can get the advantage of premature knowledge. We are not casting any doubts on that at the moment but the suggestion that other people could get such information certainly is not likely to be the case. We want a guarantee that when a document exists-that is the type of document to which we are referring-we should be able to look at it. Irrespective of what government has been in power, far too many mistakes have been made. We had the same trouble in my time in government. The calculations of what was deemed to be the money supply and what ought to be the appropriate exchange rate were tragically wrong. The estimate of whether the economy was overheated was disastrously wrong. The propositions put forward by the Department of the Treasury were invariably wrong. The result of this is that we have to live with that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of public interest, if documents prepared on this basis were made available they would certainly engender debate in our community as to whether there should not be some better standard of administration. It is not much good changing governments if we do not change the people who are prone to making policies. One of the difficulties Canberra has is its incredible isolation from the community which we all represent and which is working hard to make a worthwhile economy. The Opposition's amendment will do no harm. It places very strong emphasis on the fact that the primary consideration's the public interest. I would be very pleased if the Minister would accept even one of our 30-odd amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Laurie Oakes is another matter. The point is that if for Hugh Dalton the premature disclosure of something in the Budget-that disclosure leading to its public dissemination-was a matter of such concern that he was obliged to resign, then how wrong would it be to have a more open clause 44 which would allow people to pry into documentation within the Department of the Treasury and other councils of the Government dealing with economic matters, to gain information which they could use to their obvious financial advantage in areas such as exchange rates and interest movements, and also in regard to policies that affect particular segments of the economy, be they the rural, mining or manufacturing sectors, or in regard to protection policies and the like?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Only to dwell on this matter for a moment indicates that it is important for a government, irrespective of whether it is of our political persuasion or of the Oposition's political persuasion, to be in a position to have advice formulated and delivered to it in a way which keeps that advice sufficiently confidential. If the advice or information on which those decisions were made was prematurely made public, this could lead to financial gain for other people, remembering always that as a general proposition the financial gain of one is at the expense of another. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I make is that the protection which the Government intends to give to documents affecting the national economy is not unusual. It is not so out of the ordinary that the Government can be condemned or overly criticised for being too narrow in its outlook on this point. Both the present Canadian Freedom of Information Bill and the draft Freedom of Information Bill prepared for the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration include general provisions aimed at protecting national economic interests. The Canadian Bill, for example, provides exemption for a document which contains information, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to be materially injurious to the financial interests of the Government of Canada or the ability of the Government of Canada to manage the economy of Canada. The relevant clause of the Bill we are discussing contains a list of the kind of information to which the clause applies. Disclosure of the information in the categories there listed might or might not result in undue benefit or detriment to any person.

<PARA> (c) the financial means of the applicant;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the applicant's prospect of success; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the reasonableness of the decision under review.''.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment relates to the role of the Ombudsman. We have dealt with Part V of the Bill. We want to insert a completely new Part VA. It is entitled 'Role of the Ombudsman'. We think, as I think everybody in this nation would agree, that there should be a role for the Ombudsman to deal with complaints to the Ombudsman. We believe that there ought to be a special person, a deputy ombudsman, to deal with freedom of information matters. This relates to the fact that there will be reports made by the Ombudsman, there will be investigations by the Ombudsman of action taken by Ministers and the fact that the Ombudsman may represent persons in proceedings before the Tribunal. All that, I think, is very essential and necessary and would be in accord with the spirit of what the role of an ombudsman is these days.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important, in the course of administration, that there be an independent arbiter, namely, the Ombudsman, who can not necessarily override ministerial decisions but certainly can review whether those decisions have been properly based. In many cases, of course, the work of the Ombudsman is very fruitful indeed. In fact, it is of some significance and it is certainly beneficial to our modern democracy that there is an opportunity to review what is happening pursuant to the laws that we pass and their administration. It is not much good passing laws and expecting them to be administered the way we thought they would be. In fact, it appears very clear that in a number of areas they can perhaps be misinterpreted. That is understandable, human nature being what it is. But such an interpretation or misinterpretation can cause untold difficulties for the citizens of this nation.</PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is lengthy. We know that the Government has made some concessions but it was the view of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs that the role of the Ombudsman ought to be extended. We feel that this is right and it would be of valuable assistance to the departments which might have some difficulties in carrying out provisions of the proposed Act. What we are talking about applies to a number of areas. The first element is a separate administrative unit within the Ombudsman's office and the creation of the position of deputy ombudsman for freedom of information. The second element is the extension of the ordinary function of the Ombudsman of investigation and conciliation to enable him to investigate as well ministerial decisions. The third element is giving to the Ombudsman the role of a general counsel for applicants and appearing on their behalf before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The fourth element in the equation gives the Ombudsman a specific role as an adviser to departments and agencies to assist them to carry out their obligations under the Bill. The fifth element is to give to the Ombudsman a specific power to monitor and criticise the way in which the legislation is operating and to report to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> I think I have summarised our amendment very well. It could be a part of the proposed Act and would not alter government policy. It would not alter government's prerogative. It just gives a role in very definite and definitive terms to the Ombudsman to help in this freedom of information legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government, of course, has a high regard for the work of the Ombudsman and the important role that he plays in investigating, on behalf of citizens, action by government affecting them. I have had occasion in my own work as a member of parliament, in my electorate office, to call in aid the Ombudsman on behalf of constituents so that I could better represent the interests of those constituents by having the Ombudsman investigate the administrative actions of particular departments. So, in case the Committee should misunderstand what I am about to say in putting the Government's point of view against accepting this amendment, I thought I should make those introductory remarks. What I am about to say in no way should be taken as lessening the Government's view of the important role that the Ombudsman plays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of this amendment is to extend substantially the role which the Ombudsman would play in freedom of information matters. The effect of the amendment is that the Ombudsman would be entitled to review decisions of Ministers and to act as counsel before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal if, in addition to his ordinary powers, he considered his intervention to be justified. Those two matters entitle the Ombudsman to review the decisions of Ministers as distinct from the administrative action leading up to a Minister making a decision. To allow the Ombudsman to act as counsel before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would extend quite considerably the role which the Ombudsman may now play under his legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The House will recall that in response to the Senate Committee report, the Commonwealth said that it would review the Ombudsman's role in freedom of information matters in the appropriate context of its consideration of the report on the Ombudsman's powers which had been made by the Administrative Review Council. That report has been tabled. The Government believes that within the Ombudsman's existing powers, as they have been extended by this Bill to ensure that he is not precluded from investigating a matter merely because there is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Ombudsman will nevertheless be able to play a significant role in the effective working of the freedom of information legislation. So it is not as if the Ombudsman is being cut out from playing a part in the working of the freedom of information legislation. He may do that and he may effectively perform a significant role within his existing powers. But the Government considers, at least at this time, that we should not extend those powers any further in the way which is proposed in these amendments. There is still to be put before the Parliament the Government's response on the report of the Administrative Review Council to which I have referred. </PARA>

<PARA> (21) Page 37, after clause 59, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Review of certain decisions in respect of documents relating to the Governments of the States or the Northern Territory ''59A. (1) Where notice of a decision that a document, so far as it contains information, is not an exempt document under section 33A has been given, in accordance with sub-section 33B (2), to the Government of a State or the Northern Territory which made submissions in accordance with that section, that Government may apply to the Tribunal for a review of that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> ''(2) Where an application is made in accordance with sub-section (1)- (a) the provisions of this Part (other than sections 55 and 61) apply in like manner as they apply in relation to an application for review of a decision refusing to grant access to a document; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the agency or Minister concerned shall forthwith inform the person who made the request of the application. </PARA>
<PARA> ''(3) Where- (a) upon a request referred to in sub-section 33A (1), a decision is made, after the making of submissions by the Government of a State or the Northern Territory in accordance with that sub-section, not to grant access to the document to which the request relates, so far as it contains the information referred to in paragraph 33A (1) (a); and</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment will not be very successful because it relates to earlier amendments which have been defeated. I will not waste much time on it. The earlier amendments, Nos 8 and 10, related to documents which could be exempt but on which we put a public interest test. The proposal was that where a notice was received pursuant to section 33A relating to documents of the governments of the States or the Northern Territory, the Minister should inform the government of the State or the Northern Territory that application had been made for access. I have moved the amendment and say no more about it.</PARA>

<PARA> (22) Page 39, after clause 65, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA>Tribunal may award costs in certain circumstances ''65A. (1) Where- (a) a person , after having made a complaint to the Ombudsman in respect of action taken by an agency or a Minister under this Act, subsequently makes application to the Tribunal under section 55 for review of a decision constituting or comprised in the action to which the complaint relates;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the person is successful, or substantially successful, in his application for review; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) in a case where the decision is not a decision to provide access to a document-the person had sought representation by the Ombudsman before the Tribunal but the Ombudsman had declined to represent the applicant,</PARA>
<PARA>the Tribunal may, in its discretion, recommend to the Attorney-General that the costs of the applicant in relation to the proceedings be paid by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> ''(2) Without limiting the generality of the matters to which the Tribunal may have regard in deciding whether to make a recommendation under sub-section (1), the Tribunal shall have regard to- (a) the question whether the decision of the Tribunal will be of benefit to the general public;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the question whether the decision of the Tribunal will be of commercial benefit to the person making application to the Tribunal; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the reasonableness of the decision in relation to which the application to the Tribunal was made.''. </PARA>
<PARA>We wish to insert this new clause 65A which provides that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may award costs in certain circumstances. I think that this is fair. The amendment provides that the costs could be awarded by a recommendation of the Attorney-General, particularly where a person makes a complaint to the Ombudsman and is successful before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It does not automatically follow that costs would be awarded, but we ought to be able to give the citizen some redress, and we want to put it on the basis that it is not unprecedented for costs to be awarded. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very good reasons for so doing, which I know to have been set out in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. In our view the Tribunal ought to have a discretion to recommend costs so that it will be a reality and so that the departments will not exercise the muscle that they might by saying: 'You have to face up to the fact that you will have to bear your own costs'. That is not at all reasonable. It is in accordance with normal justice and normal procedure that if one is successful-and bear in mind that we are putting it on the basis of a discretion-costs ought to be awarded. That is all that the amendment seeks to achieve. I cannot think of any reasonable government that would dare to oppose it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Chairman, that really puts me on my mettle. On the face of it, one would think that this is an amendment that the Government ought, in all reasonableness, to accept. But let me explain the Government's position because, again, we oppose the amendment . The Government's basic consideration in opposing this amendment is that freedom of information matters going before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should be on the same basis as other matters going before that Tribunal. If that proposition is accepted, then when one understands that the Attorney-General has power under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act to grant costs, it will be seen that a person in the circumstances covered by this amendment, in that he succeeds on an appeal before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, can obtain costs by the Attorney-General deciding that that person's case is an appropriate one for the granting of costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect of this amendment is that in a case where an applicant who has obtained a favourable recommendation by the Ombudsman which was not accepted by the agency concerned succeeds on an appeal before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Tribunal is empowered to recommend to the Attorney-General that costs be awarded in the applicant's favour. It is not a detemination by the Tribunal that costs be awarded, which was rather the language used by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), but that the Tribunal might recommend to the Attorney-General that those costs be awarded. Our situation is fairly straightforward. As I have said, the Attorney-General having the power to grant costs under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, he can then do so in respect of freedom of information matters coming before the Tribunal. We do not think that costs for proceedings before the Tribunal in freedom of information matters should be considered in isolation from or differently from other aspects of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment relates to clause 93-'Reports to Parliament'-which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after the end of each year ending on 30 June, prepare a report . . . and cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The difficulty is that 'as soon as practicable' often means, as we know, that it does not happen for some considerable time. What our amendment is saying, in effect, is 'as soon as practicable after 30 June should not extend beyond 31 October'. That is all that this amendment does. It simply provides that the annual report must come before the Parliament not later than 31 October in any particular year. Some departments and agencies seem to be a long way behind in preparing annual reports. We would like to see this provision put in all legislation requiring annual reports. It is a bit behind the times to have annual reports which are at least a year out of date when one gets them. On this occasion we are saying: 'We'll be specific; they ought to be in by 30 June, but it's essential that they be in by 31 October'. I need not elaborate any more; the amendment is self-explanatory. </PARA>

We all know that, with the best will in the world in some situations, legislative prescriptions that something be done by a certain date cannot be met. We think that the more reasonable, more flexible situation is to commit the Minister to the obligation to present an annual report to the Parliament but not to bind him in a straitjacket, as it were, to a specific date. The Minister of course will be under the scrutiny of Parliament and if there is any delay on his part, undoubtedly the Parliament will soon let him know of its dissatisfaction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes the inclusion of Schedule 2 which exempts and proceeds to list a number of agencies. I might help the Committee, Mr Deputy Chairman, by saying that we have indicated our intention to move a number of amendments which are of some detail-Nos 24 to 30, virtually-but I think that it is now more effective to say that we oppose the whole of Schedule 2, because our amendments amount virtually to omitting those same agencies. I want to indicate to the Committee now that we are opposing-that is the best thing for me to say-the Schedule in lieu of my moving those amendments. What I am saying is that Schedule 2 contains Part I, 'Exempt agencies', and Part II, 'Agencies exempt in respect of particular documents'. An effort was made by the Opposition to try to redraft them and virtually to omit them. I am making the point now that we will be opposing Schedule 2. That means that only one question will need to be put. This provision relates to exempting certain agencies. The exemptions under Part IV of the Bill are already too wide and there is no need to include any agency. I think that is self-explanatory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will advert to just a couple of matters that cause us concern when we are talking about restrictions concerning freedom of information. We have had untold difficulty in the past in relation to matters involving the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Admittedly there has been some improvement. The Opposition now has the opportunity of attending briefings on ASIO matters. There has been a quite remarkable improvement in that sense, but it was only recently that that was achieved. It is significant because we want to protect not only the rights of members of parliament but also the rights of the constituents. If there is to be any invasion of a person's rights and if information is to be gathered without that person knowing, it is a very serious matter indeed. We have had the experience in recent times, which the debates would show, of information gathered by an intelligence agency being misused in this Parliament. It has been the subject of comment. All information should not be the privilege of the Executive government. If we are to have a democracy the alternative government has to be closely considered. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another matter which has caused us concern and which would cause all our citizens concern. The Australian Secret Intelligence Service is referred to as an exempt agency. If somebody were to ask whether he could have access to the name of the person who did the recruitment for that agency he would be astounded to find that it has been done by a Minister of the Government. I think this is something that really upsets the whole concept of what we are about. One could imagine what would happen if a Labor Minister were active in recruiting members of ASIS. The whole of the nation would be alerted-certainly by the Liberal Opposition-to the fact that we were doing something wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that information like that be ascertained. We happen to know that that is the position now but we did not always know it. It concerns us no end that the people who have been recruited might feel that they have some obligation to those who recruited them. This information has never been given. I am giving it to honourable members now. It certainly affects the whole aspect of security and whether we, as an Opposition, can get the right sort of information or whether our citizens are getting adverse reports in any area. In other words, it is completely reprehensible that it was ever done. Whilst we have always been very critical of and concerned about past operations in some of the intelligence areas, this is something very startling indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say no more at present than that it has happened. One can see that if we are always going to have a closed operation these agencies are going to be exempt merely because of their title. We have to understand the people who are there, how they got there, who appointed them, what their jobs are, what information they gather, who they give it to and how it is used. All that should be available because it can be of a quite serious nature not only to operations within this nation but also to operations outside it. It is for that purpose that we want to be very careful about saying that we are going to close up on giving information. I am aware that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) would not be knowledgeable about what I am saying. I do not expect him to be. But I assure him that it is true. I think he would be just as concerned as anybody else if this sort of operation were allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that it is dangerous to have all these exemptions simply because these people seem to have some special preserve. Certainly, if the public interest would be affected the information would not be disclosed. But if the public interest is being affected because the information is not to be disclosed simply because it would be a worry or a concern to a government, I think that is deplorable. For that reason and a number of similar situations that can apply, I ask why all these agencies have to be exempt as they are. The exemptions are far too wide. For that purpose the simple thing for us to do is to delete Schedule 2. Let the Government rely on the exemption provisions under Part IV of the Bill, which is quite adequate for exemption. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be referring to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The honourable member need not worry as I will be referring to that Organisation. What I have to say can be basically related to all the agencies listed for exemption. All these agencies are responsible for the disbursement of public moneys. Members of the general public are entitled to be informed about their structures and functions and to be given access to documents held by them. Of course I accept that there must be confidentiality in respect of some aspects of those bodies, but I submit that there is ample protection in the various clauses of the Bill to cover confidential items. I refer, for example, to the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, a trust which is responsible for the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars and whose operations should be open to the scrutiny of taxpayers and subscribers to the Fund alike. Why this Fund should be totally exempt is completely inconceivable to me. I hope the Minister for Industrial relations (Mr Viner) will explain why it has been necessary for this Fund to be excluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Aboriginal land councils and land trusts are examples of bodies whose proceedings must be open to the scrutiny of all Aboriginal people. Why should we perpetuate the paternalistic and authoritarian attitude towards the Aboriginal people which is held by the governments of Western Australia and Queensland. The list also includes the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, the Pipeline Authority and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission. Nothing Government supporters have said in debate can justify the complete exemption of the activities of these bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to refer to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. These bodies have an almost infinite potential to destroy democracy as it presently exists in Australia. Those of us who are deeply involved in political life know all too well the noises on the telephone which indicate a wire tap. We all know about the clicking cameras of broad-shouldered citizenry when we are involved in demonstrations against the worst features of our conservative and reactionary Federal Government. We also know that there are incidents which occur in the life of the nation, such as the Sydney Hilton bombing, when all the available evidence points to the improper involvement of security intelligence agents. </PARA>

In all these cases it is essential, if democratic institutions are to be preserved, that innocent citizens whose only crime is that they oppose the policies of the Federal Government should be allowed access to documents held by ASIO or ASIS which relate to their personal activities. I want to quote from an article that appeared in the Age on 22 March 1979. Although it is nearly three years old it is as relevant today as it was then. The article was prepared by the Honourable Mrs Coxsedge, a member of the Legislative Council in Victoria, who is quite an authority--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations, who is at the table, is laughing. He is worried. Mrs Coxsedge is quite an authority on the intelligence operations. As will be evident, the point about this is that the comment is not being made by Mrs Joan Coxsedge; she is reporting what was in fact said by Mr Justice White, a very eminent authority and somebody about whom the Minister might find it difficult to laugh. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After perusal of a small sample of the 41,000 dossiers held by the Special Branch in Adelaide, acting Justice White reported having found 'scandalously inaccurate opinions' about the political standing of prominent citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did indeed. It was Mr Justice White. The article continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 'My perusal of Special Branch files shows that many hundreds of people have done nothing more than take an active part in many causes where time and changing opinion have usually proved them to be right in the eyes of most Australians-campaigns against involvement in the Vietnam war or conscription for the purposes of that war, the importance of the environment and ecology and so on. They are the kinds of activities that active persons with a social conscience and a vision of a better Australia are entitled to be involved in without the brand of suspected subversion.' . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 'Even if most of these often biased and useless records were now to be sealed up and never used, they would be preserved for no purpose; they could never be used for valid historical research, except research into the history of folly.'</PARA>
<PARA>That was said by Mr Justice White. It is appalling that organisations such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Security Intelligence Service should be granted a blanket exemption. For those reasons, unless the Government is prepared to accept the amendments moved by the Opposition, the promulgation of this Bill will be a farce. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, all exempt agencies and agencies exempt in respect of particular documents. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has indicated that parts of the Schedule were finalised only after lengthy consideration by the Government and that the Government is not prepared to agree to amendment of them now without the benefit of some experience of the legislation. We are not saying that the list in the Schedule in inviolate for all time. The Attorney has indicated that the amendment of the Schedule will be one of the items in the first major review of the legislation. That is our general position. I find it rather alarming to hear the honourable member for La Trobe going on in the way in which he did regarding the Australian Security Intelligence Oganisation, the Australian Security Intelligence Agency and so on. Perhaps, having listened to the contributions of the honourable gentleman in this House on various occasions, his attitude towards the security of this nation, as he expressed it tonight, is understandable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the honourable gentleman that on earlier occasions the Parliament has debated extensively the standing in our community of ASIO following the lengthy report by Mr Justice Hope which was commissioned by the Whitlam Labor Government of which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) was a member. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will recall the extent to which the Government accepted the recommendations of Mr Justice Hope. I thought that by and large there was a bipartisan approach to the need for an Australian intelligence organisation. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has quite properly pointed out, for such an organisation to operate effectively within a country, the alternative Government does need to have access to advice from that organisation . Therefore, we have agreed by legislation that the Leader of the Opposition should be able to call for advice from ASIO. Other elements to introduce a better, stronger and more purposeful bipartisan approach were revealed by the legislation which has been passed by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposition by the honourable member for La Trobe, which virtually amounts to calling for ASIO to be an open book, has only to be stated to be seen to be in no way in the interests of the security of this nation. The Government is quite satisfied that, by the legislation under which ASIO operates, the community is adequately protected, while at the same time our intelligence organisations operate in the overall interests of the security of our nation. If the honourable member really directs his mind to the kinds of agencies referred to in the Schedules-he understands the way in which they operate and the purpose for which they have been established-he will see the reason why they have been exempted. </PARA>
<PARA> He referred to the Office of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust that operates in a commercial environment. Day by day it invests the funds of the Trust. In order to be able to do its job properly, it does not want day by day to have the prying eyes of anyone and everyone looking over its shoulder. It must be able to operate in that commercial environment in the same way as do other organisations. Does the honourable gentleman know that the Aboriginal land trusts are the title holding bodies of Aboriginals in respect of Aboriginal land granted under legislation of this Parliament? Aboriginal land councils, by their nature and having regard to the purpose for which they were formed, are not public bodies in the same way as agencies of the Government are understood to be public bodies and therefore to be subject to this freedom of information legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I point out, with regard to Part II of Schedule 2, that the agencies are exempt only in respect of particular documents. Those documents are ones which relate to the competitive commercial activities of the agencies. Other documents relating to such matters as referred to by the honourable member for La Trobe, such as the structure of the organisation, are not exempt. Only those documents which relate to competitive commercial activities are exempt. As I have said, the Government does not have a closed mind on whether all these agencies and all the documents of these agencies should, for all time, be exempt . The Attorney has clearly indicated that the Schedule will be the subject of review in the first major review of the legislation. It is for those reasons that the Government opposes the amendments moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise two questions on the Schedules. The first is a specific one relating to the Health Insurance Commission. What kind of justification can there be for complete exemption of the Health Insurance Commission as an agency? I would have thought that that agency would on many occasions be in significant conflict with people who insure with what is called Medibank. I am sure that individuals would often like to find out why they are not getting proper refunds, why they are not getting the sort of treatment from the Health Insurance Commission which they ought to be getting. I am sure that the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) would join with me, if he were here, in opposing the exemption of the Health Insurance Commission. I certainly feel very strongly about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to raise another point. I make the point that I have non-standard views on this piece of legislation. I think there are some benefits to be gained from the legislation. However, there are some disbenefits because I can see that people will keep two sets of records, one set for the purposes of the freedom of information legislation and another set of records as I would have to do as a medical practitioner because I would be worried that some patients would ask me to produce the comments which I had made about them for my own benefit. Patients would be entitled to see those comments. I am sure the same sort of thing would happen in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I think some of the people who have been most active in advocating this legislation have been quite hypocritical. I am referring to many members of the academic community in Australia. The Minister will probably be aware that generally speaking academics have been in the forefront of those in favour of this legislation. Yet when this Bill approaches proclamation time, who again will be in the forefront of asking to be exempt or to become exempt agencies? It will be the same academics. Academics at the Australian National University, the Canberra College of Advanced Education, et cetera will be asking for their institutions to be designated exempt agencies. I hope that the Minister in charge of the legislation will very carefully consider requests from those people for their institutions to become exempt agencies. They apparently think that everybody else ought to bare all their information but that they ought to be exempt. I do not believe that is necessarily the case. I think it is possible that they may be able to make out a particularly good case in respect of some type of information about students, for example, but I do not think any blanket exemption ought to be granted to academics or academic institutions. I hope that the Minister will very carefully consider requests from other government authorities-statutory authorities-for exemption under the freedom of information legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am always surprised by the hide of some people who feel very strongly that politicians, public servants or anybody else should wear hairshirts and expose their affairs so that all their private details become public knowledge. Academics and members of the media-I think the media is part of the same type of institution-would be the first to claim, and I am not arguing the point, that they are entitled not to say what their sources of information are. They believe they are entitled to say within certain legal bounds that they have been informed that Joe Blow is a crook. Neither we nor anybody else can find out from them who made a certain allegation, who said something to a particular reporter. But they want exemption all the time. They are utter and complete hypocrites as far as I am concerned. I hope that when the legislation is in force the Minister will be very careful in considering further applications from organisations for exempt status. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like again to put a question to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) because I feel that he has not really replied to my previous question. The agencies and bodies to which I referred are completely exempt. What he did not explain to me was why they need to be wholly exempt. I can understand that there are certain matters that are confidential. I would have thought that the provisions of the legislation cover these matters. But there are some instances where innocent people or people who are personally involved should have access to certain documents. Yet the bodies I mentioned are completely exempt. Whilst the Minister has said that at some time in the future these matters may be looked at again and a decision made as to whether some changes should be made to the legislation, I would submit that now is the time to make those changes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) I would point out that the Health Insurance Commission operates in a commercial and competitive environment and for that reason, amongst others, it is not thought appropriate that documents of the Commission should be available under the freedom of information legislation. As well as that, I point out that the Commission is obliged under its own legislation to report on its activities. So there is scope for public scrutiny of those activities. I will see that the other matters referred to by the honourable gentlemen are referred to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) so that he may take note of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the further remarks of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), complete exemption is given because of the character of the agency. If the honourable member runs his eye over the agencies listed he will see quickly enough, for example, that the Australian Industry Development Corporation operates in a commercial environment and that clearly it receives information that it would not be advisable to make freely available to the public. He will see that the Australian National Airlines Commission-Trans Australia Airlines- and the Australian National Railways Commission are in a similar position. Whilst the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation is not itself a commerical body it operates in a commercial environment. It receives information from private enterprise and provides advice to and undertakes dealings with governments overseas. So one could go on. However, without going through each agency I think the honourable gentlemen must look to the character of the agencies and understand the reason why, having given the matter very careful consideration, the Government has taken the view that at this time those agencies should be completely exempt. We have given the undertaking to which I have already referred. As with so many other parts of this legislation, we must learn by experience. A clear undertaking has been given by the Attorney-General in the other place and by me in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is opposed to the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill but is not opposed to the Canned Fruits Marketing Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill. It has taken the Government about two years to introduce the latter Bill. It should have been done earlier when the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation was set up two years ago. The reason we are opposed to the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill is the trouble the industry is now in. Now is not the time to impose an extra levy on an industry. Now is not the time to lift the levy from 11c to 27c a basic carton. Now is not the time for the Government to impose this sort of levy on an industry in as much trouble as the canned fruits industry is in. The Government will take over $1m from the industry when growers are going broke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is unacceptable to the Opposition to ask for more money from an industry at a time when that industry is in desperate need of Federal financial assistance. We propose that the extra marketing initiative which is needed should be provided by the Department of Trade and Resources and the Department of Primary Industry when, first of all, the ACFC has demonstrated its ability effectively to manage the marketing of Australian canned fruit and its interest in the industry by preparing an IAC submission for the next hearing scheduled for May next year. The Opposition then will be pleased to review its position of not supporting an increase in the levy for canned deciduous fruit.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by pointing out what the labor Party Government did for the industry in 1973 when ex-Senator Ken Wriedt was Minister for Primary Industry. In that year the Labor Government provided $1.5m in grants to canners for revaluation assistance. We also gave emergency adjustment assistance to canning fruit growers. That emergency assistance was provided in the form of payments to canning fruit growers and those payments were made on the basis of deliveries of peaches, pears and apricots to canneries for canning in the 1972-73 season. Payments were made at the rate of $12 a tonne on up to 125 tonnes, with a maximum payment of $1,500 to a grower. Also at that time we had a tree pull scheme, which we continued. Funding by the Labor Government to rural reconstruction and rural adjustment was at a high level. The Government has now phased out the tree pull scheme and, on the other measure, funds are being cut back all the time. In 1973 the Labor Government did respond to the needs of the canning fruit industry. The current Government's response to a canning fruit crisis is to raise the levy which funds the Australian Canned Fruit Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the income received from the industry over the past three or four years we see that it amounted to $587,000 in 1979 when we had the Australian Canned Fruits Board; it amounted to $720,000 in 1980 when the Corporation was formed, representing an increase of 23 per cent; and in 1981 the Corporation gained $800,000 from the industry, representing an increase of 11 per cent. Now the Government is proposing that the levy go up to give the Corporation an income of an estimated $1,080,000, representing an increase of 35 per cent. That is to happen in a year when the intake of fruit is down by up to 38 per cent-the quotas are down by that amount-and in a year when the price for the fruit has dropped to disastrous levels. The price for pears has dropped $30 a tonne and the price for peaches has dropped $45 a tonne. What the Government is doing is attacking another primary industry which has experienced serious economic downturn, as has been demonstrated, and which faces another period of reconstruction due to the policies of the European Economic Community. The Opposition wants to help those members of this House who represent some of the seats in which canning fruit is grown. Surely the honourable members for Murray (Mr Lloyd), Wakefield (Mr Giles) and Riverina (Mr Hicks) have been putting pressure on the Government not to impose this levy at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to some of the quotes in the Press of recent days. For example, Mr Philip Marshall, the Secretary of the Australian Canning Fruitgrowers Association, was reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the reductions in prices only added more weight to the argument that the industry urgently needed help. </PARA>
<PARA> Peaches have been set at $180 a tonne, a reduction of $45 a tonne on last year' s price while pears have been set at $130 a tonne, $30 less than 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is now abundantly clear that the canned fruit industry in the Goulburn -Murray Valley of Victoria will have to rely heavily on the Victorian Government for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>Producers and industry representatives in the various States are now appealing to their State governments. For example, on 2 February Mr Sam Catanzariti, the New South Wales President of the Canning Fruitgrowers Association, said:</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the growers are concerned, it is disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA>I can read other quotes, such as 'SA may go solo on fruit finance'. Mr Chapman, the Minister of Agriculture in that State, again criticised the Commonwealth's refusal to match dollar for dollar the State Government's plan to help this industry. Producers are furious about the drop in price, they are furious about the quotas being cut and they are furious about this Government not taking any action to assist the canning fruit industry. The approach of the Government to this industry has been and is abysmal. The industry has had a long history. The present situation could have easily been anticipated. If I may go back, the previous Minister for Primary Industry, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the present Minister for Communications, was given a hostile reception at Berri in South Australia, so he knew all about the problems in the industry. For most of his stewardship of the portfolio all we ever heard were some unsympathetic platitudes about the possibility of a private enterprise solution for the canning industry. What he was really talking about was the canners themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government wound down the treepull scheme, continued to withdraw funds from the rural adjustment scheme and, of course, ignored most of the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry that looked at all the fruit industries in the 1970s. It ignored the plan for the Regional Development Authority to help an area such as the Riverland. I am sure the honourable member for Wakefield is fully aware of the problems which that area faces and his colleagues in his own party in South Australia face and of the case they have been making to this Government. But this Government will do nothing. It has done nothing for the fruit growers. It is absolutely essential now that the provisions of the rural adjustment scheme be directed specifically to the needs of growers in this coming season. Unfortunately, because of the way that scheme works, it will probably take eight months to get any money through and by that time the growers will have gone broke. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have to say at this juncture that the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation itself has not performed well in terms of its market judgment or in the administration of its role and functions. Frankly, too much fruit was taken in in the 1981 season. The canneries will lose at least $2.3m for the 1981 season and the situation now is that the fruit growers will have to carry the can for the canners. The quotas are being cut. The growers will not get anywhere near the same amount of money and they will not be allowed to produce the same quantity of fruit. In other words, the fruit growers are going to amortise the losses of the fruit canners. Harking back to the free enterprise solution of the former Minister for Primary Industry, the only private enterprise firm, Henry Jones of Kyabram, has got out with its quotas being sold to SPC and Ardmona with the compliance of the Corporation. All canners are now co-operatives. Letona is in receivership and the Riverland Canning Co-operative is bankrupt and is in debt. Some calculations there go as high as $28m. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Australian Agricultural Council meeting on 8 February this year the South Australian and New South Wales Ministers for Agriculture severely criticised the Federal Government and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) in particular for the Government's failure to assist the canning fruit industry. The Victorian Government also indicated that it would request Federal assistance for its canning fruit growers. The only response from the Minister for Primary Industry was that there would be no action until after the IAC had presented its interim report. It is not due until 31 March this year when the fruit under discussion will be well and truly finished. Either it will have been picked or it will be on the ground, and most of it will be on the ground. The Letona cannery in New South Wales has debts of $14m to State Government authorities and $5m to the State Government, but only $875,000 to the Commonwealth Government. During 1981 the New South Wales Government, a Labor government, under the responsible Minister, Jack Hallam, put $1.7m into canning fruit loans. The South Australian Government, a Liberal government, has provided $560,000 to canning fruit growers, half of which is to be used to supplement grower returns on fruit delivered to canneries and half of which is to provide loans to growers. The Victorian Government is trying to develop some sort of plan to assist its own growers. We need to point out that, as I am sure the honourable member for Murray will tell the House, some 80 per cent of the canning fruit in this country is produced in Victoria, most of it in his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The 150 per cent increase in levy that this Government is scandalously putting on the industry is based on the reduction of the production for 1982, down to about 38 per cent of last year's production. Because the Corporation cannot market current production it requires a higher rate of levy on the production it can market. I suppose one could be fooled into thinking it is a reverse economies of scale argument, that because production is lower the costs per unit of production increase. However, that is nonsense. The current position has been reached to a large extent because of the Corporation's apparent ignorance of the marketing situation it was facing. Now growers are being asked to increase their support for an organisation which has not been able to meet the needs of the industry it is responsible for. The Corporation is not being asked to compensate growers for their management. Growers are being asked to compensate the Corporation and give it the funds to continue. No one is questioning the fact that the Corporation should continue, but the Corporation is open to rather stringent criticism. Which other organisation can fail to do its job and then be supported by this Government in asking for a 35 per cent increase in income from people who cannot afford it? It will be guaranteed income as well. I guess this falls in with some of the nonsense that we hear coming from this Government. On Monday the Minister for Primary Industry put the seal of approval on the sale of one Government organisation which made money for primary producers, the Australian Wool Testing Authority. Today he wants to guarantee an increased income for an inept corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the marketing and management record of the Corporation. What we have is a desperate situation because there is a carry-over of some four million basic cartons. In the previous year there was a carry-over of 1.9 million cartons. It was a high production year but now the growers' intake will be reduced by half and the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee prices have been reduced from the previous year. At the 1981 Outlook Conference the Bureau of Agricultural Economics forecast that on the market prospects sales would drop . Looking back with hindsight, the forecasts of the BAE were quite accurate given the situation at that time. In contrast page 4 of the first annual report of the Corporation, looking towards 1981, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Overall the outlook for canning peaches, pears and apricots in 1981 is difficult but not alarming . . . Total sales in 1981 are expected to be around the level of recent years. However, to attain this a considerable effort will be required by the Corporation and its marketers. </PARA>
<PARA>I will return to that phrase 'considerable effort'. The BAE 1981 forecast at the Outlook Conference states:</PARA>
<PARA> The decline from the 1980 intake is due to relatively less favourable prospects and anticipated high stock levels at the beginning of the canning year. </PARA>
<PARA>If that sort of information was available to the BAE why was it not available to the Canned Fruits Corporation? If it was not directly available to the Corporation-its representatives were at the Outlook Conference-it could have discussed the forecasts. There was a failure, or there was ignorance of what the situation was. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the matter of 'considerable effort'. In the first annual report, the Canned Fruit Corporation talked of, among other things, the decline in the United Kingdom market, our major customer, the expanding Middle East market, ACFC promotions, visits overseas by members of the Corporation and EEC support for local canned fruit production. It also set out the function of the Corporation and the major expenditure, $640,000-60 per cent of the budget-in promotions overseas. Knowing the way in which the United Kingdom market was going in the past decade-to use their own words-and that the Middle East had been an expanding market, what the Corporation did during 1980 was send seven people at different times to Europe, mainly West Germany and Italy, to talk about pears. They also looked at canned fruit production in Spain and Greece. No interest was taken in expanding markets in the Middle East, or anywhere except in the traditional places which it always visited. The following was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The largest campaign for canned fruit was again mounted in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA>What happened? In 1980 there were sales of 1,089,000 basic cartons in the United Kingdom, or nearly 200,000 basic cartons below the figure for the preceding year . The major sales promotion for the whole year of the Canned Fruits Corporation managed to achieve a 16 per cent reduction in sales. Now the growers, through the canneries, are being asked by this Government to pay this organisation 150 per cent more. On page 11 of the report, the Corporation said:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1980 the only export area where the Australian industry experienced increased sales was General Export markets . . . an advance of 20 per cent was reflected . . . Middle East countries have continued to evidence a strong growth rate over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet no mention is made of any visit by Corporation members to the only bright spot referred to in their whole annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which points out how the market in the Middle East is growing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Surely a visit to Saudi Arabia would have been worthwhile. That country took more than 60 per cent of our exports to the Middle East in 1980-81. It is a large and growing proportion of our total exports but, during that year, I understand that corporation members visited Hamburg. At the recent annual meeting of the Canning Fruitgrowers this visit was put forward by the Corporation as a highlight of the Corporation's activities for the year. Therefore, it appears that the Corporation's market development and promotion activities have not changed. It is equally difficult to know how the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) who is responsible for this organisation, can support the case for a 150 per cent increase in levy when the Corporation's performance is as I have described.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the matter of quotas. The ACFC administers production quotas and pool markets for the more profitable export markets. Canners can transfer entitlements. These production quotas on canneries are intended to discourage over-production. Production in excess of entitlement is the responsibility of the canner. What I understand has happened is that the Corporation last year simply raised the quota levels when it found that there was a lot of fruit. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACFC, as I have mentioned, also approved the sale of quotas from Henry Jones, of Kyabram, to the two other Victorian canners. Henry Jones was paid for the quotas but suppliers to its factories were left with no guarantee of any outlet for fruit beyond this 1982 harvest. Already growers in the Shepparton area have been coming to me about this. One fellow said that he had paid $10,000 for delivery rights to Henry Jones when he bought his fruit block but, a month later, Henry Jones having been sold, he had no rights and did not know where he was. To get it down to the personal level, there are even people in my electorate of Werriwa who have gone broke in fruit farming and come to me about it. So, quite a few people are concerned to know a good deal about the state in which the industry finds itself. The situation they face in the coming year is very serious indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose now to touch briefly on the Bill to which we do not object but concerning which we would make the comment that the Government has encouraged growers for the last two years to fund two organisations when only one was required. The other was the Sales Promotion Committee. At a time when market prospects were grim and fruit growers on small mixed blocks could ill afford to fund one organisation, let alone two, growers had no choice because of the legislation which demanded levys. I will provide proof of that. The functions of the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation are set out as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to undertake responsibilities for the regulation, marketing and promotion of canned deciduous fruits in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>The functions of the Australian Canned Fruit Sales Promotion Committee are:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to promote the sale within Australia or overseas of canned fruit. </PARA>
<PARA>This is another example of the lack of interest by this Government and the tardiness with which this Minister acts in allowing this duplication to continue . Certainly we support the moves taken by the Minister to repeal that and put all sales promotion in the hands of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look now at the industry in more general terms we note that it was rationalised to a very large degree in the 1970s. That is a nice economic euphemism for people getting out of the industry. It now faces the major crisis to which I have referred, due to a reduction in sales volume and prices in export markets. The main reason, in addition to what I have outlined, is the intense competition from the highly subsidised production within the EEC and South Africa, as well as the upturn in the value of the Australian dollar since January 1981. Again, this is a policy that the Government has deliberately followed under its fighting inflation first strategy. It is using the exchange rate as a tool against inflation and, in so doing, is harming our rural export industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the figures that have caused these decisions by the Corporation which are affecting this industry so badly. Total sales volume for 1981 will be about 5.9 million cartons, against an availability of some 9.9 million cartons. This gives a carry-over of 4 million cartons compared with the previous year's figure of 1.9 million. In the years prior to 1980, sales were about 7 million cartons per annum. In 1980, they fell to 6.6 million and in 1981 to 5.9 million, as I have said, it is calculated that a desirable carry-over would be about 1.5 million cartons. Given that carry-over, it has been decided by the Corporation that the canners will take only 3.8 million basic cartons of fruit this year, virtually halving the production available. Sales are expected of about 6.12 million cartons; so, stock levels should be reduced. It should not be necessary to cut intake so severely in future years. In some ways, this year's plan will be a sudden, sharp shock followed by reduced levels of the usual intake in the years to come. It is simply a sharp shock that the industry will find very hard to accept. But, if we add to that the fact that the Government is going to try to get an extra $280,000 out of the industry, the position is scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA> So that the Corporation can carry on its work, the Government has decided to more than double the levy on the growers. It is up by more than 150 per cent. As I have said, the growers are being asked to carry the can for the canners. They are to be asked to pay when they can least afford to do so. The Government has no intention of doing anything about the industry. Of course the Minister will take refuge in the excuse, as he did at the Australian Agricultural Council meeting when the governments of Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia made a strong case for their growers, that he has referred the matter to the Industries Assistance Commission. So he has, but I wish to refer to what has happened at the IAC. </PARA>
<PARA> One would expect that, when an industry is in so much trouble and the IAC is asked to report on short term assistance with three months, all organisations involved would want to offer their best advice, especially the organisation charged with the ultimate marketing and management of that commodity, that is, if market downturns and supply management seem to be the major problems. In December 1981, the IAC was asked to report on short term assistance for the 1982 season. Hearings were set down for 19 January 1982 in Shepparton. Almost everyone who had heard of canned fruit gave evidence except the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation and the canners. It is almost unheard of for a statutory corporation not to present a submission to an IAC inquiry into its industry. I do not know why the ACFE chose not to appear before the IAC but I know that it reflects badly on the Corporation's performance and ability when it is in serious question. This Government is to ask growers to pay 150 per cent more for the services of the ACFC. It is asking this House to support an increase of 150 per cent to a corporation which will not even present itself to the IAC and provide information to assist in its deliberations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been long concerned about the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its role in Wollongong, which is in my electorate. My concern has turned to alarm in the light of the consistent attacks made by this Government, as explained in an internal memo circulated to ABC staff dated 15 February 1982 from the General Manager, Sir Talbot Duckmanton. This document is of such interest to the Parliament that I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>15 February 1982</PARA>
<PARA>EXPENDITURE AND STAFFING RESTRAINTS 1981-82</PARA>
<PARA> When the ABC's appropriation for the 1981-82 financial year was determined, it was understood that further funds would be provided at Additional Estimates time for approved salary and wage increases which had occurred during the course of the financial year, but that additional funds for non-salary wage increases, i.e . for increases in the cost of goods and services, would not normally be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> In January, 1982, however, the Government, as part of its policy of expenditure restraint, decided that steps should be taken by Government Departments and Statutory Authorities to restrain, until finalisation of the 1981-82 Additional Estimates, certain expenditures and, in particular, to absorb the cost of wage and salary increases, as well as increases in other costs. Following our receipt of this advice on 22 January, a detailed examination of our commitments for the balance of the financial year and the extent to which a reduction in expenditure could take place in respect of those funds which had not been committed at that stage, revealed that it was not possible for the ABC to absorb the wage and salary increases which had occurred since 1 July, 1981. In fact, this examination revealed that action which could be taken at that stage would make it possible to absorb only a small part of the cost of these increases. This position was put to the Department of Finance in discussions which took place towards the end of January and, while that Department appreciated that full absorption by the ABC of wage and salary increases was not possible, it stressed that every effort had to be made to reduce expenditure during the remainder of the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy of expenditure restraint has been further stressed in a telex issued to us by the Department of Communication on 12 February last, advising of a Government decision that, until further notice:</PARA>
<PARA> Discretionary expenditure and expenditure which might be flexible with regard to timing, is to be deferred. </PARA>
<PARA> Contractual commitments in respect of major equipment acquisitions or other projected expenditure, shall not be entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> Wage and salary increases are to be absorbed to the maximum extent possible by eliminating overtime. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible, of course, for the ABC to cease its equipment acquisition program with respect to its role as Host Broadcaster for this year's Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. Also, if overtime were totally eliminated, there would be a major cutback in program production and transmission. This recent advice from the Department of Communications provides for exemption from these requirements to be sought in areas of 'special sensitivity' and we will be seeking such exemption where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these expenditure restraints, we have been notified of the need to reduce staff levels below those achieved at 30 June, 1981. In April, 1981, we were advised that the full-time operative staff ceiling was to be cut this financial year by 2%, i.e. a reduction from 6202 to 6072. We lodged an appeal against this provisional reduction in our ceiling, and we have now been advised that following consideration of our appeal, a lesser reduction is to be applied and the full-time operative staff ceiling to be achieved by 30 June next is now 6143, representing a 1% reduction on the number employed at 30 June last. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, during the remainder of this financial year, we are faced with the need to reduce our full-time operative staff strength to 6143 and, in addition, to reduce expenditure wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting on 12 February, the Commission agreed to express its concern to the Minister at the effect of these restraints on our service and discussed at some length the action which would be necessary to achieve these staffing and expenditure reductions. It was agreed that it was no longer possible for such savings to be achieved through a general sharing of the burden across the board. The Commission recognised that across the board cuts in recent years had reduced the staffing and funds for most activities to a point where they would no longer be viable if further reductions were made, and it therefore decided that the reductions which are now being required of the ABC are to be achieved by identifiable cuts in program activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The areas in which these cuts will be made will be considered by the Commission at its March meeting. We have both a short-term and a long-term problem. It will be some months before the savings which will flow from the cuts determined by the Commission will become fully effective and therefore, some short-term measures will have to be taken immediately to achieve the expenditure and staffing reductions required of us in this financial year. The short-term action which the Commission has decided to take includes:</PARA>
<PARA> A reduction of $1 million in the capital budget by deferring until 1982/83 any further contractual commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> Savings of some $700 000 in the operational budget through, for example, a reduction in both general and engineering training; a general cutback in all areas of Radio Australia; a reduction in the program purchases, publicity, FM and program recordings budgets in the Radio Division; a reduction of output of television drama and in documentary and feature film activities. </PARA>
<PARA> A general restraint in expenditure, particularly in overtime and travel. </PARA>
<PARA> The staff reductions which will be achieved as a result of the above measures will be less than the 1% cut in our ceiling and the balance is to be achieved through a general restriction in recruitment over the remainder of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated above, it is not expected that these short-term measures will continue into the 1982/83 financial year. They are of an interim nature only, pending realisation of savings which will flow from the longer term decisions which the Commission will be taking at its March meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>T. S. DUCKMANTON</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. This memo acts on strong directions from this Government to place severe financial constraints on the ABC which will lead inevitably to further chronic underservicing. Such attacks are nothing new from this Government because since gaining office it has been remarkably consistent in attempting to downgrade the ABC and all it stands for; that is, independent and balanced news reporting which has made it famous throughout Australia and Asia, providing alternative entertainment to that offered by commercial radio and television stations too and in general catering to the needs of a community rather than the profit motives of a private corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Duckmanton memo is a recipe for savage curtailment, requiring the ABC internally to absorb wage rises and other cost increases. It demands reductions in program activities, cutting capital costs by $1m and operating costs by $700, 000, including reducing the output of television drama and features and eroding staff conditions including the cutting of overtime and travel. Staff levels are to be reduced to below the level of June 1981; that is, to 6,143-a one per cent reduction. Originally this was to be cut by two per cent and was only modified to one per cent after an appeal by the ABC. The ABC has been cut almost to the bone and this latest savage chopping of programs and staff will leave a skeleton service. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in Wollongong is a disgrace. Wollongong, the seventh largest city in Australia, has a ridiculous pocket-sized ABC. It is laughable to assume that the ABC can cater adequately for the region when the staff comprises two journalists, one casual news typist, two casual announcers and one casual programs officer. That is the sum total of the ABC office in Australia's seventh largest city. Radio station 2WN broadcasts only five hours a day, seven days a week with an additional four hours on Saturday. I am wary of making comparisons with other regions but I must point out that the Newcastle office has one manager, one assistant manager, one staff announcer, six journalists, three office personnel, two casual announcers and a record librarian. Understand- ably , it broadcasts a minimum of 16 hours a day. </PARA>
<PARA> In Wollongong, the office is already so downgraded that any further moves to squeeze out so-called cost excesses will be ineffectual. It has already been wrung dry. For instance, a ridiculous situation developed last month as a result of an earlier so-called cost cutting measure when local radio programs on fishing, gardening and bowls, which for years had catered to a regular audience, were dumped, I do not presume to be a program manager but feeling in the community was running high because of the suddenness of the move and the rudeness with which the local comperes were treated. This is no reflection on the local ABC but on the head office. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC Wollongong television service deserves a special mention. It is run, again through no fault of the local ABC, like a Keystone Cops operation. There is no camera crew, let alone any studio facilities. A freelance cameraman is called in when necessary but the evening news film must be rushed onto the train to Sydney before lunch. As honourable members can imagine, the competition with the one commercial station which has a late afternoon deadline, a range of journalists, camera crew and full studio facilities, is not severe. </PARA>
<PARA> Wollongong is a huge and complex city catering for a vast range of people-from the steelworks, which is the largest single industrial employer in Australia, to the education complex which includes three technical colleges, an institute of education and a university. It covers the tourist belt known as the Leisure Coast, the rural Southern Highlands and south coast agricultural industry, the southern coalfields, and the urban sector ranging from heavy industry to the assorted manufacturing, retail and services sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> It is urgent that the Wollongong ABC office be upgraded, the number of journalists expanded, extra announcers provided and more local radio time permitted. There should also be provision for at least one camera crew for the television news service and arrangements made to convey film to Sydney to an afternoon deadline. If this Government will not implement those reforms, the next Labor Government will. I give that as a pledge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday morning I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) a question. It was on an important issue; it dealt with an important matter. It is unfortunate that what followed smothered the issue I sought to raise. At the centre of the issue are two royal commissions currently proceeding in Victoria, the first into the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the second into the activities of the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation. Each royal commissioner has been given a commission by both the Commonwealth and Victorian governments. As I understand it, it is within the capacity of the Victorian Government to withdraw its particular commission before the report is brought down. Any action by a government to terminate or to vary a commission that it has granted would be a matter for consideration by that government. Any action on the recommendations of a royal commission is a matter for the Government that receives them. In the case of a joint Commonwealth-State royal commission, whether any follow-up action is taken would be a matter for the Commonwealth or Victorian governments, or both governments together and would depend on the nature of the recommendations. The royal commission into the Painters and Dockers Union was set up because of public and government concern for the alleged corruption on the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Miss Louise Potter of Revesby, who is 76 years of age, wrote to me recently telling me of her plight. Miss Potter's life has been one of support, service to her country, pain and struggle. Being the youngest of a large family she supported her aged parents until her early forties. She served for four years in the Women's Australian Auxiliary Air Force during World War II during which time she sustained a spinal injury. The injury, which seriously disrupted her social and work life, has caused her much pain throughout her entire life. After leaving the Air Force, Miss Potter struggled for several years to convince a bank to give a home loan to a single middle-aged woman. She struggled to pay off that loan and to buy the basic necessities to live. Now at the age of 76, Miss Potter is faced with the predicament that she may have to sell her home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Miss Potter, who constantly requires treatment for her spinal injury, is on an 80 per cent disability pension from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. She also gets a part age pension from the Department of Social Security. She has no significant other income. Last November, following the automatic pension rise in line with the consumer price index increase, Miss Potter received notice from the Department of Social Security that she was now 27c over the limit at which she qualified for fringe benefits. This occurred because of two government decisions: Firstly, to count the full disability pension as other income when calculating her social security pension entitlements; and, secondly, not to increase the $20 permissible income for pensioners since 1972-this despite 175 per cent inflation since that time. Pensioners can still earn only up to $20 a week without losing part of their pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Both Miss Potter's age pension and disability pension are indexed so that when her disability pension was increased by about $1.50 in November 1981 to make a total of $40.27 a week she no longer qualified for fringe benefits and her age pension was reduced by 75c. She immediately asked the Department of Veterans' Affairs not to give her the increase but it could not do so. For this minor increase Miss Potter now finds herself in a position where she must take out health insurance, pay full council rates and becomes ineligible for other pensioner concessions. As a consequence of her disability, Miss Potter uses an enormous amount of electric power for heating. Her power bill for the last three quarters was $445. Without a pensioner discount, these bills pose a great hardship. All of this will cost her approximately $20 a week extra, something which Miss Potter cannot afford. As she explained to me, the costs of maintaining her home have escalated dramatically over recent years. Yet when she gets any increase in her pension to keep up with price rises, half of that increase is taken away by the Department of Social Security and, with the abolition of tax indexation, a third of the remainder is taken away by taxation. Clearly, Miss Potter's standard of living is rapidly declining and she has now reached the point where she can no longer make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this predicament on Miss Potter is heart-rending. I quote from her letter:</PARA>
<PARA> Please excuse this scrawl but the shock of losing my fringe benefits and perhaps being forced to sell my house has made me very ill and left me very shaky. I can scarcely hold the pen. Please excuse, too, this lengthy letter, but just being able to write to someone, instead of thinking and worrying has helped to settle me. </PARA>
<PARA>She continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I am fairly sure that if the Government realised just what they have done and are doing to us, they would be humane enough to save us this strife. </PARA>
<PARA>I wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) on 17 February seeking an increase in Miss Potter's disability pension which I see as the only immediate solution to her financial plight. I implore the Minister to be humane and sympathetic to Miss Potter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to take a few minutes of the time of the House tonight to raise an issue concerning my electorate of McMillan, which I suppose, when we get out the facts, will show just what this Government is capable of doing. Last year a new post office was opened in my electorate in the city of Moe, which meant that we had a vacant block of land because of the new post office being built. With a vacant block of land in Moe and land zoned as public land, the council was very keen to see that something was done with that land which would help the community. So in the normal procedures, the State Government was given the opportunity to see whether it wanted to buy that land. It did not want to do so. Then the council made clear to the Government that it was prepared to buy that land and develop it to see whether it could attract regional government facilities to the La Trobe Valley area. The council made an offer for this block of land of $10,500, based on the fact that the land was zoned public land. That was back in August-September of last year. Communication was conveyed to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), and on 7 December I received a letter from him saying that negotiations on the purchase of the site were in progress and he would advise me of the outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has come to my attention just in the last 24 hours that the council recently received a letter from this Government, through the Department of Administrative Services, not only rejecting the council's offer for the land but claiming a valuation figure which was obviously calculated as though the land were zoned for commercial purposes. The land is clearly zoned for public purposes and the council has no intention of rezoning that land. The Department also had not acceded to the council's request for a period of 12 months before considering offering the land to the public to enable the council to press its case for the establishment of government offices on that land. The Department has said to the council that it will now hold the property only until 13 March and that no extension will be granted beyond that date. I have taken this matter up with the Minister in seeking an extension of that date to see whether we can get things back on the rails. </PARA>
<PARA> But what really concerns me about this matter is as follows: The council was astounded to hear that this Government, through the Department, wrote to the State Department of Planning to seek assistance in determining the zoning which would be applied to the property when it passes to the Commonwealth ownership. In other words, in respect of the land which is zoned by the city as public land and is available for purchase and for which a genuine purchase price has been put forward by the council, the Government has written a letter to the Victorian Liberal State Department of Planning asking for assistance in determining the zoning which would apply to the property when it passes to the Commonwealth ownership. No doubt the council was very upset. It immediately wrote to the Minister for Planning objecting strongly to this line of action and to any changes in the zoning from public purposes reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> What sort of a government have we here which takes this sort of approach to public land in a city against the council's wishes? It is fair enough if the Government decides that it can get a little more for that land if it can have it rezoned 'commercial', but surely to goodness, the Commonwealth of Australia has not become so destitute under this Government that it has to go behind the back of a council and write a letter seeking to have this public land rezoned ' commercial'. The council has urged me to take up this matter at the highest possible level. I have raised it tonight because I see this Parliament as the highest possible level to which one can bring such a matter for the attention of the Parliament and the people. I urge members on the Government side to see, when this matter is raised in Cabinet, if it is raised, that their departments do not take this type of approach. If there is a commonsense approach on the part of a local council in a fast developing area to go ahead and develop office space to attract Commonwealth departments to that area so that local people can deal with Australian Taxation Office personnel, for example, and others it should be encouraged to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's actions in this area are totally reprehensible and I urge the Government quickly to reassess the situation and see that the local council is given the 12 months that it wants to see whether it can establish these offices in that area, because it is something that we badly need in the fast growing area of the La Trobe Valley. The Government should withdraw quickly its approach to the State Department of Planning seeking to overrule the council zoning. </PARA>
