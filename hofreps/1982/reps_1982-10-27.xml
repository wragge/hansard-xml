<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take note of what the honourable member for Wakefield just said. I think South Australians would be directing their attention to that factor as they weighed up a question on these lines or on any other line. The honourable member for Grey, representing an area involving the steel industry, of course has asked questions in this House about that industry and has related it to unemployment. The reality is that this Government wants to see a competitive steel industry. What is happening in Australia is not unique to it. Major retrenchments and plant closures are occurring in many countries in world conditions of depressed steel demand. For Australia, export markets have disappeared or are unprofitable. The Australian industry has to adjust to this situation. The honourable member will be aware that quite apart from the specific elements of coal and steel, which were discussed with people yesterday, those representatives raised other matters as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have not left the steel industry on its own. Since receipt of the report from the Temporary Assistance Authority we have given even more assistance to that industry than was indicated by the report of the TAA. We imposed tariff quotas with 150 per cent duty on any increase over the 1981-82 levels. We have had to consider the impact of increased protection for steel on downstream industries, and we have rejected the proposition that the decision we took is responsible for the restructuring. Indeed, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has indicated that this occurred as a consequence of planning well before any Government decisions were taken. Honourable members well know the measures that have been taken for industry. The package announced by the Prime Minister in July was warmly received by industry and it ought to be giving a fillip, in the area of the investment allowance, which honourable members on the other side would abolish, in the area of depreciation and, of course, in the area of the tax benefits available, to try to get further investment for more jobs in this country. To sum it all up, this Government does believe in development and in providing jobs, in contrast to what honourable members opposite would do.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WF7">Mr JARMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. What does the Government intend to do to increase the productivity and profitability of Australian industry? Does the Budget in any way form a basis for co-operation in achieving wage moderation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2585" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is obviously concerned for the profitability and the competitiveness of Australian industry. Only through a healthy industry overall-a healthy manufacturing industry is a very important part of that-will we have the kind of future in Australia that everyone would want. That is why we introduced the package on 19 July which, in a very remarkable way, has improved the depreciation provisions available for manufacturing industry. That is why we also introduced depreciation allowances for income-producing buildings generally for the first time, although they had been available to some elements of the tourist industry as a result of earlier decisions. This, of course, provides the opportunity for Australian industry to make sure that it does have access to the most modern and competitive equipment. Without that I doubt whether manufacturing industry anywhere would be able to compete effectively in the modern world. If we are not using the most modern and effective equipment, then certainly industries in other countries will. The new depreciation schedules allow our industries to compete on much fairer terms with their counterparts in other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, there are the general tax cuts which start to flow in November and which are substantial. The housing interest rebate, which is general rather than specific for first home buyers, will also be of significant help. Even though housing interest rates have not dropped to this point, the fact that there have been some significant falls in official interest rates and in some private sector interest rates should take away from potential home purchasers and home buyers the fear that the upward spiral in interest rates is just going to go on and on. Even if families believed that they could afford to enter into a contract to buy or build a house now in a situation of rising interest rates, I have no doubt that a number of them would be concerned as to whether the increases at some subsequent time might put them in difficulty. I think the fact that there have been some significant falls in official interest rates should take that fear away. It is encouraging to note how secondary market rates have held reasonably well in spite of the adverse consumer price index figure released a few days ago.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, many parts of Australian industry are going to be helped by the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program and by a very significant increase of over 20 per cent in general Commonwealth capital works. Small industries are also being helped by the increased retention allowance and by other measures which will encourage greater equity participation by Australians by providing a tax rebate for $1,000 of equity income and also, of course, by measures designed to encourage employee share ownership. The last two measures might seem relatively small steps but they are saying something of very real philosophical importance which I am sure many people would want to support.</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget does provide a basis for co-operation, for working together, for wage restraint. A single income family with two children, on $300 a week and paying off an average home mortgage, will be $17 to $18 a week--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. In the past you have drawn the attention of Ministers and the Prime Minister to the need for them not to give long answers when they could easily make a statement. I point out that the Prime Minister has been speaking for some minutes. Obviously he should be asking for permission to make a statement to this House. I ask you to ask him to draw his answer to a close.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was making the point that a single income family, with a dependent spouse and two children, earning $300 a week and having taken out an average housing loan of, say, $25,000, will be $17 or $18 a week better off as a result of the Budget. If they had to get that extra money from their employers that would be, say, $25 or $26 a week. In the current environment, that additional $25 or $26 could be enough to send some firms bankrupt. These matters certainly need to be taken into account in any wage decisions that are made in the period ahead of us. Coupled with the general measures designed to assist industry and with the measures designed specifically to help Australian families and Australian working men and women, there is in this Budget a real basis for restraint and for working together. It is very much to be regretted that, as indicated by calculations made by Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association, the Budget of the Cain Government in Victoria will take $12 a week out of the pockets of every Victorian family. That is in marked contrast to this Budget, which is putting $17 or $18 a week into the pockets of those families I have been speaking about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two remaining points that I want to make in this answer. I want to make them as a whole and without interruption by points of order. The first point to be made is that many typical Australian families are $ 17 or $18 a week better off as a result of the measures contained in the Budget. The benefits of those measures are now starting to flow through and will do so progressively through the month of November. That stands in marked contrast to the points that were revealed by the Taxpayers Association in a recent newsletter, when it pointed out that taxpaying families in Victoria on average will be $12 a week worse off as a result of Mr Cain's first Budget, which is increasing overall expenditure by 24 per cent in one year. That even beats Mr Whitlam's first Budget, which increased overall expenditure by 20 per cent. These two matters stand in very stark contrast, very much to the benefit of this Government and its policies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Mr Lionel Bowen-Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order in an endeavour to get some stability into the Parliament. My point of order concerns the question of relevance. The question asked in what way the Prime Minister's Budget assisted anybody. The Prime Minister persists in talking about the Victorian Budget. In no way at all is the answer relevant to the question. It is a political ploy which, as you would know, is related to a by-election. It has nothing to do with the proceedings in this House. The important matter is that, if we are to get some courtesy and understanding on both sides of the Parliament, we had better get some clear justice in the interpretation of what is relevant. Unless we get relevance, we will have complete disarray and we might as well throw away Question Time.</PARA>

I give him, as I give the Leader of the Opposition, considerable latitude, and I do not intend to change that practice. In terms of the question of relevance which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised, clearly it must be relevant to contrast what has happened to a Victorian under one Budget with what has happened to him under another.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Deputy Prime Minister received a letter circulated to members of the House by Mr E. F. Herbert, Chairman of the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia? It is stated in the letter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> UEGA is not proposing at this time to proceed with the construction of an enrichment plant in Australia, nor even with a detailed feasibility study. Whether or not a detailed feasibility study is undertaken in the near future will depend on our joint assessment, with Urenco-Centec, of the extent and timing of future markets.</PARA>
<PARA>Will the Deputy Prime Minister therefore acknowledge that the full feasibility study which the Minister for National Development and Energy announced on 3 June this year has now been deferred? Will he also acknowledge that the prospects for a uranium enrichment plant in Australia are receding rapidly and that his efforts over recent weeks to build up expectations in South Australia and elsewhere that such a plant could be operating in four to five years have been deceitful and mischievous?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the letter the honourable member mentioned, but let me remind him of an answer I gave to this House previously. We had received a report from the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia which said that it preferred and had selected the Urenco-Centec technology for the enrichment of uranium and would now proceed with a commercial evaluation of the carrying out of enrichment in Australia. That is the situation at the moment. Until it has done that commercial evaluation it cannot proceed with an enrichment plant. It is very logical and sensible that Australia should move to the beneficiation of a raw material such as uranium so that we get the added value of it. It is part of this Goverment's policy to have the treatment of ores carried out so that there is an added value from which all Australians can benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know the policy of the Australian Labor Party. It is quite clear. The Leader of the Opposition said in South Australia only a few days ago that he was against the enrichment of uranium. That is quite clear. Any prospects of uranium enrichment in South Australia are killed by the Labor Party's policies. We know that it will not be allowed in New South Wales or Victoria. The only two States that the Uranium Enrichment Group has selected are Queensland and South Australia. It is not an option in the Labor States. If South Australia were stupid enough to elect Labor to power, then South Australia would not be an option. It is quite clear that under the Labor Party's policies the uranium industry would be killed. There would be no possibility of enrichment or of any further development of the uranium industry. That is quite clear. Nobody in the Labor Party will deny it. It is against the development of uranium. The Leader of the Labor Party sits in his position because of the support he gets from the left wing and the communist union leaders, who are against the development of uranium in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That will depend on how many interjections and points of order there are. On a number of occasions Premiers have written to the Commonwealth asking that specific matters be included in the core measures because of particular aspects of drought. This has happened over the years, especially in relation to Western Australia and Queensland but also in relation to the other States. At present there is an outstanding request from Queensland for the construction by local authorities of simple bulk storage facilities for molasses in drought affected areas, in western Queensland in particular. This measure will enable the more efficient bulk transport of molasses to be used as fodder. These measures are being accepted as part of the core measures. They will, of course, have long term benefits which will extend beyond the period of the current drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, core measures will be available which will include low interest carry-on loans, which is probably the most relevant of the measures, for horticultural crop growers in the Mundubbera-Gayndah area, where severe losses have been caused by frost damage. That was a request from Queensland. From South Australia there were also requests, because of the particularly severe frost damage suffered in the Riverland area in June. On a one-off basis, because of the overall severity of the drought throughout the eastern States, the Commonwealth is prepared to accept this frost damage as part of the core measures for this drought. It does not want that to be taken as a precedent for all frost damage for all time, but there are particularly severe circumstances at the moment. The combination of drought and frost has put many people under very great difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth hopes that these measures will be of significant benefit to the people concerned. They are both in response to special requests coming from South Australia and Queensland. I also make the point that I think most States have now accepted that the carry-on loans should be available for small businesses. But New South Wales is still hanging out against that. I make one further plea to Mr Wran to assist small business in the country towns and cities of New South Wales by including eligibility for small businessmen badly affected as a result of drought. Why New South Wales holds out against that particular measure I utterly fail to understand.</PARA>

Was the Nomad subject to test audit on climb performance while the Shrike was not so tested? Has it subsequently been found that the Shrike aircraft contemplated for use are not new as stated in the Minister's Press release and that, subjected to the same audit tests as the Nomad, they did not perform nearly as well? Is it true that the gross weight of the Shrike Commander for instrument flight rules operations has been overstated by 400 pounds, thereby rendering the aircraft ineligible for the award of this contract?

The Minister will be aware that the prices fixed for Newcastle coals will determine the whole structure of Australian coal prices into Japan in 1983. Is he also aware that the coals produced by the Newcastle group of shippers are very competitive in price on a delivered basis in the Japanese market but progress reports from Japan suggest that Newcastle producers in particular should reduce their price in United States dollars? This is now being followed up by suggestions of reduced tonnages. Will the Minister indicate to Japan that the Newcastle tonnages cannot be replaced from elsewhere at anything like the price at which they can be supplied from Australia and that the mills should not pursue an unreasonable policy in what is already a difficult market for suppliers? Finally, can he assure the House that the Government will stand by the Newcastle companies should the mills endeavour to divide them by using tonnage discrimination against producers leading the negotiations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the difficult negotiating circumstances for the coal industry overseas, particularly with Japan and the steel mills there. The Newcastle colliery owners for a number of years went their own way and endeavoured to negotiate independently with the Japanese steel mills. Last year they joined together as a group and collectively negotiated with the Japanese. This was a much more satisfactory way, rather than six individual people going and negotiating with a single buyer, which put them at a distinct disadvantage. That sort of approach has had my support and encouragement. I hope that the industry sees the virtue of acting as a group and that in the course of the negotiations this year it will put its case as strongly and convincingly as it possibly can. It will certainly get my support in taking that approach. I believe that this is an industry objective that ought to be followed through even more than is being done in the Hunter Valley.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Wide Bay for his question. It highlights the very grave difficulties we have with our subsidies to nursing homes because we are dealing, in my mind, with an unsatisfactory system. It is the end result of the Government trying to control prices in every nursing home in Australia over a long period. Basically what we see now is a situation where the individual States can alter the staffing arrangements within nursing homes under State legislation or they can allow inflationary wage settlements to occur . This pushes up the costs of the nursing homes. Under the existing scheme we are obliged to meet those costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two States where there were the most outrageous increases in costs owing to inflationary wage settlements were Victoria and New South Wales. That led to the situation where we had no alternative under the existing scheme but to meet those rises in costs. One of the very difficult factors in the management of health care is that over the last 12 months or so there have been grossly inflationary wage settlements of the order of 20 per cent, or even more in some cases. This in itself is causing these institutions to look very closely at how many people they can employ. It gets back to this very serious matter of employment. In recent discussions with the Tasmanian Minister for Health Services we looked at our joint problems in this area. We realised that inflationary wage settlements were a very great threat to employment in health care. There is a direct link between the two.</PARA>
<PARA> On the more general question about the nursing home situation, the Minister for Social Security, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and I recognise that we face an unsatisfactory system for the control of nursing home costs. We have set up a consultative committee to look into this matter. The honourable member for Grayndler has been chairing a sub-committee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure which has been looking into the matter of nursing homes. I am anxiously looking forward to that report, which the honourable member informs me will be tabled tomorrow in the House. That report will be of great use to the consultative committee which the three Ministers have set up. My aim would be to get us out of this totally unsatisfactory situation, the anomalies of which have been drawn to our attention very directly by the honourable member for Wide Bay.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the honourable member for Hughes that I have repeatedly drawn attention to the need for the Australian economy to become more competitive with the economies of the rest of the world. Indeed, if we are to maintain our present living standards and prevent them from falling and, it is hoped, increase our living standards we must become more competitive. The honourable gentleman is quite correct when he says that our inflation rate is now seriously out of line with that of our trading partners. We must, therefore, ask ourselves what the fundamental causes of that uncompetitiveness are. We can make a very major start by recognising the very significant contribution that wage increases have made not only to levels of inflation but also to levels of unemployment. It is no surprise that those very industrialised countries to which the honourable member draws attention with relish in asking his question are countries which have achieved wage settlements equivalent to or less than their levels of inflation over the past two or three years, in stark contrast to Australia, where wages have increased by 3 per cent or 4 per cent in real terms over the last two financial years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has already indicated in general terms what the Government has done in this Budget and over the years to create a better climate for investment in Australia, for economic recovery and for job creation. Indeed, the last answer of the Treasurer was very relevant to the question of our international competitiveness. In specific terms we as a government are certainly not responsible for these retrenchments. The matter is before the Coal Industry Tribunal today and has been, in fact, for most of the past month. That Tribunal's hearing has been running parallel with an inquiry of the New South Wales Industrial Commission which brought down its judgment on Monday. Mr Justice Fisher of that tribunal said that because of the state of the domestic and world demand for steel there was no option but for Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd to conduct the retrenchments which it had.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without prejudging the findings of the Coal Industry Tribunal, I am bound to say that the cause of these retrenchments is the nature of the coal produced. There is no export market for this type of coal. If it were not for BHP's technical ingenuity there would not have been a market for the coal even domestically. The company has blended this kind of low grade coal for coking purposes with other coal. Because of the lower demand of its blast furnaces there is a lower demand for this kind of coal. The company has offered some of the miners other jobs. In fact, the retrenchments represent less than 10 per cent of its coal industry work force at this time. There are other mines in Australia, such as Drayton, where jobs could be found for other miners.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the mining industry unions, as well as the employers and the tribunals, have an obligation to try to co-operate with this Government. In the end the policies of this Government in respect of investment, retraining and relocation assistance are the only things we can do to assist people to assist themselves. But people need to exercise wage restraint. They need to listen to what this Budget contains to increase real disposable income and not listen to the quite shallow material presented to them yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition. That material has been rightly castigated this morning by a number of economic commentators for misleading people who did not need to be brought here. They did not need to come to Canberra to demonstrate or protest. I have had discussions over recent months with the Lord Mayor of Wollongong and the mayors of Shellharbour and Kiama. There have been continuing discussions between their officials and the officials of several government departments. I have also had discussions with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the steel industry unions and BHP. All those discussions continue as the responsible work of government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to correct part of a statement I made to the House last Wednesday during the debate on the Government's Budget Estimates. When I was outlining the basis of the estimates of additional revenue to be collected through the increase in late payment penalty I stated that, of the total amount of estimated outstanding tax overdue of $1,925m, an amount of $830m would not be the subject of any dispute between the taxpayer and the Commissioner of Taxation and that $1,095m would still be in dispute. The correct figures are, for the amount not subject to dispute, $690m and, for the amount still in dispute, $1,235m. This correction is purely an internal one and makes no change to the overall figures included in the speech.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the House yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made certain allegations about me based, he said, on claims by Mr Rhys Trevor Volkman that I had interfered with an investigation by the Narcotics Bureau into the activities of Nugan Hand Ltd. The substance of Mr Volkman's claim as quoted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was that Mr Nugan became concerned at certain investigations by the Narcotics Bureau and approached the then member for Riverina, Mr Sullivan. Mr Sullivan is then supposed to have approached me and I in turn am supposed to have approached the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Fife, suggesting that there may be some slow-down because the investigation was upsetting primary producers in the Riverina region. Mr Fife in turn is then supposed to have issued an instruction or request that led to a directive by Mr Brian Bates of the Narcotics Bureau.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am certain that such a matter has never been raised with me by Mr Sullivan and that I have never made such suggestions to Mr Fife. I contacted Mr Sullivan this morning and he stated that he has never at any time raised anything of this nature with me. I remind the House also that Mr Brian Bates has denied that he was directed by any Minister of the Crown to suppress the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics into the activities of the Nugan Hand banking corporation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House will be aware that I was Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs between 17 July 1977 and 8 December 1979. Yesterday during debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83 the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) referred to allegations which had been made by a former officer of the Customs Bureau and which suggested that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and I had been in some way involved in slowing down an investigation into the affairs of Nugan Hand Ltd which at the time was being carried out by the then Narcotics Bureau. I do not recall ever receiving representations from Mr Sullivan, the former member for Riverina, concerning Nugan Hand either directly or through the Deputy Prime Minister or someone else. I also cannot recall receiving representations from anyone suggesting that the Nugan Hand investigation by my then Department be terminated or slowed down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have recently asked my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), who now has portfolio responsibilities covering these matters, to have the relevant files checked to see whether any record exists contrary to my recollections. His inquiries to date do not substantiate the allegations that have been made. The implied suggestion that the Deputy Prime Minister requested me to have this investigation terminated or slowed down is false and mischievous . It is also false and mischievous to state that I instructed verbally or in writing Mr Harvey Bates or indeed any other officer of the then Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to terminate or slow down this investigation. On the contrary, because of my concern in respect of this investigation, I repeatedly sought and obtained assurances that the Department was actively pursuing the matter. I also sought and obtained assurances that other law enforcement agencies were investigating the activities of Nugan Hand. I dismiss the allegations that have been made with the contempt which they deserve. </PARA>

The matters that I raised yesterday came from the transcript of evidence given by Mr Volkman to the task force dealing with the Nugan Hand Ltd investigation. Mr Speaker, as you are aware, I had to read the evidence to the House because of your ruling that it is inappropriate to try to incorporate documents in Hansard for the reasons which you announced earlier. The significant point, which perhaps both Ministers might like to have investigated, is contained in a further part of the evidence which would certainly clarify the situation. That file of 150 pages relating to this matter-that is, the file of the Narcotics Bureau, which has now been disbanded- has now been reduced to a mere 42 pages. The question asked of Mr Volkman during the Corporate Affairs Commission investigation was: How could he explain the missing 100 pages of the file? He said that he could not.

As a result of the work done and time given by the members of the Trust, I believe that the four official establisments are now better maintained and better equipped for their tasks than for many years. We are indebted to the Trust for that. The Government does not, however, believe that substantial expenditure on such a major development at Government House as is contemplated in this Special Report can be justified in the present circumstances. We thank the Trust for the considerable work that has been put into the Report, but it should be understood that the Government will not be proceeding further in the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some time, by motions in this House-most recently on 18 August, 8 September and 13 October-and by statements outside this House, I have been attempting to warn the community of the increasingly dangerous social implications of rising unemployment in this country. Unfortunately, on most occasions the reaction of the Government to those statements and motions has been one of complacency. I suggest that any complacency for which the Government may have perceived there were some grounds should have been dispelled totally by the events around this House yesterday. I make it clear on behalf of the Opposition that we are not condoning violent action. However we condemn completely what is already emerging as an attempt to paint the events of yesterday as merely the results of some organisation of extremists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What happened in the surrounds of Parliament House yesterday, if looked at carefully and closely, as I had the opportunity of doing, reveals the depth of despair that is spreading amongst ordinary decent Australians, who are seeing two things: They are seeing a loss of jobs and a threat to their jobs-that is bad enough-but they are also seeing an attitude of government which, as I have had cause to say before, is one of complacency, avoidance, diversion and, indeed , deception. The combination of these facts-the rising unemployment and the attitude of this Government-is giving rise to the attitudes which we witnessed here yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this point at the outset: There is already evident an attempt by some people to make moral judgments about the action of people around this Parliament yesterday and easily to condemn them. I make the point-I suggest it is irrefutable-that no member of this Government, from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) down, has a right to make moral judgments about and condemnations of the people who came here yesterday unless his own position is impeccable. The Government's position is not impeccable. As I will show, in respect of unemployment the Government has been not only incompetent in terms of its economic policies but also despicable in terms of its refusal to accept any responsibility whatsoever for this emergingly disastrous situation. It simply contents itself with a persistent series of diversions and allocations of blame to others but not to itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, because I think the dimensions of this problem should be very clearly in the minds of people, I will again try to get into the consciousness of members of this Government and the community just how bad this problem is and how it is accelerating in its dimensions. I remind the House that in statement after statement over recent months I have been trying to point out what these dimensions are and how the problem is rapidly getting worse. On 21 October I had cause to say that Australia is in the midst of a massive jobs crisis. I pointed out that, on the basis of available statistics, the number of people in full time employment in September 1982 was 72,000 lower than it was a year earlier. I pointed out that young people are the major victims of the jobs crisis and that full time employment among teenagers fell by 43,800, or 8 per cent, over the previous 12 months. I talked about the increase in long term unemployment. The facts are that now over 170,000 people wanting full time work have been out of work for more than 6 months. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be well in the consciousness of members of this House that recently we have had evidence of an alarming acceleration of unemployment. In the event we saw the adjustment of the calculations made by the Government in the Budget Estimates of the number of unemployment benefit recipients. It went up from 395, 000 to 460,000, which was the last guess of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). In September the number of unemployment beneficiaries had jumped by the remarkable figure of 25,000-24,900, to be exact-to 446,300. That occurred at a time when in seasonal terms there is normally a downturn in unemployment. The figures to which I have been referring in terms of the acceleration of this crisis were confirmed by a statement in the 'Australian Bulletin of Labour' from the Flinders University National Institute of Labour Studies Incorporated. It confirmed what I had been saying just a few days before about the level of unemployment next year. According to that independent institute at Flinders University, unemployment in Australia could reach 638,000 or 9.2 per cent of the work force by the end of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members want other indications, I refer to the recent release of the ANZ Bank, which contains its employment advertisement series. One sees there the remarkable evidence of the total collapse of the employment market in this country. In seasonally adjusted terms, the number of advertisements for employment in the major State newspapers has collapsed totally from a figure of 20,737 in June 1981 to 12,236 in September 1982. In other words, in a period of just over 12 months there has been a 41 per cent collapse in the number of jobs advertised. In the last quarter there was a 21 per cent decline in the number of jobs advertised against a 2 per cent rise in the previous year. In the September quarter, in seasonally adjusted terms, there was a jump of just under 50,000 in the number of unemployed people. I point out, as I have had cause to do in recent Press releases, that whilst we must be terribly concerned about the impact of unemployment on our young people-it has reached the level where one in five of our young people is unemployed-we should not forget that, in the most recent period, the fastest growing category amongst jobless people in this country is men in the prime of their working lives, as it has recently been put. In other words, we have the situation where men in the 35 to 54 age category are out of work for a longer period than anyone else. The average duration of unemployment for male breadwinners in that category is now over 10 months, and that category of male breadwinners has been the fastest rising category of unemployment in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the dimensions of unemployment. I hope that at this stage we do not have to spend any more time in persuading people about the dimensions of unemployment and about the fact that it is accelerating. We should not have to waste any more time. We have been trying to get this into the minds and consciousness of members of the Government for the last 12 months. On every occasion when I have gone with the evidence the Government has used some diversionary excuse, some attempt to say that unemployment is not as bad as it really is. For God's sake, the Government should accept the fact that we are facing the total collapse of the employment market in this country. Let us go from that to analysing what the Government's attitude has been. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that in the last few minutes that are available to me I will be able to put to the Government that the Opposition and the trade union movement are prepared to work with the Government constructively to do something to improve the situation in this country. We must accept the fact that up until this present time the Government has sought to avoid, to evade and to blame others. Before I say anything else, I plead with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee), who is at the table, not to spend all his time in reply talking about wages and the trade union movement and blaming everyone else. Will the Minister break new ground this afternoon in this House by accepting, on behalf of the Government, that this Government has some responsibility in terms of the economic policies it has been pursuing? Will the Minister concede the possibility that the Government may have been mistaken and that there may be room for improvement in the economic and social policies to be pursued in this country? He should not just give us a dialogue of abuse of the trade union movement. We will concede that what happens to wages is not irrelevant. The trade union movement has conceded that. The Opposition and the trade union movement are prepared to talk with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has to face up to the fact that very responsible people in this country are expressing a fundamental concern about the stage this Australian society has reached in regard to the question of unemployment, and I will go to just two or three examples. I refer to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 July 1982 and a reference to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Cardinal Sir James Freeman, called yesterday for a conference between Commonwealth and State governments, trade unions, employers and welfare groups to grapple with unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Cardinal added: 'The figures must surely disturb our entire community, including those who normally ignore the problem of unemployment simply because they personally have not been victims of its totally demoralising effects. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a challenge here which demands that governments and the public should face up to the situation with more than words or cosmetic treatment, before our worsening economic crisis gets completely beyond control,'</PARA>
<PARA>That was said by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney. I turn next to an article in the Australian of 31 July which refers to what the Chairman of the Australian Law Reform Commission, Mr Justice Kirby had to say. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> He cited the Brixton riots in London as a warning of what could happen in Australia if a 'whirlwind of discontent and alienation' was allowed to sweep our unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> He said there was a danger with endemic unemployment that it could undermine the general acceptance by the community of the legitimacy of Australia's legal machinery. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me take the matter from those general condemnations to the tragedy of the impact in a personal sense. I refer to an article in the Age of 16 October under the heading: 'Unemployment found to affect the psyche'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> A West Australian research psychiatrist analysing the link between unemployment and psychiatric disorder among young people under 25 has found three groups to be most at risk. </PARA>
<PARA>The article then refers to the work of Dr Finlay-Jones. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Finlay-Jones found in his study that 49 per cent of the unemployed group suffered severe psychiatric disorders and three-quarters of these were cases of depression. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to this House: For God's sake, let us get beyond this simple cosmetic approach of the Government of saying that it is all someone else's fault. We are not saying it is all the Government's fault. But for God's sake, we are saying that there is a very considerable degree of responsibility on the part of the Government. We on this side of the House do not say that we have a magic answer which contains all the solutions, but we do say that we approach this issue with intregrity and not simply trying to score political points. We do not want to come to electoral power on the backs of a growing army of unemployed in this country. What we are saying is that we believe we have available some sensible ideas and some better approaches. We believe that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has shown in the offer that it made a few weeks ago that it has the possibility of a constructive approach. I am not saying that its proposals were perfect-and I doubt whether it is saying that-but it does recognise that what happens in the industrial field can have an impact upon the level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> So what have we got? We have the Labor Opposition in this House saying: 'All right, we think there is a better way. We are not necessarily saying we know all the answers'. We have the trade union movement conceding that it has a responsibility; it has a concern and it has ideas. We are prepared to look at this matter now in terms of what I have been trying to say for years and increasingly in recent months-that this is not just an economic problem; it is increasingly a problem of fundamental social dimensions which, if allowed to go unchecked and be faced by the same callous attitude of the Government, will rent the social fabric of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I plead with the Minister: Do not give us another quarter of an hour of abusing the trade union movement and abusing the Labor Opposition. Accept the hand of co-operation which is put out and change your course of action before it is too late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did listen to the honourable member for Wills. He directed a number of questions specifically at me. I am now specifically answering them. He spoke of the simple cosmetic approach. I venture to say that the approach taken by the Opposition consistently on this issue has been open to the accusation that it has been a simple cosmetic approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me talk about the issues of co-operation, the attitude of the Government and the question of blame. We have shown-the Budget which has just passed through this House is a very good illustration of this-great concern for the individuals who have become unemployed as a result of the domestic and international recession. We have shown great concern to get industry moving, to retain employment as it now stands, to get longer term investment and restructurings so that jobs can be found. We have shown a series of initiatives with local and State governments and the trade union movement as well as with industrial organisations to try to get some long term, permanent, restructured industrial opportunities for people in this country. Again, consistently, we have produced a package of training programs to provide people with the skills of the kind we will need in this country. This Budget does a great deal in that regard. In fact, it does much more than any of the traditional economists would have thought was possible, given the nature of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, without I hope unnecessary repetition, let me remind the House of the fact that the Budget that is currently before Parliament contains a number of measures aimed at enabling industry to plan with certainty for the future so that it can make long term investment decisions which will give people the prospect of jobs with certainty-not temporary jobs but permanent jobs. The Budget contains also a very great lift in the funding of the training programs which will enable people to acquire skills to be more competitive in the depressed economic circumstances when they apply for jobs. Through the variety of programs they will have a higher level of skill. They will be equipped also when the economic upturn comes so that they can gain employment. The industrial investment will be matched by a comparable level of skill. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the attitude of the Government, in particular regarding yesterday's events, one would have to say this: As I said in Question Time, discussions were under way which we, as a government, had been having with the responsible organisations, including local government and the trade unions. I think it is very sad indeed that the social problems of which the honourable member for Wills has spoken-which we have all acknowledged-should be capitalised upon in the way in which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) did yesterday. I heard part of what he said. I have read other statements that he allegedly made yesterday. I believe he was using some of those retrenched people as pawns in a political debate. That is a very serious matter of concern. Who would lead them to think that a government has a magic wand? It is not the honourable member for Wills in his remarks today or, as far as I heard them, yesterday. But the Leader of the Opposition talks about guaranteeing the jobs which they have just lost when he knows there are no markets for the coal or for the steel in question. He talks about an Australian Labor Party government telling Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd that it has to do certain things, to make certain investments. </PARA>

We have not sought a dialogue of abuse of the trade union movement, which was the phrase used. On the contrary, from the time of the tripartite conference in particular we have sought to work with the trade union movement. Our one area of disagreement with the trade union movement at this point is that the concession that it believes it has made-that it will press only for the maintenance of real wages-is not a concession which is sufficient in the present economic circumstances to be sure of retaining jobs and laying the foundations for the economic recovery for which we all strive.</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand that the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions was on Channel 7 this morning and, in fact, was arguing that really there are 93 per cent or 94 per cent--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Barry Jones" NAMEID="KH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr MACPHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bow to the honourable member for Lalor, who watches all these programs. The President of the ACTU said that 92 per cent of persons are currently in employment. One could be forgiven for feeling that he, unlike his predecessor, has not yet got the message that people making up that 92 per cent cannot just press for the maintenance of their current level of real wages except at the expense of some of their 92 per cent and certainly in a way which is prejudicial to the prospects of re-employment of some of those who have been shed in the last few months. I accept the social consequences to which the honourable member for Wills has rightly referred. The Government certainly accepts the ultimate responsibility for trying to get the co-operation of people . But beyond jawboning it is difficult to know what we can do to induce the President of the ACTU to understand that at this stage there is an obligation to tighten the belts and to have what virtually is a wages freeze for the next few months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We accept that the dimensions of the problem are very serious. Not for one moment have I run away from the kinds of descriptions the honourable member for Wills has given here today and elsewhere. However, I do not think that such descriptions ought to be so dramatically overstated that they actually create an even more pessimistic psychology in the community than that which now exists. It is important for people to get an understanding of the gravity of the situation so that they will moderate wage demands or take more serious approaches to productivity improvement. But I do not believe that the situation should be so overdramatised that, in fact, it deters investment and deters people from taking advantage of employment and training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing which is most disturbing about the nature of these seven debates-this is the seventh matter of public importance on this subject which has been raised since the Budget; it is an important subject and I do not deny that it is appropriate to debate the matter seven times-is that one would have thought that in those seven debates, six of which have been led by the honourable member for Wills, we would have actually had an outline of the alternative policy, if there is one, of the Labor Party in respect of this matter or acceptance of an invitation such as we extend today for the Labor Party to work with the Government to try to find a bipartisan approach. In fact the honourable member for Wills-I suspect that it is because of embarrassment caused by some of the wide and rash statements of the Leader of the Opposition-has tried, as a substitute for not having a policy in that regard, to pretend that the Labor Party has a monopoly of concern about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing could be further from the truth. If there were a magic wand we would certainly wave it. There is not. One cannot, in the end, get away from fairly orthodox economic management. In the end one cannot get away from the fact that if the markets are not available for what is dug out of the ground, grown or manufactured and these products cannot be sold, one cannot go on employing people to do those things. For the steel industry there has been a drop in export markets at the same time as a drop in domestic demand. So the imported steel products are those we do not make, do not make in volume or cannot make competitively. But if we were to put up all the barriers against imports of some of the things we cannot make competitively, other people would put up other barriers against some of the things we do make more competitively and sell. That would disemploy a whole range of other people. It is no easy solution to say that we will put up more protective barriers or that we will put on this or that protective device without running the risk of retaliatory action which can only worsen the employment situation for someone else somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit again that the Government has shown a consistent approach in trying to take a longer term view. Parts of primary and secondary industries have already undergone a very major restructuring. The fact that we hear nothing about them now is probably a result of the fact that good news is not reportable news. It is regrettable that the steel industry was one of those industries which did not undergo a restructuring when times were more buoyant. Had that not been so we would not have in fact had the problem with which we are now faced. The repetitive amalgam of statistics from the honourable member for Wills, quotes from his and other previous statements of the Opposition, readings of editorials and all the rhetoric we are accustomed to are no substitute for ideas. We have not received any ideas from the Opposition. In fact, there has been no rebuttal by the Opposition of the assertion I made in the debate on 13 October. There has been no rebuttal by the Opposition of the National Times article I quoted then at some length, to the discomfort of the Opposition, stating that in fact the Labor Party was working from an interim employment platform and had overlooked the preparation of a final platform for the biennial conference of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not deal with this subject by saying that what is happening is all the Government's fault, that there is no social concern, that this is a callous government and that the attitude of the Government led to the displays of yesterday. I wonder who paid the fares for some of those people who came to Canberra yesterday. I wonder who induced them to come. I wonder who thought that they should come here and demand action from the Government. Any reasonable economic adviser-the Labor Party has such people available to it-would have told those people that this was not the avenue for achieving what they want. People were received by me here a week or so ago as part of a delegation. There were other people who can-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister implied that that was the only thing that would work. I point out to the Minister that recent levels of real wages have risen very sharply in most of the successfully managed economies throughout the world. I cite Japan as the best example of that. In Japan inflation and unemployment levels are both at less than 5 per cent. That gives the lie to the Minister's suggestion as a remedy. The fact is that after seven years of Fraser Government economic vandalism we have an inflation rate of 12.3 per cent and an unemployment rate of over half a million people in true figures. A Budget blow- out of about $1 billion is on the cards. When the Minister talks about what the Budget will do to alleviate unemployment of course he neglects to mention the fact that the Treasury estimates were at least 70,000 too low and that, in fact, the Government will be paying some $300m or $400m more in unemployment benefits than it set out in the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After seven years of fight inflation first policies by which this Government has destroyed centralised wage fixation and expanded unemployment, as I have said, to half a million plus, we have reached the position that workers have to come to Canberra as they did yesterday to see the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Jobs are being lost in heavy and manufacturing industries at an alarming and accelerating rate. We are witnessing as a direct result of this Government's actions-or should I say inactions-the deindustrialisation of Australia, the rapid and rocketing collapse of manufacturing industry in Australia. It is all very well to speak of restructuring manufacturing industry, of opportunities for new and viable industries and of new opportunities for high technology industries. That is all very well and supportable but many existing modern and previously viable industries are collapsing around us because of the policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, let us look at the list of jobs that have been lost or will be lost in the near future by retrenchments announced by the companies. International Harvester Ltd has already run down its work force by 1,600 and has announced a further 600 jobs to go at Geelong and Melbourne. Qantas Airways Ltd is threatening the loss of 1,000 jobs. At the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd, a run down of 500 jobs has already occurred. The other day 254 retrenchments were announced in Australian Motor Industries Ltd. General Motors-Holden's Ltd has run down its labour force by 2,000 in the last two years and has threatened a further 350 retrenchments. Ansett Airlines of Australia has retrenched 350 people. In Tasmania Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd has threatened to retrench 350 people in the next three weeks. Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd at Burnie has already announced 190 retrenchments. The Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd at Risdon has run down 150 positions and 350 retrenchments have been announced. Rossarden has announced the loss of 91 positions and 109 retrenchments have already occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Retrenchments are occurring all around Australia. Even as we are talking, the rate of retrenchments is accelerating. It has rocketed in the last few weeks as a result of this Government's policies. The situation is worst in steel and ancillary coal mining industries. Already at the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd steel division at Port Kembla we have seen a run down of 2,700 jobs and 1,730 jobs at Newcastle. Some 950 are to come plus another 260 fourth-year apprentices , for whom the company does not have work are to lose their jobs. Another 1,750 people will go in Newcastle and I will come to Whyalla in a moment. Some 800 people will be sacked at Port Kembla along with 260 fourth-year apprentices, 250 at Newcastle and, of course, the 440 miners. At Whyalla 500 jobs at the steel complex have already been shed by attrition. In November 340 more jobs will go, it is hoped by attrition and voluntary retrenchment schemes but, of course, voluntary retrenchment will dry up in today's economic climate when it is so difficult to get employment. We all know that at Whyalla it will eventually come down to retrenchment-sacking-just as has occurred at Port Kembla and Newcastle. These job losses have been effected so far by attrition, or voluntary retrenchment schemes. But eventually it comes down to compulsory redundancies or retrenchments which is simply a nice way in which to tell people that they have got the sack, that there is no further employment for them. When attrition dries up as a means of effecting job shedding the sackings follow. That is what will occur at Whyalla, at Lysaght in Westernport if the economy does not not pick up and unless there is some relief from imports. </PARA>
<PARA> BHP steel division can well afford to withdraw these retrenchment notices. While it lost $12.6m on its steel operations in the last financial year, it made $105m the year before. Last financial year its total group profit was $365m. The reason for all of this is, of course, primarily the domestic depression, the falling consumption rate of steel in Australia, import penetration, and to a certain extent belated technological changes in the industry or changes to the steel-making process. Production is falling. Last year raw steel production fell by 24 per cent or 561,000 tonnes compared with the year before. Consumption is slotted to fall, according to BHP's assessment of a couple of years ago, from 5. 6 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes next year. That is a tremendous drop in projected domestic steel consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the reasons why people came here to see the Prime Minister yesterday. Mr Speaker I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter which I sent to the Prime Minister last week asking him to meet these people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wrote to the Prime Minister last week asking him to meet a combined deputation of unionists representing people to be sacked. He refused to meet a deputation. He changed his mind early yesterday and told my office that he would meet a deputation from the Illawarra Development Corporation and one trade unionist only, the General President of the Miners Federation. After a concerted demonstration yesterday afternoon, he gave those people two hours. Yet the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations had the audacity to say today in this Parliament that there was no need for those people to come to Canberra and demonstrate in the way that they did because they could have achieved the same result by way of a deputation. I repeat that they were knocked back by the Prime Minister until they came here and made a fuss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What did the Prime Minister tell our steel people yesterday? Apparently they were told that the Government would support another hearing before the Coal Industry Tribunal and that BHP's steel division would be invited to put up another application to the Temporary Assistance Authority. This infers that the decision made on 26 August to peg import levels at the ridiculously historically high level of the 1981-82 financial year was wrong in the first place. Of course , that was a mistake and the Government has now admitted it to be a mistake. Imports have doubled in the last two years. In certain categories of steel production consumption, imports are running at 32 per cent of domestic consumption. What can we do, the Minister asks? We can do a lot, a damn sight more than what this Government has been doing. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) put a temporary plan before the House yesterday which I do not have time to repeat. However, I go further and say that this Government must offer temporary protection against imports from countries such as Korea in return for a pledge of no sackings in the short term by BHP. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must admit that I have been bitterly disappointed with the speeches that have been made in this debate by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). Both of those honourable members have told us how bad the problem of unemployment is and appealed to us not to bash the unions. That is about all their speeches contained. I can assure both honourable gentlemen on the other side of the chamber that they do not have a monopoly on concern for the problems of unemployment in this country or the social effect that it is having and likely to have in the future. We on this side of the House have for quite a long time been concerned about the growing problems of unemployment and the effect that they are likely to have on the future of Australia. We have been trying to persuade honourable members on the other side of the chamber and people outside this chamber what could and should be done to protect the jobs to provide opportunities for our young people in the future. Unfortunately some honourable members and people outside this chamber have not been listening or responding to the requests that have been made by the Government over quite a number of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I assure the honourable member for Wills and other Opposition members that we are concerned not only about the growing problems of unemployment right now; we are also concerned to provide opportunities for our younger people and the workers in this country on a permanent, long term basis. We are not concerned about the short term, band-aid measures that are being put to us by the Opposition. We want long term, constructive and productive jobs. The honourable member for Cunningham in his speech said that, to try to protect the jobs of workers at the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, protective barriers should be raised a little higher than they are now. I remind the honourable member that Australia is a trading nation. We depend for our prosperity, for our opportunity -creating prospects, on selling products on the international market. If we put up protective barriers we are not only protecting those products that are sold within Australia but we are also preventing products from being sold outside Australia. So we would not be creating jobs; we would not be protecting jobs; we would destroy jobs by doing that. I ask the honourable member not to leave the chamber. I am sure he is most interested in my speech. Our policies need to start at the point of creating jobs. We must accept that Australia is a trading nation. We must sell our products on the world market. We need industries which are buoyant and are thus able to sell products on world markets. That is where jobs are created in this country; that is where long term employment will be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> In selling our products on the international market-be they rural or manufactured products-we must look at the factors that the international customer is looking for. That is what will determine jobs in this country. Our customers are looking for a quality product, for cost-competitive product, and for the product to be delivered on time. To create jobs in this country-I urge this on honourable members on the other side of the House-we have to look to satisfying our international customers. We should look at the quality of our products, and particularly at the cost of our products. The Government has been saying for years that we cannot continually push up the cost of production and expect to be able to compete on world markets. Unfortunately, Opposition members , the trade union movement and people in industry have not been listening. They have not taken notice of what the Government said. They have now forced Australia into a position where we are uncompetitive and pricing ourselves out of jobs. Who do we blame for that? Do we blame the Government for being perceptive and telling us years ago, or do we blame people who simply did not listen?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the cost of our production. We all agree that wages are a major component. All of us would agree on that point. The honourable members for Wills appeals to us: Do not bash the unions. I assure the honourable member for Wills that I will bash anyone; I will direct any criticism where I think it is deserved. If the unions deserve one up the bracket, they will get it from me. I remind the honourable member for Wills that over the last financal year the hourly cost of wages rose by 20 per cent while the consumer price index rose by 10 per cent. If that is not a cost impediment to our selling products on the international market, what is? Whose fault is it? Is it the Government's fault? The Government consistently went before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to argue for wage moderation. The Commission did not listen; the unions would not listen; industry would not listen. Now we have priced ourselves out of markets. We have priced ourselves out of jobs. Now members of the Opposition, the unions and industry are saying: 'It is the Goverment's fault'. It is not. What rubbish! The Government forewarned everyone that this situation would develop, but no one listened. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the honourable member for Wills that he claimed in his speech that the unions were now prepared to co-operate with the Government to try to improve the situation and to provide job opportunities. Unfortunately, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) did not see the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions on television this morning, but I did. I was disgusted with the President of ACTU because, without even cracking a smile or being in the least concerned, when asked about the rising rate of unemployment he said: 'Well, if unemployment reaches 8 per cent it means that 92 per cent of people are still employed. We in the unions are not concerned about the 8 per cent; we are concerned only about the 92 per cent'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the honourable member that the next question asked of Mr Dolan was: 'Will you moderate your wage claims in order to bring down the cost of production in Australia and to provide job opportunities?' He answered: 'Well, the workers, the 92 per cent, realise that there are CPI increases. We have to pursue their claims to sustain their standard of living'. Mr Dolan, on behalf of the trade unions, was saying: 'We are not concerned about unemployment. We are concerned only to try to sustain the standard of living for those people who are lucky enough to have jobs, and to hell with those who have not'. Is that a responsible attitude from the trade union movement? We accept that the problem of unemployment and the creation of jobs cannot be solved by any one group within the community. It is not the fault just of government, of unions or of industry. It has to be a total community problem. Everybody must be prepared to bite the bullet and pull in the same direction to get over that problem. But we will not get over it while one group-unions, industry or government-is not prepared to bite the bullet or do the right thing to create job opportunities for the whole community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hate to disagree with my friends on the other side of the House. I wish we could have some co-operation. I remind my friends on the other side of the House that 75 per cent of Australians work in private industry and 25 per cent work in government employment. So a recovery in the Australian economy has to come from the private sector. The vast majority of jobs provided by the private sector are provided by those firms we can broadly consider as small businesses-those that employ less than 100 people. Not all employment is provided by organisations such as BHP or the large mining corporations; it is provided by the small industries, the small businesses. That is where we have to direct our policy. One of the unfortunate things for small business over recent years has been that we have had a succession of sweetheart agreements between big companies and big trade unions which have said: 'We can give you a shorter working week and increased wages'. What has that done for small businesses? It might be convenient for big business and trade unions, but it forces small business to lay off workers. That is the root cause of unemployment. We must get away from these sweetheart deals so that small business can compete, survive and sell their products on the international market. We will not do that while we have a negative, head-in-the-sand attitude coming from honourable members on the other side of the House, from the trade union movement, or from big business. </PARA>

<TITLE>Proposed Student Loans Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Restrict Access to Education</PARA>
<PARA> People from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts. These people, if they enrol, will be forced to amass loan debts. Richer students do not face this handicap.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Undermine the Teritary Education Assistance Scheme</PARA>
<PARA> TEAS should cover the basic living costs of students. Currently the scheme only assists 38% of full-time students and the maximum level of TEAS is a mere $49.67 . Government statements indicate TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Disadvantage Women</PARA>
<PARA> Women students would be disadvantaged by a loans scheme as they have a lesser ability to repay loan debts, because on average women earn less and have a higher unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Disadvantage Mature-Age Students</PARA>
<PARA> Usually mature-age students forego income to study and already have large financial commitments. They could not return to study if it meant incurring substantial debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Distort Educational Choices</PARA>
<PARA> Mounting loan debts would force students into studying shorter courses or not continuing with post-graduate study.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Result in Massive Attrition Rates</PARA>
<PARA> Students will attempt to undertake extensive part-time work or overload courses to minimise their loans. Increased failure rates will result forcing students to 'drop-out' rather than continuing study and increase their debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Cause Administrative and Financial Difficulties</PARA>
<PARA> Overseas experience shows high default rates will occur on student loans. Government money will be channelled away from TEAS to paying off banks. The government will also bear the administrative burden of pursuing defaulters.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the proposed student loans scheme will have disastrous effects on tertiary education, which we believe benefits the whole community, not just the individual student.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides for implementation of proposals put forward by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and the Australian Wheat Board for variations to the existing wheat marketing and pricing arrangements embodied in the Wheat Marketing Act 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>Overview</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>In June of this year I announced that the Government had agreed to proposals by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation aimed at improving the efficiency and flexibility of Australian Wheat Board operations. The proposals empower the Board to operate on wheat futures and financial futures markets, to establish financial reserves, and to introduce options in arrangements for the payment of the guaranteed minimum price-GMP. They also cover machinery aspects of the existing arrangements. The Bill also accommodates a proposal put forward by the Australian Wheat Board, in the context of current severe drought conditions, that the Board be empowered to import and market domestically foreign wheat, should the need arise. Additionally the Bill enables the Australian Wheat Board to act on behalf of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau to secure foreign wheat for Australia's food aid program. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has also been taken to introduce modern standard provisions into the Wheat Marketing Act relating to disclosure of interests by members of statutory bodies. The existing marketing and pricing arrangements rely on complementary Commonwealth-State legislation and each of the States intends to amend its legislation to put the revised arrangements into effect. The revised arrangements will apply for the 1982-83 season, beginning on 1 October 1982. The marketing of Australia's wheat will experience particular difficulties in the period ahead. The drought has drastically reduced the national crop and will compound the difficulties of the Board in supplying the requirements of food aid ; the regular and major markets that have been developed over past years; and the domestic needs for human consumption, industrial usage, feed compounders, and feeding of livestock in drought affected areas. The revised arrangements, particularly the authorising of the Board to import wheat and to hedge transactions on futures markets, will give it increased flexibility in its complex marketing task. </PARA>
<PARA> The wheat marketing and pricing arrangements to apply beyond the 1983-84 season are currently the subject of inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission, which is expected to report by 30 September 1983. Experience with the revised arrangements embodied in this Bill will be taken into account in considering new arrangements which might apply beyond 1983-84. Consideration will also need to be given to the views expressed by other interest groups, notably the Flour Millers Council, concerning the appropriateness of existing arrangements including existing domestic pricing arrangements for wheat for human consumption . I now turn to the specific proposals encompassed by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Futures Operations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Bill will empower the Board to hedge wheat and financial transactions on futures markets thus enabling the Board to secure price assurances for its unsold wheat. The Government accepts the view of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation that the Board should be authorised to hedge on futures markets at this time. The authorising of the Board to hedge transactions on futures markets will enable it to use a marketing mechanism that is accepted in international commercial trading of grain. Experience has shown that the hedging of transactions on futures markets facilitates grain trading. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposed arrangements the Board will be able to hedge on wheat futures markets, currency futures markets, and financial futures markets to protect its wheat sales and also its commercial borrowings used to finance payments to growers. However I emphasise that the Bill carefully defines what is meant by hedging purposes in order to preclude any suggestion of speculation on futures markets. It also provides that the various types of futures transactions will be subject to separate guidelines approved by the Minister for Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Reserves</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Bill enables the Board to deduct moneys from the proceeds of the sale of wheat and wheat products and create reserves that can be used for specific purposes, consistent with the powers of the Board under the Act. The Board will be required to disclose the details of each reserve in its financial statements which will be published in its annual report to parliament. Provisions have been made in the Bill so that the Government's financial liability under the guaranteed minimum price arrangements will not be increased as a result of deductions made for reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>Advance Payment Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Under the existing legislation the Board is required to pay the guaranteed minimum price to growers on delivery of wheat at the beginning of the season. As growers may not always wish to receive the payment at that time the Bill provides for deferment of all or part of that payment until later in the season. Payment of the advance payment to growers will be on the basis of arrangements worked out between the grower and the Board, subject to equity being preserved between growers. Any additional costs arising from the optional payment arrangements will be excluded from the excess commercial borrowing cost reimbursement arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Allowances and Charges</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The advance payment made to growers on delivery of the wheat consists of the guaranteed minimum price adjusted to take account of quality allowances and certain transport, handling, and storage charges. These allowances and charges can vary significantly between growers and States and appropriate deductions for individual growers can be difficult to determine at the beginning of the season. Accordingly, the Act is being amended to ensure that provisional and final adjustments can be made for these charges and allowances and that the full amounts will be brought to the account of individual growers. </PARA>
<PARA>Finalisation of Pools</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Presently the Board is obliged to hold wheat against the season for which it has been received until its ultimate disposal. This can delay the finalisation of a season's pool and impair the efficient management of the Board's operations. The cost cannot be justified on equity grounds when the volume is small. The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation has proposed that when the stock of wheat held in respect of a season is reduced to a residual level the Board should be enabled to transfer it from one season to another. The Bill provides that the Board should transfer residual stocks from one pool to another only when it has priced the wheat and such a transfer could not potentially cause or add to a call on the Government's commitment under the guaranteed minimum price arrangements. I will be taking up with the Board the desirability of it determining and announcing each season its policy in respect of the residual stock which is intended to be transferred to a later pool. </PARA>
<PARA>Redeliveries</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Sales of wheat by the Board for stockfeed use are provided for under section 26 of the Act. It is proposed that the section be broadened to enable growers to take redelivery of a quantity of wheat delivered by them during the season at a price determined by the Board. The price charged for the redelivered wheat will be equitable between growers and will be based primarily on recovering the guaranteed minimum price plus any adjustments for quality and storage and handling costs. The redelivered wheat will only be able to be used for stockfeed purposes and may be of a different quality from that delivered initially by the grower. </PARA>
<PARA>Remuneration of Authorised Receivers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation has proposed that the existing legislative provision be removed requiring the Board to negotiate agreements on the rates of charge with its authorised receivers for services they provide. Accordingly, it is proposed that the Act be amended to provide for the Board to make payments on the basis of rates determined by the authorised receiver in each State and in accordance with the remuneration agreements in force at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>Approval of Progress Payments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Bill also removes the legislative constraint that advance payments by the Board, other than the initial advance, be approved by the Minister. Should the occasion arise where growers are dissatisfied with the rate at which progress payments are made then the appropriate course of action will be for the Minister to take up any representation with the Chairman of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA>Consistency of Season and Accounting Year</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation has proposed that the Board's accounting year be brought into line with the crop year. The Bill provides that the accounting year be brought forward three months from 1 December to 1 October which will be consistent with the 'season' used in other sections of the Wheat Marketing Act 1979. Following on from this change it is intended that the Board' s annual report be submitted to the Minister for Primary Industry by 31 March of each year instead of 30 June, unless a later date is approved by the Minister. In the next reporting period there are likely to be practical problems for the authorised receivers and the Board in fitting in with this new schedule, and it may be necessary for me to extend the Board's reporting period. </PARA>
<PARA>Authority to Import</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Bill enables the Australian Wheat Board to import and market domestically foreign wheat, should the need arise. Any specific proposal by the Australian Wheat Board to import wheat will need to comply with quarantine restrictions and will also be subject to the Minister's approval under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Requests will be considered on a case by case basis and an import need will have to be substantiated. The domestic marketing of Australian wheat is subject to the Wheat Marketing Act 1979 and any foreign wheat marketing on the domestic market will need to be consistent with the provisions for Australian wheat, especially in respect of pricing. </PARA>
<PARA>Agency for Australian Development Assistance Bureau</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the current reduced wheat supplies, the Board will also be empowered to act on behalf of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau to secure foreign wheat for Australia's food aid program. The Board's expertise will be used in negotiating shipments of foreign wheat direct to Australia's food aid recipients. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments contained in this Bill arise essentially from proposals put forward by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and the Australian Wheat Board . The revised arrangements take account of changed circumstances for the marketing of wheat since the current five-year plan was introduced in 1979. These proposals, especially in respect of imports and hedging, will assist the Australian Wheat Board in its complex task of marketing the Australian crop to the best advantage. Experience with the revised arrangements will be reviewed in the context of consideration of wheat marketing arrangements beyond 1983-84. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill ( No. 2) and associated Bills now before the House, far from being the triumph over tax dodgers which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has so proudly proclaimed, represent only the latest chapter in the greatest tax scandal which this nation has ever known, a chapter which again demonstrates the Government's weakness in dealing with tax dodgers. It is a scandal which has encompassed negligence and culpability on the part of senior Ministers, inexcusable government delay, bureaucratic bungling and incompetence, protection of tax dodgers in the Liberal Party's own ranks, irreparable government splits and prime ministerial hypocrisy and inconsistency. The smell of this scandal has tainted not only the entire government but also has reached far into some of the previously most exclusive sections of the Australian establishment. Most of all, however, this scandal has encompassed a massive rip-off of the vast majority of honest Australian taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordinary wage and salary earners and other income earners have had to bear the brunt of record tax levels under this Government to make up for continual government neglect and failure to take prompt, effective and tough action against tax dodgers. For years now ordinary taxpayers have struggled under ever increasing taxes while the Government either refused to act or dithered over what action to take to stop the haemorrhage of tax revenue through tax avoidance and evasion. The Government has continually placed the interests of ordinary Australians second to the interests of persons indulging in a wide variety of tax rorts, an approach necessitated by the Government's knowledge that most of those using these rorts are squarely in the ranks of its own supporters. Now that the Government is belatedly acting to recover some of the taxes stolen, to use the Prime Minister's own word, through bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, ordinary taxpayers can feel little comfort. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation currently before the House is weak and does not go anywhere near far enough to recover the full amount of stolen funds. Whilst the Australian Labor Party does not oppose this legislation we regard it as inadequate in these respects and accordingly will propose amendments to strengthen it and to ensure a strong attack on tax dodgers. The package of legislation before the House to deal with bottom-of-the-harbour type tax evasion schemes, or straw company schemes as they are otherwise known, is in five parts. The Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2] is the principal Bill. It sets out the basic conditions under which promoters of these schemes and former share owners in companies dumped under the schemes become liable to repay evaded company taxes and undistributed profits taxes. This so-called recoupment tax will apply to promoters and all shareholders in companies involved in such schemes since 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax-Vendors) Bill and the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax-Promoters) Bill formally impose tax on the promoters for 20 per cent of the tax liability and on the shareholders' shares of the unpaid company tax established under the first Bill while the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) ( Consequential Amendments) Bill amends other Acts to fit in with this legislation . Finally, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Additional Tax) Bill amends the income tax laws to increase late payment penalties from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, effective two months after the Bill becomes law, and also restricts the power of the Commissioner of Taxation to remit penalty tax to circumstances of genuine hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation has been hurriedly brought forward by the Government in the face of the extremely damaging revelations made in two government instigated reports-the McCabe-Lafranchi report, which was instigated by the Victorian Liberal Government and had nothing to do with this Government, and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, which was instigated by this Government and the Victorian Liberal Government. Both reports vividly illustrated the incredible growth of the tax avoidance and evasion industry in Australia. Both are stunning indictments of the Government's failure to take decisive action in these areas. These reports concentrated particularly on tax evasion involving the stripping of untaxed company profits through bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. These schemes have spread at an amazing rate. McCabe and Lafranchi gave details of 900 companies, of the total of some 3,000 companies they investigated, which they alleged were involved in all States. The Australian Taxation Office now admits that up to 6,000 companies may be involved. The New South Wales Government reportedly has a list of about 4,000 companies involved in New South Wales. So it is impossible to tell exactly where the schemes stop. </PARA>
<PARA> Bottom-of-the-harbour schemes developed out of the so-called dry Slutzkin dividend stripping schemes which were legitimised by a 1977 High Court decision. Dry Slutzkin schemes basically involve the following steps: First, the target company with accumulated profits on which all company tax has been paid is liquidated so that all assets are held in cash. Next, the shareholders of the target company sell their shares to the scheme's promoter for a price close to the full value of the cashed-up company. As far as possible, they avoid any knowledge of the promoter's intentions. Income received in this way by shareholders is a tax free capital gain. Finally, the promoter, through a series of transactions, declares a dividend to milk funds out of the company so that no further tax is paid. An example of the scheme might involve a company with accumulated after tax profits of $1m. Assuming that 40 per cent is distributed to shareholders so that undistributed profits tax is not payable, tax on the $ 400,000 dividend in the shareholders' hands would be $240,000 if the shareholders are on the top marginal tax rate. In this case the true worth of the company, after allowing for tax liability, is $760,000. However, under this scheme the company is sold to the promoter for, say, $900,000-that is, well above its actual value-which represents a commission to the promoter of $100,000 and a tax free profit to the shareholders of $140,000. In effect the shareholders and the promoter have split the tax payable between them. These schemes were subject to amending legislation in 1978 but, as usual, the Government went only half way and further legislation was required in 1981 to stop these activities finally. </PARA>
<PARA> So far I have been describing the dry Slutzkin schemes. The bottom-of-the- harbour or so-called wet Slutzkin schemes are a particularly insidious development of the dry variety. They usually involve the target company with current year profits on which company tax has not been paid. Again, the target company is cashed up before being sold to the promoter for a price approximating its full value with no account being taken of the outstanding tax liability. Once again, vendor shareholders are advised to ask no questions. As in the dry Slutzkin scheme, the promoter and the vendor shareholders effectively split the amount due as company tax between them. At this point the essential similiarities between the two schemes end. Whereas in the dry Slutzkin scheme the promoter puts the company profits through some form of tax avoidance scheme to get out of paying taxes, under the wet Slutzkin scheme the promoter merely walks away with the assets of the stripped company in most cases and then transfers its shares and directorships to derelicts, criminals or men of straw with no money and fake addresses, or the company records may literally be dropped in the bottom of the harbour. Either way the company has no assets and it is virtually impossible to trace. Using a similar example to the one I used earlier, a company with untaxed current year profits of $1m would have total taxes owing of about $590,000, including company tax and tax due on dividend distribution to shareholders. In this case the true value of the company is $410 ,000 but it is sold to the promotor for a price well in excess of this value, say, $900,000. This represents a rip-off of public funds to the tune of $590,000 -$490,000 tax free to the company shareholders and $100,000 commission to the promoter. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be seen from this example that wet Slutzkin or bottom-of-the-harbour schemes involve straight out tax evasion through the illegal misappropration of funds from the company as well as an element of the so-called dry Slutzkin schemes, which are, in a strictly technical sense, legal tax avoidance schemes which worked within the letter of the law which operated at the time. In the view of the Opposition, there is no way, however, that there is any justification for either aspect of such schemes. They were little more than a highly blatant and artificial device designed to abuse the intent of the tax laws and avoid huge amounts of tax for the greedy few with access to such schemes. Both varieties of this scheme have in common the aim to avoid liability for tax on dividend income paid out of company profits which, when distributed to shareholders, should have been taxed at the shareholders' marginal tax rate. While such distributions in the dry Slutzkin scheme are paid out of already taxed profits, the bottom-of-the-harbour variety goes further, as I have shown, and also evades the tax which should have been paid on the actual company profits before a dividend is paid. So the reason for the higher tax loss from such schemes in the example I gave earlier is that they dodge company tax on company profits and undistributed profits as well as personal income tax on dividend incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to attempt to recoup only that portion of the tax lost under bottom-of-the-harbour schemes represented by the evaded company tax and undistributed profits tax. No effort is being made to recoup the tax lost which should otherwise have been paid on dividends distributed to shareholders. The tax lost from this personal income tax component of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes could be half as much again as the $580m which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) now says the Government hopes to reclaim through this legislation. We have asked the Treasurer, in a letter which was sent to him a month ago, to give us a calculation of the exact or approximate amount which he thinks would be involved in the loss of personal income tax through the use of the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. To date we have had no response. He clearly does not want to give us an answer to display to the Australian public how much revenue in the form of personal income tax was ripped off by this scheme which he is not bothering to pick up in this recoupment tax process. Quite clearly the Government is embarrassed about any publicity of the amounts involved. But there is no doubt that they are substantial. As we understand it, about two-thirds of the 4,600 companies which the Commissioner of Taxation has so far identified as being involved in this scheme had accumulated profits. Therefore, an element of the loss of personal income tax is involved in two-thirds of those companies. We can therefore reasonably presume that several hundred million dollars may well be involved in personal income tax ripped off by the use of this scheme-tax which is not being recouped by this legislation. There is absolutely no reason for this exclusion other than the Government's desire to tread a soft line against tax avoiders and restrict the scope of the legislation so severely. Labor regards the legislation as inadequate especially because of its failure to act in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, these Bills will attempt to recover evaded company tax by establishing a liability to recoupment tax for shareholders and promoters where an arrangement has been entered into to put a company in a position so that it is unable to pay its tax and where the total consideration received for the sale of the company's shares exceeds the net assets of the company, including the outstanding tax liability. In this situation an assessment for company tax due will be issued to representative shareholders, who will then have a period of 60 days to object, if they so desire, to the company tax liability. However, there will be considerable incentive to the shareholders not to object on frivolous grounds, as 20 per cent penalty tax will commence to accrue 30 days after the issue of the initial assessment, unless they can take advantage of another clause which I will mention later. After 60 days each shareholder in the company will become liable to pay recoupment tax equal to a proportion of the unpaid company tax determined by reference to the proportion of total proceeds received for the sale of his or her shares. Again, 20 per cent late payment penalty will begin to accrue where recoupment tax is unpaid by the shareholder after 30 days.</PARA>
<PARA> Should the shareholders decide not to contest the assessment they will, on paying a 25 per cent deposit, be able to pay the tax liability in instalments over a 12-month period. This is a provision of the legislation to which we strongly object. In addition, the promoters of these schemes will become liable to repay 20 per cent of the total tax outstanding, this amount being determined on the basis of the average 12 per cent commission charged by promoters on the total value of the stripped companies. Shareholders will still be able to repay the full amount of tax owing and any money recovered from promoters will be refunded to the shareholders. This is the main structure through which the Government proposes to recover some of the total tax lost through these schemes. The legislation is to apply to schemes entered into between 1 January 1972, which is just prior to the date of the first known use of those schemes, and 4 December 1980, the date on which the Crimes (Taxation) Offences Act was proclaimed to outlaw such schemes specifically. There are many other provisions in these Bills to which I will not refer because of lack of time. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Australian Labor Party is not opposing these Bills as a whole, we do however have serious reservations about them and about the whole series of events surrounding them. In the first place, these Bills should not have been necessary. Had the Government acted promptly when the existence of these schemes was first discovered, the schemes could have been quickly strangled and revenue losses drastically reduced. The report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union vividly illustrated the history of government inaction against bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Initially some 50 companies were found to be operating these schemes in Perth in 1973. After close examination of existing laws, a decision was made by the Commissioner of Taxation in late 1975 to prosecute the persons involved in this case. Prosecution was to be launched under the Crimes Act for conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth and liquidation proceedings were commenced to recover tax owing. As we know, and has been discussed in debates in this House on several occasions, no such prosecution was ever launched for reasons which I will not go into now because of lack of time. But certainly an important factor to bear in mind in this debate is that although a decision was made in 1975 to take such prosecution no such prosecution was launched in subsequent years and no such prosecution has yet been launched. </PARA>
<PARA> A result of this inaction was that no action was taken against the schemes until 1980. The Attorney-General's Department dithered around until that time when it informed the Australian Taxation Office that insufficient evidence existed for criminal prosecutions. Despite the overwhelming weight of earlier evidence to the contrary, the Attorney-General's Department inexcusably delayed this case for five years before deciding that it could not proceed. Absolutely no effort was made to test existing laws. Had a test case been launched under the law as it stood, this would have been a tremendous disincentive for other potential users of this scheme. We in the Opposition strongly feel-in this we are supported by Costigan and several legal opinions-that action in this area stood a very good chance of success. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Office was not without some fault during this debacle. While the investigative officer in Perth did a good job in uncovering the initial examples of the scheme, setting up prosecutions and pushing the Crown Solicitor's Office to follow through with them, he was let down by a seeming lack of resolve on the part of head office. Certainly the Taxation Office in Canberra, having been presented with the facts from Perth, made the initial decision to prosecute. But from this point on it apparently lost interest in pursuing the case through the Attorney-General's Department. According to the Costigan report by 1979 the Taxation Office in Canberra had become discouraged by delays within the Crown Law Office. While the Taxation Office began to press the Treasurer for legislative action in 1978 the fact that it failed to follow up on the initial prosecution decision is a poor reflection on its efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has claimed that the Government was not informed of these schemes until early 1978. In our view the Taxation Office should have gone straight to the Government at least two years earlier immediately the delay within the Crown Solicitor's Office became apparent. However, once it went to the Government in 1978 and stressed the need for action it got little response from the Treasurer or the Government for two and a half years. The Treasurer has made various excuses for the delays, citing the heavy workload of taxation matters, the need for careful scrutiny of criminal penalties, the secrecy provisions of the Tax Act, internal opposition within his own party and the fact that strong public attitudes to taxation avoidance were not then evident. None of these excuses holds water. The simple fact is that the Government and the Treasurer were totally negligent and unable to stomach the tough action which was necessary to end these abuses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has claimed that he was not made aware of the full implications of these schemes until 1979 or 1980. Yet a brief glance at the so-called ' telephone book of documents' which he tabled in Parliament a few weeks ago gives the lie to this claim. Right from the outset the Taxation Commissioner stressed the extent of the problem and the need for urgent action. In the middle of 1979, following upon extensive delays to that time, the Taxation Commissioner told the Treasurer, and I quote from the documents:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the problem of straw company and straw trust evasion is already very serious and growing. It is my considered advice that the situation needs to be remedied urgently and with stern measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Such warnings continued to flow to the Treasurer with the Taxation Commissioner claiming at the end of 1975:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . this activity is occurring on a large scale daily. </PARA>
<PARA>By the last months of 1980 the Treasury Secretary was backing the Commissioner, stating that the situation had reached an alarming stage. Finally, after some 18 calls by the Commissioner to the Treasurer for action, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was passed outlawing such schemes. This eventual passage of legislation in no way absolved the Treasurer from blame over his failure to act decisively at an early stage over this issue. When he was first warned of the urgency for action he should have acquainted himself fully with the case and demanded all available material on the matter. In this way he would have become acquainted with the Perth fiasco. He should have ensured that existing laws were tested to the full or he should have announced immediately that action was pending and that such action, as it occurred in numerous other cases, would backdate to that time. He took neither course and therefore ensured that the schemes carried on unhindered for a further two and a half years. In saying that he should have taken action to backdate action to that time, I am not referring to criminal penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely clear from the events that have unfolded that both the Treasurer and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) have been guilty of culpable negligence in the administration of their departments. Had either Minister acted promptly and efficiently there is no doubt that the current tax scandal would not have reached the stage it has. Despite the overwhelming evidence against both Ministers, the Prime Minister has steadfastly defended them against demands for their resignation. The Prime Minister's action in this situation sits completely at odds with a statement he made in 1972 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if a major blunder occurred in a Department of real importance to Australia, and if the Minister were unaware of it, the Minister should accept responsibility for the mistakes of his Department and offer to resign. </PARA>
<PARA>There could be nothing clearer than that statement from the Prime Minister. Yet we have come to expect the Prime Minister to renege on earlier undertakings and to twist his previous statements to suit the particular situation in which he finds himself. Certainly this trait has come to the fore during the current tax debate. When the Government finally brought itself to act against bottom-of-the- harbour schemes at the end of 1980 it made no effort to recoup the hundreds of millions of dollars already lost through these schemes. Certainly it knew at that time of the massive extent of lost revenue but it was content merely to boast about stopping the schemes while at the same time allowing users of these schemes to keep their spoils. If it had not been for the public outrage stirred up by the combined impact of the Costigan and McCabe-Lafranchi reports the Government would not have taken any action whatsoever in this recoupment area. The Government was compelled by the strength of the revelations made by these reports to take action to recover some of the taxes owing. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, almost two years after the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, the Government has now presented Parliament with legislation to recoup these lost taxes in an effort to defuse public outrage over its abject failure to act at an earlier date. However, this legislation is weak and inadequate and is further evidence of the Government's lack of nerve to tackle the problem head on. The weakness of the legislation is a clear product of the lack of support within the Liberal Party at large and the divisions within the parliamentary Liberal Party over the provisions of this legislation. During the past few weeks the Australian public has been treated to a bitter display of infighting within the Liberal Party over this issue. The Prime Minister, under threat from his back bench, called a meeting of the Liberal Party's national executive to give him so -called unanimous support for the stand taken against the tax dodgers. Yet the very next day the Western Australian Branch President of the Liberal Party went public, saying that his organisation did not support the Prime Minister. It was significant, of course, that the Western Australians were the initial source of opposition. It is not difficult to speculate as to whom they are trying to protect. </PARA>
<PARA> In following days we were treated to the spec- tacle of most State branches expressing their opposition to the legislation and of Government back benchers appearing on national television to voice concern for so-called innocent parties and Liberal principle. In truth their opposition smacks more of a desire to protect their own rather than of any concern for principle. The result has been legislation which in the first place was inadequate but which has been progressively watered down to cater to the demands of the party to such an extent that it may be ineffective in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the House of the changes made to the measures since they first became public. Initially, the companies involved were to be subject to penalty tax for failure to lodge tax returns and for late payment from the time that they were initially assessed. These provisions were dropped. Next, the proposed late payment penalty was reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. Last week the original Bills were withdrawn and replaced by a more sanitised version which allows tax dodgers 12 months to pay without penalty, a provision much more generous than anything available to ordinary taxpayers. Next, a provision that the Commissioner of Taxation could name persons involved in these schemes in his annual report was dropped, presumably to protect well known Liberal identities from disclosure. Finally, a very odd clause exempting certain companies has been inserted. We now find that where companies were put into a tax avoidance scheme after sale to the promoter with a reasonable expectation that the scheme would be successful, but which scheme subsequently fails, the companies and the vendors and promoters associated with that scheme are exempted from this legislation. In our view, this clause opens up wide scope for up to 700 of the 4 ,600 companies officially admitted to be involved to escape the legislation, with considerable revenue consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor is strongly opposed to this particular provision, as well as to the 12 months to pay clause, which, as I said, is far more generous than anything available to ordinary taxpayers. We will oppose these clauses in the Committee stages of the Bills, and I will outline our objection in more detail at that stage. In addition, we shall move during the Committee stage to reinsert the provisions which allow the Commissioner of Taxation to name in his annual report the people who have failed to pay the recoupment tax. In our opinion, there can be no justification for protecting the identities of such persons, who deserve the fullest weight of public condemnation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the original intentions of the Government have been extensively watered down to adopt a softer approach to participants in this scheme in response to pressures from within the Liberal Party. I am sure that although the Bills are now before the House we have not yet seen the end of attempts to emasculate the legislation. Last week the Treasurer admitted during a Press conference on the steps of Parliament House that further change could be expected. What a ludicrous situation. Obviously the Government is on the back pedal, and all the tough rhetoric from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer about the activities of the tax dodgers and the need for fairness in the tax system can be seen for what it is-just so much hollow rhetoric. There has been nothing more pathetic in recent weeks than the Prime Minister's defence in Parliament of persons using dry Slutzkin schemes which, according to the Prime Minister, were all right because they were tax avoidance rather than evasion schemes and had been approved by the High Court. Yet only weeks before the Prime Minister had condemned them. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . those high priced lawyers and accountants who have devised and promoted tax avoidance schemes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>do more damage to the basis of this society than a thousand Gallaghers in this world, or a thousand Builders' Laborers Federations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister also called for an ethical approach to financial transactions , not just a strictly literal approach to the law. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if we have to legislate for every wrongful act . . . then we will be so subsumed in legislation . . . every judge in the land would have to work overtime. </PARA>
<PARA>There can be no clearer condemnation of tax avoidance practices than those, yet the Prime Minister quickly forgot those sentiments when forced into defending one of his own. His selective righteousness is contemptible. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already indicated that Labor will move in the Committee stage to strengthen this legislation in several important ways. In addition, we wish to move a second reading amendment on the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill (No. 2) expressing our deep concern at the total inadequacy of the Bill in several respects. In our view, the legislation is deficient in two key respects. Firstly, it makes no attempt to recoup personal income taxes avoided under bottom-of-the-harbour schemes which should have been paid when accumulated company profits were distributed as dividends to shareholders. I have already shown how these schemes involve loss of revenue from both tax on company profits and undistributed profits and tax on dividend income. These Bills attempt to recover only the first element of evaded company tax and undistributed profits tax and still leave shareholders in an advantageous position, having received a tax-free amount for what would otherwise have been taxable income. There is, in our view, absolutely no justification for delineating between these two aspects of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The Government does so on the basis that the loss of company tax represents tax evasion, which is in some way more objectionable than the loss of personal income tax through what is meant to be tax avoidance. I have already illustrated the Prime Minister's views on the subject, but I will again quote his words. In May 1981 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 'There is no real difference between the person who finds an artificial loophole to slip out of tax and the person who falsely declares his income.'</PARA>
<PARA>There we have the Prime Minister saying in 1981 that there is no real difference between tax avoidance and evasion. Yet in this legislation the Government is making that distinction very clearly indeed and justifying not pursuing hundreds of millions of dollars on the basis of a distinction which last year the Prime Minister said did not exist. We on this side of the House reject that distinction in respect of this scheme. Whichever way it has been achieved, either through straight out tax evasion or through the use of some totally artificial and contrived device to exploit the letter of existing law, there is no dispute that a tax benefit has been gained and gained at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. Particularly is this so given that these two components are an essential part of the one scheme and, indeed, are involved in the one transaction. So action against the scheme should clearly encompass both elements . I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) condemns the abject failure of the Treasurer and the Government, knowing of the existence of straw company tax evasion schemes since at least 1978, to respond quickly and effectively to the massive tax evasion occurring through the use of such schemes;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) is of the opinion that the Bill is grossly inadequate in that:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To an extent the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis) is in fact accurate. There is a scandal in this matter. It is a scandal of personal abuse by the Australian Labor Party, of left wing McCarthyism, and of guilt by association as the Opposition has sought to use the Government's effective measures against tax evasion and avoidance as an excuse for transferring the bottom of the harbour into the bottom of the gutter. Let us recognise that the schemes to which this legislation is addressing itself are schemes that were blocked totally by this Government in 1980. The whole tax avoidance debate relates to a remarkable success story by the Government in which $3,000m of claims under avoidance schemes have effectively been blocked by the Government's anti-avoidance legislation-let alone the evasion schemes that have been stopped. So the bottom-of-the-harbour action represents probably no more than about 10 per cent of the total effective action taken against the whole of the tax avoidance and evasion industry. Lest anyone think that that money is lost, there is no doubt whatsoever that a very large proportion of it will be and is being recovered. The present legislation simply seeks to recover the evaded part of that tax liability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Howard) mentioned the other day in Question Time what was happening about the pursuit of many of the avoidance schemes that people may wrongly think they had got away with simply because the Government, to provide surety in this matter, had specifically legislated against these avoidance schemes. The fact is that in all of these avoidance schemes that have received some publicity, and which, as I say, were knocked off many years ago, the assessments are still outstanding and the Commissioner of Taxation is pursuing them slowly through the courts, as the legal process requires. The taxpayer has every right to pursue the matter to the final court. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the House that the general thrust of what the honourable member for Gellibrand presented was, in fact, nonsensical. I put it to the honourable member that what has happened in the tax avoidance industry is very simple. As the High Court of Australia effectively diminished the usefulness of some of the previous legislation against tax avoidance and in some of its judgments declared that that legislation was, in its view, at the time deficient then, of course, tax avoidance grew rapidly. It grew so rapidly that, in fact, by 1977-78-shortly after the Slutzkin decision and the Cridland decision of the High Court of Australia-claims for deductions generated during the year involving tax avoidance reached an horrific total of $1,860m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The table clearly demonstrates that as the level of avoidance fell as a result of the Government's very successful campaign, the level of illegal evasion rose dramatically until, of course, this Government blocked it. I repeat: This Government blocked it in 1980. One would not know that, of course, if one listened only to the Opposition; one would think it was all still going on. But in fact, that is the reality. To suggest that the Government has been unsuccessful, that it has done nothing, is utter bunkum, and it can be shown to be bunkum. The reason-I must say the reason was totally distorted by the honourable member for Gellibrand-that there have been changes in the current legislation from the legislation that was introduced into this House three or so weeks ago is very simple. The Government was quite properly determined to ensure that the legislation did not extend beyond the limits which were clearly indicated in the Treasurer's statement of 25 July when he introduced the concept of recovery of tax evaded in these schemes to strip companies of untaxed profits. This, I repeat, had been totally blocked in 1980. It was very important, indeed, that the legislation as introduced did not, in fact, extend beyond what the Government had always said it should deal with-that is, illegal evasion of tax. I know that the Opposition finds it impossible to distinguish between what is legal and what is illegal. That reflects its whole approach, I think, to many more things than the tax matter. Members of the Opposition cannot distinguish between illegality and legality but this Government does and, I believe, must, particularly where it is reaching backwards to seek the recoupment of taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been alleged that this is retrospective tax. I suggest that the word is 'recoupment' because what this legislation is doing is not making illegal what was legal at the time; it is recouping the proceeds of something that was always illegal. Surely the Opposition can recognise that very significant difference. We are recouping the proceeds of what was always illegal. The problem is that the people who perpetrated the fraud were not the people who benefited from it. There was always a fraud. What the honourable member for Gellibrand is demanding now is that we go far beyond recouping the proceeds of fraud, which the Government has continually said this legislation is all about. The honourable member wants to recoup the proceeds of quite legal activities, activities in fact that the High Court had held in some instances were legal. The honourable member wants to go back into time and, in fact, to introduce genuinely retrospective legislation that will make illegal something that was legal at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, what this legislation is seeking to do is simply to make certain that the proceeds of fraud are recouped. I recommend to the House and, I might say, to the parliamentary Press Gallery, that they reread the Treasurer's statement of 25 July to see exactly what the Government has always been about in this matter. There has been no change of direction, no withdrawal, no softening of the thrust of the Government's objectives. The Government has always said, as the Treasurer said, 'having regard to the fraudulent nature of the scheme' and so on. The word 'fraud' has always been the essential element of every statement that the Treasurer and, I might say, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) have made about this legislation. The recent changes have ensured that it does not extend beyond those clear limits that were quite properly set in the Treasurer's initial statement. So there is no need for the Government to be defensive on this matter. There is no need for it to have to justify the caution with which it approached the whole matter of introducing, in the first place, in 1980 criminal liability in a tax matter and of course, in this matter seeking to recoup the proceeds of fraud because of the special problem created by the fact that the person who perpetrated the fraud did not receive the benefit of that fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that this legislation is doing no more than recouping the proceeds of that fraud. It seems to me that the matter of penalties, which was raised earlier, goes beyond that matter of recoupment of fraud. I believe the Government has done the right thing by clearly stating that the past failures by the directors who acquired these companies will not be visited upon the vendors- after all, it was not the vendors who failed to submit a tax return; it was the new owners. The vendors had no control over the actions of the new owners. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that there has, of course, been a determined campaign on the other side of this matter-many people feel that this law goes too far-to try to denigrate this law, to say that it is retrospective and against various principles. I submit that that campaign is wrong. I am glad to see that the Government is not dissuaded from pursuing this law by that campaign. I concede that there have been some areas where the need for clearly distinguishing between what the Government was seeking to do and what some people held that this law, in fact, enabled to be done should be cleared up. It seems to me to be quite right that the Treasurer, while sticking clearly and firmly to his 25 July statement, should have made these alterations. This recoupment legislation will, as I said, do no more than recover company tax that was evaded in bottom-of-the- harbour strips of untaxed company profits. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that many people in the Parliament wish to discuss this matter today and that we should seek to limit our remarks. However, I want to stress that the revenue involved in all these matters has not been lost. The allegation by the Opposition that $35 a week has been lost by the ordinary Australian taxpayer is, in fact, a fraudulent claim. If there is any fraud in this matter it is fraud on the part of the Opposition. Its claim is absolute nonsense. The loss of $35 a week suggests something like $10,000m worth of evasion a year which, of course, is absolute nonsense. The total of all the private company profits in Australia in one year is $2,000m. Is the Opposition seriously claiming that five times the total revenue of all private companies has been evaded illegally in this way? It is arrant nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell honourable members one bit of reality about this matter of evasion. Something like $3,000m has been estimated as being the proceeds of evasion of a manual kind-the evasion brought about by the cash economy. That is not evasion by big business. That is not evasion by the silvertails. That is, in fact, evasion by ordinary Australians. I would suggest that this is the area in which big evasion now takes place. That costs every Australian family taxpayer something like $10 a week. That is why I commend the Treasurer for the next bout in his incredibly successful campaign against tax avoidance and evasion. I refer to the campaign he announced in his Budget Speech in which he said that he would be introducing measures during the year which would allow for the collection of something like $500m next year out of the cash economy. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) I would like to raise a few matters. I start by mentioning the fact that this Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill ( No. 2) is again a belated effort by this Government. It is a reactive measure against tax avoidance. If one goes back over the government's record, despite the fact that we have repeatedly heard Government members in this House talking about the great record of the Government on tax avoidance, one can see that it is appalling. This legislation is another indication of how long the Government has taken to act on matters which were known a long while ago. The schemes we are talking about, bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, were first detected as far back as 1973. In relation to that I refer to page 27 of the report of Mr Costigan where he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This scheme was first detected in a wide spread manner by the Australian Taxation Office in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a long while earlier than 1978, the year to which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) alluded. In fact, in November 1975 authority was given to launch prosecutions, but that matter was put in the too hard basket by this Government. That is the way the Government has continued to act in this area ever since. According to the Government, nothing could be done until the passage of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of November 1980. That matter also has been canvassed at considerable length in the debates on taxation in this Parliament, particularly in the debates involving the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Again the Government failed to take action to prosecute people who were ripping off the system in a most outrageous way. There was no excuse for this Government not spelling out clearly to people in the community the fact that it was not prepared to tolerate the sort of behaviour which has gone on in the tax avoidance industry over a long period. Numerous opinions were available but I do not propose to go over them again. They have been mentioned so regularly in debates that we are probably all a bit sick of hearing about them. The fact of the matter is that if this Government had taken action, by prosecuting people years ago, we would not be in the hopeless situation in which we are now in relation to tax avoidance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lilley for that interjection because it is right. The argument that from a legal point of view it is difficult to prove conspiracy or fraud is an interesting one. In these circumstances nobody denies that it would be difficult. But I put an example to honourable members: Suppose somebody proposed a scheme, highly organised and sophisticated-it has been going on all the time in the tax avoidance industry-whereby people could rip-off the system at the expense of wage and salary earners of this country. Suppose that the person receiving the scheme discovered a few weeks later that someone had in fact been prosecuted by the Federal Government for conspiracy. I find it very difficult to understand how the Treasurer or anybody else could argue that that would not have had a very great effect on the whole tax avoidance industry. It would not be of particular interest to people to know whether the person was convicted. Is it said that somebody would be prepared to go through a trial on that sort of issue, regardless of whether they were convicted, in view of the expense and the fact that it was a criminal proceeding ? Such a prosecution would have knocked the scheme on the head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But this Government did not have the will to do that. Despite the opinions that were available the Government continued to hide behind the view that nothing could be done until legislation was introduced. That legislation was the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of December 1980 which was passed almost two years ago. The claim that existing laws were inadequate is a contradiction of numerous legal opinions which were given prior to that period. But no action was taken by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth looking at the sorts of people involved in these schemes and the attitudes they adopted. After the Government acted in relation to amending the Income Tax Assessment Act and Part IVA was inserted, a seminar was held in Melbourne on 23 June 1981, at which papers were presented. Those papers indicated the type of mentality of this Government in dealing with tax evasion and its total failure to understand the matter-it is probably more correct to say that it did not want to understand it-is demonstrated by looking at some of the papers given at that seminar. I would like to refer to one in particular. It was a paper given by Mr Neil Forsyth, a Melbourne Q.C. At that seminar referring to Part IVA, he said this:</PARA>
<PARA> If Part IVA applies, if there is a scheme, etcetera, and the Commissioner has brought it into operation and has assessed some tax by reason of it, then section 226 sub-section (2A) provides that there is an automatic penalty of 200 per cent of the amount of that tax, but of course the Commissioner and the board of review have power to remit all or part of that penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> I myself think that the maximum penalty is too high. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Treasurer ought to listen to this because it indicates the sort of mentality with which we are dealing:</PARA>
<PARA> It equates artificial but honest arrangements with fraudulent and dishonest steps taken by taxpayers. It blurs the distinction completely between what is clever and tricky on the one hand and what is dishonest and cheating on the other. The distinction is drawn between being clever and tricky on one hand and cheating and dishonest on the other. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Forsyth went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Not everybody might agree that there should be a distinction but to me there is a distinction between saying ''That is what I've done, I say it works, I think it's clever, it may not be playing fair by the community but that's a different matter' and saying alternatively ''I'm just going to put this money into my pocket''. </PARA>
<PARA>In the taxation avoidance industry people have publicly stated that it is okay if one says: 'That is what I have done. It works. I think it is clever. It may not be playing fair by the community and that is a different matter.' That is the mentality that the Government has had to deal with. One must have some sympathy for the Government in that regard. But one cannot have any sympathy for a government dealing with people of that mentality which then takes no action to prosecute people. As I indicated earlier-I think it is worth repeating-the argument that it is difficult to prove that conspiracy or fraud has been committed is accepted. But the fact of the matter is that if the Government had sent some people for the big jump it would have certainly slowed them down. However the Government did absolutely nothing. In November 1980 it trumpeted the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill as if it were the greatest invention that had come into being in relation to tax avoidance, but still there were no prosecutions. We are told that it has all stopped. Eminent authorities have been quoted by representatives of some firms, such as members of Coopers and Lybrand. At Question Time one day the Treasurer announced that a member of Coopers and Lybrand had said that taxation avoidance in this country was dead. No prosecutions were launched after the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill was passed and none before. The mentality of people whom we were dealing with and whom this Government was dealing with is as I have indicated. If people thought that something was clever they did not care whether or not it was fair by the rest of the community. As long as they got away with it that was okay. This Government sat back and watched it happen. We have now got to the stage where, if it had not been for the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, this legislation would not be before this Parliament today. Again nothing would have happened. The Government is totally reactive all the time. No positive action has been taken by this Government unless it has been of a reactive nature. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1980 the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and I drew to the attention of the Parliament a scheme operating in the assignment of debts in Melbourne. It was an enormous rip-off of the tax system. Nothing was done about that until the matter came into this place and then some action was taken. It will be interesting to see how much action was taken. That is a matter we have not put away as something we do not intend to continue to explore. However it is again an indication of the way in which this Government reacts. The tax avoidance industry just goes along. The Government yaps at its heels like a dog and the tax avoidance industry it just kicks it away until something else crops up and then the Government puts its finger in the hole to see whether it can stop the flood. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting and delightful to hear that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) supports the Bill but there seemed to be a certain amount of apology in his speech in that he kept talking about the fact that this Bill will recoup company tax already avoided. Therefore there was an apologetic nature about what he had to say in respect to retrospectivity. We ought to make it quite clear that we on this side of the House do not make any apology with respect to retrospectivity of legislation where it is directed at artificially contrived taxation avoidance schemes with no commercial value whatsoever. I think it is about time that people faced up to that issue. There is no need to be apologetic about it. I draw to the attention of the House a decision in the Victorian Supreme Court as far back as 1960 in the case of Doro and the Victorian Railways Commissioners by Mr Justice Adam, a very highly respected member of that court. The reference is 1960 Victorian Law Reports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer interjects: 'Thank you, your honour'. Of course that is a classic example of his somewhat inane attitude at times on these matters. He indicated here one day in reply to a question that I seemed to take everything that Frank Costigan said as being some sort of holy writ. That is something that I am pleased I have the opportunity to clarify. I do not think what Frank Costigan says necessarily takes on such a high standing. But what I am saying is that what he said in his report confirmed opinions of Queen's Counsel and other senior barristers in this country over many years. The Treasurer has never come into this House and put an opinion which contradicts those opinions and said that they were wrong. Until he does he should take some notice of opinions given by people over the years, people such as Frank Costigan and numerous others before him. Even in my 20 minutes I do not have time to go through them but there are plenty of speeches in which they have been listed and it would not be a bad idea if the Treasurer read them. In that decision Justice Adam stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The strength of the presumption against retrospectivity in any particular case, and accordingly the ease or difficulty with which it may be overcome, must, I would think, depend on the nature and degree of the injustice which would result from giving the statute a retrospective operation. </PARA>
<PARA>He later said:</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, where to give retrospective operation to a statute might be considered to work some injustice to one party, but is clearly required to rectify a manifest injustice to others, there would, on principle, seem little reason for giving much weight to the presumption. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a classic case with respect to retrospectivity, and I am pleased to see that the Treasurer agrees with that. The manifest injustice that comes about because of what these people have done to the detriment of the rest of the community clearly justifies retrospectivity in this type of case. What are we dealing with? We are dealing with tax avoidance which has become big business. Schemes were devised and commercially marketed by specialist companies whose principal or only activity consisted in the sale and operations of such schemes. That is all they did. It was a growth industry under this Government. They were only commercially marketing and operating tax avoidance schemes. In return taxpayers incurred a fee, usually calculated as a proportion of the tax that it was hoped would be saved and payable at the outset. Schemes tended to be very complicated, required the participation of numerous parties and the circulation of substantial sums of money. That is the sort of operation that we were faced with. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, there has been a change in attitude in relation to the whole question of tax avoidance. To a large degree that has come about because of the reconstituted High Court of Australia. Under the present leadership of Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs, far from showing an appetite for mobilising the Barwick brand of pedantic literalism, it is now looking at these cases in a far more sensible way. That was demonstrated in the case of Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Limited v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation. In that case the High Court showed quite clearly that it was prepared to seize upon the House of Lords decision in Ramsay Ltd v. the Inland Revenue Commissioners of 1981. In that case the House of Lords dismissed two appeals involving artificial tax avoidance. The House of Lords in that case quite clearly spelt out that it was not prepared to tolerate any further this totally contrived effort to avoid the contribution that people should make to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing about the Treasurer that has always surprised me is that he has said time and again in this House that there was a change in community attitudes to tax avoidance, as if that was an excuse for not taking any action. It is true that there has been a change of attitude, but to a large degree it has come about because we on this side of the House during this Parliament and the previous Parliament, through spokesmen such as the honourable member for Gellibrand and various other honourable members, have spelt out the situation over and over again. Tonight honourable members opposite will talk about the great record of this Government, so in closing it is worth referring to two sets of statistics of the Commissioner of Taxation. In 1979, 655 individuals were identified in tax avoidance schemes which involved an amount of $317m. The number of companies involved was 1,603 and the amount involved was $107m. By 1981 the individuals numbered 17,957, involving $620m and companies-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many honourable members want to speak in the second reading debate on these taxation Bills. Therefore, I propose to confine my remarks to a few points. Certainly in my electorate and in many parts of this country my attitude to this legislation is well known. I have always made it clear that as a member of the Liberal Party, as a person who believes in the rule of law and in the things for which our forefathers fought, I do not see retrospective legislation of this nature as being in the long term interests of Australia. Nevertheless, I want to make one or two other points. I am acutely aware of the concern in the Australian community about the tax evasion industry and also about the more artificial forms of tax avoidance. I am also very much aware that almost every Australian tries, legitimately and properly, to minimise his tax in the normal course of events-'minimise' meaning to avoid paying unnecessary tax. I am aware of that concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware that, largely due to public efforts by people such as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and me telling people that under the present arrangements there is an unfair shifting of the tax burden from certain groups to other groups, there is now an awareness in the community that that shifting of the tax burden by artificial schemes of tax evasion is downright unfair. As I said, we have been saying that for a long time. We are saying that, of course, not only in the context of the more illegal or unfair practices such as artificial schemes, but also in the overall context of determining who ought to pay tax; in what form it should be paid; whether there ought to be more indirect taxes or less; whether we ought to be double taxing dividends, as people tell us we do; whether we ought to be raising a lot of tax through Customs and excise; and whether we should have regressive forms of tax spending, such as the raising of money from people in the western suburbs of Sydney to subsidise people on the North Shore to go to the opera. There are many things in the tax system with which many people would disagree. </PARA>
<PARA> If I had the time this evening I would launch into some ideas about how we could genuinely reform the tax system so that, for a start, there would be less possibility of evasion and less possibility of artificial tax schemes and, in addition, there could be a more efficient taxation system that could add positively to our potential as a country. It also needs to be said with regard to community concern, that individuals often speak with two hats, depending on the aspect of taxation to which they address themselves. I have no doubt that many of the people who have quite openly said that we ought to legislate retrospectively to catch the people who have been called knaves and thieves must have aided and abetted at some time in their lives an evasion through the cash economy. For instance, any person who pays cash for a job which somebody does in his house and any person who shops in a market where no receipts are given probably have a fair idea that a percentage of that payment might be going to somebody who withholds knowledge of that transaction from the Commissioner of Taxation or does not declare all of the transactions at the end of the financial year. It is well documented, certainly overseas, that the cash economy is a major economy. It is the one in which most tax is evaded. The so-called bottom- of-the-harbour schemes are particularly nasty, but all in all in a single year more tax would be evaded through the cash economy in Australia than was probably ever evaded in the so-called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes since they have sprung up. I am told they started to spring up at the end of the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> I also register the fact that members of the Australian Labor Party, who very self-righteously today have said that they will do all sorts of things about getting money from people who in all fairness ought to have paid it, when given the opportunity did nothing about it. During their period of power between 1972 and 1975, to my knowledge, they did nothing. During this period officers working in the Australian Taxation Office-on the evidence that we have heard recently- began to find out about some schemes. This was the period when there was a famous court case relating to the Curran scheme. I reiterate that members of the Labor Party did nothing. They seem absolutely ridiculous when, instead of supporting the present Government, which has done a lot, they criticise it. They ought to look at their motives and wonder why they could not do anything during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address myself for a minute or two to the problems I see in starting off a retrospective tax campaign. Even if the present Government sticks to what it has been saying-that is, that this is an absolutely special case-it is possible to assume from what the Labor Party has had to say already in this debate that, should it gain power in Australia again, it will re-examine all the tax rules. Perhaps on its definitions of fairness it will pick out those areas in which it believes the legislators have legislated unfairly previously and will change those laws back to what they were. If it does so, it will be saying that the Government ought to be able to override the rule of law and that the right of the individual people to act with certainty within the law ought to be thrown out of the window in favour of a government which rides roughshod over people's rights. I remind the House that not many hundreds of years ago our forefathers had to fight the king. It can be said that in our present system, we are the king, but then the ordinary people had to fight the sovereign king to get very simple rules of law established in Britain. It was a matter of great historic moment when our forefathers stood up against the king and said: 'You cannot ride roughshod over our basic right. There ought to be rules that are certain'. It was from that that our Westminster democratic system sprang. It has proved to be the best system of rule ever invented. Certainly, it is the most lasting and the most democratic. </PARA>
<PARA> All I am saying is that this legislation introduces a great fear in my mind. There is a great fear in the minds of many of the people in the community who support it that if this method is used again and again they will not know where they stand and the police state, the state where governments can come back and change the rules, will have come into this country. That is the attitude of the Australian Labor Party. It sees government as being above the law. It sees many tax schemes it would want to attack in the future. I have just heard the term: ' We ought to get at all schemes that have no commercial value'. What does that mean? Does that mean that an ordinary trust arrangement has no commercial value? Does it mean that an ordinary private company arrangement has no commercial value? Does it mean that an ordinary partnership arrangement has no commercial value? I just do not know what it means, but no doubt if Labor should ever get back into power the ordinary people of Australia will find out well and truly what it means. I simply say that the tax which was owing ought to have been collected under the law. No doubt other speakers will talk about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say in conclusion that this legislation as it is presented, in the sense that it expresses the aim of the Government, which in turn expresses the concern of the community, is better legislation than it was a week or so ago. There have been some changes, but still some other changes are required, and one of those changes is absolutely required. If vendor shareholders in all fairness sold their shares without reasonably knowing that the company was to be used for one of these terrible, so-called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, at least those people ought to be protected under the law. I hope to raise that matter later. I hope that I can get widespread support for that basic principle of Australian justice. I recognise the problem facing the public. We have a perception amongst the public that those who might vote against this legislation are simply the friends of the tax dodgers. Nothing could be further from the truth. As far as my record goes, I point out that the first time the issue of tax evasion was debated in this House-I emphasise, debated in this House-it was raised by me as a matter of public importance. It was not raised by the Labor Party, and that ought to go on the record. I will not say any more about this legislation at the moment, except that it is bad legislation brought forward to fill a perceived need by the public. No doubt the public ought to be pleased with what it is getting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found incredible some of the comments that were made by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury). The honourable member for Macarthur suggested that the Government and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) could take credit for the approach they have adopted in relation to taxation avoidance and evasion . Let me just refer to some headlines in connection with the Government's approach to this question. First of all, the Australian Financial Review on Monday, 28 June 1982 bears the headlines: 'Multi-Million Dollar Losses to Tax Evaders' and 'More Names Promised but No Money'. The front page of the Sydney Morning Herald on 23 September this year bore the headline: 'Government Inaction on Tax Lurks Dates to 1977'. On the front page of the Australian Financial Review are the headlines: 'Extraordinary Government History of Inaction' and ' Tax Evasion-New Disclosures'. We have as well a reference to the companies of Mr Denis Horgan, a leading Liberal in Western Australia and former Chairman of the Western Australian Liberal Party Finance Committee. The headline states: 'How Horgan Company Avoided $7m in 5 Years'. We have from the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Malcolm Fraser) a request to the same Mr Denis Horgan-who has been appointed to all of these government authorities at an income of something like $30,000 a year; this tax dodger, this crook-please do stand down. It is no good the Treasurer shaking his head when I use the word 'crook', when newspapers in Australia are referring to the fact that this same character's companies avoided $7m in five years. It is no good, either, for the honourable member for Eden- Monaro to come in here with all of his offended virtue and offended morality and suggest that retrospective legislation is not appropriate. The position in Australia at present is that through tax evasion and avoidance the Treasury, the Commonwealth Government, and all of the taxpayers in Australia who meet their responsibilities are being ripped off to the extent of probably $7,000m every year. Of course those figures cannot be refuted. They have been supplied by much more eminent authorities than I would ever claim to be. What does that represent ?</PARA></TALK.START>

When the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and anyone else on the Government side cross the floor and vote against this legislation-that is apparently honourable members' intention-I hope that all of the households in their electorates become aware of the fact that because of all these smart tax dodging lurkmen and crooks around the place every household in Australia is paying to compensate for that at least $30 extra tax a week, and every pay-as-you-earn taxpayer is paying an extra $25 a week to make up for all the tax dodgers, all the tax avoiders and all the tax evaders.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Let the Australian people be perfectly aware of that. We have all this nonsense from people such as the honourable member for Macarthur and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. Let them cross the floor and let their names be recorded! McCabe-Lafranchi indicated 923 companies that had been involved in these bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The Australian Taxation Office has indicated possibly 6,200 companies that have been involved. The New South Wales Government has indicated that in New South Wales alone the number is probably something like 4,000, and so it has been going on. We know it has been going on since the early 1970s. The Treasurer himself admitted that the Government knew about it as early as 1978. Every conceivable excuse has been sought and advanced by the Treasurer and the Government for their personal and general procrastination. The most incredible claim made by the Treasurer was that action could not have been taken earlier because the community was not sufficiently aware, the level of public concern was not sufficiently high. For that reason the Government procrastinated. I say to the Treasurer, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker: That is an incredible statement to make. We surely should be allowed to expect more from the Government and responsible Ministers in the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the very serious deficiencies in this legislation is that no provision is made for the recovery of tax from unpaid dividends. I know that the Government has used as an excuse for this legislation and for the reversal in its attitude towards retrospective legislation the fact that this legislation is designed to recoup tax which was not paid under various types of evasion practices. The point is that if this assertion by the Government and the Treasurer is in fact correct, if this legislation is designed to recoup tax which was not paid as a result of evasion practices, of course the legislation is not necessary because tax evasion is illegal. If it was illegal when these practices were undertaken it is quite obvious that there were laws in existence at that time which could have been and should have been applied adequately to deal with them. The Government is introducing retrospective legislation in order to recover tax which was lost under various types of avoidance practices. So the practices at that stage must have been legal. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted-the Opposition and the Australian community are delighted-at this change of attitude on the part of the Government. Let us not hear this nonsense from the Government that it has not reversed the position which it previously adopted. Of course it has. It is legislating retrospectively to collect retrospective taxes. The type of scheme which is not being legislated against, as I said, relates to unpaid dividends. They are the dry Slutzkins. Sir Garfield Barwick, when he was Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, presiding over the original Slutzkin case indicated that that type of practice was legal. What a legacy Sir Garfield Barwick has left to this nation! What a legacy that incredible man-that shameful person-has left to this nation!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Of course there is no point of order, and the Treasurer knew it. If the Treasurer is talking about whether any action has been taken against Horgan, I might ask the Treasurer how many prosecutions have been launched anyway. We know the answer: No prosecutions. We know the performance of the Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth. We remember too the Treasurer referring to the fact that he was disappointed that he had not been informed by the Crown Solicitor's Office and by the Commissioner of Taxation about some of these things that had been going on. But the evidence tabled in this place just recently indicated that since 1978, at the very latest , it was well and truly known. It is now 1982. Rather belatedly, as a result of justified anguish on the part of the Australian people about just what direction was being taken, the Government is being forced into a position in which some type of action has to be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A devil! There are any number of reasons for us to be concerned about the role of that 'gentleman'. The Prime Minister, on earlier occasions, and particularly in his electorate talk on 31 May 1981, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that there is no real difference between the person who finds an artificial loophole to slip out of tax--</PARA>
<PARA>That is like the dry Slutzkin scheme, the one against which no action has been taken under this retrospective legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>and the person who falsely declares his income. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the tax evaders. They are the people who offend against the law and who are guilty of illegal acts. Of course, in connection with that I suppose we could include the wet Slutzkin. Why did the Prime Minister change his attitude from May 1981 until more recently when he has been defending the dry Slutzkins? It is because one of his mates, John Reid, has been into dry Slutzkins up to his neck. Everyone knows that the only reason John Reid disposed of those companies to the Brian Maher group was that they were then going to engage in dividend stripping operations. There should have been provision in this legislation to deal with those. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975 the Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth was supposed to take action under the Crimes Act against the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Of course, the claim now is that legislation existed. No action was taken. David Solomon, in an Australian Financial Review article of 18 October 1982, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax avoidance as an industry is a comparatively recent phenomenon . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is a recent phenomenon. It has mushroomed only since 1975, under this Government. The figures prove it. The annual reports of the Commissioner of Taxation indicate the extent to which it has blossomed under this Government. David Solomon went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and it was able to blossom because of the destruction of Section 260 of the Act by the Barwick court. </PARA>
<PARA>That same 'gentleman' is one of the knights of the realm. Would we expect anything other than that from one of the knights of the realm whose names have been mentioned in connection with these provisions? The same article by David Solomon led off in this way:</PARA>
<PARA> The Barwick High Court during the seventies effectively put a time-bomb under both the Australian taxation system and the Liberal Party. That bomb has exploded, leaving the tax system in a shambles, and the Liberal Party nearer to splitting than it has ever been in its history. </PARA>
<PARA>The only member of the High Court during the period of Sir Garfield Barwick's chief justiceship who showed any concern or guts in connection with these shysters was Justice Lionel Murphy who argued for a purposive interpretation of the Income Tax Assessment Act instead of a literal interpretation. In conclusion , I will read into the record part of a minority judgment by Mr Justice Murphy. In connection with the Westraders case he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion, strictly literal interpretation of a tax Act is an open invitation to artificial and contrived tax avoidance. Progress towards a free society will not be advanced by attributing to Parliament meanings which no one believes it intended so that income tax becomes optional for the rich while remaining compulsory for most income earners. </PARA>
<PARA>Justice Murphy continued:</PARA>
<PARA> If strict literalism continues to prevail, the Legislature may have no practical alternative but to vest tax officials with more and more discretion. This may well lead to tax laws capable, if unchecked, of great oppression. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the position in which we increasingly find ourselves. I have mentioned before the possibility that the whole of the taxation system could collapse. All of the changes that have been introduced increasingly are showing themselves as being incapable of achieving what the Australian people are increasingly demanding not only from the Parliament generally but also particularly from this Government. We give this assurance: That whenever the election is between now and the end of next year, when there is a change of government, for the first time an honest, courageous, successful and determined attitude will be taken towards the whole question of tax evasion and avoidance. We will not allow ordinary wage and salary earners in Australia to continue to be ripped off in the future as they have been in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2], the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax-Vendors) Bill, the Taxation ( Unpaid Company Tax-Promoters) Bill, the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) ( Consequential Amendments) Bill and the Income Tax Assessment Amendment ( Additional Tax) Bill. I say that after having given a great deal of thought to the legislation, as I know that so many members on the Government side have done . I record my appreciation to those who have led the concern that has been expressed about the legislation since the beginning of this Budget session. That concern has caused the Government to continue to re-examine the provisions of the legislation, not only in the preliminary drafting stage but also since the legislation was originally introduced into the House and since its reintroduction after its withdrawal. I believe that the reconsideration has resulted in much better legislation which will do what it seeks to do, to recoup unpaid company tax from those who benefited from a totally artificial and illegal scheme designed to evade that company tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret that I will not be able to support the amendment which will be moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury). I have considered it closely but in conscience cannot support it. This gives me cause for concern because I have a great respect for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and for many of those who will support his amendment. My early reaction was that if I am in disagreement with my valued colleagues, my reasoning is probably faulty. That is why I have looked closely at the amendment to see whether I could support it. My difficulty is that I believe it is the duty of the Government to ensure that the taxation in question is paid. Very few argue about that now. What is sought to be recovered by the legislation is the benefit, the unpaid tax, that the vendor-shareholder received by way of premium on the sale of shares in a company which was bottomed, nothing else. The vendor-shareholder has been effectively holding the tax, albeit in the guise of a premium. This legislation will require him to pay it, to hand it over. He does not lose something that was rightfully his, even if he thought it was. He will not be poorer in terms of what his position may have been before he sold his shares. He will lose a windfall that came to him as a result of the way in which he sold the shares. In this context there is no question of fairness; there is no question of innocence or guilt. There is simply the recovery from vendor-shareholders of money which they received from promoters in a way that was fraudulent on the promoter's part. In a sense the promoter did not give the vendor-shareholders good title to the money. Because the tax is illegally evaded it must be recovered even though it is in the hands of people who may not have acted fraudulently or illegally. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret the necessity for this legislation but I acknowledge that it has been made necessary only by the devious schemings of promoters who are prepared to go to any lengths to create artificial devices that will enable people to evade their legitimate taxation obligations. Such actions must be countered with legislation of this kind. In a sense the Government must fight fire with fire to protect the common good. A year or two ago we passed interpretation legislation in this Parliament which was designed to guide the courts towards giving consideration to the clear intent of legislation when it went through the Parliament rather than the strict letter of the legislation. That legislation should significantly reduce loophole arguments and decisions. Clear sidestepping in an illegal way of the intent of the law by the promoters led to the bottom-of -the-harbour concept and led in turn to this legislation. This legislation will restore the intent of the law. I regret that it has been necessary to deny the benefit to which vendor shareholders thought they were entitled, but the action of the promoters has left the Government with no choice. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to be able to acknowledge that these practices have been stopped. The legislation that was introduced by the Government at the end of 1980 has ensured that no more activity of this kind is being undertaken by promoters and that companies are not being handled in the way they were. The problem which has been left for the Government to deal with is the problem of outstanding assessments and the recovery of tax that was assessed and was legally payable by companies which promoters sent to the bottom of the harbour. Essentially, the arguments about this legislation reduce to arguments which deal with the conflict between two principles. In the final analysis, we have to determine whether retrospectivity is a better principle than fairness and equity or whether the reverse is the case. My examination of the issue has led me to come down in favour of the principle of fairness and equity as opposed to the arguments that have been advanced about retrospectivity and other arguments which have been put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt about the power of this Parliament to legislate in matters concerning taxation. Equally, there is no doubt about the powers that this Parliament has to pass retrospective legislation. In Kidman's case the High Court of Australia held that it was within the legislative competence of the Commonwealth Parliament to make provisions of the Crimes Act retrospective. That judgment has been used in other areas to enable the Parliament to legislate in a retrospective fashion. There is no doubt whatsoever that the Parliament has the power. What is interesting about this legislation and the debate which has been taking place is that there is no retrospectivity concerning the taxation liability or obligations of people who are concerned. Tax assessment and liability provisions remain exactly the same as they were. What this legislation will do in a retrospective way is remove the protection of limited liability from shareholders in proprietary companies and, as a result of having done that, make them liable only for the taxation which those companies had a responsibility to pay and which was not paid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And from which they benefited. Only in this single instance are they liable. We are doing what we are only because we have been forced to do it by the schemings of the promoters and the illegal and blatantly artificial actions that were entered into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not have a great deal of sympathy for shareholders who were involved. I think the magic trick argument that ignorance would be a valid excuse in later challenges does not really hold as much water as they believed it might. Most of the people who were involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes as so-called innocent shareholders had to remove from their company structure all the assets, liabilities, plant, shareholders' funds and all that sort of thing. They had to leave the company with nothing other than the current year's profits and the liability for the tax that was supposed to be paid on those profits. In most cases the promoters requested that the money being left in the companies be left there simply in the form of a bank cheque. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that anybody who was involved in a scheme that involved that amount of complexity, conniving and contriving, must have realised that there was a little more to it than simply a bit of legal tax avoidance. There is no doubt in my mind about people's expectations when they were told further by the promoter that they would get not only what the company was worth after the taxation liability had been taken away from the accumulated profit, but also a significant premium. It was not just the sort of premium that a promoter might have paid if he was going to put the company through some legal tax avoidance scheme or offset the profits against some losses that had been bought fairly cheaply somewhere else. I do not believe that the sort of premium that was being offered, and actually being accepted by shareholders in companies that were going to these promoters, was a reasonable expectation. People who accepted from promoters a premium equivalent to 80 per cent or 90 per cent of the tax that would otherwise have been payable, in all fairness, really deserve to have their credentials checked if they are going to argue that they are innocent, that there is no liability on them or that this legislation will treat them unfairly. Had it been a normal commercial transaction, those people would not have expected anything like the sort of premium that the promoters were paying for those profits. If the people concerned had no knowledge that the taxation that was due and payable by their company was not going to be paid and, for the most part, was going to be redirected to them in the form of a premium on the shares that they were selling, then they were ignorant or stupid, or both. </PARA>
<PARA> An argument has been put to us about the fairness. I think the fairness argument is a compelling one. Before I deal with that matter I just want to say that a few other arguments have been raised about retrospectivity. Firstly, it has been said that it creates a precedent that will enable the Australian Labor Party, should it ever achieve government, to legislate retrospectively. That has been of grave concern to this Government--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Robert Brown" NAMEID="5A5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI7">Mr LUSHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that the honourable member for Hunter says that the Labor Party will do this. That has been a matter of grave concern to this Government. We do not wish in any way to set precedents for Labor governments to take advantage of. The Australian Labor Party is not concerned about that and it will legislate retrospectively. We are acting in the way we are, only because these matters have been forced upon us. From the point of view of those people who were involved in schemes I think the only question to be asked is whether they will pay their taxation under this Government or at some later date under a Labor government, should there ever be one. The ground of precedent is not really an argument against retrospectivity. The Labor Party has made it perfectly clear that it will legislate retrospectively whether or not we have given it a precedent for doing it. That needs to be understood. A lot of waffle has been talked by people on my side of politics who believe that that is a valid argument. It is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Equally, a lot of waffle has been talked about certainty. I do not accuse the people who use that argument of being in any way ungenerous or wrong. But the fact is that they do not understand what it is about. If they looked at the situation closely they would see it as it is. Certainty about taxation remains. The Australian Labor Party is the party that offers uncertainty. It has a commitment to legislate retrospectively in terms of tax. We are only transferring the liability to pay the tax. What is important in this issue is that the liability to pay the tax is being transferred from the company which has been rendered unable to pay the tax to the people who have gained the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairness is important. Millions of taxpayers pay their tax week by week and month by month through the pay-as-you-earn system. They have no alternative but to do that. They do not have available to them options that may be open to other people in the community, whether they are among the smarties in the top income bracket or among those operating in the cash economy. The pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are paying their tax. This Government has a responsibility to those people to make sure that they do not carry any more of the burden than they ought to be carrying. Whether it is through the recovery of this tax which has been assessed but not paid, or whether it is through an attack on the injustices of the cash economy, this Government has a responsibility to the honest, genuine , fair dinkum taxpayers in Australia to recover tax and to ensure that people make their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do not accept that argument about fairness we are doing two things. Firstly, we are not only allowing those people who received a benefit to keep a benefit which really should be a benefit to the taxpaying community of Australia and to Australians as a whole, but also allowing those vendors who contrived and schemed to rip off the community to get away with it. That is one thing which I cannot tolerate. Whatever else I might be prepared to argue, discuss and be reasonable about, I am not prepared to be reasonable about those promoters. Promoters have engaged in the most scurrilous activity. They have gone against everything regarded as proper in the administration of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, although I do not necessarily agree with it, people are entitled to try to organise or arrange their affairs in such a way as to reduce their liability to pay tax. But that is not involved in this situation. What is involved in this scheme is an arrangement whereby people act totally illegally. They go out and they find men of straw-aged pensioners or people on their death beds in nursing homes-and give them $100 or a bottle of scotch and say: 'Sign this document'. As a result of having signed that document-although to them it would not make any difference-they become the owners of a company for which there are no documents and for which there is a taxation liability. I am not prepared to be a part of a government or a party that accepts that as fair and proper. </PARA>
<PARA> We have taken action in this legislation to recover the funds from those who have benefited. We have also dealt with the promoters through the Special Prosecutors legislation. I would say that such action is welcomed by 99.9999 per cent of Australians. I include in that the people who probably got involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes at the behest of promoters. They probably wish they had never done it now. They would like to see the promoters skinned also. There are not harsh enough words for those promoters. They have skinned hundreds of millions of dollars off the taxation pool that should be available for the general services of the Government in this country so that the Government does not have to take quite so much money off the taxpayers who pay their proper tax. I feel very strongly about that matter. I am very pleased that the Government has acted in the way it has. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to say very briefly that those people who are hiding behind the argument about the decisions which were taken by the High Court of Australia in Slutzkin's case in my view do not have an argument. That was a decision which dealt with the fact that if one did not know, then the procedure was going to be all right. In the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme, the principle has been transferred to a totally different scheme. I believe that although the principle may be okay, there is no argument for saying that the scheme is one which has been approved by the High Court. A lot of the argument has been centred around that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation. I have enormous respect for those who have carried the argument to the Government to ensure that the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2] is in the form that it now is. I believe it is a far better Bill. As I said earlier, I regret that I cannot agree with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and so many of our colleagues who will be supporting an amendment to the legislation. In my view and in the view of the National Party as a whole, we strongly want to support this legislation. We believe that it is in the national interest and that it must be passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2] and the associated Bills, and particularly the amendment moved so ably by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). This Government's policies in areas of taxation and corporate law can best be summed up with the simple dictum: 'Incentives for the rich to get richer are good, especially if embedded in the tax system. Welfare for the poor to get less poor is bad'. It is worse if they actually do; that destroys character. This nation has witnessed an extraordinary saga of ineptitude and inequity in our taxation system. Every week the media reveals more examples of tax avoidance and evasion. Despite utterances from honourable members opposite, the saga is not over yet. By and large, the culprits are those who can afford the advice that allows them to evade or avoid perhaps all of their tax. One witnesses the sad spectacle of two of our leading professional groups-lawyers and accountants-being dragged into tax schemes that everybody knows are blatant, artificial and contrived.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At whose expense do the better off sectors of our society score because of the exploitation of the appalling gaps in our law? Only now are Australians, perhaps feeling the economic pinch as never before, getting a glimmer of the depth of corruption and amorality reached by some of the wealthier members of society. Wage and salary earners and small businessmen and women pay their income tax to provide the social benefits that revenue pays for. For years their income tax load has escalated. They may have raised families, built homes and businesses, run farms, yet still they have paid their allotted tax. Now they discover that many companies and wealthy members of society do not contribute any tax at all in many cases. To these people tax has become optional. Persistent is the carping phrase that very little of what has been done over the years was actually illegal. Some sections of our professional people argue that they should not make moral judgments about what they or their clients do, that they should be able to turn a blind eye. How many groups in history have used that sort of reasoning to try to escape moral blame?</PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable members opposite try to excuse the actions of avoiders and their advisers. They claim that, because when vendors sell companies the companies owe no tax at that time, the vendors are blameless. They cannot plead ignorance of corporate accounting practice. Is it that they cannot differentiate between the wet and dry Slutzkins? Let us take the dry Slutzkin. It occurs where companies are stripped of accumulated profits after primary company tax has been paid. In receiving the proceeds of sale in the form of capital what was avoided was the secondary tax that would have been payable by the shareholders if the accumulated profits had been distributed by way of dividends. The disposal of a company in this manner was held to be effective by the High Court of Australia, and such cases are not covered by the legislation. Yet anyone knows that the vendors either knew or ought to have known that the tax was being avoided and that they were profiting by such avoidance. In contrast, cases popularly known as wet Slutzkins involve the stripping of profits before the primary tax liability has been net. After the profits have been stripped the company records are disposed of. In these cases there is a clear and undisputed liability for payment of tax on untaxed profits of the company at the time of the strip. The liability still exists but cannot be collected as the companies have been stripped of their assets and dumped. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation seeks to recover tax from vendor-shareholders on the basis that , considered in the light of the amount received for their shares, they should have been aware that the tax would not be paid by the company. They ought to have known that most people sold their companies just before the end of the financial year deliberately to avoid paying company or other taxes. Certainly many of the companies did not actually owe taxes at the time of the sale, but everyone knew, especially the vendor shareholders, that liability for the current year was soon to be assessed and that, morally or in equity, the company did owe taxes when it was sold. Of course the vendors knew that they were avoiding taxes. Did they think they got high prices for their shares simply because they had struck a good bargain or because the purchasers were stupid? Were the vendors so ignorant of tax and commercial matters that they did not know these things? Of course not. It is utter nonsense to claim otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> The wet Slutzkins are morally worse than the dry Slutzkins but they are both avoidance tactics. Both are shonky and contrived. No one is fooled by the blustering and humbug of interested pressure groups. Their attention is better directed to making sure that this tax fiasco never happens again. I do not intend to talk about the part that the High Court has played in this fiasco. One can say this though: The members of the Court have endorsed the decisions in cases such as Europa Oil No. 2, Cridland, Curran, Slutzkin, Isherwood and Dreyfus, Westraders and Commonwealth Aluminium and they have much to answer for. They should have known what their reasoning would lead to. They should have known better than to encourage artifical schemes of tax avoidance. No other court in the common law world would have entertained for so long this sort of nonsense and artificially that our top court did. One can hope only that recent cases show a permanent change in the High Court's attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislature for years has made its intentions plain enough. Judicial sabotage has gone on for far too long. It is time our leading professionals showed some leadership. Society expects them to act as professionals and not as greedy amateurs. The efforts of the Ethics Committee of the Victorian Bar and the Australian Society of Accountants to do something about it are long overdue. The Accountants Society proposes to introduce regulations to prohibit members from engaging in or promoting artificial tax practices and charging fees based on the amount of tax avoided. That sort of action is at least a step in the right direction. One hopes that it will go further. How much more should we know and will perhaps never know because the witchcraft of accounting and legal jargon deprives society of the information? The battle is only starting. Our common aim ought to be to make sure that the tax system is fair and enforceable. We owe a debt of gratitude to McCabe and Lafranchi and the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union for their honesty, integrity and leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to another culprit in all of this. Nobody has touched on this yet, and I want to devote my remaining time to it. Australian company law provides relatively little protection to small shareholders or small trade creditors. Similarly, the administrative and judicial machinery for enforcing such laws is complex, cumbersome and unsuitable to the effective combating of corporate malpractice and crime. Regrettably, the existing so-called national company laws provide a breeding ground for the spiv, the charlatan and the corporate crook. They were eliminated in Europe a decade ago. It is a scandal that the so-called lawmakers of this country perpetuate ineffective law. What the Costigan Royal Commission has done is to underline the link between organised and corporate crime. There is no longer a clear distinction between Mafia-type drug rings populated with foreign names and shyster company behaviour. Costigan revealed how big crime touches diverse sections of the community. Blue collar thuggery is married to white collar crime by seemingly respectable celebrants. That investigation has uncovered serious breaches of integrity and gross incompetence at the very centre of law enforcement and the judicial system. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many abuses in relation to company affairs. Nobody can any longer deny that. For example, the sale of many companies through the so-called wet Slutzkin schemes was helped by the easy creation, manipulation and destruction of straw companies. It is a very simple process under present law to establish such a company. All one needs are two shareholders prepared to put forward sufficient capital, namely, $2, sign certain papers which have usually been prepared well in advance and are sitting on the shelf in the office of a shonky accountant or solicitor, pay the registration and stamp duties and presto, one has a limited liability company. In the wet Slutzkin situation, companies were established with false directors or fictitious persons; there was no ability on the part of the corporate affairs commissions to check out the details of the companies. Certainly there was no capital backing. </PARA>
<PARA> This practice has been exacerbated by the failure of the Government to close effectively tax avoidance loopholes which have existed for years. The ease with which trusts can be set up using $2 nominee, sometimes straw, companies for the purposes of reducing tax has been brought to the attention of governments time after time. We have failed to provide better protection for prospective shareholders from the offering and transfer of shares by unscrupulous manipulators. Having become shareholders, they are subject to other abuses and mismanagement by the controllers of companies. Under present laws, shareholders have no effective say in the way their money is used and have, in effect, no control over directors. Company meetings are an empty charade. Such provisions as the present law makes for the expression of shareholders' opinions are inadequate and easily by-passed. </PARA>
<PARA> These laws cannot be taken seriously when compared with laws being applied throughout most European and Scandinavian countries. I was delighted to see the former Minister in the House yesterday talking about the need to do something about proprietary companies. It is a pity that he did not say that during the debates that took place 18 months ago. If one contrasts the laws with the laws in New Zealand one finds that they are a joke. If one contrasts them with the laws in Europe one finds that they are laughable. In Europe or Scandinavia it is impossible to register and operate a limited liability company with a share paid up capital of $2. Much larger sums have to be lodged and therefore there is a much greater risk by shareholders. In Great Britain a public limited liability company must have an issued paid up share capital of at least 50,000 pounds whereas in Australia such a company can lawfully have an issued share capital of 5c. Because of the larger sums injected into European companies creditors at least have some safeguards. In Australia the absence of a significant minimum share capital requirement for limited liability companies means that there is no disincentive to the use of such companies on a massive scale for tax avoidance or other nefarious purposes. The Government knew that at least 10 years ago. In Australia the winners are the accountants, the lawyers and the sharp operators. The losers are the creditors of the alarming number of such companies that become insolvent every year and the taxpayers at large. Any government which is serious about the fairness and efficacy of a tax system must look further than the tax laws for the reasons for Australia's massive tax evasion and avoidance schemes. The parlous state of our company law is inextricably linked with the tax problem, and the Government has failed to grapple with it. </PARA>
<PARA> A minimum share paid up capital requirement would not be an answer in itself. It would have to be supported with shares issued for non-cash considerations, transactions between companies and their directors or shareholders, discount share issues, and the payment of dividends. Here again reform is needed to protect both the creditor and the public. If the business community knew enough about reforms it would recognise their merit and at least support them. Instead, in deliberate ignorance we leave unchanged our very imperfect system to the detriment of our business community, investors, shareholders and the public. Our blindness to the abuses of corporate law and our unintelligent approach to even the most cautious reform have branded Australia as the dunce of corporate law. This is not a matter for party politics or vested interest groups. The issues are too important for that. Our company law is riddled with deficiencies. These can be remedied only by a federal companies Act and not the charade of national legislation we have today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I would say it to Mr Walker. Thus, for example, what Queensland wants Australia gets. It is a national tragedy that we have the lowest common denominator approach to corporate law. We have company laws with no single government bearing political responsibility for them. In future changes to the laws may be made by a mere majority vote of the Ministerial Council. But it is still likely to be a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Solutions will continue to be compromise solutions. The result-company law broth-will be both weak and insipid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two current difficulties with law enforcement. The first concerns the ability of the National Companies and Securities Commission and the State corporate affairs commissions promptly to investigate breaches and, where warranted, launch prosecutions. The second is obviously the inability of courts in this country to handle complex corporate matters. Just as the Australian Taxation Office appears to be both understaffed and lacking sufficient highly trained officers to carry out the necessary investigative and prosecution work, there is considerable evidence that the NCSC and its State delegates are likewise hampered. It is an appalling indictment of this Government's priorities . If we are to take the regulation of corporate crime seriously we ought to be prepared to pay for it. There is a substantial link between the proper regulation of companies and tax avoidance. Thus the return to the public from its investment in resources in the corporate area would at least be cost- effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Company and commercial matters are often beyond the understanding of the common jury. It may be that the expediency adopted in the Bankruptcy Act of making all offences triable summarily unless the court itself commits for trial by jury ought at least to be considered. Under the Bankruptcy Act summary trial leads to a lesser penalty than may be imposed on conviction or indictment, but certainty of conviction is certainly a great deterrent. It is high time also that the superior court provided a permanent commercial division for the rapid untangling of corporate problems and corporate misfeasance. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Government that if we as legislators fail-as we certainly have-to give the community the laws it deserves, the laws it needs, but above all the laws it ought to respect, the backlash by the people in this country will be predictable and inevitable. Public cynicism at the genuineness of concern by governments for fair and efficient business dealings will inevitably increase. As the current atmosphere surrounding tax avoidance clearly indicates, sooner or later the chickens will come home to roost. We ought to remember that-each and every one of us. When the law is allowed to be disregarded and brought into contempt public acceptance of the legitimacy of the entire authority of the state is jeopardised. For five years the Government has brought the tax laws and the corporate laws in this country into contempt. When that happens the Government has a real problem. </PARA>

They are the cornerstone for the spiv, the charlatan and the corporate crook. That has been proved beyond any doubt. This Government has been warned by the revelations of the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. That has been compounded by a long litany of revelation of corruption, collusion and malpractices in a whole range of critical areas that have seriously damaged the credibility of this Government, the judiciary, the corporate and some professional bodies. If we are to sweep away this appalling legacy and clean it up there must be major surgery and reform in these areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The five taxation Bills before the House at the moment could well be described as the most effective and certainly the most important legislation presented to and passed by this Parliament since the election of this Government to office in 1975. I say the most important legislation not because I regard other legislation in a lesser way but rather because this legislation, above all, will put to rest tax evasion and the tax avoidance industry. Those few Australian people and organisations which have conducted campaigns against the introduction of this legislation have endeavoured to promote uncertainty amongst the many genuine taxpayers who have been contributing their tax in a lawful manner. By their action they endeavour to give their campaigns a degree of credibility that they do not deserve; they tend to hide their blatant schemes amongst other legal arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak as a member of this Parliament who, over the last few months, has received 70 or 80 letters from different people. They are conducting a most professional campaign; a campaign which, when one analyses those letters, has obviously been organised by people who have a strong vested interest in the matter. The effects of the legislation that we are now considering can be stated simply. This legislation is designed to collect tax legally due from a company which has been rendered unable to pay its assessed commitments because its assets have been stripped in a most artificial manner. This legislation seeks payment from those who have unfairly gained from a contrived situation. I refer to vendor-shareholders and the promoters of the schemes. This legislation is not the result of a government's greed for revenue, as suggested by some, but rather a strong and continuing desire to ensure fairness to all sections of our Australian community. It is our responsibility to shoulder the taxation burden in an acceptable ratio to our reward for effort and initiative. It would therefore follow that additional revenues now collectable as a result of this legislation will enable a future reduction in other federal revenue raising matters imposed on the Australian people. In other words, those who may have been disadvantaged through their honesty and a sense of community responsibility will be relieved of this unfair burden. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at tax collection statistics we will see that they clearly show the growing burden that has been placed on those persons who have their tax deducted from their wages and salaries. I refer to pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. This can be seen particularly when one compares such collections with tax collected from companies. If one looks at a 12-year comparison-1970-82-in the statistics provided in the Budget Papers one will find that revenue from companies expressed as a percentage of pay-as-you-earn tax has declined from 55 per cent in 1970 to 29 per cent in 1982. To highlight another statistical comparison, I express as a percentage of total Budget revenue collections the statistics of company tax collections. In 1970 company tax collections, as a percentage of total Budget revenue, represented 17 per cent, yet in 1982 the figure had fallen to 13 per cent. It is clear that both of these comparisons show the declining value of company tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that by making these statements I may offend many people operating companies which fairly meet their company tax obligations. Obviously the decline in these company tax collections results from a minority of company people practising tax evasion on a large scale. I apologise to honest operators of companies which have fairly contributed tax over the years. If we study the statistics relating to pay-as-you-earn tax collections-they appear in the same Budget Papers I mentioned earlier-no decline emerges. In fact the trend is reversed. In 1970 PAYE collections provided 32 per cent of total revenue; yet in 1982-12 years later-they provide 46 per cent of total revenue collections. Surely this is a trend that is very unwelcome to wage and salary earners. It is a trend that is unfair to the community and it is a trend that will not be tolerated by this Government. That is the reason why we have this legislation before the Parliament at the moment. It is not surprising that community reaction against such practices has been growing. Rectification of the anomoly is very much justified. To allow such a situation to continue would eventually place the Australian democratic system in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I should say in passing how disappointed I am that a small number of my parliamentary colleagues have apparently seen fit to indicate their opposition to this legislation. Although I have some understanding of their reasoning, based on their principles, and in particular their objection to retrospective legislation, I feel that in these circumstances the actions by a minority group have been so damaging to fellow citizens and our country that I have no hesitation in forgoing my dislike for retrospective laws in supporting this legislation. What has been done is not legal. People just distance themselves from action under the law. These actions and schemes have been far from the spirit of the tax legislation and normally accepted taxation practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Those participating in the schemes must have always realised the risks involved . Perhaps some thought it was Christmas and they deserved a present. In my past occupation as an accountant I could only liken these schemes to fantasy and fairy tales. Perhaps the only other words that one could use to describe them are completely unrealistic. In reviewing the legislation, which is obviously quite comprehensive-some 40-odd pages supported by two sections of explanatory notes-could I first clearly restate that it is designed to collect unpaid tax legally assessed. It does not, as some would want us to believe, attempt to illegalise retrospectively that which is legally allowable; nor does it interfere with that which is legally disputed. Such disputes are for the courts and the taxation boards of review to determine. The legislation provides for payment of tax by vendor-shareholders as well as the architects who organised arrangements whereby companies are unable to meet their tax payments, the people described in the legislation as promoters. These people have benefited at the community's expense and they now have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major point of importance addressed in this legislation is the 12 months period allowed to pay. Although I have no sympathy for those who have benefited from payment not made, it must be realised that the money is not lying around in someone's bank account just waiting to be paid to the Commissioner of Taxation but may be in some form of investment providing goods and services to the Australian people and possibly providing employment for many Australians. Under these circumstances a reasonable time should be provided so as to create circumstances least liable to disrupt. I am pleased that the 12-month period to pay has been allowed in this legislation. I know that many other honourable members tonight wish to express their opinions on these five Bills, but before I cease this speech I wish to congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Howard). There has been tremendous pressure in the build-up to this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation is not only far too little-it is far too late. It catches some of the cheats, but it protects a lot more and allows them off scot-free. The Government has deliberately narrowed its scope to apply only to schemes where company tax, or undistributed profits tax, was payable and an illegal evasion of tax took place. Tax avoidance-however blatant and contrived, however much it has cost ordinary taxpayers-is exempted from this legislation. This shows how hollow has been the political posturing on this issue by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He has been forced to do just enough to try to satisfy outraged public opinion-but nowhere near enough to catch all those hundreds of Liberal Party supporters who have been ripping off the tax system ever since this Government came to office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For most of the last 18 months the Prime Minister has been insisting that there is no difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Suddenly, now, the Prime Minister discovers there is a difference, and a big difference. His professed moral outrage is replaced by a mealy-mouthed rationalisation why this Government will do nothing to bring to account a lot of wealthy Liberal Party supporters who have been into the lucrative business of tax avoidance for years. So the tax avoiders are to be allowed to go on bludging off the rest of the community. This legislation does nothing to stop them, and it does nothing to recover the thousands of millions of dollars lost in tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's extraordinary political expediency on this issue is perfectly demonstrated in the Government's insistence on catching only situations where illegal evasion was involved. That is the Government's argument today. Yet for months, if not years, senior Ministers have been arguing that the Government's hands were tied in taking action against bottom-of-the-harbour schemes because the existing law did not make them illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the Treasurer cannot have it both ways. If the schemes were legal at the time, why is the Government now going to such lengths to distinguish them as different from other legal tax avoidance rorts? If they were illegal, why did the Government not do something about them for almost five years? If they were illegal, they could have been illegal only because they transgressed existing law. Why the massive delay? If we ask the Prime Minister for an explanation, we get a rambling, meaningless diatribe that simply ignores the question. The Prime Minister does not want to know about the relationship between tax evasion and tax avoidance, and he will say just about anything, however incoherent, to try to fudge the issue. But the fact remains that a lot of people, a lot of wealthy Liberal Party supporters, who should be caught by this legislation and forced to pay the millions in tax they have avoided for years, are going to get away without paying a cent. This Government, and this bowdlerised legislation, is going to protect them. </PARA>
<PARA> How tax evasion and avoidance have grown under the Fraser Government. The third interim report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union late last year on tax avoidance and evasion said:</PARA>
<PARA> This industry has developed in Australia, particularly over the last 5 years, at a rate far in excess of any other industry and has brought with it profits comparable only to the heady days of the Victorian gold rush . . . the impact on the community has been very serious. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner of Taxation's annual reports between 1975-76 and 1980-81 reveal a 2,500 per cent increase in the number of identified participants in tax avoidance schemes. Australian companies are avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars a year through use of tax havens due to the Treasurer's abandonment of a foreign tax credits scheme. The Opposition, without any apology at all, proposes to take this issue up in greater depth a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association estimates that $7,000m for annual losses in tax revenue are due to avoidance and evasion. In very simple terms that means that the average Australian household has to pay over $ 35 a week extra tax to subsidise the tax cheats. As Professor Mathews said in 1980:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . personal income tax is a voluntary tax for the rich non-salary earner. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of achievement of the Fraser Government. The wealthy decide as an option whether they will pay their taxes while those less well off, the middle income earners, the modest income earners, have no choice at all. More than that, they have to bear an unfairly high tax burden to subsidise the tax parasites who have been evading and avoiding in this one persistent growth industry under the Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of Government inaction has caused a massive shortfall in tax revenue. The Government has sought to make good those losses, not by making sure the tax cheats pay up, but by hitting low and middle income wage and salary earners. The Government just is not fair dinkum in its fight against tax avoidance and evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Bluntly, the Government has failed. It has failed to commit itself to fully retrospective legislation against blatant avoidance schemes back to the time they were first used. It has failed to launch prosecutions under the new general anti-avoidance legislation-Part IVA-or under the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. Neither of these weapons has been tested although available for eighteen months or more. It has failed to take action to recover tax avoided under bottom-of-the -harbour schemes until shamed into doing so by the disclosures of the McCabe- Lafranchi report, which the Treasurer initially sought to deride as a stunt. Some stunt! It has forced the Government to retrace its steps and to introduce this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the dimensions of the actual loss in tax revenue that has taken place, perhaps the worst aspect of this whole affair has been this Government's procrastination against closing off the so-called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Let me remind the House that sections of the Australian Taxation Office, and the Attorney-General's Department have known about these schemes for nine years. In 1975 the first prosecution was about to be launched in Perth-a prosecution which would have closed off this licence to make money for a lot of greedy and unscrupulous people and saved literally thousands of millions of dollars in tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> But then this Government came into office and, quite mysteriously, the file on the prosecution itself went not to the bottom of the harbour, but to the bottom drawer for the next six years. The Treasurer, by his own admission, has known about these schemes since February 1978. Almost five years ago the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr O'Reilly, told him. He not only told him; he also warned him that there was a need to make directors and shareholders personally liable for a company's tax on current year profits after they had been stripped and the records sent to the bottom of the harbour. The Treasurer should have-he certainly could have-there and then declared that remedial legislation to stop this scheme would be enacted and, further, would apply from the date of announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> Commissioner O'Reilly urged the Treasurer on 11 November of that year-that is 1978-to adopt a general principle of this nature. The Treasurer did so a week later, but it was never applied to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. That is incomprehensible in view of the evidence presented to the Treasurer by the Commissioner of Taxation. Earlier, in May 1978, Commissioner O'Reilly recommended that a new criminal offence should be created to catch those involved in current year profit strips. Then began an extraordinary period of backing and filling between the Treasurer, the Australian Taxation Office and the Attorney-General's Department. It went on for 2 1/2 years before finally the Government enacted its Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act in December 1980. Throughout this period nothing was done, except that letters got written, interminable meetings were held, people pondered, papers were shuffled, delays occurred and the responsibility was passed backwards and forwards. Tens of millions of dollars went on draining away in the hands of the greedy evaders and avoiders who were milking the tax system at a furious rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, after the new legislation was enacted in 1980, still nothing was done to catch anyone or to recover any of the lost tax for another two and a half years. Now that I find intolerable and inexcusable. Nothing was done until Mr Costigan turned up with his now notorious report just 3 months ago and touched off the panic in the Prime Minister's office that has now produced this latest Bill. At last something is being done, but only after seven years. We still do not have a single Minister who will accept any responsibility for the appalling delay which has gone on for so long and which probably would have continued until the Labor government was returned to office if it had not been for the diligence of Mr Costigan. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some examples of where the Government has deliberately allowed tax avoiders to escape. We have all heard the Prime Minister defend tax avoiders who have cost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars through straightforward uncomplicated dry Slutzkin schemes. In addition, many dry Slutzkins were part of the same transactions as wet Slutzkins. If honourable members require elucidation on dry and wet Slutzkins, I suggest that they should have listened to my colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) who dealt with this in considerable informed detail earlier. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may well be true. The Treasurer was generous enough to say that the speech of the honourable member for Hawker was more informed and interesting than mine, and I freely acknowledge it. That would still allow my speech to be well ahead of the Treasurer's. This second type of dry Slutzkin has cost about half as much again as was lost due to current year profit strips; that is about $300m. In total, losses due to dry Slutzkins were about $600m. The Government has no plans to recover that money or any other part of the $3 billion lost under the schemes that had subsequently been outlawed. What is the distinction? In the past the Treasurer has made none. Nor has the Treasurer sought to distinguish between types of schemes when resorting to his harsh rhetoric against tax dodgers. About the part IVA amending legislation in May 1981 he said :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect of this further legislation (i.e. a penalty tax of 200%) is that the persons who stand to profit most by company stripping activities-the vendor shareholders-also stand to pay heavily for any involvement in such activities. </PARA>
<PARA>He added:</PARA>
<PARA> That proposition applies both to bottom of the harbour strips and strips of tax company profits. </PARA>
<PARA>He puts them on an equal footing. He does not distinguish. He condemns both of them as being equally improper and equally inexcusable but in this legislation he acts against one only. Nor was Commissioner Costigan in any doubt about the qualitative equivalence of the two types of schemes. In Costigan's fourth interim report, volume 1, he describes the scheme to which chapter 3 'Fraud on the Commonwealth Revenue' is directed. On pages 72 to 73, Costigan describes the implementation of the scheme. In sub-paragraph (c) it is clear that Costigan does not distinguish qualitatively between current year profit and accumulated profit schemes. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> The assets and liabilities of the target company were then transferred to the new corporate entity, leaving at the end of the day, a target company with only cash in the bank. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> The amount of cash in the bank was equal to the accumulated profits, plus the current year profits (if any). </PARA>
<PARA> The cash in the bank reflected that equation, and it was on that amount that the percentage constituting the promoter's commission was calculated. </PARA>
<PARA> The total amount of cash in the bank was the money that was then used to finance the purchase of the shares. </PARA>
<PARA>The point, however, is that he does not make any distinction. He refers to accumulated profit schemes and those schemes which have additional current year profits, if any. He makes no distinction. He puts on equal footing the accumulated profits or dormant company schemes which are resorted to as part of tax avoidance and which until recently were excoriated by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. What happened in the interim? They discovered that senior officials of the Liberal Party and prominent establishment figures from the corporate sector who they had favoured with appointments had been involved in these sorts of schemes; so they immediately established a distinction to save those people from embarrassment and themselves from shame. But those tax bludgers have ripped off millions of dollars, they have become greedy and unscrupulous millionaires at the expense of the rest of the community. McCabe and Lafranchi had no doubt about this either. Only the Government makes this false distinction. The reason is simple. Wet Slutzkins were usually operated by the new rich who made quick killings-the sort of person the Prime Minister would blackball from his Melbourne club. Dry Slutzkins, on the other hand, involve pillars of the establishment-old money-and are therefore untouchable. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most important change between this version of the Bill and the withdrawn Bill is the insertion of a completely new clause 3 (12). This provision waters down an already limp wristed Bill to such an extent that at least one in four of affected companies will now be exempted from liability for recoupment tax that they would have paid under the first draft of the Bill. This amendment, which we should call the Baume amendment after the honourable member for Macarthur, means that where a company, after being stripped of its assets, entered into a post-sale tax avoidance scheme to reduce or eliminate tax liability, it has now been exempted. This provision is crippling for the legislation. Many promoters, after stripping the company and paying the vendor shareholders, entered into a variety of tax avoidance schemes to eliminate the tax liability-for example, Curran schemes, pre-paid interest schemes or complex differential interest rate schemes. In these cases the vendor shareholders will escape scot-free even though they got an unrealistic and inflated price for their shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major problem with the Bill is its great complexity. The Government has been so concerned to narrow its scope, to write in exemptions, and to soften its effects that any half-way decent lawyer should be able to ensure that his clients either pay no tax under the Bill or at least do not pay tax for many years. My attention has been drawn to a number of what might seem to be technical problems with the Bill. If these problems are real, the chances of the Government recovering much money quickly seems small. Some important examples include clause 3 (2), which excludes as directors persons acting:</PARA>
<PARA> In the proper performance of the functions attaching to his professional capacity or to his business relationships with the directors. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of this is that the mastermind behind the schemes may be able to get off the hook. Clause 3 (11) protects taxpayers from paying an additional back tax in respect of the tax avoided. This means that the vendor-shareholders will have the use of all this unpaid tax for years to invest and on which they can make a profit. Vendor-shareholders should at least have to pay as a penalty a reasonable interest on the unpaid tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 (8) may seem to be no more than a technical provision for the service of notices. Its effect, however, is that the promoter who skips the country will be able to evade service of assessment notices and will therefore be able to evade his liability, despite the fact that he may have assets back in Australia more than sufficient to pay the tax. Already one promoter has disappeared overseas, and although the Government is more than willing to refuse passports to those it persecutes under social security legislation, it will not do the same to tax avoiders. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 (1) (j) is a most unusual test. Any imaginative promoter should be able to pump out of his word processor structured evidence to prove that the business was in fact carried on after the last sale. Clause 5 (1) (m), when read carefully, has the effect of giving the vendor-shareholder a tax deduction for the fee he paid the promoter-that is, the taxpayer is subsidising criminals. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 (1) (g) and clause 5 (2) (g) have the effect that when a company was stripped and at the same time, or just before the strip, the company entered into a tax avoidance scheme, the vendor-shareholders could argue that at the time the company was sold the company did not have a liability to unpaid tax- another loophole. Again the imaginative evader can get to work to fake the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 21, of course, is an outrage. Pay-as-you-earn taxpayers have been bearing the burden of these rich speculator tax evaders for years, but when PAYE earners come to pay their tax they do not get any time to pay. What is so special about taxpayers under this Bill is that they get a 12-months instalment plan, and interest free. It sounds more like an advertisement for a shady finance company than a serious tax Bill-an entirely appropriate metaphor for this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is better than nothing-but only just. It is a typical product of this Prime Minister. He has trumpeted about what tough action he is going to take, but his mates in the Melbourne Club and in the Western Districts have given him his orders: 'Do as little as you can to save your political skin. Make sure it is full of loopholes and so complicated that, at the best, it will be years before any of these rich parasites on society have to take the unprecedented step of actually paying what they owe in taxes.' I serve warning on all the millionaire speculators who believe they have a divine right to rip off ordinary decent Australians. After the next election we will get it back, we will get it all back, and we will get it back quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of my colleagues also wish to speak in this debate, which is being conducted within a limited time, so I will attempt to state my position as briefly as possible and hope that I will be able to make some further detailed comments tomorrow in the Committee stage of the consideration of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill (No. 2). I oppose the Bill. My opposition is based on a fundamental belief in the rule of law, a concept already introduced into this debate by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury). One need not be a lawyer or resort to detailed and complex jurisprudence texts to understand what is meant by the rule of law and to appreciate its vital importance to our society. I believe the rule of law is well understood by all who value the concepts of freedom, liberty, justice, fairness, impartiality, regularity and certainty. These concepts are relevant to the legal ordering of our relations between one another as citizens equal under the law, and they are certainly central to the governing of the relations between the individual and the state. The rule of law is built on and embodies these concepts, underpinning the very foundation of our society. The rule of law safeguards freedom and liberty whereby a citizen is free to do as he pleases so far as he is not prevented by the force of law. It is the rule of law which demands, where freedom and liberty are so limited by law, that the law be administered in accordance with the precepts of natural justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under this legislation the clock will be turned backwards to make taxable today what yesterday, in the hands of the vendor-shareholders, was non-taxable. Within constitutional limitations I do not challenge the power of the Parliament to make or unmake any law whatsoever, but I should have thought that the injustice to persons who are affected by retrospective laws is so obvious as not to require elaboration. Resort to retrospective law fundamentally affects our society because it is contrary to and destructive of the very basis of our system-the rule of law which I mentioned briefly. Once any form of retrospective legislation is accepted the decision as to where to draw the line is totally subjective, and through its use we move, as my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro stated, from a situation in which there is 'government under the law' to one in which there is 'government above the law'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is being argued that this overturning of the rule of law should be supported on some subjective understanding of fairness. It has been put to me that the principle of fairness should overrule the aversion to retrospective legislation on this occasion. I considered that argument, firstly by focusing on the nature of taxation under the rule of law. I think in the main it will be accepted that the taxation system is a revenue raising instrument providing for government expenditure by describing in the tax Act various classes of taxpayers, goods and categories of action which will attract a taxation liability. Predominantly, tax is neither a punishment nor a fine, and the absence of a tax is not a reward. Everybody believes that the tax Act and the taxation system should be fair. Undeniably, that is the principle upon which the provisions of the taxation legislation should be based. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious, then, that under the rule of law certainty of the tax laws is essential if the tax system is to operate fairly. Fairness must be inserted at the outset so that at any time all can know by definition or description whether they will be liable for tax. However, to assert a concept of fairness after the event which imposes a liability on people who acted in accordance with the law at the time is, in reality, not fair but extremely unfair. Let us remember that taxation is an Act of Parliament and not an act of God. Taxation liability is determined by objective criteria contained in the tax Act. If we are now to override these objective criteria by the retrospective application of a moral judgment about what is fair, the very need for the tax Act is negated. We might as well replace it with a single-section Act which could state: 'A person shall pay the amount of tax which is deemed by the Commissioner of Taxation at any time to be appropriate or fair'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also considered the argument of fairness in the light of what the vendor -shareholders actually did. Vendor-shareholders legally sold shares for a capital non-taxable sum. They were supported by the provisions of the tax act which provided that a taxpayer's taxable income is determined at the end of the year of income, meaning that there is no tax liability in respect of the current year of income at the time of the sale of the shares. Vendor-shareholders were supported by another provision which stated that the taxpayer is liable only for his or its tax which, in the case of a company, is the company's liability and not that of the shareholder. They were supported by decisions of the Full High Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of South Australia, and the apparent governmental acceptance of these decisions that shareholders who sold their shares to dividend strippers were not personally liable for income tax on the capital proceeds they received on the sale of their shares. They were supported in the belief by legal opinions that purchasers would take legal steps to reduce the companies' current year taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA> It is history now that the McCabe-Lafranchi report showed that in many cases of such sales of shares no legal steps were taken by the purchasers, and the companies were in fact sent to the bottom of the harbour, the outstanding tax liability not having been reduced or paid. It is history too that the Costigan report revealed that in 1974 the Commissioner of Taxation was advised by Mr Brinsden Q.C., as he was then, that criminal and civil proceedings could be taken against persons who had stripped a company of its assets and put it in a position of being unable to pay its tax. It is further history within the same report that in 1982 it was discovered that instructions to proceed on the matter had been sitting in a bottom drawer of the desk of an officer in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth for five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Fraudulent and illegal evasion of tax took place in the sale of share arrangements which are the subject of this legislation. Of that there is no dispute, but it was fraudulent and illegal evasion practised by the purchasers and strippers, not the vendor shareholders. Yet now, in an extremely arbitrary way, it is proposed to recover the unpaid tax from the innocent vendor shareholders. It is likely that the guilty purchasers and strippers, because they were fraudulent evaders, will have so ordered their affairs as to escape the net. If that is fair, it is beyond my understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I have examined the concept of fairness in the light of the legislation's own terms. The legislation proposed to create an artificial tax year-1 July to the date of the sale of shares-where, as I have stated earlier, a company tax liability for the current year of income did not exist at the time of sale. This destroys the limited liability protection for vendor shareholders and, in an extremely discriminatory fashion, now makes them liable for the debts of others. Against this there are numerous opinions confirming the view that existing laws are sufficient to bring to justice those persons who have committed criminal or civil offences. Fraudulent and illegal evasion of tax may be subject to recovery through sections 47 (2B), 231 and 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and sections 124, 295 (2),367B and 374D of the Companies Act. Fraudulent and illegal evasion may constitute offences under the common law provisions regarding the cheating of the Crown under section 231 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 86 of the Crimes Act and sections 124, 374C (1) and 374C (2) of the Companies Act. We are overturning law and the rule of law to create a new retrospective liability on shareholders when existing law to cover the fraudulent and illegal evasion of tax remains unused. I cannot accept that this is fair. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I do not think that the proposed law can be supported on any objective criteria. It is no comfort to argue that we are only recouping an outstanding liability. It must be recognised that the power to tax is the power to destroy. When a liability is retrospectively imposed on persons who have hitherto had no such liability there will undoubtedly be a destructive effect on innocent individuals. When that is realised retrospective regret will be useless . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government's inaction over a number of years has now resulted in a situation where large amounts of revenue have been lost to the Commonwealth. People involved in bottom-of-the-harbour tax evasion schemes now hold considerable amounts of money which rightfully belong to the Australian people. The growth of such schemes as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes has meant that while pay-as-you-earn taxpayers have been contributing a growing proportion of tax revenue, paying tax has been optional for rich property owners and the very wealthy. Under the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill (No. 2) and the other Bills which are being dealt with cognately, the Government is proposing to recover only company tax and undistributed profits tax lost through bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It is ignoring completely the income tax lost through dividend stripping and lost sales tax. Those two types of lost revenue probably account for double the amount lost through the types of schemes covered by this legislation. The Government hopes to recover about $580m. This means that it is ignoring $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. Following this Government's inaction and ineptitude between the years 1977 and 1980 and between then and the introduction of this legislation it will now forfeit about two-thirds of the tax evaded and avoided through these schemes, that is, the wet and dry Slutzkins. This legislation is a most inadequate attempt to recover vast sums of money lost on this enormous tax rip-off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The circumstances surrounding the deplorable tax avoidance and evasion mess centres, of course, on the Slutzkin case in the High Court of Australia in 1977. The occurrence of this High Court case marked the beginning of a massive surge in the growth of tax avoidance in this country which, in the words of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, rivalled the heady days of the Victorian gold rush. The High Court case dealt with what is now known as a dry Slutzkin involving a dividend stripping operation which avoided income tax for the original vendor shareholders. In the High Court case three justices presided, the Chief Justice, Garfield Barwick, and Justices Stephen and Aicken. Unanimously they decided that section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act could not be used to counter the activities occurring in the Slutzkin case. This case was one of a number in which Chief Justice Barwick had an opportunity to pursue his most peculiar view on tax avoidance which was that a taxpayer has the right to organise his affairs in such a way as to minimise his total tax bill even though the arrangement may have little or nothing to do with genuine commercial or business practices. The sole aim, of course, was to minimise tax liability. Despite the unanimity of the judges sitting on the Slutzkin case, Barwick's view on tax avoidance and the effect of section 260 of the Act, the general anti-avoidance section, was quite singular. The Privy Council has already disagreed with the Barwick view in connection with the Keighery case in 1957. In the early 1980s Justice Murphy took an opposite view in the Westraders case. Prior to this case Murphy had not sat on a major case involving tax avoidance. Decisions on tax avoidance were dominated until then by the Barwick view. The decision of Barwick gave a great comfort to the tax avoidance industry and has one of the elements leading to the vast growth in tax avoidance from about 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> The dry Slutzkin tax avoidance schemes, as we all know now, quite simply converted a dividend which was subject to income tax into a capital gain which was not subject to tax. Wet Slutzkin schemes were, I suppose, given the crooked nature of the people involved, a logical extension of the dry Slutzkin operation . These schemes not only provided this dividend stripping but also were extended to allow for evasion of company tax on current profits and Division 7 tax on accumulated profits. Vendor shareholders sold their company to a tax evasion promoter for 10 per cent to 20 per cent less than the value of the company's assets without deducting the tax liability. This 10 per cent to 20 per cent, of course, became the promoter's fee. The promoter then used procedures such as collapsable loans to enable the reduction of company assets to a level where the taxes could not be paid. Having stripped the assets of the company in this way the promoter then either sold the company to the men of straw or simply destroyed the company's papers-vis-a-vis the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes-so as to destroy the records of the company's activities. But it was the deliberate act of evading the company's tax liability that made wet Slutzkin schemes illegal-it became illegal tax evasion instead of avoidance-while the dry Slutzkin schemes were legal, according to the Barwick High Court decision and, therefore, were only tax avoidance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> These evolving company-stripping tax-evasion activities which flowed from the Barwick High Court decision were not stopped by this Government. They should have been. This flourishing of tax evasion cost Australia dearly in lost tax revenue. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) has said that he expects to recover $580m from this piece of legislation-$470 in unpaid primary tax I think and $110m in unpaid Division 7 tax. However, the total cost to Australia of bottom-of-the- harbour schemes is much greater than this. This legislation ignores the income tax lost through avoidance by vendor shareholders in both wet and dry Slutzkin schemes. In addition, it does not provide for collection of sales tax lost through the use of the straw companies. That is an outline of the development of these deplorable practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on now to examine why there was this inexcusable delay on the part of this Government. It has been clearly demonstrated that at least two avenues were open to this Government long before 1980 and long before this legislation. Firstly, Mr Costigan has pointed out in the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union that existing law was sufficient to launch charges against these people. Secondly, the Commissioner of Taxation has been warning this Government-as the record shows- for a number of years that, if existing law was not adequate, new legislation should be enacted. Going back to my first option, it is now common knowledge that the Brinsden opinion of, I think, 1976, which was mentioned in the Costigan report, outlined that either individually or collectively the company taxation Act, the Crimes Act and the Income Tax Act contained sufficient powers both to charge the perpetrators of the schemes and to recoup the finance involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Why was there a delay? According to documents tabled in this House on 22 September by the Treasurer, letters written by the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr O'Reilly, how and why legislation should have been enacted to combat these practices was outlined on no less than 30 occasions between 15 July 1977 and October 1980. Yet we have seen nothing but a litany of government incompetence, delay and deliberate obfuscation which has cost workers and tax payers billions of dollars. Statements by Taxation Commissioner O'Reilly and other members of the Australian Taxation Office demonstrate the extent of these schemes. In June 1978 the Commissioner told the Treasurer, in the documents I am referring to, that the stripping of 389 companies in three States by one promoter had cost over $9m. In October 1979 the Commissioner told the Treasurer that about 1,230 companies had been stripped by one promoter in three States involving the loss of another $21.3m. Again, in October 1980 the Commissioner told the Treasurer that a Sydney operator had stripped 733 companies involving the loss of $128m in tax. As a sort of coup de grace the Commissioner told the Treasurer that nearly $9m worth of shares had been traded by the chief straw company operator in Sydney in two days just prior to the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 coming into force. As if these amounts were not bad enough the Commissioner had pointed out on 15 November 1979:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . write offs are only the tip of the iceberg-in most straw company cases it has not been practicable to debit the tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner of Taxation was uncertain as to the total cost of all these schemes because naturally the promoters did not declare the amount of the evasion and avoidance. If the Commissioner was right about these write-offs being only the tip of the iceberg then we could expect the total loss to be ten times the amount which I have mentioned. The total cost of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes could be around $2 billion to $3 billion. Yet we are looking at picking up only something like $580m in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the Government's responsibility in the face of this massive haemorrhage of revenue? Obviously its first responsibility was to act as speedily as possible to stop the loss. It demonstrably did not do so. It could have done so under existing law, as the rebels on the opposite side of the House are so keen to point out. But it did not do that. It could have legislated in the way in which the Commissioner of Taxation pleaded with it to do but it did not do that. There were almost four years of inexcusable delay and this country lost almost $3 billion in revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to digress slightly and put this on the record: Use of the existing law could have recouped this money. If it could not, against the advice of Mr Brinsden and outlined in the Costigan report, legislation could have been enacted much earlier. The job could have been done by means of those two avenues . But, as has been pointed out by the Press scribes, there was another way in which to do this. These schemes, particularly the dry Slutzkin schemes, were effective only because of the lack of a workable, just and fair capital gains tax. If Australia had a capital gains tax, the dry Slutzkin schemes would have been negated and the illegal wet Slutzkin schemes would have been less effective than they have been as a means of avoiding tax. Where company tax was not paid, in a sense a capital gains tax would have still partly negated the wet Slutzkins . A capital gains tax would not have recouped as much tax as company tax plus income tax on distributed profits but it certainly would have been better than nothing. Of course that is what this Government got-nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> After four years this Government finally decided four weeks ago to make a virtue out of necessity. Perhaps in a hopeful early election situation the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) decided that the may as well attack some of the friends of his own party, to make an appeal over their heads directly to the electorate and to say: 'We have been caught out by the Costigan report. But now we have the Special Prosecutors Act; we will set up this National Crimes Commission and we will introduce this tough retrospective legislation to attack all these people such as Horgan and company. That shows you how fair and how fair dinkum we are'. Of course that is what he has in mind-to attack his own party and his own people and appeal over their heads to the electorate. But the electorate is going to say: 'Well, you should have done this years ago. Why was there the need for retrospective legislation when you could have used existing law or legislated years ago or implemented a capital gains tax?' Now the Government is introducing this legislation, and that is what Government rebels are bitching about. After four long weary years four weeks ago the Government brought in this legislation. Of course it suddenly became too strong for it so it had to have a significant watering down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has made five changes, some of which we support and others of which represent a significant watering down of the legislation. The Government is going to try to make the promoters liable for 20 per cent of the company tax and the undistributed profits tax which have been evaded. That is fair enough. I support that. The Government is going to give the identified vendor-shareholders one year to pay instead of 30 days. Quite frankly, I do not think they deserve that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third change is that the Government does not want to identify those who fail to pay the recoupment tax despite the fact that they have had the benefit of the money all this time. If they do not pay they are still not going to be named in the annual report of the Commission of Taxation. The fourth change is the one that I think is the most serious change. Vendor-shareholders of some 700 companies whose promoters tried but failed to avoid liable company tax via a tax avoidance scheme are now not going to be liable. That is a very serious loophole because it will let many of these vendor-shareholders off the hook simply because a promoter's own avoidance scheme has failed. The fifth change, as I understand it, is that all vendor-shareholders, where possible, instead of just one, are to be served with a company assessment notice. I think that is fair enough. I support that. I want to conclude with a quote from Kenneth Davidson writing for the Age. He discussed the John Reid case. He implemented-not a wet Slutzkin but a dry Slutzkin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the comments by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) illustrate very clearly some of the fears I have about this legislation. He talked about a capital gains tax and the implications of a capital gains tax. If we think of retrospectivity being applied to a capital gains tax we realise just how horrendous it is. It does not matter whether members of the Australian Labor Party profess it openly or covertly, they are in support of a capital gains tax. That is very clear. Secondly, even though I oppose the legislation I cannot agree with the point made by the honourable member that the legislation has been watered down. To some extent concessions have been made which I think have converted very bad legislation into just bad legislation. That is the best and most complimentary comment I can make about it .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I oppose the legislation. I oppose also the amendment moved by the Opposition to the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2]. My opposition is based on several grounds. Firstly, I find retrospective taxation in all forms absolutely abhorrent, unjust and unnecessary. Secondly, I agree with some of the comments which have been made by members on the opposite side that there has been inaction by the Government-if not by the Government, at least by the bureaucratic element of the Government. It puzzles me that people have not been taken to task for this inactivity over a long time. Thirdly, I oppose the legislation because I believe that the current law has not been adequately tested in any way. In fact, if we analyse it there has been no testing of the current law at all. Fourthly, when I made the comments on capital gains tax I pointed out quite clearly that I am worried that this will set a precedent for future legislation by either a Liberal or a Labor government. Legislation by a Labor government based on this precedent really sends shivers down my back. I am completely scared of it. </PARA>

This debate has a degree of hysteria and a degree of panic in it. Some of the accusations that are being thrown around are very unjust. It is necessary in that case to outline and justify my situation. It should not be necessary in a Parliament such as this for Opposition or Government members to attribute to honourable members improper motives for their comments or views. In 1978 I voted against a previous retrospective taxation legislation to outlaw Curran schemes. I was one of six who voted against it, so I am completely consistent. I have no truck with tax evaders at all. In fact, if honourable members check with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) they will learn that I have forwarded details of three or four schemes of evasion and avoidance to the Treasurer so that action could be taken. I support very strongly the efforts the Government has made without introducing retrospective legislation to counter tax evasion schemes. The record of the Government in this area has been quite good and I have supported it. I cannot support retrospective taxation legislation for the reasons I have given. It is unjust that we have a degree of hysteria in this debate. It should not be necessary to explain one's views or say that one is not associated with, paid by or a confederate of any tax evasion firm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some comments have unfortunately been made by both the Treasurer and to an extent by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) suggesting that the legislation is not retrospective. I cannot go along with that at all. In a report in the Australian Financial Review of 26 July 1982 the Treasurer, in referring to this legislation, is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not retrospective in that it does not create a tax liability for the first time. The liability was always there but the tax has never been paid. </PARA>
<PARA>A Press release by the Acting Attorney-General (Mr N.A. Brown) on 12 October stated that if it was retrospective it was only a teeny bit retrospective. I cannot go along with that in any way at all. I prefer to take the view expressed by a Queen's Counsel from Western Australia, Ian Temby, who was a Labor candidate in a recent by-election. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> What the Treasurer announced late last month is not legislation having retrospective effect to the date of the announcement, but rather truly ex post facto legislation: persons will become liable to pay tax on the basis of acts which when performed did not attract taxation consequences. Furthermore, and this is true however hard the press release tries to gloss over the fact, it will create a new liability. The individual shareholders were never under a possible liability in relation to the taxation obligations of limited liability companies in which they held shares. Now they are to become liable. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a new debt and a new taxation liability created where they did not exist before. In that respect the legislation is truly retrospective. I agree with Mr Temby's remarks in respect of the legislation. Let me say that when I was elected to this Parliament I supported fully the platform of the Liberal Party. Let me just quote several aspects of that platform in relation to taxation. Since we are not permitted now to have certain material incorporated in Hansard-I would have had this whole section incorporated-I just pick out several sections. The platform states:</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The rights of the taxpayer are guarded by</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> (d) ensuring that taxation adjustments do not have retrospective effects. </PARA>
<PARA>We then go on in the Liberal Party policy platform to say:</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Taxation avoidance schemes will be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Tax evasion is a crime and will not be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA>I think this very clearly shows the genuine platform of the Liberal Party in this matter. It disturbs me that people are now saying that this is a once-only effort, that we can forget our platform this time, that we can forget our philosophy this time. Let us not forget-the National Party would have done well to remember this at its recent conference-that this is not the first time we have legislated for retrospectivity. The first time was in 1978 with the Curran scheme when we legislated retrospectively in relation to taxation. So this is not a once-only thing; it is a second performance of such legislation. There is no way in which we can say that this is a once-only effect; this is the second time; we are making a habit of it. If Labor got into government, God forbid, it would make an even greater habit of it. We will be the ones to blame. We will have no justifiable philosophical opposition to the Labor Party's actions in that regard. Members of the Labor Party spelt out quite clearly not only in 1978 but also today that they will do this. We Liberals have fallen for the trap. We have made it easier for them. All our excuses cannot say otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) spoke very clearly on several aspects that I wanted to speak on including the certainty of law and the effect of retrospective legislation in that it imposes uncertainty for business planning and business investment decisions. How can anyone in an entrepreneurial or business situation be expected to anticipate the decisions of governments in, for example, 10 years' time? It is quite unreasonable. It is completely against the whole concept of our coalition parties' views on the free enterprise economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that I wanted to speak on very briefly, because we are limited in the time that we can speak, is the fact that current law has not been tested. The report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union which has been referred to tonight ad nauseam and a number of other prominent legal authorities have pointed out that the current law is adequate to meet these cases where fraud is involved. We are told by a number of Press releases that in this legislation we are dealing with fraud . I believe that the Government has not tried to use the current law in any way. The previous speaker from this side of the House, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), mentioned in detail a number of aspects of the law that could have been used but which have not been used. Basically this comes down to conspiracy, which is dealt with in the Crimes Act, provisions in the current income tax laws and the Companies Act. There has been no attempt to use that legislation in any way. If fraud is the trigger for this legislation, as the Government maintains, fraud obviously is a criminal offence and can be punished under current law. </PARA>
<PARA> Just the other day the Treasurer admitted that even for the Curran scheme retrospective legislation may not have been necessary. He pointed out that under the then existing law some of those offenders were being successfully prosecuted . If there had been more effort I am sure that more prosecutions could have been successful. I just mention as an example the Gold Coast area where some 4,000 files were recently seized under current legislation-not this legislation. There had to be justification for this action. Those files were seized under section 10 of the Crimes Act. This was done by a reference to the current law, not to retrospective law. I am sorry that this Government and the bureaucracy which it controls have not had the resolve, the energy or the drive to prosecute in these areas of fraud and criminal intent. For this reason I would have thought that one of the gravest tests that a non-socialist government would apply to legislation such as this is whether the current law was deficient. In no way have we tested and proved that the current law is deficient. That would be an absolute necessity, I feel, for an argument for retrospective tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, because the 10 minutes I have to speak is up, let me reiterate that I am opposed to the legislation; I am opposed to the amendment moved by the Opposition. I am disturbed that the Government has not acted much more strongly in the past on these actions. To that extent I can support some of the less colourful statements made by the Opposition. I feel that action should have been taken. It was necessary that the current law be tested before we even contemplated a law as repugnant as the one we are now proposing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel it appropriate in this debate on the Taxation ( Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2] and associated Bills for the House to hear now from an honourable member who will support the legislation, even though the Australian Labor Party supports it with many reservations and intends to press a number of amendments. I draw the attention of the House, particularly Government members, to a comment made by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his second reading speech. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The only tax to be recovered under the legislation is tax that was legally payable, and the payment of which has been illegally evaded. This follows from the provisions in the legislation that make recoupment tax payable only where company tax legally payable remains unpaid, former owners having had the opportunity to contest the Commissioner's contention that company tax is payable . </PARA>
<PARA>I have listened to Government speaker after Government speaker attacking the legislation. I was astounded that the last speaker, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey), said that the retrospective legislation, as he calls it, is unnecessary. On the Government's own assessment, this legislation will bring in $580m of fraudulently unpaid company tax. I think of what this money could do for Western Australia, for some of the Aboriginal fringe dwellers suffering from leprosy who I saw. I think of what this money could do for some of the schools in the Kimberleys, Broome and Turkey Creek that I visited during the parliamentary winter recess-those very depressed places in Western Australia. I think of what $580m could do to assist the lot of these Australians living in the twilight zone, these people who are very poor and very disadvantaged. I am appalled that Government members could say that the legislation is unnecessary. I feel that they are totally unable to comprehend that this money is owing. In their own Treasurer's words, the tax is legally payable at all times. The honourable member for Canning is distressed and has cold shivers about this precedent. He will not be in this House after the election. The Labor Party candidate, a very charming young women from Western Australia, will be representing that electorate. She will be a very competent member of this House.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's speech deals with the history of the tax avoidance scheme. He talks at length about the problems of whether a secretary is a shareholder in a company. I believe that the expression 'bottom-of-the-harbour' emanated from the problems in New South Wales with a certain Cabinet Minister named Arthur in the 1950s who was found to be involved with a promoter named Doyle. Doyle was promoting companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently Mr Doyle was uncovered when his share scrip was found floating in Sydney Harbour. Twenty years ago, in the early 1960s, I was working for the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor's Office in Sydney. We were trying to recover many debts for the Australian Taxation Office. I remember one case of an entrepreneur bringing second-hand aeroplanes into this country-history repeats itself-selling these aeroplanes and avoiding tax by transferring the directorships of his company to an office secretary. Vast sums of money were owing to the Commissioner of Taxation at that time, yet only now has the Commissioner, through the Treasurer, bestirred himself to act to stop this loss of revenue to the Treasury, this stealing of money owing to the nation. That is the only way it can be put. In the legislation the Treasurer has somehow tried to accommodate people such as office secretaries who find themselves running a company, but these people have to follow a rather convoluted, involved procedure. An application must be made to the Federal Court of Australia seeking a declaration that the person is not in the promoter class but is really only a simple soul who signed the documents and became a director of the company and, therefore, should not really accept any liability. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole sad saga of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes is unfolding in the House today. It has disclosed a terrible trail of sadness, misfortune and financial distress which is just starting. From personal contact I know how distressed and disillusioned are the staff in the Commonwealth Attorney-General' s Department. I know that the people in this Department who are hard-working officers were stunned by the revelations of the Costigan report. They have borne the brunt of many jokes since and they have lost heart. Their spirit has been destroyed. Basically, the reason for this loss of heart has been the policy of the Liberal-National Party Government, which has been in power in Australia since 1975, to cut the numbers in the Public Service, to emasculate the great Australian Public Service so that it cannot perform its job. This Government has been seen to be incapable of handling the situation in the case of those government departments. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Perth office there is a very serious inference that this situation was not caused just by a shortage of numbers but that there is some other explanation, of a corrupt nature or otherwise, or one involving political influence. I believe that many people will be finacially destroyed by this whole exercise. Vendors-shareholders will sue their accountants and the people who gave them advice. There will be cross-actions, court proceedings and bankruptcies. In my opinion, the whole scenario is a most distressing one which will go on for years. I believe that in the wash up, very little of this $580m the Treasurer is talking about will be recouped. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of this legislation and of this whole bottom-of-the-harbour scandal that concerns me is the failure of the Commissioner of Taxation anywhere in his many reports to Parliament year after year to refer to the problems he was having with the Perth office of the Deputy Crown Solicitor. There was $580m worth of stolen taxes involved. The brief sat in the bottom drawer of some officer in the Department for five years, but never once did the Commissioner inform Parliament. Parliament is the highest court in the land. If Parliament is not told that all is not well in the office of the Commissioner of Taxation and in the office of the Commissioner's solicitor, that is a very sad indictment of this Parliament and what we are all doing here. We are wasting our time if senior public servants, the senior men advising the Treasurer, and the Treasurer do not inform Parliament of what is happening with the collection of company tax in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation may have been exonerated by Mr Costigan but he has not been exonerated in my opinion. He has pursued and hounded small taxpayers, school teachers and people with petty claims. He has forced these people to go through extraordinary procedures to lodge appeals, and there have been years and years of delay before appeals have been heard. Yet the Commissioner of Taxation has not reported to Parliament. He did not have to give details of promoters or of people involved in tax evasion. I believe he is hiding very skimpily behind section 16, which he claims prevented him from disclosing just what was going on in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Western Australia and in regard to the evasion of company tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament would never have heard of this whole sorry saga if it were not for the Costigan report. The Costigan report was meant to tip a bucket on the Australian Labor Party. It was the bright idea of the Federal Liberal-National Party Ministry and it totally backfired. Unfortunately, the report came along at the same time as the Lafranchi report and it showed just what disarray the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth was in. The most incredible story went around the world. People could not believe what had happened in the DCS Office in Perth. After all this, I believe Parliament should be more serious in its attempts to scrutinise what is occuring in the Public Service. The fact that this matter was never revealed to this House is, I believe, shameful. I believe that all members of this House must take cognisance of the fact that the Commissioner of Taxation could go on, year in and year out, failing to tell the House of this appalling evasion and of the fact that he could get no action out of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office. The matter was allowed to float on year after year, and nothing was done about it. This is a most serious aspect of this whole sorry saga. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) talked about the rule of law, and he can be excused for getting this whole matter mixed up. The Treasurer has said that the taxes are owing and they are the only taxes that are being recovered. I put it to the honourable member for Tangney: Were these the actions of a prudent businessman or businesswoman? Were these the acts of conscientious accountants? Were they the acts of the family solicitor? Would the family solicitor advise a family with a company to destroy its documents? Is this what the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia tells its members to do-to burn the documents , to put them in the bottom-of-the-harbour, to destroy them? If that is what those people do our nation is in a very serious situation. Are these the acts of the wise, small entrepreneur, the small business people who form the backbone of our nation, the people who employ most of the labour in this country? I do not believe they are. I believe that these people are scandalised by what they read about bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and the millions of dollars that have been taken out of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> When all the inquiries are completed I am sure we will find that nearly $1,000m has been taken out of the economy. I very much regret that only a very small amount of this money which has been stolen from the taxpayers will ever be recouped. I trust that after all this the accountants will look at their ethics. Countenancing the destruction of company records is an illegal act in itself. Provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act state that records must be retained for a certain number of years. I am sure there are similar provisions in the companies Acts in all States. It is a tragic situation that accountants coldly advise clients to go along their way merrily destroying documents, destroying all tax returns and tax records, so as to take part in one of these appalling schemes of tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the matter of the recovery of $580m. I put it to the House that many of the people involved may well be dead. Many of them may well be overseas. I note that in the Bill the Government has set out all sorts of schemes for joining people and has made provision for joint and several liability. There is also a provision for time to pay. There is an incredible loophole in the whole scheme. The Treasurer has been forced by his recalcitrant back bench to introduce this notion that the recoupment legislation will not apply where there was a pre-sale avoidance scheme which, though ultimately shown to be unsuccessful, might reasonably have been expected to have worked. This is quite an incredible loophole. It will cost taxpayers millions and millions of dollars. Nevertheless the Government has the task ahead of it of recovering this money. </PARA>
<PARA> I now get to the nub of my argument on recovery. We have an assurance that the taxpayer has the right to appeal. Any honourable member who has ever been involved, or who has had a constituent who has been involved, with the appeals system at work in this nation, appeals from decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation, is in for a surprise because the system has ground to a halt. It is clogged with appeals. It now takes years and years to get an appeal dealt with in the office of the Commissioner of Taxation or a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. The number of staff in the office of the Commissioner of Taxation and all his State offices have been cut so much, particularly in the appeals sections, that it now takes up to two years to even have a file or an objection assessed. Objections, quite rightly, can be made by lodging a $2 fee. The procedure is that the objection to the assessment is heard before a board of review. The boards of review themselves are crying out in anguish; they cannot handle more appeals. They are totally overworked. No costs are awarded so it is an encouragement-and it should be-to the taxpayer to try his or her luck before the Board of Review. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the cases dealt with by the Board, as published in tax cases and all the other taxation journals in this country, deal with small claims. A lot of them seem to eminate from teachers who say that part of a room was their study. A lot of claims relate to public servants and professional people who have gone on overseas trips. A number even emanate from members of Parliament in relation to election expenses. The people-I might even say the unfortunate dupes-who have gone into bottom-of-the-harbour schemes now have to go through this procedure of appealing; else they go to a supreme court or a federal court and lodge their appeal. Of course if they are objecting to an assessment in court they lose their anonymity; their names are published, their cover is blown, unfortunately. So most of them, I should imagine, would go to a board of review. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has let the system of appeals to taxation boards of review grind to a halt. It has failed to ensure that this long established traditional system of appeals from decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation will work any longer. It just does not work. I have seen questions on notice by honourable members concerning the tragedy that is occurring before the boards of review in each State. If any taxpayer wishes to proceed with an appeal against a decision of the Commissioner of Taxation he is being denied justice. Justice must not only be done but be seen to be done. It was not done before a board of review for a very long time. The pay-as-you-earn taxpayer in particular has already paid the tax but he or she must wait possibly five years before a decision is made on that claim. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board of Review situation is one that worries me but I know that an insensitive government will do nothing about it. The policies of this Federal Government are the reasons why the Public Service, the boards of review in each State and taxation offices have come to such a sorry position. This Federal Government has cut staff ever since it came to office. It has some sort of churlish belief that public servants must work harder. My experience is that senior public servants work very hard. They earn their pay; they carry their load;. they have the responsibility and they are conscientious. One cannot run any business or undertaking, particularly something like the Australian Public Service, by cutting staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of the prosecution in Western Australia in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office, and the essence of any prosecution under any Federal or State Act, is that it must take place quickly. Many Acts of Parliament have a statute of limitation written into them. One must launch a prosecution within six months or a year. I do not believe that the prosecution in the Perth Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office could have been allowed to remain in that bottom drawer for five years. It was not just litigation dreamily moving along; it was a prosecution. The Government and Treasury had senior counsel's advice that a prosecution should be launched. I cannot understand, with my experience working in the government and in private enterprise as a solicitor, how a prosecution can drag on. Germane to the whole matter is the fact that witnesses disappear, evidence disappears and people forget. I believe that we really have not got to the bottom of this whole question of what happened in the Deputy Crown Solicitor 's Office in Perth and how this matter was allowed to run on. Much good will come out of all this. I believe that many of the schemes directed at retired people for avoiding tax to get pensions will at least fail from now on. People will be aware that avoiding tax is a very risky business; that one just cannot avoid one's responsibilities by hoping for capital gain. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Last week, the Government introduced the National Crimes Commission Bill. The Bill which I now introduce is a complementary measure directed to ensuring that royal commissions have effective powers and procedures so that they may carry out their important functions. </PARA>
<PARA> In its proposal for establishment of a National Crimes Commission, the Government of course did not have in mind doing away with royal commissions. Each type of body will have its special function and use. The primary purpose of the Crimes Commission will be to assemble the evidence for prosecutions in difficult cases of organised crimes and the like. By contrast, the basic purpose of a royal commission is to ascertain the facts as to a particular matter or matters and, where appropriate, make recommendations to Government for future action. However, as the Bill now before the House recognises, royal commissions can vary somewhat in objectives, and powers that may be appropriate for one royal commission may not be appropriate for another. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ships Painters and Dockers Union-the Costigan Commission-in its Interim Report No. 4 made recommendations for certain amendments to the Royal Commissions Act. The first was that a royal commissioner should be empowered to issue a search warrant where he believes on reasonable grounds that a person has documents relevant to the terms of reference of the Commission and there is a reasonable likelihood of the destruction of the documents. The Commission pointed out that mere service of a subpoena to produce documents will, if the person has something to conceal, result in the destruction and non-production of documents. The subpoena, the Commission said, acts as a warning to such a person of the Commission's interest . The Government broadly accepts this recommendation subject to the qualification that the warrant should be granted by an independent judicial officer. It has also concluded that the application of the provision should be limited to royal commissions whose Letters Patent indicate an intention that the provision should apply. Proposed new section 4 so provides. </PARA>
<PARA> The next recommendation of Mr Costigan was that the procedures and remedies available to a royal commission to deal with witnesses who failed to attend or answer questions should be strengthened. Existing powers and penalties were, it was said, inadequate. Reference was made to the equivalent provisions of the Victorian Evidence Act. The Government again broadly accepts this recommendation . The procedures provided under proposed new section 6C for dealing with such witnesses are broadly based on this recommendation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under this provision, a witness who fails to take an oath or answer questions may be referred to the Federal Court or the Supreme Court of a State or territory. That court may order the person to comply with the relevant requirement. Failure to comply would be punishable as contempt of court. However , these provisions will be limited to royal commissions with Letters Patent indicating that intention. In further consultations with Mr Costigan the need emerged to put beyond doubt the power of the Commission to communicate information and documents to a Special Prosecutor, the National Crimes Commission or Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, State or Northern Territory and law enforcement bodies generally. This doubt is removed by proposed new section 6P.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1912, section 6DD of the Act has rendered statements or disclosures by a witness before a royal Commission inadmissible in evidence against him in any criminal or civil proceedings in any court except proceedings for an offence against the Act. Because of the existence of this section, it was the view for many years that, on the proper construction of the Act, self-incrimination was not a lawful excuse for the failure of a witness to answer questions or produce documents. However, the decision of the High Court in Hammond v. The Commonwealth (1982) 56 ALJR 767 cast doubt on this construction although the majority formally reserved judgment on this point. The actual ground on which the majority of the Court granted an injunction restraining the Royal Commission in question from continuing its examination of Mr Hammond was that questions were being put to him by the Commission as to facts directly relevant to issues in criminal proceedings already commenced against him.</PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise that the present Bill would not affect that ground or the result of any future similar proceedings but, given the fact that section 6DD protects a witness against use of evidence given by him to a commission in other proceedings and the need for a royal commission to establish the facts of a particular matter, the Government has concluded that the doubt as to the construction of the Act arising from the High Court decision should be removed and that it be made clear that, in the special circumstances of a royal commission hearing, self-incrimination is not an excuse for failure to answer questions or produce documents. I mention that the reverse is intended to apply under the National Crimes Commission Bill on the basis that the primary purpose of that Commission is to obtain evidence admissible in a court for a prosecution where appropriate. Thus, under the Bill self-incrimination is an available excuse-subject however to an indemnity having been given by the Attorney-General -and there is no prohibition on use in a court of the evidence obtained by the Crimes Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> A final feature of the present Bill is the provision made in proposed new section 7AA which is intended to remove doubt as to the capacity of a Commonwealth royal commission to accept powers and functions given to it by a State government in the form of a parallel commission. When special circumstances arise calling for the establishment of a royal commission to inquire into a particular matter, it is in the interests of the nation that the body should be clothed with all necessary powers and given effective procedures so that it can fulfill its important task expeditiously and effectively. The present Bill is directed to this end and the new powers and procedures provided under the Bill will greatly enhance the ability of royal commissions to discharge the many and varied functions for which they are established. I commend it to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>To assist the consideration of the Bill I might apprise the Committee of developments since the Bill was last considered by the House and the amendments moved by the Government and accepted by the Senate. The Public Service Acts Amendment Bill was first introduced in the Budget session last year. The Bill was the culmination of a number of projects undertaken to update the employment provisions in the Australian Public Service. The major changes proposed were to abolish divisional structure in the Public Service, revise the procedures for promotions and appeals, and revise arrangements for the recovery of outstanding debts from the salaries of public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Bill was debated in the autumn session this year, the Government moved certain amendments to the Bill. These amendments were to provide a greater degree of autonomy to Parliament in determining its staffing arrangements- arising from the Jessop Committee report into the staffing of Parliament; to provide for the furnishing of reports giving reasons for decision in relation to promotion matters; and to provide for the dual appointment of permanent heads. During the winter recess the Public Service Board has had extensive consultations with the unions representing public servants. As a result of these consultations, and other developments to which I will come shortly, the Government has decided to move further amendments to the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill. These amendments were considered in the other place last night and the Bill as amended was passed. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few years there have been a number of court judgments which have affected the promotion and appeal processes in the Australian Public Service. Prior to the introduction of the Bill in the Budget session last year, there was an important judgment on a promotion appeals case which indicated that the established procedures of the Promotion Appeals Committee were deficient. The judgment cast appeal proceedings into an adversarial framework requiring a far greater degree of legal formality than the Government considered desirable. For this reason the Bill contained specific provisions which would have had the effect of allowing Promotions Appeals Committees to determine their own procedures and therefore continue with the less formal arrangements that had existed before the judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of the Bill there have been a number of judgments which have stressed the importance of personnel management interests involved in the promotions appeal system. The effect of these later judgments has been to largely offset the effect of the earlier judgment. The Government, in the light of these developments and opposition from the unions, moved amendments to the Bill in the Senate to omit those provisions detailing the procedures to be followed by Promotions Appeal Committees. The amendments moved by the Government also delete from the Bill special provisions for the giving of reasons for decisions in relation to promotion decisions. These special provisions were inserted by amendments moved by the Government and passed in the House in the autumn session. They had the effect of replacing section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The Government was of the view that these provisions were necessary to protect the privacy of public servants involved in promotions and appeals. It was feared that the application of section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act would have forced decision makers in the Public Service to reveal confidential information about other parties to a promotion or appeal to an applicant. This would have had detrimental effects on individuals as well as jeopardising harmonious working relationships in the Public Service. The effect of the recent judgments mentioned, as well as developments in the legal processes for providing reasons for decisions, has been to minimise the problems of privacy in providing reasons for decisions. The Government has therefore decided to delete those special provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government amendments include a provision giving expression to the merit principle. This provision reflects the Government's commitment to promoting efficiency in the Service and concomitantly precluding patronage, favouritism and unjustified discrimination. This amendment originated from an Opposition amendment which was supported by the unions. As a result of the discussions between the Public Service Board and the unions the Government has included a number of amendments which I understand will remove the remaining points of possible contention. In the other place an amendment was accepted which will clarify the responsibility of the departments of Parliament in presenting annual reports. The Government recommends to the House that the amendments to the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill be accepted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill came before the House in February this year the Australian Labor Party had a long list of amendments. The debate was gagged before we had the opportunity to outline the reasons for our proposals and the Bill was rammed through in the most dismissive manner. I draw to the attention of honourable members the manner in which this legislation was rammed through this House. I can recall that the debate began at 12.30 one morning and that the Bill was passed through this House, with hundreds of amendments, in 20 minutes. This was an example of how the business of government should not be conducted. In sharp contrast is the way in which it was handled once it reached the Senate. The Government, for whatever reason, found itself in a position where it had to consult with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Public Service Board over the provisions of the Bill. By the time that consultation had finished the substance of all the amendments except one that we had proposed in the House had been accepted by the Government and they were included in amendments proposed by the Government in the Senate last night. We congratulate the Government on its good sense in this matter and suggest that this sort of co-operative approach might be a fruitful way for it to conduct its affairs in the Parliament in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One matter which we and many members of the Public Service hoped would be included in this Bill was an anti-discrimination provision. This was not accepted by the Government. I personally am quite disappointed about that because there is no doubt-I hope that the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) will acknowledge this in his reply-that a great problem with discrimination in the Public Service, particularly against women, exists today just as it has existed for years. I draw to his attention the Public Service Board's annual report for 1981-82. In that report the Board cites the employment figures for men and women in the various divisions in the Public Service. There are 28 First Division officers, all of whom are male; there are no women. In the Second Division there are 1,245 men and 27 women. In the Third Division there are just over 48,000 men and 16,000 women. However, in the Fourth Division there are about equal numbers of men and women. I am sure that the Minister acknowledges that that is a problem. We had hoped that that problem of discrimination would be dealt with by some sort of amendment. However, we hope that the assurances that the Government has given that it will bring down sex discrimination legislation are more than talk. There has been considerable discussion about that matter over the last few years and I hope that we see such legislation introduced into the House very soon. Both the Labor Party and the trade union movement are very anxious that this Bill should become law as soon as possible so we think it would be unwise to delay its passage by insisting on the provision at this time. We also hope that we will see the introduction of the sex discrimination legislation in the very short term. We therefore support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem about this debate on bottom-of-the- harbour schemes is that it creates a credibility gap of over four years. That is a pity because the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has taken some notable scalps in his tax avoidance battles. However, retrospective collection of avoided tax was not contemplated from the day the Treasurer was informed of these practices in 1978 until the publication of the McCabe-Lafranchi report this year. The consideration of the legislation is not just a question of having regard for a principle of opposing bad legislation that forever casts doubt on the rule of law and the fundamental certainty of commercial action. It must be studied in the light of the unbridled evasion of taxation by greedy individuals, of innocent people caught in the net of advice offered by taxation professionals and of the failure by Ministers to act upon advice offered to them by their advisers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facts are that from 1974 to 1978 the Attorney-General's Department was quite incapable of safeguarding the interests of the Commonwealth by proceeding upon competent legal advice against those who evaded tax by fraud. Costigan has well documented those failings. He entitled a particular part of his interim report No. 4 'The Lamentable History of Non-Prosecution'. Because of the failure to prosecute it became accepted as fact by government that no case could be made against those involved in company stripping under existing law. Therefore the Commissioner of Taxation began his requests for new legislation to prevent bottom-of-the-harbour activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer was informed of these matters in February 1978. He introduced remedial legislation in November 1980. It took 33 months from the date the Treasurer was first notified officially of the operation of straw companies until he introduced into Parliament legislation to suppress them. In all the voluminous documents tabled by the Treasurer there is no satisfactory answer for the delay. It took five months from the date of the publication of the McCabe- Lafranchi report by the Victorian Government on 27 May 1982, detailing publicly for the first time the extent of company stripping, for the Treasurer to get legislation into the Parliament. Obviously the entreaties of the Commissioner of Taxation over nearly three years warning of these practices robbing the pay-as- you-earn taxpayer had a painfully slow effect in prodding the conscience of the Government into action. Yet a short five months of public revelation and political attack were sufficient to galvanise the Government to act against its own principles to collect retrospectively that which it had previously not even thought worth collecting through 1978, 1979 and nearly all of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Commissioner of Taxation as the sire, the Treasurer's gestation period was 33 months. When McCabe-Lafranchi forced the issue, it took five months. The Costigan reports and the McCabe-Lafranchi tabulation of company stripping make doleful reading for the honest taxpayer. The repetitive evasion of huge taxation liabilities by well-known businessmen highlighted the attack on Commonwealth revenue. Costigan sheets the blame home to government, and his criticism rests not on the absence of the sort of law we have before us but on our failure to use the law which we already had. It is a strange and devastating fact that although these schemes were picked out in the early 1970s and the Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) all refer to them as illegal, no case in law has been brought against the vendors or the promoters concerned in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. We cannot therefore assume that prosecution and recovery would be unsuccessful. The Treasurer himself confirmed this when he spoke in the House on 25 August. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I would have to say that events may well prove Mr Costigan to be wrong because until such time as the validity of prosecutions under the pre-1980 law is tested by the courts of this country, who is to know whether Mr Costigan is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>Since then we have enacted special legislations to set up the prosecutions under the pre-1980 law. It would be much better for the future certainty of the rule of law if we took the Costigan road first. The Government now wants to recreate the conditions of 1978 to enable it to remake its decision, but in setting out retrospectively to alter the law it does not intend to give those affected by it the chance to alter their decisions. We must consider also innocent people who may be caught by this legislation. It would seem that those who sold a company with its tax unpaid before the end of the financial year may simply be involved in a lottery. If losses were injected into the company after the sale all will be well. If it was stripped they will have to pay up. Their responsibility is determined by action taken by the purchaser after the vendor had severed all connection with the company. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to have a constituent in this position, and although it would have been difficult to match losses with the company he sold by the year 1977 that is what he believed would happen. With this legislation in prospect he does not know whether he will be liable because he does not know what happened to the company he previously owned except that it was liquidated some years later. In fact, a leading accountant told me that he thought the promoters had a legal way of handling the current year profits they purchased. He said: 'If I was unaware of their methods, how would a businessman off the street know the position?' Just last week I received a letter from a constituent who was a shareholder in Metro Industries Ltd. The question put to me was: 'Where do I stand?' It is on this point that the Government's position is somewhat hypocritical. Many people are involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes because they were advised by experts. Yet this is the advice that the Government offers in a publication headed 'Taxation-Managing the Small Business', Series No. 16. This publication, which is currently in the Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops, contains advice on taxation matters. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Most businessmen do not have the expertise to carry out the complete accounting and taxation functions which are an integral part of their business activities. Even those who are proficient in accountancy frequently find that it is better to place the preparation of final accounts and taxation returns in the hands of specialists. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the advice which the Government gives to the small businessman. Apparently we now qualify that advice and our attitude by saying in this Bill: ' The advice we may have advised you to get previously is no longer the advice we now would have you accept'. I again refer in passing to the current advice to the small businessmen from this Government which is to put their affairs in the hands of professionals. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is retrospective not only in calling in back taxes. It is also obviously retrospective in a political sense. As documentation shows, pressure was building up, departmentally, at least by 1974. From 1978 it took nearly three years for the Treasurer to enact blocking legislation which, when passed, gave no indication that retrospective collection was in his mind. In fact, he gave no early warning signal that this would be the case at any time during his lengthy consideration of the issue. If he had made a positional statement of intent in 1978 he would most likely have undercut the major throughput of the schemes before they peaked. Those still operating from that time until 1980 would have been quite legitimately subject to tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The absence of such a declaration and the inaction during all of 1981 and the early part of this year confirm beyond reasonable doubt that there was no intention to proceed as we are now until political pressure was assessed as being utterly compelling in its urgency. In this way, therefore, it is easy to recognise that we are following Labor's policy. The Bill is here because Labor forced the issue, and it will pass because of its coalition with the Government. The Australian Labor Party gloats at the prospect of legitimising its future retrospective actions, while we run along in fear behind it. Because of a partial retreat, a sharp distinction has been drawn between dry and wet Slutzkin schemes; yet it is difficult to see the difference in terms of morality in relation to the payment of tax avoided. The principal difference seems to be in the quantity of tax avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> In the wet scheme no tax was paid on current year profits. In fact, the companies were sold before the end of the financial year and had not yet been assessed for tax. The tax obligation passed to the new company owners. In the dry case company tax was paid but no personal tax was paid on dividends or on undistributed profits. The responsibility for the latter tax also passed to the new owner. Critics can therefore ask this question: 'If vendor-shareholders are made responsible for the fate of the company which has passed from their hands in the case of wet schemes, why are they not made responsible in the same way for the actions of the new owners in relation to dry schemes?' As a matter of fact I am pleased to be on all fours with my electorate committee on this issue. That committee, without any prompting from me, considered this matter at some length and regretted deeply the evasion and avoidance of taxation but said collectively with almost a unanimous voice-not quite, but almost unanimous-that we should not as a party destroy the certainty of the law by retrospectively collecting tax even though a large sum of money was involved. The committee prefers the Government to proceed in the case of any suspected fraud on the laws existing prior to 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Some measure of positive direction will come out of the wrong turning respresented in this Bill. Firstly, from now on governments will be more diligent. Ministers will know they cannot ignore imperatives put to them by their senior advisers, and those who would cheat the system will know that they will always be subject to retribution. On the darker side, company structures are much less secure, political necessities may force retrospective alteration of previously valid law and individuals will know that they may be buffeted by decisions far removed from their own knowledge. On balance I prefer that those who acted fraudulently should be charged with those offences. I have no brief for them. I oppose this Bill as a desperate move boding ill for the future, put forward by men who found their consciences very late in the argument. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a nation all Australians are quite well aware now of the appalling extent of the tax avoidance industry in our country. Thanks to the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the Costigan report on the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the speeches of members of the Australian Labor Party in both Houses of Parliament, and thanks to the vigilance of our staff and the media, some of the leading villains in the tax avoidance industry have been exposed. The Australian Taxation Office now admits that at least 6,200 companies are involved in tax avoidance schemes, but even that figure is open to debate. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) puts at $530m the revenue lost due to these schemes, whereas some say it could be three times that amount. Whatever the correct figure is, it is till an incredible amount of money. It may well be lost to the Treasury for all times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Taxation (Upaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2], and the other Bills which are being debated cognately, recognise the phenomenal growth of the tax avoidance industry in Australia and attempt to do something about recouping tax owing. For that reason I applaud the Bills. However, the public must not be misled into thinking that the Bills are a cure-all for tax avoidance in this country-far from it. The Bills are grossly deficient in recouping hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes and in deterring tax avoiders from future indulgence in tax avoidance schemes. The Bills seek the payment of company taxes avoided through bottom-of-the-harbour schemes but they do not require payment of the individual income tax also avoided under them. These unpaid taxes amount to millions of dollars. Further, other tax avoidance schemes, amounting to hunderds of millions of dollars in lost revenue, are not included in these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Last weekend I received a phone call from a businessman in my electorate informing me that certain tyre companies have been avoiding paying sales tax on imported truck tyre cases. He claimed that the companies have made false representations on Customs and shipping forms, thus avoiding the taxes due on imported tyre cases. He also claimed that other tyre companies were avoiding paying taxes due by importing truck tyre cases through a central figure. I understand that the Taxation Office has caught up with one of the companies and has assessed that it owes the Taxation Office $1.3m in avoided taxes. The businessman also claimed that the company had offered to pay the Taxation Office $750,000 but it refused to accept that amount, saying that it wanted the full amount. If these accusations are true I expect the Treasurer to take immediate action to gauge the extent of this type of sales tax avoidance and stop the fraud continuing. Who knows how far-reaching the scheme is throughout Australia and in how many other capital cities in Australia this sort of fraudulent activity is taking place?</PARA>
<PARA> The innocence clause in these Bills makes a mockery of the attempt to reclaim unpaid tax. The clause was added due to pressure from Government back benchers who sinisterly oppose retrospective tax legislation. The clause includes the provision for a claim of innocence because of the intent to avoid rather than evade tax when entering an artificial scheme. The existence of this innocence clause will make the legislation unworkable and lead to protracted and expensive legal battles which will clog up our courts. Let me pre-empt those legal battles with some very elementary thinking. It seems to me that the intent of a criminal does not make any difference to the severity of the crime of theft, and that is what tax avoidance is. It is the theft of revenue rightfully owing to the Government, and indirectly it is theft from pay-as-you-earn wage and salary earners. A thief receives a fine. Fines and the cost of repayment of stolen articles will always exceed the value of the items stolen. However, there is no provision for penalties in these Bills except for late payment. The generous repayment arrangements of a 25 per cent deposit and 12 months to pay must surely seem one of the most attractive loan conditions these businessmen have ever seen . </PARA>
<PARA> In the most recent issue of the National Times there is an article which quizzes several leading businessmen on retrospective legislation. It is interesting to note the astute observation of Sir Keith Campbell of the Hooker Corporation Ltd. He points out that the tax evader has had the benefit of the tax money plus the opportunity of its investment value. However, he is asked to pay back only the avoided tax and even then he is given plenty of time in which to do so. Meanwhile, and without penalty, he has the use of the money owing to the Government. It is nothing short of an interest free loan with highly attractive conditions of repayment. If the repayment attracts penalties they are at the rate of only 20 per cent. That is not too much more than the normal interest rates we have today. I hardly feel that the repayment arrangements included in these Bills will make for a deterrent to tax avoiders. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that with these arrangements tax avoidance in this country will continue. Unfortunately, it will continue unchecked. That is a further enticement to the tax avoiders and an encouragement to continue their practices. Tax avoidance will continue unchecked because of the staff ceilings in the Taxation Office and the Australian Federal Police. The razor gang wrongly recommended that staff in the Taxation Office be reduced. The number of staff was reduced by 167. Most of those who lost their jobs because of the dreadfully misguided and false economies of the razor gang cut-backs came from the tax avoidance area of the Taxation Office. Each of those sacked from the avoidance area was responsible for the reclamation of $500,000 a year in unpaid taxes. The result of that staff cut has been the cancerous growth of tax avoidance in unprecedented proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> Royal commissioners Costigan and Woodward have both complained of the staff ceiling levels and training standards of the Federal Police. They have also indicated that staffing and training deficiencies have led to investigations being seriously and adversely affected. It is therefore obvious that, unless the Taxation Office and Federal Police staffing levels are increased, tax avoidance will continue to flourish. It will be the aim of a Labor Government to increase staff ceilings in these areas to make avoidance investigations more effective. Under these Bills tax avoiders who are caught will be able to debate their innocent intent in the courts or plead guilty and pay back their taxes without penalty and with the benefit of the use of that money. I support the amendments which oppose these favourable repayment arrangements and legislate against all tax avoidance schemes rather than merely elements of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will endeavour to be brief. The issue before the House is complex. I believe that very few people could reasonably see it in black and white terms. I regret that the legislation has been introduced as quickly as it has. The time required to get such a difficult matter straight is more than we have had. It is more important to get it right than get it fast. The Taxation ( Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2] is retrospective and, as such, it offends the principle of certainty before the law. To that extent I agree with the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) and the honourable member for Eden- Monaro (Mr Sainsbury), with whom I agree on most matters. However, I part from them on two points. First of all, I believe that the proscription against retrospectivity is a proscription against penalty applied retrospectively. It depends on the imposition of penalty not merely on the fact that it is retrospective. I will come back to that. The other matter with which I disagree is that I believe that the prohibition of retrospectivity is not the only principle that a parliament must take into account. There ought not be a penalty . In my judgment this Bill should merely recoup those moneys that have been received by a person. Whether that person knew that those moneys had been received is not the issue that worries me most. It is whether that person did or did not receive them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill before the House worries me in that, as far as vendor-shareholders are concerned, it goes some way beyond the point of recoupment and some way beyond the benefit received in that it charges to the vendor-shareholders the whole amount of the tax owing by the company that was later stripped though they would not normally have received that whole amount. So to some extent, in the case of vendor-shareholders, this legislation goes beyond recoupment. To that extent I have a reservation about the Bill. The Bill before the House-although I am hopeful that there may be changes to it-certainly goes much beyond recoupment in respect of some classes of people who are collectively referred to as promoters. Not all the people involved in promotion were involved in company stripping and not all the people who were in that chain knew all the steps further down the chain. Of course many did. A distinction needs to be drawn. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, for another reason, that penalty ought not be inflicted. I have discussed the issue of justice. A penalty ought not be inflicted because we need a bulwark from which to defend the principle of the rule of law in future. It is an important principle. I think some rather extravagant things have been said, condemning those who have spoken entirely from this principle. As far as the arguments of those who spoke from this principle went, in my judgment they were right. But that is a question of judgment. However, if we impose a penalty, where do we then draw our line? What will be our bulwark against indiscriminate abuse of certainty before the law? In my judgment, this or any other legislation ought not go any further than to recover those benefits that have been received. That is an important underlying principle that ought not be offended. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of guilt or innocence does not arise. This is a tax Bill. The loose language that has been used by Opposition speakers and Government speakers in this Parliament and outside it impugning people's motives is unnecessary and damaging. </PARA>

It reminds me of the use of the word 'un-American' at the height of McCarthyism in the United States of America. At that time communism was a threat to the free world, as it is today. What Senator McCarthy sought to do was, in my judgment, right. The methods he used, in my judgment, were very wrong. The same applies in respect of this legislation. Those people, on either side of the House, who make loose remarks about other people's motives and moral standing are, in my judgment, committing the same offence and offending the same principles that Senator McCarthy committed and offended in the United States. It is wrong and the method used does matter. People's motives are not matters that ought be brought into question by this legislation. This legislation is a taxing Bill, which is designed to recoup moneys that in my view should be recouped. But I object strongly to slanderous attacks on people's reputations. I object to them strongly when people are named, as they have been in this House, or when attacks have been made in general terms as they have been made outside this House. It is the same offence that Senator McCarthy committed in the United States, and it is wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There will not be the vast sums saved that some people suggest will be saved through this legislation. Nonetheless the sum is appreciable-possibly about one per cent of the total taxes raised by the Commonwealth Government. The important thing about the legislation is that it will place the tax laws in a position where they are seen to be fair so that much money that is now being lost to the revenue through petty evasion-the cash economy surely involves more vast losses than were ever involved in sophisticated avoidance arrangements-will be paid. I think that is very important. The legislation is protecting the whole tax base. That is what it is all about. It is putting in place an appreciation of fairness that will stand well by the whole tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the cause of draconian tax laws. The cause is excessive, wasteful expenditure, and let no one forget that. I have sympathy with those people who have constantly criticised governments for their waste of money and who now find this legislation offensive. I have considerable sympathy for them. I do not agree with them but I have a lot of sympathy for their position. I have no sympathy at all for those profligate, big spenders who would now take away the Government's tax base. I think we should distinguish between the two groups. People such as the honourable member for Tangney and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro have mounted an argument with which I disagree. But it is an argument from principle that needs to be taken seriously. It needs to be remembered because the principles it enunciates are important to the whole system of government from here on as they have been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax revolt is brought about by perceived waste and by too much reliance on the income tax base. I draw the attention of Opposition members to the fact that we rely so heavily on the income tax base that a tax revolt is almost inevitable . If we are not able to broaden the tax base in the one area on which it can reasonably be broadened-that is, to tax the transfer of goods and services in the community; a sales tax or a retail turnover tax-we will face a reliance on a single tax base that cannot be sustained. Finally, there is the question of legislated loopholes such as films, gold and tax averaging for farmers-the sorts of things that are placed in the legislation deliberately. Those are the things that reflect badly on the Parliament because they were put there deliberately. Let us get this legislation through. Having done that, let us bend our minds to cleaning up the tax Act itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has moved an amendment to the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2] 1982 which I support. Of course we would not have had the present Bill before the House if it had not been for the revelations of the McCabe-Lafranchi report to the Victorian State Government and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Since the beginning of 1978 the Commissioner of Taxation has been urging the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to take action. However, because of pressure from influential supporters, officials and parliamentary members of the Liberal Party the Treasurer did nothing and allowed one of the biggest and most scandalous examples of government maladministration since Federation to occur. One has to study the philosophy and morality of the Liberal Party of Australia to understand why the Treasurer and other members of the Government procrastinated on the matter for so long. Their philosophy is one which extolls the virtues of the financier, the money persons, the person who, with a stroke of genius, buys and sells companies which represent the accumulated profits of working people. The capital tax free profits they gain amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some more notorious cases, amount to millions of dollars. This buying and selling of companies is of course a legal activity. The capital gains acruing to the financier are quite legal. There is unfortunately no capital gains tax involved and, providing company taxes and profits taxes have been paid, the financier is not involved in anything illegal. In fact, some of these people have been depicted as the heroes of our society, as great captains of industry, when, in fact, what they really represent is wealth and power of the most obscene kind.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is but a small step for the less scrupulous of these financiers to look into ways and means of avoiding and evading their taxes. These people resent the intrusion of government into their financial affairs. Members on the Government side of the House espouse the cause of small government, or preferably no government regulation at all. Why should the Federal Government be slugging them from company taxes, dividend taxes and sales taxes? Is it not rightfully theirs? Did they not earn it by the sweat of their brow? Or at least they instructed somebody else to earn it for them with the sweat of their brow. So there has developed a new brand of creature, a hybrid of the financier, called a promoter whose ingenuity was turned towards clever schemes of tax avoidance and evasion. These promoters were aided and abetted in their bottom-of -the-harbour schemes by the views of the High Court of Australia under the leadership of Sir Garfield Barwick.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I quite agree with the honourable member. This learned judge made it quite clear in various judgments that so far as he was concerned all potential taxpayers had the right to so arrange their financial affairs that they minimised their tax liability. The promoters needed no further encouragement and , legitimised by the 1977 High Court decision, dividend stripping schemes known as dry Slutzkin schemes multiplied. Selling off a company to a promoter in a way in which, whilst company tax was paid, the payment of any dividend tax was avoided, was not good enough. Both vendor-shareholders and promoters became greedy and developed the wet Slutzkin schemes involving the avoidance of both company tax and dividend tax. I am not going to detail exactly how these schemes worked because it would take up my time. My colleagues on this side of the House have already explained the sometimes rather complicated steps involved in tax avoidance and evasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I want to make is that many members on the Government side of the House do not believe that any wrong-doing has been committed in the case of dry Slutzkin schemes. They have also, even in the case of the more blatant schemes involving the avoidance of both company tax and dividend tax, attempted to argue that the vendor-shareholders who sell their company to the promoter are innocent . What nonsense this is! Do Government members really think that the average Australian who has paid pay-as-you-earn income tax for many years will accept such humbug? What about the miners from Wollongong who were here in Parliament House yesterday protesting at the loss of their jobs? Will they accept that humbug-that the shareholders are innocent? Of course they are not innocent. Australians will not accept that because they know that when these vendor- shareholders received a price for their shares in their company which was way above the normal market price, those shareholders must have suspected that something crooked was going on. Those shareholders must have known that they should be paying dividend tax or, in more blatant cases, company tax and dividend tax, and that the price they were receiving for their shares represented the unpaid taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> We had both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister hypocritically saying that some of these people are innocent because there was no tax liability when they sold their shares. In case there is some misunderstanding, I want to make it clear that I am not confused about the difference between dry Slutzkin and wet Slutzkin schemes. I realise that the former is considered legal according to the law of the High Court and that the latter is illegal. But one cannot get away from the fact that both schemes are immoral. It was a criminal attempt by shareholders to avoid their just taxation dues. The shareholders and promoters are equally guilty and should suffer the full weight of taxation law. The reason for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) is to ensure that the shareholders who so many Government members consider are innocent pay the taxes which they knowingly and willingly avoided. Why should these people get away with it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; they are their friends. Why should these people get away with it when they received a price for their shares which was above the normal market value? Unfortunately it is not enough for legislation to be passed in the Parliament to recoup the taxes avoided by the friends of the Liberal Party. The Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was passed belatedly at the end of 1980. Since that time there has not been any prosecutions against these blatant tax offenders. Let me say that again-there have been no prosecutions against these blatant tax avoiders. The Government has had two years to prosecute. Why has it not taken action? I wonder how long it will take the Treasurer and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to ensure that there are prosecutions in relation to the present legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another hypocritical charge made by both the Treasurer and the Government members is that the 1972-1975 Labor Government failed to take action on tax avoidance when it was in power. Incidentally, with three elections in three years and a hostile Senate, was the Australian Labor Party Government really in power during that period? The truth is that tax avoidance and evasion during that period had only just begun to operate. It was only a shadow of the estimated $3,000m per annum which taxation experts have stated is the magnitude of the problem in the last financial year. The Government was aware of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes as far back as the beginning of 1978 and yet it has delayed taking action for five years. Such inaction is inexcusable but it is also indicative of the immoral activities of a government, many members of which have a sneaking regard for the shrewdness of the promoters of these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the ALP is not opposing the legislation, we consider that it is an inadequate response to the tax avoidance in bottom-of-the-habour schemes. The evaded company tax may be recouped, but what about the accumulated profits and sales taxes which have been evaded in many of these schemes? The Taxation ( Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2] is only a beginning and when the Labor Party wins government, which will be very shortly, we will ensure that these crooked tax avoiders and tax evaders make their just retribution to society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The history of this legislation goes back some four months to the release of the McCabe-Lafranchi report and subsequently the Costigan report on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. It appears from those reports that despite the many and positive actions taken by this Government to block loopholes which over the years have been discovered in the Income Tax Assessment Act, a further and more damaging tax evasion practice was being undertaken. The Costigan report outlines in detail the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Whilst I believe the report has many inaccuracies and in many respects is inadequate, I wish to quote from paragraph 3.93. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From time to time there have been suggestions that there is something clever or novel about these types of schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The paragraph continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that they have been known to the law for many years and the law has developed the remedies for them. In the case of companies those remedies lie in the misfeasance proceedings. As long ago as 1820 it was determined that where directors improperly invest or pay away companies' monies they are liable in misfeasance and that has been re-affirmed many times over the last one hundred years. </PARA>
<PARA>So says Costigan. Despite this advice the Government believes, presumably on the basis that such action as proposed by Costigan may not be successful and in any event would involve a long and arduous process through the courts, that legislation is therefore needed to recover the outstanding tax more rapidly. This legislation is the means whereby that goal is to be achieved through the mechanism of a recoupment tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of the legislation is to recover evaded company tax from the principal beneficiaries of the earlier evasions. The legislation is to operate on untaxed profits which were stripped from companies between 1 January 1972 and 4 December 1980 when the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was implemented to overcome this and other tax evasion practices. </PARA>
<PARA> Before dealing with the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2] in its retrospective effect I shall make a few comments dealing generally with the lead-up to this legislation. There is no doubt that many people, including me, felt justifiably incensed about those who had undertaken fraudulent activity to evade tax, thereby indirectly increasing the tax burden borne by the rest of the community. However, in the course of what became a rather heated and at times irrational debate, many others by inference or association were erroneously included in that group. At times the debate and some proposals for action appeared to be motivated more by a lynch mentality than a reasoned, rational and fair response. Accusations were made both inside and outside this place-I particularly refer to allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) and a select number of his colleagues who have done irreparable damage to this institution by their crude, base, unfounded, Star Chamber-like tactics. They deserve the scorn and contempt which the community has heaped upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> I deal now with retrospectivity. I have often expressed my opposition to retrospectivity both in this place and outside. I well recall the Curran debate when the legislation affected only people who had entered into the scheme during that current financial year. It had the effect of putting them back into the position they were in before they entered the scheme. During that debate some argued on the basis of Lord Hailsham's views that 'a man cannot be punished or penalised for doing something which is lawful at the time it is done'. 'Penalise ' is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as being 'to subject to penalty or comparative disadvantage'. In my view the Curran legislation put people back in the same financial year into the same position as the rest of the taxpayers and, in that respect, they were not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other reasons why in general I am against retrospective legislation. Of course, those reasons include my belief that people are entitled to certainty as to the state of the law. Unfortunately, my views are not shared by the members of the Opposition, who have repeatedly stated that they would have no reservation in enacting retrospective legislation in circumstances which I believe to be abhorrent. Given the stated intention of the Government to legislate retrospectively and the Opposition's support for that action, my purpose has been to endeavour to ensure, in respect of vendors, that those caught by the legislation are only those who benefited from the scheme and that the subject sale was made without appropriate inquiry and without reasonable and appropriate arrangements being made to ensure that the subject company's liability would be met. I have also tried to ensure that in line with the company tax liability now imposed on vendors they ought to have similar rights under the Income Tax Assessment Act to those they would have had if they had continued to own the company. This is why I have recommended and supported many changes to the Bills. I would like to thank my colleagues, especially the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and Cabinet, for their patience and flexibility in all but one or two matters. I believe we have a much better Bill as a result. For the members of the Opposition to criticise the changes merely indicates their irrational and emotional reaction and a complete lack of regard for natural justice. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NI4">Mr PORTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And their ignorance; quite right. The Treasurer, in his statement to the House on 23 September when he introduced the original legislation, made it clear that a number of changes had been made. I believe they were substantial changes that went at least part way to making the legislation more acceptable. Firstly, I refer to the fact that the vendor-shareholder will now have an opportunity to contest the basic assessment of the company tax which is subject to recoupment. Clearly, after the vendor had sold his company he was not in a position to contest any tax liability which may have been assessed on that company. If we are to require him now to pay that tax it is essential that he be given the opportunity to contest that assessment if he so desires. Secondly, the penalties which have applied to the company tax which was payable some years ago by the purchaser will now not be incurred by the vendor who is subject to this recoupment tax but rather the obligation of the former owners to meet any penalty owing by the company will be measured from the date that would be the due date for payment if the company assessment had been served on the day that the copy of the notice of assessment is sent to the vendor-shareholders. Further , the Bill now provides that the service or reissue of a company assessment notice is to be served where possible on all former shareholders, not just one. Also, the special legislation will now not make vendors liable for tax incurred by the company in respect of lodgment of an incorrect return, a late-lodgment or a non-lodgment which would have been out of the control of the vendors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer in his second reading speech to the amendment legislation also outlined some further welcome changes. Vendor-shareholders now have the opportunity of requesting a limited time to pay. Former owners are given the opportunity to pay the unpaid company tax in instalments over a period of up to 12 months, in which case they would not be liable for any late payment penalty nor would they be liable to pay the recoupment tax. I do not think there can be any criticism of the legislation in relation to those who have fraudulently evaded their tax liability. However, at the other end of the scale are those who entered into a legal avoidance arrangement. Both the original legislation and this amending legislation make it clear that those people will not be subjected to recoupment tax. The Treasurer has made it clear that the Government's intention has always been that the tax recouped under the legislation should be that tax that remains unpaid as a result of arrangements which have resulted in illegal evasion of tax. He has quite rightly pointed out that the legal authorities could not be seen to be part of an arrangement to leave the company unable to meet its tax liability and that they lack an element of fraud. The legislation has now been further extended to include a specific provision with the effect that, in the words of the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA>If the target company was the subject of a post-sale attempted avoidance scheme which, objectively viewed, would have had reasonable prospects of succeeding in its purpose, and the scheme is not part of the stripping arrangement so that the arrangement carried no purpose of rendering the company unable to pay, there will be no recoupment tax liability. In line with that, the recoupment legislation will also not apply where there was a pre-sale avoidance scheme which, though ultimately shown to be unsuccessful, might reasonably have been expected to have worked, if at the time of the sale the Commissioner had not raised an assessment rejecting the claims made under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I welcome the extension of the exclusions of the legislation to those two groups of people. This brings me to the point of concern I mentioned earlier. The legislation now quite rightly excludes vendor-shareholders who have sold their company to a purchaser who reduced by legal means the company's tax liability. The Bill does not exclude those who sold their company after making due inquiry to ensure that the purchaser was going to act within the law, had some means whereby he could legally use the company and that the tax would not be evaded. If, subsequently, the purchaser does not do as the vendor was led to believe, the vendor will be caught by this legislation. I intend to raise this matter together with some technical matters in relation to promoters at the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) have been faced with an excruciating political dilemma. There is nothing they would have liked to have had more than an early election, with 25 September as the preferred date. But the revelations of the McCabe- Lafranchi report, followed by the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and its devastating evidence about bottom-of-the-harbour tax evasion schemes put paid to that. The December 1983 election was the least attractive option for the Prime Minister with the prospect of an economy out of control, massive unemployment, possibly of the order of 12 per cent to 15 per cent, high inflation and record interest rates. On that basis the Fraser Government would not just face defeat. It would face political annihilation-oblivion at the hands of the electors. So the Prime Minister felt compelled to adopt what appeared to be a 'get tough' policy on tax evasion. I say 'appeared to be' because it is clear that one can drive a coach and four through the present legislation currently before the House in its highly attenuated state, weakened as it has been by the attacks on it within the Liberal Party and by members of parliament in Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To have any hope of winning a 1982 election, the Prime Minister had to attempt to win back the votes of people who were on the pay-as-you-earn tax scheme-that is to say, the great majority of the electorate, the people whom the Slutzkinites of both wet and dry variety refer to so contemptuously as the 'mugs '. The people at the higher level of the income scale who made such a mockery of the concept of progressive payment of taxation are the people of whom Professor Russell Mathews said that the higher and higher up the income scale, the more voluntary the question of the payment of income tax appears to be. </PARA>

That statement is on record and I am sure that further evidence from Commissioner Costigan will abundantly confirm that. So the Prime Minister faced that dilemma. Even though there are not too many honourable members on the Government benches tonight who relish the prospect of an early election, the Prime Minister seems to be the one person in the Cabinet who still holds the view that he has no option, that he has to get out early with this legislation enacted. I believe the legislation will prove to be inadequate and, as I will mention in a few minutes, there will not be very much the Government can do to win back the votes of the electorate. I think it is already too late for the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point that immediately comes to mind is that the whole question of getting tough with the people who have been the financial supporters of the Liberal Party really exposes the utter hollowness and hypocrisy of the Liberal Party line about its opposition to public funding of election campaigns. Good God, we have had it already! We have got it already. Where do honourable members think the money comes from to provide the Liberal Party's slush funds? The Liberal Party's slush funds have clearly come from money which should have been tax payments into revenue. The Liberal Party has simply left out the intermediate step of paying the money into the Treasury and bringing it out by way of public funding of elections. The money simply comes into Liberal Party coffers in lieu of any payment to taxation. We have had Liberal Party election bonanzas lavishly paid out of funds which never went into the Treasury's coffers . They were paid for out of ripped off slush funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has a very narrow range of alternatives. Either he can go to the electorate now and face the virtual certainty of being done in by the electorate or he can wait on into 1983 and be done in by his own colleagues in the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is a very unforgiving party when it sees the prospect of going down. Even the National Party is essentially more forgiving in its nature. We know that the Leader of the National Party always brings home his wounded. He does not leave them lying on the barbed wire in no- man's land. He drags them home no matter what condition they are in. That is not the same philosophy we find inside the Liberal Party. The result is that it is clear that the Prime Minister may take the view that if he is rejected in November like de Gaulle he can retire from the public scene for a while. He can retreat to Nareen-les-deux-Eglises and wait for the call of his people to bring him back again. But that call will never come. I think that whilst the principle of retrospectivity is not a principle we would like to see generally applied, it has always been regarded as exceptional in revenue cases. I will repeat the citation of the case the Treasurer referred to when he spoke in the debate on the Curran scheme. This has not been quoted so far in this debate. I will cite this in support of the position of honourable members opposite; so they should not look alarmed. I refer to the famous case of Howard de Walden v. Inland Revenue Commissioners and the judgment of Lord Greene, Master of the Rolls. Incidentally, for those who are listening on their crystal sets and want to look up the case, the citation is 1942 1KBD 389. Lord Greene said:</PARA>

For years a battle of manoeuvre has been waged between the legislature and those who are minded to throw the burden of taxation off their own shoulders on to those of their fellow subjects. In that battle the legislature has often been worsted by the skill, determination and resourcefulness of its opponents of whom the present appellant has not been the least successful. It would not shock us in the least to find that the legislature has determined to put an end to the struggle by imposing the severest of penalties. It scarcely lies in the mouth of the taxpayer who plays with fire to complain of burnt fingers. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the section has to some extent a retroactive effect again appears to us of no importance when it is realized that the legislation is a move in a long and fiercely contested battle with individuals who well understand the rigour of the contest. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the other factors, apart from the feebleness of the legislation before us , is the fact that clearly the Taxation Office is not well placed to exact what should have been paid by defaulting taxpayers. The structure of our administrative system in the Taxation Office is a shambles. I draw attention to the last report of the Commissioner of Taxation. I will not have time to read the relevant part in full. It pointed out not only that $973m of tax assessed remained uncollected because of administrative challenge but also that there was a shortfall in revenue due to tax avoidance schemes in 1980-81 which alone reached $310m. This is the significant point. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The number of experienced staff required to be allocated to the additional work of detecting, monitoring, investigating and contesting tax avoidance schemes continues to make serious inroads into resources available for other administrative functions. </PARA>
<PARA>The point was that the report shows that the total staff in the Taxation Office in June 1981 was 12,311, of whom 983 were investigating officers. The net cost of collection of income tax as a percentage of income tax revenue collected was 0.87 per cent, a decrease on previous years. In the current year income wage and salary earners paid 82 per cent of the individual income tax burden. Dr Paul Gerber, in a very important paper called 'The Functions and Procedures of Boards of Review' has pointed out the scandalous backlog of cases that exist within the Taxation Board of Review structure. I understand that in 1936 there were three Boards of Review in Australia. Now, 46 years later, there are still three Boards of Review. The population of Australia has increased three times, the number of people above the tax threshold has increased, say, 20 times, but the number of Boards of Review is exactly what it was 46 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a government which claims that it is serious in going out after the tax malefactor. The Treasurer, who is hastily beating a retreat from the chamber, is the head of the vigilante group, the head of the posse who never brings back the man. He goes out with his six-guns to find the people he is chasing but he never brings them back. He has a zero result in terms of scalps brought back. Dr Gerber's paper points out there are now very many thousands of backlog cases that have to be examined by the Taxation Board of Review. The period it is taking for them to be dealt with is many years. Members of the present Taxation Boards of Review have recently commented on the overcrowding of cases before the Boards. In 1981 over 24,000 cases were awaiting determination by the Board of Review. Dr Gerber also said that it appeared that Boards of Review had largely displaced the cinema as a form of popular entertainment and that since seats in the front stalls could still be purchased at pre-war prices, it was perhaps not surprising that there were queues three years long waiting to gain admission. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us say that the legislation is amended in the Committee stage and that it becomes a substantially stronger piece of legislation than what has been brought in by the Treasurer. We then say: 'It will be passed by the Senate tomorrow. It will be enacted by the Governor-General next week'. How long will it be before we can say that there has been an adequate clawback by the Taxation Office of the tax which is due to be collected as a result of the passing of the legislation? What kind of time lag are we thinking of? How long will it take to get the actual machinery operating?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister has a contribution to make we will all listen for it with bated breath. The Treasurer does not have a very long arm. I doubt whether the long arm stretches even as far as Tasmania or, as the Minister keeps calling it, the sovereign State of Tasmania. It may yet have to collect its own tax. The result is, we find, that the legislation is inadequate. I believe that the legislation has been introduced purely for the purpose of giving the Prime Minister something that looks more or less satisfactory on the surface until one starts to look at it. The horriying thing about the way this whole matter has been treated is that one realises how inadequate the whole clawback machinery of the Australian Taxation Office is. The feeble performance of the legal side of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office, certainly in Western Australia, may well be replicated in other States. That remains to be seen. It is scandalous that we have only the same number of boards of review as we had three years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final point I want to make is simply that we realise when in talking to people in the Liberal Party how very deeply they are disturbed and how bitterly divided they are over the whole question of tax. One realises when one talks about money to the Liberals that one is talking about something very sacred, something which is very close to what they are all about. Talking to Liberals about money is like talking to pre-Vatican II Catholics about the Pope. It is a very sensitive subject that one does not joke about. The result is that the Prime Minister's feeble efforts in at least making some attempt to get into the tax dodgers who have occupied such an important role in Australia, who have denied the Australian people so much revenue, who have forced a very heavy burden on the ordinary taxpayer, people in the middle income group and even people in the lower income groups, have caused such bitter dissension within the party that we have a competely corrupted party, a corrupted government, and the sooner the election comes on the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not doubt that for a minute. The principles underlying this legislation and some of the Government's stated reasons for it have occasioned, to say the least, anxiety and concern amongst a great many law abiding Australians, not just the people who are likely to be directly affected but those who have an aversion to retrospectivity in any form. These Bills do not concern themselves just with those who have acted fraudulently. Indeed that is not necessary because fraud was at all material times a criminal offence and new legislation is not required to cope with criminal activity of that sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fairness has been advanced as justification for these measures-fairness to other taxpayers who have not indulged in tax minimisation practices, having particular characteristics. Those practices which are distinguished by subsequent dividend stripping or destruction of company records by other than vendor-shareholders are to be legislated against. In this latter respect it should be noted that destruction of company records as a way to evade tax persisted for as long as it did and over such a period because those comparative few who promoted the schemes kept secret to themselves their illegal intentions and activities. If what they were doing had become generally known at the time it seems unlikely that promoters could have continued to attract customers. It is reasonable to assume that if there had been widespread knowledge of illegal dumping of records after ownership of companies had changed hands, many would have been advised by their lawyers and accountants not to sell their shares. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, had the end result of the schemes been known at large, or to any more than the select few who had promoted them, many other unscrupulous individuals would have engaged in the same activity. The tax advantage which was attractive to vendor-shareholders was of course the motivating factor, just as the creation of income splitting devices, investment in films, contrived arrangements with certain charitable organisations, and many other legal tax minimisation schemes motivated others. </PARA>
<PARA> The targets of this legislation might be said to have had the misfortune to discover subsequently that they dealt with charlatans and frauds. Some of those who are responsible for this new tax may be said to be victims of the luck of the draw. I say this because it was the experience of some companies which sold more than one subsidiary to find out later that only a minor number of all subsidiaries sold were fraudulently dealt with by the purchasers of sub- purchasers. Had the great majority of vendors known the ultimate fate of their companies they may have opted for a tax minimisation arrangement specifically condoned by law, or any one of a number of other schemes which were not likely to put them in breach of any law. They may very well have chosen to do nothing if they even suspected that they may be contemplating an improper act. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation proposes to erase the benefits of perfectly legal acts after the event, giving vendors no opportunity to rearrange their affairs to comply with the concept of fairness which is now proffered with the benefit of hindsight. Fairness must also surely demand consideration for people who have acted within the law. Until the contrary can be demonstrated, fair-minded people might assume that most of those likely to be taxed under this new law did not know and could not reasonably have anticipated that records of some companies would be later destroyed by the purchasers or subsequent owners, just as they could not possibly have foreseen that the Commonwealth would resort to retrospective legislation to recover from them the taxes unpaid as a result of the illegal acts of others. In short, retrospective law confers no opportunity for those affected to modify their behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> To those who doubt that some people who acted innocently will be hurt by this legislation I simply say: If there are none, there will be no loss to revenue if a fairness or innocence clause is inserted by way of an amendment of the type I understand to be sponsored by my colleagues the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack) and Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury). Nothing will be lost by presuming that there may have been vendor-shareholders who did not have any knowledge of the intention of purchasers or subsequent purchasers to act fraudulently. On the other hand, there is much to recommend the presumption of innocence until a guilty intent is proved. After all, that principle is enshrined in our common and criminal law. Speaking of criminal law, some of my constituents have said that provisions of this legislation are capable of imposing penalties in excess of those resulting from conviction of a criminal offence. They cite cases of promoters' agents or promoters' associates as defined in the Bill who may have conducted his or their business through a family company or trust. Not only can they be caught up in this but their wives and children are also assessable by virtue of their interest in the family company or trust. In some of these cases, and for a number of reasons, the family home will be lost. Even the families of convicted criminals are spared the loss of the family home. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter confronting the agents or associates of promoters should be aired in this debate. Many associates or agents received commissions and fees from parties at or closer to the source of promotions. All have been assessed, or remain assessable, for income tax on that remuneration. Those who may have already paid 60c in the dollar can now confidently expect to pay another 20c in the dollar. In fact if the promoter cannot be found and tagged for his share, agents or associates will face a combined tax bill in excess of 100 per cent of the income they derived as a result of their involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I touch now on another aspect of the Bill which deserves some passing comment. Reasons advanced by the Government in introducing this legislation indicate that those who 'benefited by the fraudulent evasion' practised by purchasers or subsequent purchasers can be required to pay the new tax calculated on income derived in a particular year of income up to the date the shares were sold. Vendor-shareholders were not the only ones to receive benefit from income derived, nor did they receive benefits equivalent to 100 per cent of that income earned. If fairness is integral to the reasons for this proposed law, the Bill's provisions should also recognise that promoters took their fee or commission and that the benefit derived by vendor-shareholders was reduced accordingly. The formula in the relevant sub-clause requires vendor-shareholders to now pay tax on the equivalent of 100 per cent of profits which will now be declared earned before the end of a given financial year. Plainly that assumed profit did not all find its way back into the pockets or bank accounts of vendor-shareholders. The promoters took their cut and this legislation may now tax vendor- shareholders on a benefit they did not receive, despite the avowed intention of the Government to take into account only benefits received by vendor- shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Having addressed remarks to some of the provisions in the Bill, I now turn to my basic reason for opposing this legislation. It stems from no sympathy for tax avoiders who have benefited, or may benefit in the future, from contrived or artificial schemes. It certainly does not relate to benefits which have accrued as a result of illegal acts. It has something to do with the Federal and State policies of my party which oppose retrospectivity. It also has something to do with extending the so-called recoupment beyond the stated intention of the Government. My opposition also has something to do with the penal aspects of the legislation. But overriding all the argument I have read and heard is my commitment to the need for community confidence in the certainty of the law; certainty that today's legal act does not tomorrow become the trigger for a penalty or obligation by law created subsequent to that legal act and applied retrospectively. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those who listened to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), could be forgiven for thinking that all of the tax strippers and those involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes were innocent. Our committee received a briefing from the Taxation Office. When officers from the Taxation Office were speaking to us it became very clear that those who took part in such schemes could not be innocent. This Government has become bigger than any government in our history. It takes more from ordinary people than ever before and gives less in return. Australian households stagger under the strain of the highest taxes and highest interest rates ever. The level of income tax revenue is proportionately one of the highest in the world and has grown dramatically in the last six years. This year income tax collections alone exceed all the taxes collected in the last year of the Whitlam Government, and that is without what we would have got but for the tax evasion. Real interest rates in Australia are the highest of any of the developed nations of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the fierce burden of the skyrocketing taxes and interest rates of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has increased, the living standards of ordinary hard-working Australian families have collapsed and the futures of many small businesses have been destroyed. For the average family to enjoy the same standard of living as six years ago would require an increase of nearly $20 a week in average weekly income. The Prime Minister promised small government and instead has created an insatiable monster. The same Government has been loth to proceed against the tax evaders whose activities have added to the burden carried by the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer. This Government was supposedly first made aware of the tax avoidance and tax evasion schemes at the beginning of 1978 . A decision was made later that year to enact new legislation against these schemes. That legislation, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, was passed at the end of 1980-after a two-year delay. Now, five years later, the Government is actually taking action. That delay is totally inexcusable. </PARA>
<PARA> During this period the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes mushroomed, causing huge revenue losses. The Government admits that up to $600m in lost taxes is involved although other estimates involve figures many times larger than this amount. The Government should either have proceeded with prosecutions to test the existing law or indicated, as soon as it was aware of these schemes, an intention to legislate against them back to the date of announcement. Huge amounts of tax remain unpaid. Only after the revelations of the extent of tax evaded contained in the McCabe-Lafranchi and Costigan reports was the Government forced by public pressure to act-or as one of the Government members said earlier, forced by the Australian Labor Party to act. I quote here from Bruce Pascoe, the President of the Taxation Institute of Australia, who in 1978 said:</PARA>
<PARA> During the past year or two, tax avoidance became big business in Australia. It became a disease which, being allowed to go unchecked, reached epidemic proportions. It is, perhaps, not going to far to say that the tax paying community in Australia almost went mad in its rush to become a party to a tax avoidance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Russell Mathews, addressing the Australian Institute of Political Science summer school in January 1980, referred to the present ad hoc system of taxation which makes income tax 'a voluntary tax for the wealthy non-salary earner'. He said that the essential problem of our income tax system:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . is not to make the rich pay higher rates of tax, or even more tax than the poor: It is to make the rich pay any income tax at all. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Bill O'Reilly, has consistently urged the outlawing of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. An article in the Age states:</PARA>
<PARA> The timetable provided at the start of the 500-odd page book of documents tabled in Parliament yesterday-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, 22 September-</PARA>
<PARA>shows that Mr O'Reilly repeatedly provided the Treasurer, Mr Howard, with arguments in favour of new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As early as May 1978 he said that widespread tax evasion through straw companies merited 'very severe' laws. </PARA>
<PARA> In mid-1979, Mr O'Reilly said there were 900 defunct companies on Victorian registers. One-third of them represented a tax loss of $6m. Cases in other States were worth another $3.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> By October 1980, Mr O'Reilly-</PARA>
<PARA>He seems to have been fairly persistent-</PARA>
<PARA>was warning that tax losses had risen to $128m from 733 companies stripped by a Sydney promoter who worked on a 'production line' basis using a computer. </PARA>
<PARA> Still no legislation appeared, as the Government showed drafts to back benchers and the taxation advisory committee over more than a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill passed through Parliament on 4 December 1980. One of the Government's speediest responses then took place: the bill received royal assent on the same evening. </PARA>
<PARA>Two years later I understand that only seven cases are pending under this legislation. I asked the Prime Minister in this House how many cases were proceeding. He promised to answer the question. I have since written to him about it but still have no answer so I am not even sure of the seven cases. I wish to read a little of the Commissioner's letter to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) dated 7 November 1979. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am gravely concerned to hear that there may be some question about going ahead with the planned legislation on this matter, the nature and level of penalties proposed being, I understand, a source of difficulty for some of your colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA>A few years later they are still having the same difficulties, which was apparent when we listened to them speaking tonight. Sometimes I cannot work out which side they are on. Mr O'Reilly continued:</PARA>
<PARA> May I make these points:</PARA>
<PARA> These activities are criminal in nature and fraudulent-they are not merely an aspect of tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that would have alerted the Treasurer immediately. I will repeat those words:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . criminal in nature and fraudulent . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The potential of the practices, if left unchecked, is such that legislative action against tax avoidance (including revision of Section 260) could be largely to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA> This activity is occurring on a large scale, daily. Although the full revenue implications are hard to estimate (because the parties fail to lodge returns and frustrate inquiries), I am having to write off large amounts of assessed income tax because companies have been stripped of assets. </PARA>
<PARA>That was happening in 1978, five years ago. The companies have had five years in which to continue to strip off assets. Mr O'Reilly continued:</PARA>
<PARA> One promoter has stripped over 1150 companies in Victoria which had income tax liabilities in the year prior to the strip totalling $14 million (23 being over $100,000). </PARA>
<PARA>I will not complete the reading of the letter because it is a very long one. I know that I am not allowed to incorporate it in Hansard so I will not ask to do so. In the debate tonight nobody has mentioned what could have been done with all of that money if we had collected it when it became due. Some of the money milked off by the tax cheats could have been used to build welfare homes and save countless families, including supporting single parents, the misery and despair they face now in renting in the private sector. It has been stated that:</PARA>
<PARA> Between 100,000 and 300,000 people are without any shelter at all; the estimates vary among those agencies who are struggling to cope with this destructive problem. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . they indicate a situation in which between one per cent and two per cent of the entire population have no roof over their heads. </PARA>
<PARA>So the tax cheats have not just taken our money; they have taken the roofs from over some people's heads. In the Age on 17 August S. Dobson, a north-west youth accommodation officer, in a letter to the editor said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that at a time when the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare warns that 'Government failure to combat youth homelessness will effectively nurture a skid row population in Australia'-</PARA>
<PARA>Further on the letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At a time of rapidly growing youth homelessness, the Government should be increasing its funding commitment to youth refuges, and to the establishment of medium and long-term households for homeless youth. </PARA>
<PARA>The tax cheats got off with the money that could have been used to house the homeless youth. The money has been drawn away from rape crisis centres and halfway houses by this Government. I know we have had bad economic times and that is the reason the Government has given less funding, but had it proceeded against tax cheats in 1978 when it should have we might have got that money back . There are hundreds of examples of where the lost money could have been used if the Treasurer and the Government had been as assiduous over the past five years as the Taxation Commissioner urged them to be. </PARA>
<PARA> What about job creation schemes? They could have flourished. During the time when the tax cheats had been ripping us off this Government has been urging workers not to press for wage increases. It has delayed pensioners' twice yearly increases-at one stage it cost $30m. Because of the Government's harsh economic policies Australian families have suffered growing hardship over the past seven years. The only industry to flourish has been the tax evasion industry while the Treasurer sat and did nothing. That makes a mockery of the Treasurer's statement of 9 March 1982 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has done more to wipe out tax avoidance in this country than any Government since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA>Again on 14 September 1982 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe if one examines the record that what has been done by this Government in the campaign against tax avoidance is one which could not have been equalled by any other Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know of any other government which would have stood by for five years and let the avoidance industry grow to the extent which it did grow. This is the Government which ripped off the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer for five years while it refused to move against its mates in big business. The PAYE taxpayer has subsidised the total expenditure of the Government while the tax cheats go free. Even at this late hour the Government has given them another 12 months to avoid paying up. It is a disgraceful record which in itself indicts the Treasurer and the Government-as the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) did earlier when he declared the Treasurer culpable after 33 months of inactivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The saddest thing about the sorry history of tax evasion and tax avoidance is that while the wealthy doctors in Sydney are selling their debts to their wives and getting off almost scot-free from income tax, the Taxation Commissioner, who has been trying to capture the Treasurer's attention to do something about this, was diligently tracking down any PAYE taxpayer who attempted to get away with any failure to pay up. And so the Commissioner and the Department should, but the contrast is there. The Treasurer has presided over a philosophy of 'let the rich get rich at the expense of the PAYE taxpayer'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill which establishes a most dangerous precedent-a precedent that will change the whole concept and application of law in Australia. This Bill reaches into the unknown depths of retrospectivity. It seeks to go back 10 years to shift the liabilities for actions that have been performed over that period. In a democracy such as we have in Australia the order of our society is based around the rule of law. Our people base their actions on the certainty of the law and they rely on the law to protect those who have acted within the confines of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill now seeks to change all that. People who have acted within the confines of the law over the past 10 years will now have their actions made illegal and they will be required to pay a heavy cost because a new law has been backdated. Such a manoeuvre by legislators must surely undermine public confidence in the law. On the surface the Bill is designed to recover company tax that has not been paid, and I am sure that all of us would agree that every citizen has a moral obligation to pay his or her legitimate taxes. However, the payment of taxes is in fact a legal obligation and not a moral obligation. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of Government and Opposition spokesmen have said that people who evaded tax through the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes have been morally wrong and that this legislation is necessary to correct a moral injustice. But moral standards are a mater of individual subjective judgment. What is immoral to one person may be quite moral to another. The Government is now making a subjective judgment to the effect that for the past 10 years some people have been morally wrong and it is now passing retrospective legislation to correct their sins. If such action by government is acceptable, who can say that at some time in the future a different government will not decide that the present methods of tax minimisation are immoral and therefore pass retrospective legislation to recoup the lost tax?</PARA>
<PARA> Businessmen now carry forward losses, farmers write off the cost of farm improvements, and parents claim the education expenses of their children. It might seem inconceivable to us that a future government would deem these or other practices to be immoral, but it could happen. The only way in which to ensure that future governments cannot make today's legal actions subsequently illegal is to enshrine the principle that taxation law will not be changed retrospectively. If that principle is not endorsed by all political parties, no person, whether he or she be in business or otherwise, can confidently claim any tax deduction, because that may be deemed to be immoral in the future and retrospectively legislated against. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole business of retrospectivity is so disruptive that it must be stopped before it is allowed to get started. We need to look closely at the events that led to the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. Governments of both political persuasions have known about tax evasion and bottom-of-the-harbour schemes for many years. Whilst some revenue was lost it was not considered to be serious. The earlier loose application of section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act by the High Court of Australia left little room for artifical tax evasion schemes. However, the change in interpretation during the 1970s by the Barwick High Court led to an explosion of various artificial schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr O'Reilly, was well aware of the growing loss to revenue, but his appeals for urgent corrective legislation were not responded to quickly enough by the Government or by government departments. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wrote to Treasurer Lynch in July 1977 asking for urgent action. In 1978 the present Treasurer (Mr Howard) asked the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) for a Crown law opinion as to the adequacy of existing law. Despite several reminders from the Treasurer it took 10 months before that opinion was received. When legislation was produced other departments objected to certain clauses, which led to further negotiations and redrafting. It was not until December 1980 that the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was passed. That legislation finally stopped the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. During the preceding years Mr O'Reilly constantly pointed out the growing losses to revenue through the legitimate actions of vendor-shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Vendor-shareholders, however, cannot be blamed for the losses to revenue. Citizens in the community can act only according to the law and its interpretation by the courts. If the law is inadequately framed the fault must lie with the legislators, not with the citizens who use the law or with the courts who interpret the law. One of the dangers with this legislation is the undermining of public confidence in the High Court. People who used these tax minimisation schemes did so under the law, according to the interpretation given by the High Court. Despite the fact that they acted in conformity with court decisions, they now find that they will have their affairs thrown into confusion because of retrospective legislation. How, then, can people act in future with confidence if the decisions and interpretations by the highest court of the land can be made null and void because legislators pass back dated laws? Some people have said that there is a history of retrospective legislation in this country and other countries, but I ask honourable members to reflect on whether there is a history of retrospective legislation that overrules the highest court in the land and also changes the whole concept and application of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view the whole sorry state of affairs has arisen because the administrative process is not working properly. Certainly it is not working the way the vast majority of Australian people want it to. It seems to me that government administration is breaking down because of the rigid discipline of the party system. That means that political expediency and point scoring override all other considerations. No thought is given to the effect on public administration. Leaders will use every opportunity to score a point or 'tip a bucket' on their opponents. Perhaps they think that that wins them public favour or support from their followers. One thing is certain: While politicians concentrate their attention on political expediency and point scoring, the administration of government will get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, above all else, the Australian people expect their governments to be good, effective and efficient administrations and also that the affairs of government will be conducted honestly and with high integrity and principles. It is about time that politicians in this country started to respond to what the people want rather than what they themselves try to impose on the people. Naturally, while this point scoring battle is taking place the process of public administration is left to the public servants. Knowing that their jobs are protected by permanency, the public servants are not concerned about efficiency or giving service to the public but are much more concerned about promotion up the promotional ladder. In all of this, the constant losers are the Australian people. Revelations by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, inquiries into the Health Department, the Australian Dairy Corporation and the meat substitution scandal, all show clear evidence how government administration is breaking down and the effect that is having on the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people want politicians to co-operate more on a bipartisan basis so as to improve our public administration. If a good idea is put up by the Opposition-and that does not happen very often-it should be looked at objectively. Equally, if there is a problem with administration, all parties should be more concerned to make improvements rather than simply score political points. The fact that our present system is not working properly is self evident . The system needs to be improved so that we can go forward into the twenty- first century with confidence. Our present system has a long history of tradition and hard won experience. The good features need to be retained while improving the administrative processes to take account of the modern computer age. </PARA>
<PARA> I am in no dispute with the Government over its determination to recover unpaid taxes. But, in doing so, the Government must be constrained within the parameters of the law in the same way as any Australian citizen is constrained by the law. The Government will have my wholehearted support if it recovers unpaid taxes by using existing laws. But we can never allow governments in this country to fiddle with retrospective laws simply to suit their own convenience. The use of retrospective laws is so disruptive, so potentially dangerous and so destructive of confidence in the law that such laws should never be considered as an option for any government. Therefore, the practice of retrospectivity must be stopped before it is allowed to get started. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why is this legislation being debated tonight? The proximate cause is, of course, the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. I will have something to say about that aspect later. However, I believe that the cause of this situation is much more fundamental. I think that this legislation reflects serious divisions in the class which the Liberal Party and, for that matter, the National Party represent. Over a large number of years, the Government has been supporting that small 10 per cent-the upper class of this country-at the expense of everyone else in relation to taxation and the distribution of wealth as a whole. The distribution of wealth in this country has been getting worse and worse in relation to 90 per cent of the community vis-a-vis the top 10 per cent. Of course the Government, unlike the governments of many other countries, does not provide figures on the distribution of wealth but some have been compiled by sociologists recently. I will refer to some of those figures because I think they are very relevant to the whole question. A study carried out by Phil Raskell determined that the top 10 per cent of the community own 58.5 per cent of the wealth of this country. The next 40 per cent own 33.57 of the wealth. The next 40 per cent own 7.66 per cent of the wealth and the lowest 10 per cent own 0.27 per cent of the wealth. In other words, half of the Australian people own less than 8 per cent of all the wealth of this country and the top 10 per cent own more than the other 90 per cent put together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is in this context that one might ask the questions: Why is this so? Why has it happened? How has it arisen? One of the major ways in which it has arisen has to do with the deliberate policies of conservative governments over the years to do absolutely nothing to collect properly taxes from the wealthy of this country . It is because there has been no concern with collecting taxes from the wealthy , in the form of either wealth taxes or proper income taxes that this situation has arisen. There has also been a failure to prosecute companies. This was revealed quite clearly in the Costigan report. In some cases companies simply disappeared and were not heard of for years. All a person had to do was to turn himself or his earnings into a company, put the letters 'Ltd' after his name and the Commissioner of Taxation would not bother about him. Why were so many companies not investigated by the Commissioner of Taxation when individuals were ? Mr Deputy Speaker, if you or I do not put in our tax returns what happens? We get a note from the Commissioner of Taxation pretty smartly asking where they are. But if somebody represents his income as company income, other things will happen. He will not be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot convince anybody in this country that this has not been a deliberate decision of a government which represents the wealthy and the top 10 per cent of the people to whom I referred. Not only has this situation prevailed but also massive tax concessions have been given to companies and corporations. These concessions increased in the 1981 Budget by 56 per cent to over $1,000m. The 1982 Budget allocated nearly $2,000m in concessions to companies and major corporations. But that was not enough in providing ways of avoiding taxation or providing taxation concessions for these extremely greedy people. They could not even be bothered to use the so-called legal tax avoidance mechanisms. They went to the point of total and utter corruption in the sense that they used illegal schemes because they were simpler. That is the whole point. They could not even be bothered appointing their accountants to use so-called legal tax avoidance measures; so they went as far as using these totally illegal and discredited schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has this distribution of wealth been allowed to continue for so long without something being done in the area of tax avoidance? That question has been asked time and again. People have referred to the incompetence of the Government. People have said, including honourable members on the other side of the House, that something ought to have been done earlier. The fundamental reason is this: The interests that represent the Liberal Party and the National Party are tied to those interests which stand to benefit by these tax avoidance and evasion measures. That is the fundamental point that must come out of this debate. What has happened as a result of this failure to persist in examining these schemes? The result has been that the other 90 per cent of Australians have had to pay much more in both direct and indirect taxation. That burden was imposed by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) at a time when he was doing very little to stop these other schemes, very little to investigate them and, in particular, very little to have the offenders prosecuted. </PARA>
<PARA> When we speak of the lack of prosecution we should not blame just the Treasurer . What about the Attorney-General's Department? What was it on about? What about the Australian Federal Police? There has been so little in the way of prosecution in this whole area, especially in relation to these totally and blatantly illegal schemes, that one must ask whether there has been massive and utter incompetence or, as has already been established in the course of other inquiries initiated by this House and in other ways, corruption in the sense that there have been deliberate attempts to frustrate legal process. </PARA>
<PARA> One might then ask: Why has the Government, after all these years, finally brought the matter to a head? That it has done so has created considerable division within the ranks of the conservatives. Costigan showed that the greed had gone beyond any kind of rationality, beyond any kind of acceptable behaviour , even in a context in which the wealthy were allowed to get away with massive tax evasion. It was only at the point at which Costigan revealed the extent of the illegality that the Government was forced to act. But there was another reason, an economic reason. It was that the Government, as a result of its disastrous economic policy, had not been able to come to grips with the increasing Budget deficit and its need for revenue. Even though it had imposed massive income taxes, had derived $3,400m from petrol tax, and had imposed other indirect taxes, it still had not been able to deal with the fundamental problem of this economy-the fiscal crisis of the state and its inability to pay for its own services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will talk about that on another occasion, do not worry. I am not intimidated by that question. There are many answers to such a question. To return to the issue at hand, that fiscal crisis has created a division within the conservatives. There have been those who have said: 'We have to do more to collect this money because it has gone beyond a joke; it is now a ridiculous situation. We cannot even sustain a minimal level of services'. The Government tried cutting quite a few services but found that it had to dish out more and more in allowances to the upper class and to the big corporations. In the end the Government needed more money and the Costigan inquiry provided it with the excuse it needed to try to collect some of the back taxes owing. Of course, not everyone agreed. Some had friends who were going to be required to pay back these amounts of money. Events have unfolded in two stages. There have been incredible debates and fights within the Liberal and National parties. As a consequence, the Treasurer has given in to various interests in regard to important clauses of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall refer to two of the clauses which clearly show that he has given in to those interests to a considerable degree. The first concerns the fact that one can now pay, over 12 months, the taxes owed. There is no requirement to prove that one is in need, that one cannot pay. The right to pay over 12 months has been made automatic. We would have considered reasonable a clause which said: ' If you cannot pay in 30 days you can put a case to the Commissioner of Taxation and see whether that case stands up. In that instance he might be able to give you an extension of time'. That was not good enough for the friends of the Government. It was necessary to provide a full period of 12 months to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members that these schemes have been denounced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), by the Treasurer, and by most of the front bench and have been described as being morally totally insupportable. The people who are responsible for these schemes have now been told that they can pay over a period of 12 months. The Government, with its Budget deficit, cannot afford this 12-month period. The whole nation is going bankrupt. If that is the period which this Government wants to put forward, why does it not give ordinary people 12 months within which to pay their taxes? I also remind honourable members on that point that people do not have an onus to prove that they need 12 months. It is automatic that they will get it. </PARA>
<PARA> A further absurdity in another clause I think clearly illustrates the general point I have been making about the support of the upper wealthy class by this Government, which does not represent anybody other than the top 10 per cent. I wish now to say something about that second clause in the legislation. There is now a clause to exempt companies that might have gone through a tax avoidance scheme in the first instance. If it can be proven that the promoter to whom a company was sold was intending to carry out some form of tax avoidance-even if that so-called legal tax avoidance was not accepted by the Commissioner of Taxation-then the person can claim that a genuine sale had been made. In that situation the person may be able to escape the tax. This is an extremely serious loophole in the legislation which was introduced as a backdoor way of allowing a substantial number-probably up to one-quarter of the people who were involved in these schemes-to get out of paying their recoupment tax. I believe it is a further example of where the true philosophy of this Government lies, of where the Government's heart is, even though it pretends to us now that it is really into punishing these people by recouping the tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say one other thing about this matter. Those honourable members opposite who are opposing this legislation on the retrospectivity principle are talking as if the Government were imposing some kind of criminal penalty on these people. All that the Government is doing is collecting taxes; it is not imposing a criminal penalty. I remind honourable members that, as far as the Opposition is concerned, the fourth clause that is relevant in this legislation is that in which the Government has tried to stipulate that even if a person refuses to pay back taxes that person cannot be named by the Commissioner of Taxation. In other words, there is virtually no sanction against him. There is no criminal sanction. A similar situation exists where we think that our tax repayment will be $1,000 and the Taxation Commissioner sends us a note saying: ' I am sorry, it is $2,000'. That is the position into which these people will be put. I believe that it is absolutely disgraceful that anyone in this House is opposing this legislation in view of what has happened and what continues to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the principles involved and the causes involved reflect back on the class situation, this upper class of 10 per cent with which the Liberal Party and national Party are involved and whom they represent. It is because of this that members of those parties have had fights amongst themselves as to whether to put forward this legislation. Had it not been for the pressure of the media, had it not been for the pressure of Costigan, and had it not been for the pressure of the Opposition, this legislation would not have come forward to this House and we would still be in the position where the rich would be paying very little tax and the rest of us would have to pay more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time available I should like to focus attention on two areas. I refer, first of all, to the underlying principle which this Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [No. 2] throws into relief and, secondly, to some points of fundamental concern that emerge from the existing draft Bill which is presently before the House. Much has been said in this debate about the principle of retrospectivity. Some honourable members have embraced it as though it is a principle which in some way prevents or should prevent Parliament from passing laws which have any retrospective operation. Of course, the truth is that there has never been a principle of English or Australian law that Parliament cannot pass retrospective laws. It has always been part of our law that we can. But also it has always been part of the law that there is a statutory presumption that in interpreting an Act it is presumed not to have a retrospective application by reason of the injustice that retrospective applications can bring out. But it is not always unjust to enact a law that has a retrospective application. This has been pointed out on many occasions. It was pointed out by Mr Justice Isaacs many years ago in the case of George Hudson Ltd v. Australian Timber Workers' Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Justice Isaacs said:</PARA>
<PARA>What may seem unjust when regarded from the standpoint of one person affected may be absolutely just when a broad view is taken of all who are affected. There is no remedial Act which does not affect some vested right, but, when contemplated in its total effect, justice may be overwhelmingly on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA>The power is there and, much as I respect the views which have been expressed on the other side, such as the views expressed by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), I think that on balance the decision that the Government has made is a correct one. If one looks for the circumstance that justifies the application of a retrospective operation of a law to the kind of facts that we are looking at here, it is surely this: That, at the end of the day, whether wittingly or unwittingly, vendor-shareholders-I am concentrating attention on them for the time being-obtained a benefit as a result of what in the final analysis was a stripping operation designed to leave companies denuded of assests and unable to pay tax. They may have been unaware of what was going to happen or they may have known what was going to happen. But certainly in all cases there was an actual or contingent liability that hung over the companies. Certainly this liability was not satisfied. It was not legally avoided; it was simply not met because the companies were deliberately stripped of assests and so on balance it seems to me that those who profited should make good what was lost. </PARA>
<PARA> It is on that point that I part company with some of my friends on this side of the House. Simply put, an avoidance scheme does not involve illegality or evasion, but the schemes covered by the Bill involve at the end of the day illegality or evasion and that is the fundamental distinction between avoidance and evasion-between what is legal and what is illegal. That having been said, and that in my view being the justification for the legislation in terms of principle, I should like to say something upon some points of fundamental concern. In making the comments that I am now going to make, I will make it perfectly clear that I am not being critical of the draftsmen who have had a most complicated task, nor am I being critical of the Government's efforts to meet the views of a number of us who have thought that there were areas of the Bill which threw up what might be called unintended consequences. The Government and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) have been more than open and more than willing to meet the constructive criticisms that have been put. </PARA>
<PARA> That being said, let me just touch on a few points. First of all, if one goes to the definition of 'eligible promoters class' one sees that this covers a wide number of people. I know that the very word 'promoters' is one which engenders almost an hysteria from some of the members of the Opposition. But if one looks to the definition one will see that it includes not only people who would be promoters but also others who are agents, who are brokers, who may have one share in a company which was a purchasing company or who may have been a director in a company which was a purchasing company and who by reason of a variety of other associations can be brought in as part of the eligible promoters class. What then happens? Those individuals are subject to a joint and several liability which is either 20 per cent, or in certain circumstances 100 per cent, of the taxable amount, that is, the unpaid company tax. In principle it seems to me that that is unjust for the reason that the 20 per cent cannot be regarded as a calculation of an estimated benefit. Certainly the 100 per cent liability cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give one instance of cases where the 100 per cent liability will apply. That is made perfectly plain on page 57 of the explanatory memorandum where it is pointed out that cases within the 100 per cent liability for the eligible promoters class include 'schemes under which the vendor-shareholders were all individuals and all those persons died before any assessment to vendors recoupment tax was made'. In short, the state of health of other individuals determines whether a person in a class has to pay 20 per cent or has to pay 100 per cent. That seems to me to be fundamentally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I pass on to another point. Those who are jointly and severally liable, once they become within the class, unless they can be excluded under clause 11, which as presently drafted is a somewhat cumbersome provision, are liable to the extent provided for under the Bill, whether or not they had an intent to benefit improperly or illegally. That seems to me to be fundamentally contrary to principle. </PARA>
<PARA> On a somewhat different subject, it will be noted that if one examines the Bill there are provisions relating to beneficiaries. It is perfectly plain that in certain circumstances beneficiaries-that is, beneficiaries who are beneficiaries of a trust and who are children-can become liable to recoupment tax. We all know how trusts can operate where parents control trusts and as a matter of convenience distribute to children notionally but, in fact, the money goes into a business or into an investment which is controlled by the parents and which may, of course, fail. What we are seeking to do in certain circumstances is to charge children with a liability for a benefit that they never received in circumstances that they could not control. I am bound to say that does not seem to me to be a just approach to the kind of problem that we face. I hope the Government will take that point as it has taken a number of other points that have been put to it and see what can be done to overcome that sort of problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I pass on to one or two things said by members of the Opposition. The things which have been said reveal very clearly the distinction between the approach taken by the Government parties and the approach taken by the Opposition. First of all, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) made the position quite plain. He said he was looking forward to fully retrospective legislation. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) said that he did not need a precedent. It is perfectly plain that if a Labor Government were in power it would not be troubled in the least by any injustice, nor would it be troubled in the least by the prospect of setting aside transactions which were legal in the past. It would apply palm tree justice. Secondly, it would seem from what the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) said-if he has any influence upon the affairs of the Australian Labor Party-that we can look forward to a capital gains tax if that party ever gets into power. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I come back to the question of exposure-the concept of trial by Parliament or by the media. Much criticism was levelled against the deletion from the Bill of the provisions which require or confer a right on the Commissioner of Taxation to report those who have failed to pay recoupment tax. That is symptomatic of the McCarthyism of the Left that this Parliament has suffered from for quite some time now. It is a very good thing that that provision has gone out of the Bill. One thing that emerged very plainly is that there is a refusal to acknowledge or an incapacity to understand that there is a difference between what is legal and what is illegal. Whatever one's views may be about tax avoidance, there is a fundamental difference between what is within the law and what is outside the law. It is that fundamental difference that it is perfectly plain the Labor Party does not intend to observe should it ever get into government. That is the fundamental difference which this legislation does observe. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on these points: It has been said by the honourable member for Tangney that the rule of law is central to our society. It most certainly is. Our law, in terms of the application of laws passed now to events from the past, has always admitted of exceptions where the circumstances were sufficiently special, sufficiently compelling, and where the public interest was sufficiently important, so as to outweigh the damage that laws which have a retrospective operation can do to the general administration of justice. It is always a fine judgment. I am bound to say that the views that have been put from my side of the House to the effect that there can never be a breach of this principle are all too black and white. Quite often it is a question of weighing grey against grey. It is always a question of making a very fine judgment. If there is one thing that this debate has illustrated it is the importance which the Liberal Party and the National Party attach to the principle of law. The debate that this legislation has evoked outside this Parliament and within the Liberal Party and the National Party-with the exeption of some obviously self-interested parties-has been a debate of principle between people who are concerned with principle. That is the strength of our coalition parties. I hope that this is the last time we will have to debate in this Parliament the application of this principle. </PARA>

It is strange that someone on the Government side should raise that. When I came into this House I did some research into a speech made by Sir William McMahon, the former member for Lowe. I recall as a union official hearing over the radio a speech made in this place in which Sir William McMahon extolled the virtues of Lord Hailsham-another one of the Government's class-about retrospectivity. It was important to me at that time because the Government was talking about the Curran scheme and the evils of retrospectivity.

We had to obey the rules of the organisation. I went into a ballot because I could do nothing but follow the registered rules of the organisation. I won the ballot, and the hypocrites of this Government passed retrospective legislation which said that it did not matter what I had done in the past, I had to comply with a particular regulation which said that there had to be a court-controlled ballot.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The current Prime Minister, John Malcolm Fraser, said that. He did not go on to say that he would establish it at the bottom of the harbour. He went on to say a number of things about Medibank. He said that there would be jobs for those who wanted to work and that there would be no international safaris by members of parliament. That is a real joke, is it not? We know about those promises. Honourable members opposite will have to front up to them regardless of whether the Prime Minister has called their bluff about 4 December. The Prime Minister's Government promised to establish a sound basis for economic responsibility. In fact, his policies have resulted in a massive increase in the amount of tax paid by the pay-as-you-earn wage and salary earner. This is confirmed in report No. 4 of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. On page 90 the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is of some interest to note the comparison between the growth in taxable incomes of individuals compared to the growth in taxable incomes of private companies during the period 1966-1980 . . . Whereas with inflation there has been a great increase-sixfold-in the taxable incomes of individuals, there has been only a slight increase in the taxable incomes of private companies. </PARA>
<PARA>That says it all. The people whom members of the Liberal Party represent have been paying less and less in taxes. The Government appointed the Costigan Royal Commission; the Government supported it. The Government did that to try to get at the unions and it backfired on the Government. Now it is in trouble and it does not know how to get off the hook. It will not get off the hook. Pages 89 and 90 of the Costigan report refer to the failure to prosecute in cases where asset stripping has been identified. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The statistics for this type of operation-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, pre-tax profit stripping-</PARA>

<PARA>The year 1977 was a good year; 1979 was a really good year; and 1980 was a bonanza year. Costigan's report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to assume, and I do, that had this prosecution been brought in 1975, or 1976, or even 1977, it would have inhibited the growth of these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the record speaks for itself and shows that this Government had the opportunity to move and recover those moneys that the people whom honourable members opposite represent have ripped off the taxpayers, the workers in the factories, for many years. We must remember that the Fraser Government has tried and will continue to try to shift the focus of blame for tax avoidance and evasion on to the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Perhaps it is an irony that a report which set out to investigate the painters and dockers, most of whom vote for honourable members opposite-a report whose results were eagerly awaited by the Prime Minister and his gang-has instead exposed the Government. Now the Prime Minister is trying to redirect the attention of the electorate to the union but he will not succeed and neither will any honourable member who tries to support him. </PARA>
<PARA> At page 3 of the Costigan report, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I think I should say something about the range of the Commission's inquiries. As I indicated in the Third Interim Report the Commission, to the surprise of many, found itself investigating the evasion industry. Such investigation arose from its discovery of the use being made of-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QK5">Mr GROOM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have decided for reasons which I will explain that I cannot support these Bills. First, I want to say that I believe that private members have a duty and a right to speak out and to voice their opposition if they believe that the Government is presenting unreasonable and unfair legislation. I consider that this is such an occasion. I realise that the Government is under considerable pressure from the public to act against tax evaders. We are all aware of that. I believe that the Government's response in the form of this Bill is bad both in principle and in form. Clearly the Government has a responsibility to make certain that tax cheats do not prosper. I am sure that we would all agree with that. It must ensure that we have effective laws in place to catch them and see to it that those laws are properly enforced. But in dealing with this evil of tax evasion it is vitally important that the Government does not disregard fundamental principles. John Locke, the great political theorist, published his famous treatise on civil government in 1690. I believe his words are worth remembering tonight. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Who ever has the supreme power of any commonwealth is bound to govern by established standing laws, promulgated and known to the people and not by ex- temporary decrees. There must be independent and upright judges, who are to decide controversies by those laws. And all this is to be directed to no other end but the peace, safety and public good of the people. </PARA>
<PARA>Locke was speaking of the rule of law when he said that any commonwealth is bound to govern by established standing laws promulgated and known to the people . There is no doubt that the Bills now before the Parliament offend against this basic democratic principle which is based on the belief that it is unjust to punish a person or impose imposts on him for conduct which was not contrary to the law at the time that conduct occurred. The injustice inherent in retrospective law has been recognised from the time formal laws were first created. Laws were pronounced, published and made known to the people so that they had an opportunity to act according to the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Past conduct cannot be influenced by subsequent law. This is such a trite legislative principle that it should be unnecessary to cite any authority to support it. Suffice it to say that of the great legal authorities-Cicero, Coke and Blackstone and respected modern jurists such as Dixon, Hailsham and Denning to name a few-have all appreciated the dangers inherent in retrospective laws. Further evidence of concern can be found in our common law rules of statutory interpretation, which have been referred to earlier, pronouncements by the United Nations and in the constitutions of the United States of America and France. The Liberal Party platform specifically warns against retrospective tax laws when it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The rights of the taxpayer are safeguarded . . . by ensuring that taxation adjustments do not have retrospective effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the great bulk of legal authority warns against retrospective legislation, an attempt has been made to justify the present legislation by quoting comments made by Lord Greene and Howard de Walden's case. The honourable member for Labor (Mr Barry Jones) made reference to that case in his speech earlier in this debate. The real fact is that that case did not deal with retrospective legislation as such but merely with the retroactive application in 1942-during the war years-of the provisions of the Finance Act of 1936. The legislation that we are now dealing with is very different from the legislation that was dealt with in that case. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills are plainly retrospective. They seek to impose a new tax liability on persons not previously liable and to backdate that liability so that it applies to transactions which occurred as long ago as 1 January 1972. How does the Government justify acting against this well established principle that laws imposing new imposts should not be made retrospective? There has been an attempt to justify it firstly on the basis of fairness but this is a vague concept. Fairness is a very vague concept. When is something fair and when is it unfair? Is it fair to allow tax deductions for a business lunch or for a business visit overseas but to impose duties on a paraplegic who might import a wheelchair into this country? What about family trusts, partnerships or companies which were formed for the purposes of lessening a person's tax liability? Are these arrangements fair on people who cannot take advantage of them? Will we now have legislation to set aside such arrangements to take effect from some arbitrary past date? It has also been suggested that people acted immorally or unethically some years ago and so, because of that, we should now act against them by invoking this legislation. But it is dangerous to speak of morals in this way. Who decides what is moral and who decides what is immoral? I commend to the House comments recently made by the Law Council of Australia in a submission to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on this very legislation when it said:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is appropriate to pass laws to overcome what are considered to be immoral or obnoxious practices or practices contrary to the public interests so as to make illegal those practices in the future, it is not in our submission proper to legislate to make conduct now determined to be improper or contrary to the public interest because of changed public opinion, and relate that changed opinion back to the time when the conduct was undertaken. That desire for change should not be given effect so as to make unlawful acts which were lawful at the time they were undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>Does the Government justify the legislation on the basis of the guilt of shareholders affected by the legislation? Apparently not, because the Government has made the point that it is not concerned about the question of guilt or innocence; it is simply a matter of collecting tax from those individuals who were shareholders in companies and promoters. Is it because of the amount of money involved? The question then is: How much money does one need to lose as revenue before retrospective legislation can be justified? Is it $10m, is it $ 20m or is it $100m? What price tag does one put on a principle such as this? Or has this legislation been placed before us because of politically inspired Australian Labor Party pressures which have undoubtedly built up since the McCabe-Lafranchi report of May 1982 and the report of July 1982 of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union? I regret to say that I think that that subject is closer to the mark. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that when the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill was debated in December 1980, when we knew that many millions of dollars had been lost to revenue, the Government appeared then not to be willing to consider the retrospective collection of lost taxes. During the debate the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> Quite obviously it is objectionable to have any retrospectivity regarding the penalties. </PARA>
<PARA>Again there are some words which are not relevant. He was responding to a question put by an honourable member from the other side. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> That means that the recovery of the back tax, even if that were an acceptable thing to attempt, would involve an entirely separate set of proceedings. I think that is the immediate problem. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously there was then a reluctance to travel down this dangerous track of retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Service does not come out of this whole episode very well. It might be unfair now to criticise the Commissioner of Taxation and public servants who have a responsibility to protect the revenue because the public perception and the public mood have certainly changed over the last few years. But it should not be forgotten that the Commissioner of Taxation has a very special responsibility to ensure that tax evasion does not occur. Indeed, under the Income Tax Assessment Act the Commissioner has a commission from this very Parliament to properly administer the Income Tax Assessment Act. Officers of the Australian Taxation Office and of the Attorney-General's Department clearly failed to act with proper determination and keenness some years ago when they knew that millions of dollars were being lost as a result of bottom-of-the- harbour schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people learned in the law are of the view that there were laws in existence at the time which could have been used at least to deter people from entering into these schemes. An alternative approach would have been for some statement or warning to have been issued at that early time. No doubt the public servants will continue to defend their position and will say: 'Yes, we had laws. We had conspiracy laws, we had provisions of the companies Acts and we had section 231 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, but the problem is that we did not have the evidence to back up our case. The problem was in the lack of evidence'. But they had advice from Mr Brinsden, Q. C., given at the end of 1974, and I believe it is clear on the evidence that that advice was not pursued with proper vigour. If officers were then concerned about the state of the evidence they may or may not have had to support their cases, they should have sought further advice from senior counsel on the evidence rather than write off Mr Brinsden's opinion as theoretical. It is clear that some very costly omissions were made at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference has been made to the opinion of Mr Arthur Webb Q.C., of the Melbourne Bar, given in September 1978. That opinion was part of the papers which the Treasurer tabled in response to the motion from the Senate. That opinion, I believe, tends to confirm the criticism directed at departmental officers rather than to refute it. Why should we go over this ground? I believe we should go over this ground because this lack of diligence is very relevant to the propriety of this retrospective legislation. The failure of the Public Service to act with reasonable speed and the failure of the Government to act at an earlier point in time do not show a long-standing and serious degree of concern which should have been present if this legislation could have been justified. In other words, we now throw our hands in the air and say: 'This is dreadful. It cannot be tolerated. We must have retrospective legislation'. The fact is that the Government or its officers failed to stop the practice though they knew about it for much of the 10-year period which is covered by these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> In asking the Parliament to pass retrospective law, the Government should satisfy honourable members that the law is necessary and that existing law is and was insufficient. The legal opinions that have been tabled in this Parliament to date suggest that existing laws were sufficient to stamp out these schemes. Of course, I recognise that it is much more convenient to collect tax under a strict type of legislation rather than to have to establish some form of liability. Regrettably honourable members have been left in the dark about the state of the existing law. We do not have the advantage of opinions from the first or second law officers of the Crown, from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) or from the Solicitor-General, on this important question. Some senior counsel have given opinions that section 231 of the Income Tax Assessment Act would catch the guilty parties involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and would enable much of the tax to be collected. This section provides, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Any person who, or any company on whose behalf the public officer, or a director, servant or agent of the company, by any wilful act, default or neglect , or by any fraud, act or contrivance whatever, avoids or attempts to avoid assessment or taxation shall be guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Penalty: Not less than $50, or more than $1,000 and, in addition, the Court may order the person to pay to the Commissioner a sum not exceeding double the amount of tax that has been avoided or attempted to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of a company, that section may catch only the company. However, section 5 of the Crimes Act, which covers people who aid, abet, counsel and so on, would cover vendor shareholders 'knowingly concerned in' the commission of the offence by the company and, in consequence, they could be convicted of the principal offence. Again unfortunately, that section was never put to the test. Had those provisions been enforced, many people may have been deterred from entering into these schemes and the loss of revenue could have been very much less. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make an important point relating to practical government administration. Retrospective legislation could be used to cover up neglect and inefficiency in administration and may encourage those charged with the responsibility of collecting revenue and enforcing the law to believe that they need not proceed quickly but have an abundance of time in which to act. After all, the Government could always legislate retrospectively to overcome any problem. Much has been said about the involvement of innocent people in these schemes. When we speak of innocents we really need to define our terms. ' Innocents' can mean so many different things. Do we mean by 'innocents' people who did not know that the company would eventually go to the bottom-of-the- harbour, do we mean people who did not know that the company would not pay all of its tax, or do we mean people who honestly believed they were acting within the law? Many states of mind are involved in these transactions. However, I strongly believe that there are people who could properly be said to have acted innocently and who will be caught by this legislation. Because tax evasion is so bad, it is easy to believe that everyone who benefits is guilty. But many people who are shareholders may not take any real interest in a company's operations. Some may be wives or mothers, others sons or daughters of the principal actors. They may merely sign forms. In infant and trust situations there were many innocent people. Other people took advice and were assured by respected advisers that these schemes were approved by the High Court in Slutzkin's case. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt some promoters and some of the shareholders had a guilty state of mind when they became involved in the schemes, but equally I am sure that decent and cautious people were enticed into the schemes on advice given by professional people that they trusted. It is said that the legislation will not penalise anyone because it is only requiring them to repay the money that the company should have paid. But when people organise their affairs according to the law, they obviously suffer if they are asked to repay the money years later. These people may have invested their money in their business and perhaps taken on more employees, or they may have paid off a debt or spent the money in some other way . In most cases the money would not be just sitting idle in some bank account. </PARA>
<PARA> Who will benefit from the money that will be recovered under this legislation? We have heard about fairness and the need to be fair to pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. I agree with all that. But will the beneficiaries of this legislation really be ordinary PAYE taxpayers? Frankly, I doubt it. Perhaps the Government will give a guarantee that it will earmark funds recovered for redistribution to PAYE taxpayers. But the real result will simply be a transfer of funds from the private sector to the public sector, with the Public Service absorbing the additional revenue to finance its continuing expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I do not support tax evaders and tax cheats. They are parasites on the community. But this legislation is not the appropriate way to overcome the problems. In fact, this legislation is so complex and so clumsy that I suspect that it may ultimately prove to be ineffective and a major setback in our efforts to stamp out tax evasion in this country. There is a real danger that this legislation may harm innocent people, may encourage inefficiency in the Public Service and may cause the community to lose confidence in our system of law. I am most concerned about what the Australian Labor Party will do with this precedent. I know the point has been made that this is not setting a precedent for the Government, but it is setting a precedent for the Labor Party. I am disappointed that we are walking arm in arm with the Labor Party on this issue. I recognise that the Government has made efforts to overcome tax evasion, but I believe that this legislation is inappropriate. For those reasons I cannot support the Bill. </PARA>

There are few people, be they businessmen or pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, who do not try to minimise their tax within the limits of the existing law. The problem is that some people have managed not only to minimise their tax but also to avoid it altogether. The cry then goes up to get them at all costs. It is a legitimate cry. But the cost is that of seriously interfering with the rule and certainty of law, the very foundations on which our society is based. That cost will prove expensive for Australia in the long run.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are few Australians who favour retrospective legislation, but many have reluctantly come to support the Bill as a once only Bill to ensure tax justice. I am not one of those supporters. The argument against retrospectivity is, on balance, too strong to be disregarded, whatever the merits of the arguments in favour of it. First there is a basic principle to be considered, which can best be summed up by saying that those who break the law shall be subject to penalties in force at the time. Therefore it follows that no person should be punished for doing something that was legal at the time. Whatever the moral arguments may be in favour of this Bill, many people who are now to be penalised , acted in good faith, on the best professional advice and certainly within the law. If they did not, why are we introducing this retrospective legislation? If the existing law had been fully tested and found wanting it could strengthen the argument for retrospectivity, but it has not been tested. Furthermore it is pertinent to quote Article 15 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Australia is a signatory. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or remission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time it was committed. </PARA>
<PARA>It can rightly be argued that the matter we are dealing with here is not a criminal matter. Nevertheless the principles of fairness and justice hold just the same. The Australian Labor Party is firmly committed to retrospectivity. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), and other members of the Opposition have stated this on many occasions. I quote from a speech made by the shadow Treasurer on 28 April 1982. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Careful and selective use of fully retrospective legislation will put an end to tax avoidance once and for all . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is not the voice of a party which wants a once only retrospective Bill. There speaks a party which will use retrospective legislation at any time it wishes, again and again, as more than one ALP speaker clearly indicated tonight. What we are doing here in fact is introducing ALP legislation. Regrettably we are doing the Opposition's work for it. I have no wish to be a party to passing the first major piece of retrospective legislation through this Parliament and so set a major precedent. If and when the ALP ever again governs this country and pursues its retrospective legislation program, who will then speak against that program? It will certainly not be those who support this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill goes back 10 years-not just a few months, but 10 years covering the periods of both the Whitlam and Fraser governments. During that time the attention of the Government's concern was drawn to various tax avoidance schemes on many occasions. To my knowledge no major offender has been successfully brought before the courts. I say it again: The existing law has not been tested. It is a point which Commissioner Costigan makes quite clearly and it is a point which cannot be ignored. Furthermore, even after the Slutzkin decision in 1977 and subsequent well-publicised correspondence between the Commissioner of Taxation and the Government from 1978 onwards, it was not until 1980 that the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act became law and it was 1981 before the more general anti-avoidance provisions were passed. These measures effectively stopped the schemes which allowed people to avoid tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Until 1980 these schemes had been validated to a large extent by decisions of the High Court of Australia and by commercial usage in the full knowledge that the Government was aware of the schemes and had made no move to stop them. In view of this many reputable accountants and solicitors had come to the conclusion that they were obliged to advise their clients as to what was legal at that time. Many vendor shareholders accepted this professional advice in good faith and acted accordingly. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, not to believe that many of these shareholders are now being caught and penalised because of government inactivity over a long period. Furthermore, when the Crimes Act was introduced in 1980 there was no question of retrospective legislation, nor was there any public demand for it. The Government was not blamed at that time. In fact it was congratulated for closing these loopholes.</PARA>
<PARA> What has happened then between 1980 and 1982? Quite simply, some reports have been published and the Labor Party has succeeded in applying pressure to have this measure introduced. We should reject these pressures and stand firm on the successful action taken by the Government in 1980 and 1981. The loopholes have been closed. We should now be looking forward and not backwards. In the context of looking forward it is appropriate to quote from a letter to the newspapers by R. A. Bauman of the Department of History of the University of Sydney. In his letter Mr Bauman quotes an extract from Plutarch's Life of Cato the Younger. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> When Pompey proposed a law inflicting heavy penalties on those who had already bribed the people Cato urged him to ignore the past and concentrate on the future. It would not be easy, he said, to fix the point at which the investigation of past offences would stop and if penalties were fixed subsequent to crimes, it would be grossly unfair to those who were punished in terms of the law which they had not contravened when they committed their crime. </PARA>
<PARA>During the last few months of this debate, arguments have been put forward about the morals and the ethics of tax avoidance and business practices. This is a very dangerous argument. Everyone has different moral standards and these standards vary on every issue. Two people may have a similar moral view on, say, the subject of abortion, but the same two people are unlikely to agree on the ethics of business or marriage, on parental responsibility, on taxation or on any other subject. The point is that in due course other parties and leaders will come to power-and it is fair to ask what their moral standards will be. We can be sure that their standards will be different from those that are being used as the norm today. Morality is a variable issue. The only certainty we have in this matter which is common to all Australians is the law. We are now in the process of destroying that certainty. We will be destroying public confidence in the rule of law. That is the tragedy of the Bill. It is not about collecting money in my view. In the long term it will be seen as a fundamental blow against the rule of law, and will set a precedent which will make it easy for others to use as a justifiable excuse for further retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that the Government-particularly the Treasurer (Mr Howard)-has worked long and hard on this Bill and has, since its inception, made considerable concessions to those who have been opposed to all of it or to certain parts of it. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Treasurer and other Ministers have said often that here there are conflicting principles at stake. It is not surprising therefore, in a close-run decision, that there will be members of this Parliament and the community who have come to a conclusion which differs from that conclusion reached by the Government. In the final analysis I place the principle of the rule of law above the short term expediency of retrospectivity. There has been in recent years a developing cynicism about the value of holding to certain basic principles. In short, some people would argue that expediency and advantage would overwhelm any argument about principle. I do not. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that this Bill will be passed and I regret that I find myself in the position whereby I cannot support my own Government. It is not a unique situation but nevertheless it is one we would all prefer to avoid. If there is one lesson to be gained from this divisive issue it is that the time has come to look long and hard at our taxation laws and our administration of them. Our present laws are not only causing people to spend too much of their energies avoiding tax, both legally and illegally-the cash economy is a prime example of this-but also destroying initiative and incentive in this country. In many cases they are destroying the will to work. We can ill afford this at any time let alone at a time of great economic difficulty. </PARA>

I have noticed that there have not been very many people in the gallery; in fact, there is no brave soul there at present other than our good policeman. One really cannot blame people for not listening to the debate at 1.20 in the morning. However, earlier in the evening when we looked around the gallery we should have seen it overflowing with all of those people who have written to me and every honourable member of this Parliament. I have some of the letters here. For example, some chartered accountants wrote to tell me why I should not support this legislation. Where are all those people now? Where are the accountants and tax managers, the so- called promoters of these schemes? I ask the two Government members who just spoke, and who are apologists for those people, where all those people are? Why are they not here to support them? They are not here because they are hiding. At the present time they are probably trying to get their books in order.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are looking at massive tax avoidance. In fact the ordinary wage earner has been hit to the tune of up to $30 a week because these tax avoiders have got away with it for so long. Of course, the only reason that the Government is bringing in the legislation at present is because it is looking for an early election, as many speakers on this side of the House have mentioned previously in the debate. If this were not so we would not be able to drag the Government to the barrier on legislation such as this. But the legislation does not go far enough and that is why I support the amendment. I believe that too many people will still get out under the escape clause contained in this second version of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is strange not to see Government members supporting their own Government. It is amazing when we see where some of these honourable members come from. Obviously they have many friends who are involved in this tax avoidance industry . We all know, of course, that many of the people involved in the tax avoidance industry are not only supporters of the Liberal Party but also members of the Liberal Party. It serves Government members' purpose no good at all for them to oppose the legislation because it puts them right on the line as to whom they support. As I mentioned earlier, they are apologists for the tax avoiders and promoters. If they cannot stand by the Government on this issue they should resign from their party. Not that that is going to matter very much of course, because in a very short time Government members will be scourged from office. For the first time in seven years we will have a decent party in government, one which will bring economic justice to the people of this country. We will catch the tax avoiders. Although this legislation will not catch them all I assure honourable members that a Labor Government will bring down legislation to catch all of the tax avoiders. I entered this debate with the express purpose of saying that I support the legislation before the House. I did not think it right that speaker after speaker on the Government side was opposing the legislation. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During this debate on retrospective taxation we must not lose sight of the need for overall reform of the taxation system. We need in this country a tax system that people will wish to opt into rather than out of. We must cure the malaise of tax avoidance in the nation. One of its causes is that personal rates of taxation are too high. The Government has a creditable record with its restructured three-tiered personal tax system and its efforts to widen the indirect tax base through sales tax. I was pleased to see a recent statement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on the need to reform fundamentally the Australian tax system. I fear that as every day has gone by in this debate which is coming to a conclusion tonight we have lost a day in the cause of reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is to be congratulated on the steps it has taken in the past to stamp out tax avoidance. I am pleased to have supported legislation such as the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. The Government's record stands in stark contrast to that of the Australian Labor Party when in government between 1972 and 1975. When the taxation avoidance industry was just starting to grow the Australian Labor Party did absolutely nothing at all. I am, however, troubled by this legislation before the House tonight for a number of reasons. It is quite clear that the Parliament has power to pass retrospective legislation. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) spoke eloquently about that matter. I shall quote from a work entitled Statutory Interpretation in Australia by Pearce dealing with the power of Parliament to pass retrospective legislation. Page 151 states:</PARA>
<PARA> This fact was alluded to by Higgins J. in R v Kidman . . . 20 CLR . . . where he pointed out that while there are plenty of passages that can be cited showing the expediency, and the injustice, in most cases, of legislating for the past, of interfering with vested rights, and of making acts unlawful which were lawful when done, such passages do not raise any doubt as to the power of the legislature to pass retrospective legislation, if it sees fit. The case is of considerable importance because it was held . . . that the Commonwealth parliament had power to pass retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall quote from the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins at page 453 of 20 Commonwealth Law Reports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition members might learn something if they listen to this because I am talking about principle; they do not understand principle. Mr Justice Higgins said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is admitted that the Parliament has power to make retroactive laws as to specified subjects of legislation, such, e.g., as 'naturalization'; and it would need a violent straining of the wide words of the power to make laws for incidental matters if we were to read into them a prohibition of retroactive laws designed for the enforcement of the substantive laws. If we did so, we should be adding to the Constitution, without express words, the prohibition of ex post facto laws which is expressly contained in the American Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CJ4">Mr SHIPTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer Opposition members who interjected to the American Constitution because that Constitution, as I understand it, contains a provision that no 'Bill or attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.' This shows that it is a matter of great principle, as it is included in some constitutions. I shall also quote Pearce in relation to the retrospective operation of legislation. At page 194 he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The courts generally assume that legislation is not intended to operate retrospectively . . . This presumption is most strictly applied to Acts creating an offence because of the manifest injustice that the alternative approach would bring about. </PARA>
<PARA>This shows that retrospectivity is a matter of great principle. As a matter of principle I am against retrospective legislation of this type, and the Liberal Party platform supports my view. I believe in certainty before the law, the rule of law, the basic freedoms under the rule of law, and that certainty of transactions should be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been consistent in my approach to this subject. Even before the Government announced its intention to pass this legislation, in my annual report to my electorate which I distributed in the middle of this year I stated to my constituents that I do not believe retrospective tax legislation is appropriate as it is contrary to principles of fairness and equity. I have copies of the report with me if anyone would like to read it. I would be happy to table a copy . I am in the practice of reporting from time to time to my electorate and stating where I stand on particular issues. I commend the practice to honourable members opposite. As I said, I made this statement to my electorate and to my recollection I received not one objection to it at the time. I believe that I have an obligation to my constituents to be consistent. As a matter of conscience I feel bound by both the Liberal Party platform and my statement in my report to my constituency. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course I do not support bottom-of-the-harbour-type behaviour. It is totally abhorrent. I totally condemn the practice, to which I think the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) referred, of elderly citizens being given bottles of whisky to sign company records. I condemn totally disappearing company records, sham directors and disappearing directors. I believe that action should be taken against the people responsible. Those who have fraudulently evaded their liabilities must be caught up with and brought to account. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) earlier tonight told the House how he believed the existing laws should be applied against such people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable gentleman just listens, he might learn something. If the law can be proved to be inadequate to cover what is currently believed to be illegal activity, there is perhaps a case for retrospective legislation. I would need to be convinced that the existing laws were found to be wanting before I reached such a decision. I have great respect for the views of my colleagues which are different from the ones I hold. I respect the views of the Government when, on the balance of fairness to all Australians, it comes down on the side of retrospective legislation. I respect the views of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), who earlier tonight said that there was a fine balance involved in making such decisions. He and I come to different sides of the scales on weighing that balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a difficult issue for the Liberal Party. There has been a debate on principle within that party and the Government parties. Members of the Government parties have queried and questioned the legislation. We have seen substantial changes made to it. I pay tribute to the way in which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has conducted himself in this matter. The debate shows the strength of the Government parties. It proves that the Government parties-the Liberal Party, to which I belong, and the National Party-can accommodate diverse views. This is in total contrast to the Australian Labor Party's position. Free speech is not tolerated within the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Labor Party would do. The Labor Party has signalled total retrospectivity in the tax area. No taxpayer will be safe. Every businessman will be concerned by the Labor Party's policy. The Labor Party will hound everybody; it will establish a police state. It has indicated that it would enact draconian and far-reaching legislation to change the existing tax laws. No taxpayer will be safe from the Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party in office would set aside legal transactions and create commercial chaos if the unfortunate tragedy of Labor coming to office were to occur. I say, like the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White), that it is clear that this legislation will be passed. I have the regret that he has. When I vote tonight, I will vote on my own account, exercising my own conscience for the reasons that I have expressed to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We may hold very strong views about the morality of tax avoidance schemes but the essential point to be made is that many were not illegal and are , therefore, not subject to criminal law. We are all-honourable members opposite , me and everyone else-whether we like to admit it or not, tax minimisers. None of us likes to pay more tax than he or she is legally required to pay. If clear cut deductions are allowable to us as individuals, we all claim such deductions. All of us are then legally avoiding tax which otherwise would be paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This, of course, does not deal with the morality argument applying to what have been described as highly artificial schemes designed to avoid a great deal of tax. Whilst I have some sympathy with the morality argument, it is a difficult one to sustain in the tax area. Let me deal with it briefly. If it is immoral to avoid paying tax by the use of 'highly artifical schemes', why is it not immoral to avoid paying tax through the use of more time honoured practices such as family trusts, income splitting, investment allowances and the like? If it is the highly artificial nature of the schemes which makes them immoral, I believe that that justification is very unconvincing. After all, the purpose of the time honoured schemes, as well as the highly artificial devices, is to achieve the same result-that of reducing taxation liabilities or avoiding tax which would otherwise be payable. If it is immoral to avoid a lot of tax, surely it is just as immoral to avoid a little tax? The amount should be of no concern in relation to the morality or otherwise of a person's actions. Those in the community, the Parliament and particularly the Australian Labor Party who speak so passionately on the issue of taxation morality are in so many cases guilty themselves of selective indignation. If taxation avoidance is immoral, all taxation avoidance is immoral regardless of the scheme or the amount. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not a lawyer but I strongly believe that taxation law is a question of legislation and legal interpretation. Only if this approach is adopted can the community achieve the degree of certainty that is required if the orderly conduct of business and individual affairs is to continue. That is not for a moment to argue against a moral attitude in the conduct of business. A strengthening of business morality and ethics is certainly needed. What is also needed in regard to tax law is a moral attitude backed very strongly by the certainty of the law, as enacted and defined. We are told that this legislation is necessary because companies have been put into a situation in which they have been left unable to pay their taxation liabilities. People have gained amounts of money that they would otherwise not have gained because artificially high prices have been paid for companies with cashed-up assets. </PARA>
<PARA> As the law stands, it is said, vendor-shareholders are not liable to pay tax upon the sale of shares. The companies are unable to meet the company tax payable and therefore action had to be taken to recoup the tax which would have been collected if the companies had been delat with in a proper manner. This, I believe, begs a lot of questions. Firstly, was the action of the vendor shareholders in selling cashed-up companies, legal or illegal? I am told that it was legal except if the sellers knew, at the time of sale, that the companies were to be dealt with in an illegal manner. If it was legal, this legislation is imposing a retrospective taxation penalty on an action which legally did not attract a tax impost at the time it was carried out. If it was illegal it should be dealt with under the appropriate laws governing such illegal actions and, theoretically, there should be no need for this legislation. I say ' theoretically' because, obviously, there is a very real doubt as to proceedings which could be taken successfully against the promoters and others involved in the schemes covered by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems then that the real justification for this legislation, when stripped of all the rhetoric, boils down to the fact that the existing laws for dealing with the situation were cumbersome and uncertain and that the delay in dealing with it over a 10-year period encouraged the escalation of a procedure which resulted in a great deal of money not finding its way into Consolidated Revenue. In this legislation, in my view the Government is introducing a very dangerous precedent. It is undoubtedly retrospective in its application. It is based largely on the argument that morally people should have paid tax on the money received. It breaks down the protection for corporate shareholders that was put in place for the very soundest of reasons following the disaster of the South Sea Bubble and other syndicates. Undoubtedly, the socialists in our midst, should they come to power, will use this legislation as a stepping stone to much more unacceptable retrospective legislation. The Stamp Duties (Further Amendment ) Bill being dealt with in New South Wales at the moment offers a shining example of how legislation such as this will be used. The Government, in deciding on this particular course of action to deal with the problem facing it, has undoubtedly grabbed the tiger by the tail. None of what I have said should be taken as evidence of any support whatsoever for those corporate crooks in our community who have deliberately, selfishly, wilfully and knowingly sought to defraud the revenue. They have done an enormous disservice to themselves, to the community and to the cause of private enterprise. They have given the socialists an ideal weapon with which to clobber the concept of private enterprise. They should be dealt with utilising the full force of the law. If that were done, they would have the opportunity to defend themselves, to state their case and, properly, to be regarded as innocent until proven guilty. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to my final point. This is undoubtedly uncertain legislation. It is immensely complex and difficult to understand since its full effects have yet to be fully determined. In fairness to the Government, it has been responsive to the views of those who sought to tidy up the more obvious problem areas and the legislation, in its present form, is very different from that which first saw light of day some weeks ago. But it still does not give vendor shareholders an opportunity to put a case on their own behalf. It still does not allow for the possibility that they could have acted in the most honest good faith, on the soundest of advice and in the stated belief that the company they were selling was going to be carried on according to the law. We must all remember that it was possible for companies with cash assets to be used legally and properly in such a manner as to render them not liable to pay company tax. </PARA>
<PARA> A provision obviously should be included which would allow vendor-shareholders to defend their actions with the onus of proof being on the shareholders. We have heard a great deal about morality and fairness in this debate. What could be more moral and what could be more fair than to allow vendor-shareholders the opportunity to defend themselves? If they failed they would have to pay any penalty which developed during the proceedings when they were taking that defensive action. To deny them this right is to make a mockery of the concept of fairness upon which this legislation is said to be based. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say just a few words in reply to those honourable members who contributed to this debate. This legislation, of course, raises a number of very difficult issues. The first thing I want to say is that the criticism voiced by members of the Opposition about those colleagues of mine who felt unable to support this legislation being friends of the tax avoidance industry is as shallow as it is patently absurd. The legislation does raise considerations of principle. I can say, speaking for myself and, I know, for a great number of people on this side of the House, that it has not been an easy decision to arrive at. I, as a lawyer and a Liberal, do not regard the enacting of retrospective legislation with any great enthusiasm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that demonstrates for a moment a lack of concern on the part of this Government to bring about tax justice in the community. It does involve, as has been said on so many occasions, the putting into balance of a principle generally adhered to of non-retrospectivity against a principle of the overall fairness of the taxation system and the perceptions in the community about the fairness of the taxation system. We have sought as a government to draw a distinction between the tax benefit enjoyed as a result of the evasion that took place in these transactions and other arrangements which have involved all through the transactions a purely legal avoidance of tax. In that sense I believe that the Government's action in respect of this scheme can be separated from other schemes which have been the subject of comment by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> During this debate a number of total misconceptions have been exhibited by Opposition speakers. The first of those is their total inability to understand that when one is talking about the collection of tax one is not talking about prosecuting people in a criminal sense. So when the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) comes in here and says: 'Have there been any prosecutions under Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act? Are there going to be any prosecutions under this Bill?', he frankly does not know what he is talking about. Neither of those pieces of legislation has anything at all to do with criminal liability. If the great anti-tax avoidance zealots on the other side of the House really knew anything about the taxation laws of this country they would know that anti-tax avoidance legislation is concerned with blocking loopholes in the taxation legislation. It is no measure of the success of anti- tax avoidance legislation to know how many people have been put in gaol. That is a measure of the success of criminal legislation. That is the first total and utter misconception that I believe the Opposition has exhibited during this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be fair to say that over the last four or five months there have been more speeches in this Parliament and more debate in the community on the subject of tax avoidance than at any other time since Federation. One of the interesting things I find when I look back over all of the debates that have gone on over the past four or five months is that at no stage has any evidence been advanced by the Opposition to demonstrate that the combined effect of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act passed in December 1980 and Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act passed in May 1981 has been anything other than an outstanding success in stopping blatant tax avoidance practices in this country. We have heard all the windy rhetoric about the $35 a week. What the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) is really saying when he talks about $35 a week is that $10,000m to $15,000m is still being lost on an annual basis, according to that figure. Yet not one of his colleagues has been able to point to a tax avoidance practice that is still going on in defiance of those two pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the second misconception. If someone came from another country and listened to what members of the Opposition have said tonight, he would imagine that these practices were still going on in a totally unchecked and unhindered manner. Yet the Opposition knows and the great majority of people know that the legislation we have passed has been particularly and conspicuously successful. That is the second misconception that I believe ought to be laid to rest in respect of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I say one final thing in respect of the concerns that have been voiced by my colleagues on this side of the House about the legislation and its retrospective effect? In the course of the debate we have heard a proper concern expressed about the rule of law in our community, we have heard a proper concern expressed about certainty under the law, and we have heard a proper concern expressed about the need to avoid confusing morality and legality. I have to say that in general substance the concept that was advanced by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) was that it is a very difficult and a very subjective thing to talk about morality. But governments, in all the decisions they take, have to take into account a number of considerations. They have to take into account legal considerations. They have to take into account economic considerations. They have to take into account social considerations. Let us all be frank about it, they also have to take into account political considerations. No government worth its salt pretends that it does not take into account political considerations. Of course it does. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the very important things that the Government had in mind in deciding to bring in this legislation was that, no matter how successful had been the legislation to which I have referred, no matter how successful had been our campaign to eliminate tax avoidance practices in this country, there can be no doubt that, because of the publication of the McCabe-Lafranchi report-not that it dealt with any new tax avoidance arrangements; it dealt with an arrangement that we had struck down in December 1980-and because for the first time names were published and identities were associated with particular practices, the public perception of tax avoidance in this country was changed in a very significant way. I believe that one of the things this legislation does is to establish in the minds of people in the community who have perceptions regarding the fairness of our taxation system a demonstration of the determination of this Government to legislate for the benefit of the great majority of Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to rehearse the arguments that have gone on time and again during this debate about the essential justification for this legislation. I say again that the legislation is not criminal legislation. It does not seek to say whether somebody is guilty or innocent. It is not legislation imposing an offence. In my view it is not legislation imposing a penalty. It is legislation purely and simply concerned with recouping an unpaid taxation liability albeit not from those who legally incurred that liability in the first place but from those who have enjoyed the financial benefit of it. Therefore I believe with respect to those of my colleagues who have argued otherwise that many of the precedents on which they have drawn so far as retrospectivity is concerned are more relevant to criminal legislation, are more relevant to legislation imposing a penalty and are more relevant to legislation imposing some kind of retrospective offence. After all, parliaments have in the past passed retrospective laws. This Parliament in 1977, not on the Curran scheme but in respect of the loophole revealed by the Victorian Supreme Court regarding the accrual of long service leave, voted unanimously on that occasion to pass that amendment to the taxation law. As it turned out a subsequent decision of the Federal Court of Australia retrospectively proved that that amendment was not necessary. The fact nonetheless remains that if one is looking at the absolute principle of retrospectivity this Parliament and those who are concerned about it should on that occasion have indicated that point of view. Of course then there were different considerations and perhaps different merits, but the principle remained nonetheless the same. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other thing I would like to say is that this particular Bill has raised important considerations in principle. I well understand why a number of my colleagues, in fact a great number of my colleagues, have reservations even to the point of opposition to this particular legislation. As far as I am concerned, the Liberal Party of Australia is the stronger for being able to accommodate within its ranks a healthy and honest debate on matters of principle . I think it will be a very poor party that cannot embrace that kind of debate, that kind of difference of opinion and even though there may be some differences of opinion within our ranks there is one issue on which we are absolutely united in this debate-that is, to totally reject the smear of the Australian Labor Party that the Liberal Party is the friend of the tax avoiders of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 7 September 1982:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Did he receive representations during 1982 from the Defence Manufacturers Association of Australia wherein that Association sought clarification (a) on the guidelines used to assess the level of significance of defence strategic or high technology implications of defence procurement, which give preference to Australian firms and (b) from the Government whether it will give consideration to the direct support of export sales to approved countries of defence equipment manufactured in Australia, as is done by the Governments of France, Great Britain, Israel, The Philippines, Singapore, Sweden and the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) If so, did the Association also indicate that it felt that the Defence Industry Committee was in no way representative of the Australian defence industry, as current industry executives, other than from the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, are not members of it.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) What has been his response to these representations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Defence Manufacturers Association of Australia has been informed that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided, because of the broad criteria involved, that rather than identify defence strategic or high technology industries, Commonwealth purchases, in respect of which preference policy applies, will be evaluated on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the high technology category, the Government decided that particular characterisics would be taken into account when assessing the applicability of the preference policy. Consideration is given to the Industrial Research and Development intensity, product innovation, advanced production processes, the extent of technical skills employed, and use of newly developed materials.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the defence strategic category is concerned, the principal criterion is the contribution that the project makes to the strategic aims of self- reliance for the Defence Forces. Such contribution may take either a direct or indirect form and may establish, maintain or enhance those capabilities of importance to the existing or planned forces.</PARA>
<PARA> Export of military equipment is a complex question that requires the Government to balance the benefits of larger markets against our international image and relationships. Support is given through the offsets program and through administrative assistance and, where exports have been approved, they have been eligible for the Assistance accorded commercial exports.</PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion that the Defence Industry Committee (DIC) is exclusive to BHP and is not representative of Australian industry is not correct.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Only a minority of Attorneys-General expressed support for the proposal to establish a Sentencing Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As a Sentencing Council could operate successfully only if adequately supported by the States and the Northern Territory and as the requisite measure of support has not been forthcoming I regret that there is no prospect of the Council being created in the near future.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr Street</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) I have seen several Press reports regarding the Government's attitude to the visit of the Israeli Minister for Communications, Mr Zipori, on which I do not wish to comment. It is true that the Government was not happy when Mr Zipori's visit, which was to be private, acquired a public character. Representations on the matter were therefore made both to the Israeli Embassy in Canberra and to the Israeli Government through our Embassy in Tel Aviv.</PARA>
