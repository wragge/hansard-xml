<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Treasurer. I draw his attention to an article in the Bulletin of last week which related to the growth of sales tax minimisation schemes. Is it a fact that the Chamber of Automotive Industries of New South Wales approached the Treasurer last month? Did the Chamber point out that schemes for tax evasion among car dealers are being touted throughout Australia? Is it a fact that dealers are paying sales tax according to their level of morality? What is the Government doing to stamp out tax evasion activities which are placing the tax burden on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has already taken a number of specific legislative measures against sales tax avoidance schemes. I will see that the particular article to which the honourable member has referred is in turn referred to the Commissioner of Taxation, although I imagine that he is already following up, if that needs to be done, what was referred to in the article. In the last part of the honourable member's question he asked me what the Government was doing to stamp out tax evasion. We are doing a great deal, and it is about time the Australian Labor Party changed its attitude towards indirect taxation so that we could really be given a lethal weapon against tax evasion and the cash economy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr NIXON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no truth in the story that a 4 per cent increase in the Australian Wool Testing Authority's costs has occurred because of the transfer. The fact is that the transfer does not take place until 1 July and any level of costs that might be incurred will be worked out in detail by the AWTA and the Australian Wool Corporation. I think the 4 per cent figure comes from the fact that I have said that we can ensure that the cost of the transfer will be no more than 4 per cent. That transfer has not yet occurred. As to the figure of 14 per cent, I think that the report by Hill Samuel Australia Ltd for the Australian Wool Corporation identified that the AWTA had run into cost increases of some 14 per cent that were not yet in place. They were normal cost increases totally unrelated to the transfer of the AWTA to the private sector. It is a matter for the AWTA to increase the costs by that 14 per cent when it wishes. That is a matter for the Board of the AWTA. It is a cost that is totally related to the cost increases for the running of the organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister for Administrative Services. I preface it by referring to a statement I made in the House yesterday in which I quoted from a document subtitled 'Nugan Hand' in which the then Director of the Narcotics Bureau directed in March 1978 that until further notice 'no active external inquiries are embarked upon' in relation to the activities of the Nugan Hand bank. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that during yesterday's debate he attacked my assertion that the Narcotics Bureau investigation of Nugan Hand had 'stopped dead' after this directive was issued? Did the Minister describe the statement as 'a total exaggeration'? Is the Minister aware that five months after the directive was issued a confidential information report within the Narcotics Bureau dated 4 August 1978 referred to Nugan Hand's involvement in the importation of heroin and said that 'further information would be available from a reliable and discreet source should this investigation ever be resurrected'? Does the Minister know the meaning of the word 'resurrected'? Does he still insist that my assertion that the Bureau's investigation of Nugan Hand was stopped dead in March 1978 is a total exaggeration? If so, how does he explain this information report which was written five months later?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly do not change any remarks that I made in the debate yesterday. I just confirm again to the Leader of the Opposition that, on the advice that I have received on the basis of the letter which I quoted from and then argued about, the information certainly was that the investigation was to change from the overt investigation to a covert investigation. I have no doubt that there is about a lot of information or documents that can be brought to the notice of the Government. I was not in charge of the Narcotics Bureau and I can only say to the Leader of the Opposition once again that if he has information which will help particularly the joint task force investigation he really does have a duty to give that joint task force the information so that it can act upon it. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that when I got stuck into him yesterday about his exaggerations I pointed out also that the Leader of the Opposition, when he moved the original motion in this House, very carefully changed the allegations made by Mr Volkman so that they read totally differently in this House. It was a very subtle change, but it was a very vital change.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bruce Highway is eligible for 100 per cent Commonwealth Government funding. Mr Hinze proposed to me that, in view of the importance of the road to Queensland, his State was prepared to consider making a sizable financial contribution towards its upgrading, provided both Queensland officials and Commonwealth officials could get together and prepare a plan for presentation to the two governments. Those officials are getting together and I expect to receive a report from them within three months. The proposal by the Queensland Government is quite unique and shows a degree of self-help that few other States have shown so far. I conclude by saying that road funding is not just a Commonwealth Government responsibility; it is a joint responsibility of the Commonwealth, State and local governments. There has been far too much buck passing in this area and a little more co-operation from the States would be more constructive than the buck passing we are witnessing all over the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="Q07">Mr ARMITAGE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question, which is directed to the Treasurer, by referring to a statement made by him this week at the conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants that tax avoidance and the cash economy posed a big threat to government revenue. Did the Treasurer announce in his 1978 Budget Speech certain measures to curb the avoidance of tax liabilities by persons who are paid in cash without deduction of tax instalments? If the Government is concerned at the loss of tax revenue in this area, why were these proposals not proceeded with? If the Government has been alarmed at the extent of this problem for at least the last four years, why has no other action been taken to stop tax avoidance in this area? I want an answer to the real question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Chifley is in some error in asserting that nothing has happened in this area. As I recollect it, the 1978 Budget Speech drew attention to cash payment practices in certain sections of industry, in particular the building industry. Arising out of what was said in that speech, the Government has been engaged in discussions with the industry and has also taken note of representations put to it by building industry unions, many of which have adopted a very responsible attitude to this problem, although some others, particularly in this industry, have adopted a rather different attitude. Arising out of that the Government has discussed in some detail some possible improvements of the taxation administration in this area. Depending on the further outcome of discussions with the building industry, I hope to put some proposals to the Government in the very near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the honourable gentleman that there will never be an effective assault upon tax evasion through the growth of the cash economy in Australia until there is a greater reliance on indirect taxation. I know that the Australian Labor Party is sensitive about this matter because its inconsistency has been totally exposed. It preaches abhorrence of tax evasion but when it comes to doing something effective it votes against it. The Labor Party has voted against a broadening of the indirect tax base and it has threatened to vote against some tax avoidance measures which I foreshadowed on 18 December and which will prevent the ordinary Australian taxpayer being ripped off to the tune of $120m or $150m through a very contrived arrangement set up by the New South Wales Government which will transfer those dollars from the pockets of ordinary Australian taxpayers into some of the largest company profits in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the House would know, the United States and the Soviet Union commenced negotiations on, I think, 30 November last year in Geneva on a reduction in intermediate range nuclear missiles in the European theatre. Shortly before those negotiations commenced the United States President announced that the United States was prepared to agree to what has become known as the zero option; that is, the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies would cancel the planned deployment of Pershing II and cruise missiles in Western Europe if the Soviet Union would remove the SS4, SS5 and SS20 missiles at present targeted on Western Europe. This United States proposal is fully supported by NATO and especially emphasised by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I regret to say that since the negotiations commenced the Soviet Union has shown that its approach is to engage in a propaganda campaign rather than enter into substantive negotiations. President Brezhnev's statement of 16 March, to which the honourable gentleman referred, is the latest example of that campaign. Specifically, his offer is to stop any further Soviet production of the SS20 missiles. But I point out that that would leave no fewer than 300 such missiles, each capable of carrying three nuclear warheads, targeted on Western Europe. President Brezhnev's suggestion that these weapons systems should be removed from the European section of Soviet territory is quite meaningless because, even if they were, they would still have the range to reach Western Europe from outside the European section of Soviet territory. In any case, the vehicles on which the missiles are mounted are mobile. It is the Government's view that the cause of reducing intermediate range nuclear weapons would be much better served if the Soviet Union addressed itself seriously to the zero option.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to his speech this week to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in which he said that it was widely accepted that indirect taxes were difficult to avoid. Is the Treasurer aware that, in the first year of operation of a value added tax in Britain, the equivalent of $60m to $70m in revenue was estimated to have been lost due to avoidance? Is it a fact that all European countries with heavy reliance on indirect taxes have experienced similar problems in attempting to ensure compliance and that this often involves enormous administrative costs for the collection authorities and a similar burden on tax collecting businesses? Has the Treasurer been made aware of these details and, if so, why does he believe that such problems would not arise with a wider reliance on indirect taxes in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been made aware of the fact that in those countries that have a greater reliance on indirect taxation than does Australia there is nonetheless some evasion of taxation and there are schemes which are designed to avoid tax. To be realistic-no matter what views we may have on this subject-it has to be accepted that we will never have a tax system which is totally proofed against tax avoidance and tax evasion. It is very much a question of degree. A two- pronged attack is needed. On the one hand, we need effective legislative response to sophisticated and artificial schemes, of the type contained in the new Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which was put together after receiving some of the best taxation advice around Australia. Secondly, in order to respond to the cash economy, we need a greater reliance on broadly based consumption taxes. It is only through that that we can make a serious assault upon the growth of the cash economy. That is not to say that it will ever be totally eliminated. I go back to what I said earlier. There is an utter inconsistency when a party that abhors tax evasion votes consistently against the most lethal weapon that could be at the hands of the Government to deal with it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Prime Minister seen the report of the Senate Select Committee on Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories entitled 'The future of Ordnance Factory Bendigo'?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report on the future of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The Government will be looking at the report quite closely. I note that the main part of the report recommends that the Ordnance Factory still be sold. That is consistent with the Review of Commonwealth Functions recommendation of a year ago and the Government's efforts since then which in a sense had been suspended during the Senate Committee inquiry. The Government will evaluate the various proposals, or offers of tenders and, when that process is finished, it will come to a final decision as to whether or not the factory will be sold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government would much prefer that the factory could be sold to private enterprise so that new investment could be attracted to Bendigo and to the Ordnance Factory. This would provide opportunities for expanded activity. More money would flow through the factory and into the city, providing expanded employment opportunities. That is a large part of the basis of the original decision, because we believe that enterprises that ought to be commercial enterprises are best run by private enterprise people rather than by governments . The record of government-run enterprises would seem to support that view.</PARA>
<PARA> The effort of the trade union leaders in the Bendigo area, by contacts, as I understand it, with potential purchasers to try to dissuade them from continuing with their interest, is really an action that is very much against the best interests of Bendigo and of employment in Bendigo. They ought to be roundly condemned by the councillors of the city of Bendigo and by everyone who is interested in the advancement of a great provincial city in Victoria. Having examined all the options and in particular the impact on Bendigo, the Government , if it is not successful in its efforts to sell the Ordnance Factory to a vigorous and vital private enterprise concern, will continue to operate the factory as a government operation.</PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that the honourable member has shown a very consistent interest in this matter, as one would expect. He has spoken to me about it on many occasions. He has spoken also to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on many occasions about the well-being of the city and about the possible consequences of action in relation to the Ordnance Factory. It was necessary to make this position clear as a result of one part of the recommendations of the Senate Committee which recommended that if the Ordnance Factory could not be sold, as is the Government's intention, then it ought to be dismantled. The Government believed that its reaction to that part of the recommendations ought to be made known quickly so that the concern that would be felt as a result of that recommendation could be put completely and absolutely at rest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the industry has a carryover from last year of 7,000 tonnes and a pretty substantial crop coming in this year. One of the principal markets has been the EEC. Something like 30 per cent of Australia's dried vine fruit has been sold in that area. It is to the credit of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation that it has been an aggressive seller around the world, in Japan, Canada, New Zealand and the EEC. Unfortunately, the accession of Greece into the EEC has jeopardised the Corporation's opportunity to be able to sell to the same extent as it previously could. Greece is a large producer of dried vine fruits. The preference it gets on that market now, being a member, certainly gives it a distinct advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government is concerned also about the open-ended forms of industry assistance and the guaranteed price arrangements which will be a major incentive to increased production in Greece which we will then have to compete against. This is quite unfair and unjust to a country such as Australia whose fruit industry has been a long term supplier. This point of view was made very clear to the President of the Commission of the European Communities, Mr Thorn, and some of the members of his Commission when they were here recently. I hope they might moderate some of the approaches they have taken towards industry assistance as a result of our concern being expressed. However, if we find that we are meeting unfair competition we will have to use the facilities of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to be able to lodge a challenge against EEC action. I assure the Australian dried vine fruit industry that the Government is concerned and will be watching this matter very closely.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;About a year ago when I had the opportunity to go out to the Cooper Basin I had explained to me the possibilities of petroleum being piped to and facilities being built at Stony Point. At that time arrangements had not been finalised with the South Australian Government, mainly because the company concerned could not get involved in major capital investment decisions until the Commonwealth gave export approval for the sale of liquefied petroleum gas from the plant. This approval was given and the company then proceeded to go ahead and make the necessary plans. I believe this project will go ahead. I hope that at this stage there is sufficient oil, although I am not able to speak off the cuff on this, to warrant a separate pipeline. But certainly there is encouraging exploration going on within the Cooper Basin region and I hope that this region can become another source of oil and hydrocarbons for Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly this Government wants to give all the encouragement it can to further exploration in this region. I think the fact that exploration in Australia is now 10 times greater than it was when we took office is conclusive evidence that our policies are working in relation to trying to encourage more development of our hydrocarbons in this country. But I again say I cannot give the honourable member a definite answer whether an oil pipeline will be constructed. I can get those facts and give them to the honourable member.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not right to be categorical as to when negotiations might be concluded or when a new closer economic relationship might commence. I did answer a question in the House about a week ago. I said that the objective was to try to achieve a commencement of a closer economic relationship for 1 January 1983. That is still an objective, but it will depend upon satisfactory arrangements being settled between the two Governments and also between industries of both countries. Very extensive consultations have been going on for two years between different sections of Australian industry within the industrial area and the manufacturing sector. The Confederation of Australian Industry has been working in close collaboration with its counterparts in New Zealand.

The Australian New Zealand Businessmans Council Ltd has been looking also at the merits of such an arrangement and it too believes that a CER ought to come into operation as quickly as possible so that the benefits of the combined resources of both countries can be utilised and can produce a greater economic dimension and activity between our two countries. Discussions have taken place between some of the agricultural groups. Already the dairying industries have had initial discussions and there will be more within the next few weeks. The Australian wine industry and the New Zealand Wine Institute have got together and have reached an amicable agreement to phase out completely the import licensing and the tariff arrangements on wine.

The most recent statistics available, based on a survey of 91 major government projects, indicate that there were site allowances on only 11 of them. Quite obviously, the responsible policy of the Government of not reimbursing site allowances granted has done several things. It has indicated to contractors that we are not Father Christmas. It has put a bit of muscle in them and they have fought the cases before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Additionally, it has been acknowledged that certain members of the Commission have been prone to grant increased site allowances on the basis that they are aware that the Commonwealth Government will pick up the tab. The Commonwealth Government, of course, is aware of the fact that there is not to be set the bad example of automatic flow-on to private works and to Commonwealth works by virtue of the fact that it has this policy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been waiting for this question from someone of the Opposition for some time, because this matter has been the subject of considerable discussion in the State Parliament. The Minister for Roads in New South Wales made a false accusation that the road between Wee Waa and Burren Junction actually went through my brother's property-which is an absolute lie. It does not go through it or past it, nor does that road serve it. The truth of the matter is that the route of the road was decided by the Department of Main Roads in 1978, when Mr Jensen was the Minister for Roads in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have with me quite a lot of correspondence and documents that I wish to table for the benefit of honourable members that will clarify the position quite satisfactorily. Mr Jensen, the New South Wales Minister for Roads during the Castlereagh by-election, made a statement that there was a necessity to have a remote area development category to assist those people in the remote areas of New South Wales and elsewhere. Indeed, we discussed this matter at Dubbo after his visit to Bourke. Mr Jensen pursued the issue. He required additional funds rather than to see them taken from the national roads category. But for some years there has been a development roads category covering commerce and export industries using the roads. The Government decided that to try to assist those industries and the remote areas of Australia the definition of such categories should include remote area industries, which incorporates agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA> This particular road is a very important one, serving one of the most productive areas of New South Wales. That it happens to be in the electorate of Gwydir is just too bad. Gwydir happens to cover one-third of the State of New South Wales. I am surprised that the Minister for Roads in New South Wales would single out the people in northern and north-western New South Wales for this sort of attack and treatment. The area has been neglected over a long period by successive governments in the State of New South Wales. Mr Jensen accepted the fact that the road was important and, as the correspondence will indicate, actually recommended for approval this particular project which the honourable gentlemen mentioned. So it is not a question of Mr Jensen, who was then the Minister, disapproving of it. The truth of the matter is that Mr Whelan in New South Wales is trying to make a political issue out of it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the present time there is an increasing awareness amongst the population of Australia that, under the tax structure that is set down under the Acts of Parliament, some people are paying too much tax and some people are paying too little tax. In this context of increasing understanding by the population I believe it important to raise this matter today. I want to do three things. I want first of all to talk about the inequities which are imposed on wage and salary earners in particular by people who are engaged in tax avoidance or tax evasion. I also want to stress the problems that the Government has in coping with those inequities and I hope to say one or two words about exactly what this Government has done. Also, as a corollary-this will not take very long because it is so obvious-I want to expose the miserable performance of the Australian Labor Party in this field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is certainly a very big problem in this area. As I have intimated already there are two parts to it. There is a tax evasion problem, mainly in the cash economy-the so-called black economy-which is a very strong and growing economy in many countries. There is evidence that it represents perhaps as much as 10 per cent of our total gross domestic product. Under those circumstances, of course, the amount involved could be as high as $14 billion in productive effort . Even on the basis of one-third of that figure being tax payable, the amount involved would be something like $5 billion. It has also been estimated by the Taxpayers Association of Australia to be a $7,000m industry. By way of comparison, in the United Kingdom in 1979 it was estimated by the Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue to represent about 7.5 per cent of the gross domestic product of that country. So, whatever one might say about the exact figure, from a number of comments made by people who have some sort of knowledge of this from a research point of view-including, for instance, the Monash Centre of Policy Studies-it appears to be a very big industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I move from the cash economy to the tax avoidance economy, in which people act within the law but, through contrived schemes in the main, manage to avoid paying the taxation which in every sense of the law ought to be paid. We are told by the Commissioner of Taxation in his sixtieth report for the year 1980-81 that that industry is worth at least $973m in a single year. That is only for those schemes that were at that time under challenge; it does not include schemes which were not challenged but which were nevertheless legislated for later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been very active in this field. One of the reasons I raise this matter today is the many allegations that one hears from one's electorate and also from the Opposition that the Government is not active in this field. I want to point out how active the Government has been. When the Government came into power it noted very quickly that the previous Government had done absolutely nothing in three years of office, despite the fact that it was well known that the tax avoidance industry-I am talking about tax avoidance-had grown rapidly. That was shown up very clearly by the famous Curran case in 1973. We noted that nothing had been done between 1973 and the end of 1975. Nevertheless, since 1977, when we have been able to get legislation forward, we have outlawed 36 tax avoidance schemes. Recently we announced a couple more that will be outlawed and shortly legislation will be brought into this House as I understand it relating to section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which relates to transfer pricing, a very important part of the system. I will mention just a few of the schemes that we have outlawed. We have outlawed schemes to counter five specific forms of sales tax avoidance; schemes involved in the trafficking of current year loss companies; dividend stripping; schemes under which one party obtained a deduction while the other party did not bear tax on the matching amount in the same year of income; the so-called Curran schemes; trading stock schemes; schemes involved with technical deficiencies governing taxation of royalties derived by non-residents; other trust stripping schemes; the exploitation of income of certain charitable organisations, and the list goes on and on. When one reads the list, as I have again recently, of the work that the Government has done in this area, one sees that it is very impressive. But I am not running away from the fact that there is still much more to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these specific schemes, the Government has introduced two very important measures. One is the new Division 4A of the Income Tax Assessment Act which tries to get at the sense of the Act and replaces the old section 260 which, in the light of the attitude over many years of the High Court, turned out to be quite ineffective for the job that the people who had framed the Act obviously meant it to do. We have also, of course, put through the Parliament a complementary Act to the Income Tax Assessment Act called the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act so that it is now a criminal offence to act or to aid and abet someone else to act to prevent the actual collection of income and sales tax by private companies and certain trusts, the so-called bottom of the harbour scheme , which scheme I understand was brought to light as a result of the inquiry into the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these, I think, add up to a rather impressive list, but people go on and on. When one looks back at some of the things that have been done one wonders whether there are in the community thousands and thousands of people who just do not believe they ought to share any sort of tax burden. Some of the schemes in the past few years have been so audacious and bizarre that they have become newspaper headlines and tax avoidance industry bywords such as the so-called Curran scheme and the bottom of the harbour scheme that I have just mentioned and the scheme under which a group of businessmen were able to claim a tax deduction of $3.7m after donating an art collection to the Victorian National Gallery. I understand that one promoter alone stripped more than 2,000 companies and in 733 of those cases was able to deprive Federal revenue of more than $128m in uncollected tax. All this adds up to a horrible picture, a picture which, as I have said, the Government is tackling. The Taxation Advisory Committee was set up two or three years ago by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in order to get advice from private sector practitioners on the best way of framing anti-avoidance legislation. According to that Committee, from the discussions I had with it a few months ago, there is now a real break in the growth of taxation avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention that the cash economy is the biggest area in this industry. It is not just the fancy schemes under which people, who would normally be described as people on high income, avoid tax. Cash economy is engaged in by perhaps millions of Australian individuals, often in a small way, such as the tradesman who works on Saturday and who gets paid cash money and the person on unemployment benefit who accepts cash money in a small way to keep his full entitlement to the unemployment benefit. I do not denigrate any particular group of people in this respect, but we all know that this activity exists and I am quite sure that all of us know of many instances of this sort of thing happening . Some people have said, of course, that cash economy activity is not terribly bad because, they say, if people could not get as it were overtime work without having to pay tax they would not be prepared to work. In that sense people say that the cash economy can be an incentive to people to work harder and therefore increases productivity in this country. One of the corollaries of that, of course, is that it makes it very difficult for the government to know just what the productivity of this country is. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few years, if there has been a great increase in the cash economy, our rate of increase in productivity has in fact been greater than the statistics might show, reflecting, I suppose, even greater credit on the Government in those terms. But the problem is-this is the essence of this matter of public importance-that the cash economy and the tax avoidance economy place a burden on the wrong people. They place a burden in the sense that the Government must collect, to cover all its spending programs, a certain amount of taxes from the people already in the system who cannot avoid tax or who do not want to avoid or evade tax. This year, if we are to collect the $40,000m-odd provided in the Federal Budget, we will have to collect it from those people in the system. If we miss out on $5 billion, $6 billion or even $2 billion in tax avoidance or evasion schemes, in general that money is raised from wage and salary earners who in general are not in a position to avoid or evade taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know-certainly we on this side of the House know-of the great increase in the tax burden in Australia on wage and salary earners. The proportion being paid by these people through direct taxes has increased markedly year by year and we have to do something about it. One of the first things we have to do is to look at how we can discourage, penalise or talk people out of avoiding or evading taxation. It is an area which is highly technical but I want to talk about one or two things which we must do or continue to do. I do not have very much time to expand on this. But, obviously, the Government will have to continue vigorously its anti-avoidance measures. Heaven forbid that we should have a change of government so that that rigorous and strenuous effort by the Government in the past few years might stop. I include in those anti-avoidance measures any relating to sales tax that might need to be taken, something touched upon in Question Time this afternoon. A little while ago I touched on the fact that we have had some amendments in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> One might ask whether a lower tax base overall might discourage people from wanting to avoid tax or wanting to get into the cash economy. I have always doubted that logic. It seems to me that, even with a direct tax rate of 20 per cent, the smarties would still engage in tax avoidance if they could pick up 10 per cent by their efforts. I do not think a lower tax argument fits. Nevertheless we do know that this Government, which is committed to the smallest possible government, is the most likely to have lower tax anyway in the long run . I ask this question in terms of the cash economy: Ought we not to examine what some of us, especially liberal people in our society, have always worried about; that is the possibility of identity cards. It seems to me that, in a country where people obtain so many rights and privileges, some degree of obligation ought to be on them. </PARA>
<PARA> If a cash economy is rife, perhaps it would not hurt if people, when going for a job or accepting money, were put under an obligation to show a card so that they would find it far more difficult to provide a fictitious name. I have not thought that all the way through but it is certainly a matter which I think we should have a very close look at. On top of all those ideas-I know that they are only partial solutions even if they are successful-we cannot avoid the fact that indirect taxation, as has been mentioned in Question Time by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) this afternoon, must be a way to force people into paying taxes through their discretionary purchases. It is quite obvious that, say, a rich person who has to pay a high rate of indirect taxation on a luxury good cannot avoid that tax if he buys the good. On the other hand, he may be wealthy enough to employ smart tax agents to help him avoid direct taxation through tax avoidance schemes . All this has been well documented in the report of the Mathews Committee of Inquiry into Inflation and Taxation and I hope that other people in this debate will have something to say about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I want to emphasise that the Australian Labor Party took no action when it had a three-year chance to do so. I have not heard it address the matter at all. I am certainly looking forward to the next two Opposition speakers to see whether the Labor Party has changed its mind, to see what they have to say about the cash economy-whether they are prepared to present policies that would endeavour to act against and penalise, people who are ripping off those who are co-operating with the tax system. Given that the Labor Party is the high tax party, under its jurisdiction the cash economy and the tax avoidance industry would prove an even greater burden to wage and salary earners. Let us just hope that by airing this matter and by having the debate publicised throughout the community we can appeal to the morality of the Australian people and ask those who are offending to improve their attitudes. </PARA>

<PARA> The inequitable tax burden imposed on wage and salary earners by the artificial tax avoidance industry and the cash economy. </PARA>
<PARA>One would think that this was something for which the Government had no responsibility whatever. Of course, the fact is that since it has been in office there has been a massive explosion of tax avoidance and evasion, and the burden on wage and salary earners as a result has become a matter of national concern. That is not to say that there was no tax avoidance or evasion prior to 1976; but it is to say that there is no doubt whatever that there has been a massive explosion of such activity while this Government has been in office. It is also utterly untrue to say, as did the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) on two occasions, that the former Labor Government did nothing about tax avoidance when it was in office. This is a lie which is perpetrated time and time again by speakers on the Government side, despite the fact-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw the term and say that it is a massive untruth that has been perpetrated time and time again by the Government, knowing it to be untrue. It is continually putting it forward, despite the fact that on several occasions we have shown what the Labor Government did about tax avoidance. For the Hansard record, let me yet again cite what was done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, we eliminated Norfolk Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island as tax havens for the avoidance of personal and company tax. Dividends and interests paid to Papua New Guinea were made subject to withholding tax in order to prevent the use of that country for the avoidance of such tax. The payment of dividends to artificial companies in Papua New Guinea and other tax havens was ended. Also, the Labor Government introduced the system of tax clearance certificates and the use of exchange control by the Reserve Bank to limit the employment of tax havens for tax avoidance purposes. Restrictions were placed on the purchase and use of companies with accumulated bad debts for similar purposes. Restrictions were placed on the purchase and use of companies with accumulated losses. Restrictions were placed on the carrying forward of excess distributions by private companies to avoid undistributed profits tax. Subscriptions to pseudo-exploration companies as a form of tax avoidance were ended. The avoidance of withholding tax on interest payable to overseas residents through an overseas branch of an Australian company was stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> Does that look like a list of non-action? Of course it does not. It represents a whole series of actions taken, mainly in the early stages of the Labor Government's term of office, because the previous Government had been lax and had left these loopholes, which the Labor Government proceeded to close off, in the main during 1973-74. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who has now left the chamber, also said that the former Labor Government did nothing in respect of the so-called Curran scheme, stating that it was introduced in 1973 and the Labor Government did nothing about it from 1973 to 1975. That was also untrue. The Curran case was decided in December 1974, only one year before the Labor Government went out of office. At that time the Treasurer Mr Crean, made it clear that legislation would be passed against the scheme. Admittedly it was not done in 1975, but neither was it done in 1976 or 1977. It was not done until 1978. So if the Labor Government can be accused of some slackness in 1975-I remind honourable members of the circumstances under which it was trying to govern at the time-what of the succeeding Government effort in 1976 and 1977? It did absolutely nothing about this scheme while it was being used, and demonstrably so, in massive tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an explosion of the use of the scheme in the first two years of this Government's period of office, yet it comes in here and says: 'Look at the slackness of the previous Labor Government. It did nothing about the Curran scheme. The present Government presided over the period during which the scheme was used massively as a form of tax avoidance and hundreds of millions of dollars of tax revenue were lost by its use. Therefore, we repudiate entirely the totally false accusations which have been made here today that the former Labor Government was slack in respect of tax avoidance. We have repudiated them many times before but I repeat that statement because I am sick and tired of these nauseating accusations being made for which there are absolutely no grounds whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, there has been a massive explosion of tax avoidance since this Government came into office. There is no doubt whatsoever about that. The annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation gives a fairly good indication of this fact. It gives the number of identified participants in tax avoidance schemes although, as he points out in his annual report, that is only the tip of the iceberg. It specifies that the number of people who were involved last year in tax avoidance schemes was 26 times higher than it was in 1975-I repeat, 26 times higher. Does that look like this Government has been effectively combating tax avoidance? Of course it has not. There has been this massive explosion, as shown by this statistic, of a 26-fold increase in the number of identified participants in tax avoidance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of money involved is now in the order of at least $3,000m and maybe much more. People like Mr Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers' Association say the figure lost through tax avoidance and evasion is more like $7 billion per annum. Other estimates, by such people as Professor Mathews, put the figure at somewhere around $3 1/2 billion. Whether it is $3 1/2 billion or $7 billion, an enormous amount of revenue is being lost principally because of the slackness of this Government in dealing with the explosion of tax avoidance and evasion. The Government knows that to be true; yet it brings on this kind of matter of public importance and says it is doing everything that can be done about it when in fact that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we acknowledge that particularly since 1978 there has been a whole stream of legislation brought in against particular tax avoidance schemes. We do not in any way deny that that has occurred; it is an undeniable fact. We do say that that does not show that this Government has been effective in its actions against tax avoidance schemes. It has not been effective. That is shown by this massive explosion in the amount of revenue being lost and by the number of participants in tax avoidance schemes. The Government has not been effective because it has lacked the sense or the guts, or whatever is needed, to undertake retrospective action in regard to tax avoidance schemes, thereby putting a real end to the tax avoidance industry. This is the one measure which can be undertaken by this Government which will damage the tax avoidance industry more than anything else. The Government knows that to be true. </PARA>
<PARA> We understand and appreciate fully the general undesirability of retrospective legislation but in this case we have to balance that against the massive inequity in the tax system being brought about by this explosion of tax avoidance, which is making tax optional for the wealthy and putting the burden on wage and salary earners. When we balance off the general undesirability of retrospective legislation against the massive inequities being created by tax avoidance, we come down on the side of retrospective action in this limited area of tax avoidance cases. If the Government were to introduce such legislation, most certainly it would have a massive dissuasion effect on the tax avoidance industry because people would know when they got involved in a scheme that, even if it took the Commissioner three years to catch up with them, eventually they would have to pay all the tax and the promoter's fee as well, and so would be worse off at the end of the day. That is why retrospective action is most important. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot get that effect through a case by case approach. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) time and time again has come into the House and said he has found out about a new scheme-often it is a variation of an old scheme-and as from today the Government will knock off that scheme. By that time the scheme has been used for one, two or maybe even more years and that revenue has been lost forever. The industry then goes on to a new scheme, and following that another new scheme . It plays a cat and mouse game which the Taxation Commissioner can never win. The Government must always be on the losing side. </PARA>
<PARA> The only effective action that the Government has taken in respect of tax avoidance-how effective it is is yet very unclear-is in respect of Part IVA, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. Part IVA seems to have had at least for the time being an inhibiting effect on tax avoidance schemes, on the proliferation of paper schemes. Whether that will continue we do not know. If the industry can find a way around Part IVA-I have no doubt it is working feverishly hard on doing so-we can expect paper schemes to proliferate once again and we will find that we are back to where we were a couple of years ago. At the moment it seems as though there is a temporary lull but that might not be the case for very long. It may well turn out to be a very temporary lull indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with the ineffective action on tax avoidance through the legislation which has been undertaken there has also, of course, been no action taken in respect of some schemes which have been allowed to continue. The Treasurer said last Budget that he would legislate against transfer pricing by multinational companies, that is, channelling money around to avoid tax in Australia so that the tax is paid in another country where tax rates might be lower. But we have not seen that legislation. There has been no legislation brought in about that. One would think he has had enough time to produce it since the Budget of last year but we still have not seen it. He has done nothing about the tax avoidance scheme which is available in respect of foreign earned income through the fact that income which is earned overseas and brought back into Australia is currently tax free in Australia once it has been taxed overseas. That, of course , leaves a massive tax loophole which the Treasurer in 1978 said he would close off, but in fact he has not done so. When he raised the possibility of doing that there were screams from those who were involved in those schemes and he therefore backed off doing anything about it. So tax avoidance through that kind of device continues. </PARA>
<PARA> He has done nothing about tax avoidance through internal superannuation funds which have been pointed out by others to be a prolific form of tax avoidance. Although remedies are available-they have been pointed to by Asprey amongst others-nothing has been done in respect of closing off tax avoidance loopholes through internal superannuation schemes. I refer here to the setting up of pseudo superannuation schemes which on the face of it appear to be for the superannuation of the employees but which in fact only exploit the tax deduction provisions of the superannuation part of the tax Act to get the deduction. In the end the money is not used for superannuation at all; it is just used for the benefit of those who are the operators of the scheme. These sorts of schemes are being allowed to run on; nothing is being done about them. So we say that the Government's action in respect of tax avoidance has been demonstrably, massively and culpably lax because it has allowed tax avoidance to increase to the massive proportions that exist today. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of tax evasion, the Government also, of course, gathered up its strength in 1978 to look as though it might do something about this problem, but then it backed off. In 1978 the Treasurer said he would do something about the cash economy. He came into the House and discussed the possibility of taking action to require employers of sub-contract labour to deduct pay-as-you-earn tax before payments were made to subcontractors. Nothing was done about that because there were screams from those who were involved. Therefore the Government backed off. It backed off on the one action it has ever proposed in respect of tax evasion and the cash economy. Government members should not come in here then and say to us that we have suggested nothing about tax evasion. The Government backed off from the one scheme it had gathered up the strength actually to announce something about. It did so at the first barks from those involved. It has allowed tax evasion to run on at greater and greater levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, now we have the absolute absurdity of the Treasurer saying time and time again, principally at Question Time, that the way around the tax evasion problem is through indirect taxes. What a massive joke that is. He is saying that if there is tax evasion on a wide scale this makes the tax system inequitable. That is certainly true because it means that some people pay little or no tax and others have to pay more, and they tend to be the wage and salary earners. We accept that part of the argument-there is no doubt about that. But then he goes on to say that therefore the way around that is not to stop the tax evasion but to have indirect taxes. He says that we will increase indirect taxes which are generally inequitable or regressive-that is, they bear most heavily on people on lower incomes-as a way around the problem which is created by tax evasion. What a ridiculous idea that is. In other words, he is saying that we will overcome this process which is making the tax system more regressive by adopting another approach which will make the tax system even more regressive. What an absurd and ridiculous argument. It is one that this side of the House absolutely and totally rejects as a solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government wants to do something about tax evasion it should deal with it directly. It should undertake the kind of action which was proposed in 1978. The Government needs to get a lot more tax officials on the ground instead of using staff ceilings to reduce the number of people who are employed in the Taxation Office. It was absurd that this occurred at the beginning of the year. Admittedly, that situation has since been considerably redressed. The Taxation Office, if it is going to overcome tax evasion, needs a lot more tax investigators rather than having staff ceilings imposed on it in a way which inhibits and limits its ability to overcome the problem. To suggest that the answer to tax evasion is increased reliance on indirect taxation is a massive delusion, just as is the suggestion that we cannot afford income tax cuts unless we have indirect tax increases; in other words, we cannot afford to reduce our tax payment from our pay packet unless the Government can take more out of our pay by taxing the goods and services which we buy. What an absurd argument that is. This whole argument about indirect tax is one which has no weight whatsoever . As a solution to tax evasion it is just a delusion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member sought to avoid it by saying that it was only one of the many points he was making. It is the essence of the Australian Labor Party's position that it wishes to make illegal what was legal at the time it was done. That is a basic principle of law which does not rest easily with the Labor Party. It seems to me that when one considers all the comments he made about the slackness of the Government-its ineffective action and so on-basically what he was saying was that despite the fact that the Government has introduced far more legislation per minute, per hour and per year in respect of tax avoidance and evasion than the Labor Party ever thought of, the Government has not been successful because of the lack of retrospectivity. I hope that everyone in Australia who has any concept and appreciation of the rule of law of this massive principle of retrospectivity will listen with great interest to what the honourable member for Gellibrand had to say. It is worth while dramatising the fact that when he complains about the massive explosion in identifiable avoidance he has to recognise that the Government has to know what is going on before it can identify it. At least this Government has been able to establish what is going on and to close those loopholes. That is the difference. It has been identified. He is quite right. Under his Government very little was identified because it did not have to be. The system was so incredibly wide open that there was very little need or capacity to identify the volume of evasion. When one reads through and condenses what the honourable member had to say one will see that the facts do not back his rhetoric. He said that there was slackness on the part of the Government. Can he seriously suggest that all the legisation we have introduced represents slackness? Of course it does not. It represents enormous activity. The honourable member's one basic objection is that the legislation is not retrospective.</PARA></TALK.START>

At no stage has he or the Labor Party as a whole expressed concern about this enormous loss of revenue. </PARA>

As I understand it, estimates place it at as much as the identifiable loss through the schemes on which he concentrated all but 30 seconds of his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a vital need for us to recognise that the cash economy has generated an immense tax problem. It means, very simply, that those people who do not pay a reasonable amount of tax, who do not pay what they are supposed to pay, are imposing an immense burden on those who cannot avoid payment. This evasion occurs at both ends of the scale. It occurs at the rich end-on which the honourable member for Gellibrand likes to concentrate, almost exclusively-and at the other end, the cash economy end. It is an economy which is supported by people who are equally culpable when they pay cash without requiring receipts on the acceptance of a cheque, for example, or some other identification or recognisable document. People who seek cash services are as culpable as the person who is evading tax by undertaking for cash only services which are not reported. There is no doubt, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) said, that there is an incredible volume of cases now coming to light of people, having avoided tax, having evaded tax by not stating their income, doubling up by assaulting the taxpayer by claiming social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the incredible claim of the Labor Party that the only reason that we are suggesting the imposition of indirect taxes is that we cannot collect direct taxes. What an incredible misstatement. What a nonsensical proposition put forward by the honourable member for Gellibrand. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Willis" NAMEID="ZJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Mr BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the honourable member said that. His proposition that we find indirect taxes very attractive because we cannot raise money in direct taxes misses one basic point that he and the Labor Party will never be able to understand. Indirect taxes give freedom to the person who is being taxed to decide whether he wants to be subjected to that tax in a very real way. If he wants to consume taxable items, he pays tax. The degree of that tax depends both on the extent to which the item attracts tax and on the price of that item. If, for example, the person is a pensioner and wishes to spend very little on, say, a pair of shoes, those shoes will attract less tax than a very expensive pair of imported shoes. The same applies to dresses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is incredible that this freedom for people to decide what to do with their money, how they will dispose of it, is something that the Labor Party finds so unattractive. Naturally, it is not a party that is in favour of freedom of action on the part of the individual. It is worth reminding the House that the allegation that the sales tax proposals that we have introduced are regressive is deliberately deceptive. The reality is that the bulk of lower income group expenditure patterns relates to items which are not subject to sales tax under the Government's proposals, which the Labor Party is blocking in the Senate by joining with the Australian Democrats. This is costing the revenue something like $330m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me incredible that although it is self-evident that the more people have the capacity to consume and to spend money the greater their expenditure and their taxes will be. To dismiss that situation as regressive and unfair to lower income groups is absurd. It seems to me incredible that the Labor Party would adopt this approach. But it is not incredible to me that the Labor Party opposes the concept of freedom of individual action. It seems important to me that the Australian Government follows the lead set by overseas countries. It should spread our tax base and not be continually accused of being a high tax country simply because our direct taxes are high when the reality is that the tax rate in Australia overall is very low. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it quite appropriate that on St Patrick's Day of 1982 the Government should bring on for discussion as a matter of public importance the question of tax avoidance in which it has demonstrated total hypocrisy over the last five years. The Irish have always been known, I can say this as the only member of the House wearing green today and because of my surname, for their blarney. We have seen that throughout the speeches from Government members today. Unfortunately the Government members who have spoken today have not had the positive assets of the Irish, which are: Intelligence, integrity, honesty and above all a belief that they have to take responsibility for their actions. Today in the debate we have heard the continual berating by the Government of any suggestion that it is at fault. It has said: It is not our fault. It is not our responsibility. It all goes back to the Whitlam Government. How much longer is this going to continue and how much longer is the Government to try to avoid responsibility for its actions? We can see this quite clearly in the taxation area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the debate today we have heard the most amazing hypocrisy. The Government has raised this issue of the inequitable tax burden imposed on wage and salary earners by the artificial tax avoidance schemes and by the cash economy. I agree with that statement, but it is members of the Fraser Government who have caused that situation to arise. It is because of the Government's policies over the last seven years that tax avoidance is a reality. What gross hypocrisy it is for the Government to raise this as an issue. I hope that it will serve at least one useful purpose, that is, that all Government members, particularly those on the back bench, will see that tax avoidance is a reality and will agree that the Government should accept some responsibility for its actions and do something to resolve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the reality is. Let us look at the burden on pay-as-you- earn taxpayers under the seven years of Fraser Government. As a percentage of total taxation revenue, the taxation paid by PAYE taxpayers has increased from 41.7 per cent in 1975-76 to 45.7 per cent in 1981-82. Therefore, if PAYE taxpayers were to pay the same proportion of total taxation in 1981-82 as they paid in 1975-76, they would be paying $1,506m less. That is over $6 a week for the average household. That is the increased burden that PAYE taxpayers are paying. Why are they paying it? They are paying it because of the direct policies of the Fraser Government. If the proportion of the gross domestic product absorbed by taxation and the proportion of that tax paid by PAYE taxpayers had remained at the 1975-76 levels during the 1981-82 period, PAYE taxpayers would be paying $2,931m less in tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for me to stand up and quote these huge figures, but what does this mean to the ordinary wage and salary earner and to the ordinary family in Australia? A huge proportion of the people in my electorate are making a massive contribution through PAYE. What is the effect on the ordinary family in Australia? Any person who does normal shopping and who tries to live a normal life in Australia knows what those figures mean in terms of take-home pay. The PAYE taxpayers are bearing the brunt of the disastrous economic mismanagement of this country. They are getting sick and tired of continually paying more tax while businesses, industries and the self-employed are able to take advantage of tax minimisation and tax avoidance schemes and while the less scrupulous are able to get away with tax evasion on a grand scale. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as we have heard from this debate there is no tax relief in sight for the wage and salary earners under the Fraser Government's policy. All they can expect is greater financial strain on the family budget. Not only are taxes being increased but also, when these PAYE contributions are added to everything else that is coming out of the family budget-including interest rates, increased health insurance premiums and increased charges for almost all the necessities of life-is an enormous burden placed on the ordinary family. That is what we are talking about today. That is what this matter of public importance really means to ordinary families: It means that they are paying much more and getting less back in their pockets as well as a decline in services and a reduction in ordinary family living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of all this, the Government now wants to impose a further tax in the form of sales tax. We recently heard the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) trying to give a justification for this. But this proposed tax would be imposed on such a wide range of goods, which are required by everyone in the community. Let us hope that this Government sees the error of its ways in this proposed sales tax legislation and does not try again in the next Budget to introduce further tax burdens on the ordinary family in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The net result of all this is that ordinary Australian families are losing badly under this Government's taxation policies, because not only are they paying more tax but also are they receiving less services. They have received no compensation for their reduction in buying power. Inflation is still as high as ever and the economic forecast is gloomy. That is the reality for the ordinary family after seven years of Fraser government, when all we have heard are promises. But there is a very big gap between each promise and the reality. I ask honourable members to listen to these promises and to compare them with the reality that I have just spoken about and that every Australian family knows about. In 1975, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not in the business of hitting the pockets of the working men and women of Australia. The Government will bring taxes down further, not increase them. </PARA>
<PARA>As we have seen, that has not happened. In his 1977 election speech-elections are a great time for promises-the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have ended the big tax ripoff. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should ask the families of Australia about the big tax ripoff . Further, in his 1980 election speech the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are clamping down on tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>I look now at that last promise of clamping down on tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) quoted from Professor Russell Mathews' estimate on how much tax avoidance is going on in this country. Eric Risstrom, the Secretary of the Australian Taxpayers Association, estimates that tax avoidance and evasion cost the country approximately $7 billion a year. Now there is no doubt that it is difficult to estimate the amount of money we are losing from revenue in tax avoidance. Nevertheless the facts speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the number of taxpayers identified as being involved in tax avoidance. In 1975-76, the number was identified at 861. In 1980-81, the number had grown to 22,366. The 1979-80 Budget made provision for $160m of revenue shortfall for identified but successfully defended tax avoidance schemes by indivuduals and $120m for schemes by companies. In 1980-81 the provisions had grown to $170m and $130m respectively. In 1981-82 the provision has grown to $ 220m for individuals but has reduced to $80m for companies. This growth has occurred despite the Government's claim that it is taking effective action against tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have said in our argument today is that the Government has taken this action to try to clamp down on tax avoidance but not for enough. We believe that a great deal more action should be taken in that direction because currently we have in Australia a situation in which the massive burden of taxation falls on the wage and salary earners, on those people who cannot practice tax avoidance and tax evasion. It is not sufficient to get up in this Parliament and attack the carpet layers, the paper boys, the plumbers and the housewives. What we want is a fair and equitable taxation system for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Bill before the House, the Bounty Acts Amendment Bill, is to extend for another year the payment of bounties to two industries, the drilling bits industry and the non-adjustable wrenches industry. We can tell of what riveting interest this matter is by the number of honourable members present, but I know that there are many others working hard at their desks, moving paper, who cannot wait to hear that the Opposition supports this Bill. Their suspense is now removed and I am able to say more about the Bill and also about these industries, which are of importance to our country. The bounties, or subsidies, for these industries were introduced as a short term assistance measure, initially at double the rate provided in this Bill. The extension of the bounty scheme until the end of this year at half the rate can be seen as a phasing arrangement towards frankly a lower rate of assistance. From the beginning of next year the form of assistance will revert to tariffs-25 per cent for the non-adjustable wrenches industry and 15 per cent for the drilling bits industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We on the Opposition side of the House believe that both of these industries, despite their small size, are very important to our country. They confer benefits of the type that only local manufacturing industry can. Some of the benefits include advanced technology, the employment of skilled labour, security of supply of strategically and industrially important items and also the spreading of the benefits of developments in the minerals industry to a wider range of occupations. </PARA>
<PARA> These two industries are also not likely to require heavy assistance in the longer term. The nominal rates of tariff which apply to the industries are not unduly high. The tariffs of 25 per cent for the non-adjustable wrenches industry and 15 per cent for the drilling bits industry are not high by any standard, particularly in comparison with many other industries, or indeed in comparison with the average for the manufacturing industry. Incidentally, the average for the manufacturing industry which is about 15 per cent and the average for the metal industries which is about 20 per cent are a lot lower than many people in our community think they are. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of additional short term assistance has been justified as necessary to allow the firms engaged in these industries to improve their competitiveness through new investment and improved quality. In respect of drilling bits, there has also been a problem of alleged dumping, and action has been taken by that industry on imports of bits from America. Although bounties and general tariffs are not designed to counter the impact of dumping, it is a matter of concern to the Australian Labor Party that Australia, being a very small market in comparison with so many other countries, is so vulnerable to dumping activities. The present government machinery to identify and act against dumping is, in our view, inadequate and it is far too slow moving. Our tariff, quota, and bounty assistance in part is necessary because of Australia's vulnerability, as a small market, to dumping. When people criticise the levels of protection for Australian industry they should be more aware of these types of problems such as the dumping problem. There are very few, if any, firms in Australia that are large enough to cause injury to a foreign market through dumping, but the converse does not apply. There are hundreds of foreign firms for which the entire Australian market would represent only a small proportion of their production. </PARA>
<PARA> In circumstances of world economic recession, it is not surprising therefore that Australia is especially vulnerable to unfair trading practices, such as dumping or strategic pricing, as these large overseas corporations seek to maintain their scale economies and aggregate sales by selling at low prices into any market they can, particularly the Australian market. Unlike many markets for industrial products, Australia is wide open for such trade. The non-tariff barriers which are a feature of so many other countries are virtually non- existent here. I would hope that a reduction in these non-tariff barriers can be achieved by other countries, but until they are there is no point in expecting that, in our more overt way of protection, sharp reductions in tariffs or bounties will be possible or acceptable for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Many efficient industries are vulnerable in an open market environment because, contrary to the dreams and fantasies of some of the economic rationalists who sit on the other side of this Parliament-I notice none of them are in the chamber at present-the rest of the world does not follow the rules of Adam Smith . Those people opposite think that the rest of the world does follow the rules of Adam Smith and they expect us to do so as well. The result of their expectations or aspirations would be disaster for employment in this country. On the contrary, the real world is comprised of very large firms and even some non- market countries which do not play by the rules of perfect competition and comparative advantage. This, of course, applies particularly to countries behind the Iron Curtain which do not follow those rules. It is possible, indeed highly likely, that a country which ignores this will be disadvantaged in the longer term. Its industries and growth prospects will be predated by larger, but not necessarily more efficient foreign companies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that government action be taken in Australia to ensure that our domestic manufacturing industries are given a chance to develop their products and skills, to invest, to become competitive on fair terms and to grow. That is why the Opposition supports this Bill, and it is also why we are critical of the Government's manufacturing policies generally. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is just so inadequate as an expression of manufacturing industry policy. It provides breathing space for two local companies, but it does not constitute the vitally needed, planned approach to our economic development generally. The two industries which we are discussing are both within the metal trades. Yesterday honourable members would have read of the Metal Trades Industry Association prediction for 1982. The results of this survey came out at the end of last week and have received quite a deal of publicity. The February survey of the MTIA reveals further deterioration of trading conditions and less confidence about the future. The problems include high import competition, low export sales, a lower level of investment and stagnant industry employment. The survey revealed that in February production was down and expected investment was down on the previous year's figures. There must be no doubt as to the cause of this problem. It has arisen as a response to the disastrous mismanagement of the economy which has occurred over the course of 1981 and which of course is continuing to occur during this year, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the Government's tight money policy lead to a collapse of demand and investment. We have also seen it lead to enormously high interest rates. The mismanagement of the exchange rate, which went up by over 10 per cent over the course of a year, and which collapsed down again in an even shorter period, has greatly destabilised manufacturing industry. The Government's own message to business, firstly bullish and exaggerated-talking about the resources boom that was with us-is now all doom and gloom. It has also destabilised industry in this country and accordingly has jeopardised employment. Added to this, as if this were not enough, has been the massive uncertainty created by the Government's wild swings on the issue of industry protection. We still await the outcome of the rash of references to the Industries Assistance Commission, which the Government pursued in one of its optimistic moods last year. In all of these respects, we have seen ad hockery and uncertainty run wild, whereas the great need of Australian industry is a degree of certainty and security. Without this certainty, investment for growth is virtually impossible. This is one of the fundamental reasons why manufacturing continues at such a low ebb, in such a malaise, in Australia at present. Instead, a planned approach whereby everyone is aware of and can have some confidence in a national strategy for the re- industrialisation of Australia is essential. The occasional bounty Bill does not add up to that planned approach and that new strategy. It does not achieve our purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take, for example, the drilling bits industry, one of the two industries under consideration in this Bill. Here is an industry in which, because Australia has a large mining industry, a related manufacturing industry can develop. Initially, the appropriate policies were pursued. In 1973 the Australian Industry Development Corporation, a government instrumentality, provided funds to Wepco Pty Ltd, a local company, with the aim of developing a range of percussive bits and hammers. This made a great deal of sense because, if a longer term view were taken, it would readily be seen that Australia could develop expertise in this mining-related area. In addition, since Wepco's drilling bits are made of mainly imported materials, there are subsequent rounds of import replacing development available. Unfortunately, in 1976, after that initiative from the Australian Industry Development Corporation had met with certain success, Wepco was taken over by an American multinational company, Dresser Industrial Inc., based in Texas. As a result, the foreign company acquired the technology developed in Australia with the use of Australian funds.</PARA>
<PARA> Often the excuse for allowing these international companies to take over our own companies is that the Australian company is too small, and would not have enough funds to undertake research and development in order to develop in the way that it should. Wepco is a classic case in which the multinational company which came in and took over an Australian company, took over its research and development. This is a tragedy for us. I am not making an objection to this particular set of events. Frankly, I have not had the opportunity to go back and look at the Foreign Investment Review Board report of this takeover. I am not making an attack on the company without the necessary background knowledge to do so. But, surely, it is another example of inadequate forward planning and muddled objective setting in Australian industry policy that we allow this sort of thing to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The rock drills industry in Australia is almost entirely in foreign hands. The level of imports of rock drill bits of all types has grown from $7.8m in 1976-77 to $15.5m in 1979-80. As much as 85 per cent of the drill bit market in Australia is supplied by imports. The remainder is provided by the subsidiaries of foreign companies, which subsidiaries accordingly now fully own and control the technologies involved. Whereas we should have a worthwhile manufacturing industry owned by Australians, with research and development in an area where we have so many opportunities being pursued by Australians, instead the story is such a sad one, as I have just related. What this points to is a failure of Government policy. Australia has lost because of the open door policy taken by conservatives who in recent years, sadly for this nation, have ruled it more often than not for one reason or another. That open door policy of the Government to the takeover of our innovative, small manufacturing industries by multinationals has caused this problem. We have lost because we have not put enough effort into research, development and design of new products. We continue to lose because no effort is made to identify development opportunities and to pursue them in a planned and co-ordinated way. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia must make greater efforts to develop other manufacturing activities related to resource projects. It is just one of the opportunities that we must grab and run with. Australian manufacturers should be encouraged to supply a greater proportion of the equipment and materials used by major mining projects. Linking manufacturing to resource development is one of the principal means of spreading the benefits of that development. It is particularly important to the manufacturing States such as Victoria and South Australia. I hope that anybody in Victoria, with the coming State election, who has listened to my remarks will note the different attitude of the Australian Labor Party when compared with that of the coalition parties in the Parliament on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In both Canada and the United Kingdom, government planning offices have been established to achieve this objective of linking more manufacturing activity to resource projects. In Canada the Office of Industrial and Regional Benefits seeks the maximum possible use of planning skills, project development ability, machinery and materials supplies from local companies. In the United Kingdom an agency known as an Offshore Supplies Office seeks the same objective in relation to North Sea development. I am proud to say that it was a Labour government in the United Kingdom that realised that, with the great North Sea oil development that was taking place, there was not enough flow-over of industrial activity in the manufacturing sector in the United Kingdom and that such a flow into that manufacturing sector required some government involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I will break off for a moment and say that it is quite natural in many ways that overseas companies that are involved in these big projects such as the North Sea oil drilling, because of their personnel-where they come from and where they have been trained-will naturally think in terms of using the products of the countries from which their personnel have come. If the engineers are American, they know the American companies and the American specifications and they tend to go to America for the support services and equipment needed in those projects. Similarly, in this country, the more that we allow our large projects, such as the open cut coal projects run by Utah Mining Australia Ltd, to be in the hands of foreign multinationals, the more the result will be that those multinational companies will look elsewhere in the world for the provision of services and of equipment for the projects. Where we can have Australian involvement, we can have more Australian services and equipment being used. The statistics show this to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is not always possible for Australian companies to be the developers in these great projects and that is why we need an agency such as the United Kingdom Offshore Supplies Office, or the Canadian Office of Industrial and Regional Benefits to stimulate the use of Australian products and Australian services in these great projects. The planning agencies in those countries have been very successful. In contrast in this country we are suffering a balance of payments deficit in part due to the import of machinery and materials for resource development. The coalition Government's rejection of the planning approach which I am advocating, and of the Government's involvement in the form which I am suggesting to the House is advisable, results in our not maximising our opportunities. Job creation ventures and growth are being lost because insufficient effort is being made to maximise local involvement in resource investment. The metal industry still has sectors working at only three-quarters capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the principal features of Labor's economic policies is that a management machinery will be established so that Government policy will, wherever practicable, provide an avenue for local companies to supply the needs of the major resource projects. It is very likely that some bird brain on the other side of politics will accuse me of socialism in putting this forward. I will be quite proud if he does so but, of course, in throwing out that word, the Government looks upon it as a dirty word. I do not. Indeed, I have shown by the examples I have given that there are great benefits for the Australian community , for the creation of other jobs, if indeed we pursue such activities. I might say that because of what I would consider-I am sure my colleagues do also-to be some very sensible provisions for the motor vehicle manufacturing industry, one Maximilian Walsh, in today's Bulletin, has suggested that they are the greatest examples of socialism that he has discovered in a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is so, so be it, but for goodness sake let us get on with it sooner rather than later. If ever the motor vehicle manufacturing industry required a different policy, it is now. If ever an industry required something better than the export facilitation policies that are being put forward by the Government at present, it is the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. The tragedy of this Government, from the point of view of industry, is that it is ideologically opposed to any form of Government action in relation to resource allocation. While that happens, we will not have a proper spread of the benefits to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these policies, the Government does not attempt some of the worthwhile innovations which are attempted by even some of the conservative governments overseas. The Office of Offshore Supplies which I mentioned earlier was set up by a conservative government in England. Similarly in Japan, the Ministry for International Trade and Industry has for a very long time defined leading sectors in the economy and pursued rapid development in these sectors through a mixture of government and private sector initiatives. Australia is one of the few countries in the world whose industrial policies have focused almost solely on protective devices, such as the tariffs and bounties we are considering here, and so little on positive development devices, such as research, co-ordinated planning, protection of innovative companies from predation by imports or multinational takeovers, and other forms of creative assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Government stands condemned on this issue. The performance of manufacturing under it has been abysmal. In six years almost nothing has been achieved. The levels of imports of manufactures is the main reason that Australia is now under serious balance of payment pressure. The failure of manufacturing employment to grow accounts for a major proportion of our record unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, the Opposition, in supporting this Bill, takes the opportunity to say what is wrong in other areas of the industrial policy of this country. We support the Bill because it provides continuing breathing space for the industries that it assists, but it is not a long term panacea. However, we are as convinced as we ever have been that unless a completely revamped industry policy is put in place in Australia our manufacturing sector will continue to suffer the malaise identified six years ago by the Jackson Committee to advise on Policies for Manufacturing Industry-a malaise that is still ignored. The Labor Party believes that Australia's progress is dependent on a renewed national development effort. It believes that this effort must be consciously pursued by State and Federal governments acting with the private sector and the trade union movement. We seek a co-operative approach towards an economic and social strategy which will permit a much improved performance, not just in one or two glamour industries, but across a broad spectrum of national development. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I wish to say something about Labor's strategy which presents an alternative to the one that I have been criticising and under which we are suffering at present. The co-operation that Labor would pursue would be followed through at every level but at its peak there would be an Economic Planning Advisory Council which would have continuous access to Cabinet and have its own staff, thereby ensuring that its business and union members could have an independent and effective role in the making of key decisions at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA> One of its primary objectives would be the attainment of a prices and incomes policy in Australia. An anti-inflation strategy is absolutely vital to manufacturing industry-even branches of it such as the two that I have been talking about this afternoon, that are subject to bounty help. Only if wage and price setting can be brought into line with a structure of agreed guidelines can we pursue a more expansionary economic policy without running the risk of incurring even higher inflation levels. This direct approach to controlling inflation is essential. The only alternative, that which has been pursued so unsuccessfully for the last six years, is to keep the lid on the economy forever . It works very poorly and its costs in terms of unemployment, low growth, poor productivity, increasing social and regional divisions--</PARA>

It will also be possible to achieve lower interest rates and, I hope, through activity in industries such as the two that are the subject of this Bill, to reduce unemployment, which is at such disastrously high levels at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), in his address, has taken the usual tilts at the Government's economic and industry policies. I recognise that at this time there is a slow-down in economic activity which, perhaps, is most strongly felt in the manufacturing sector. But when the honourable member talks of policy he does not offer any viable alternative policy. As the honourable member pointed out, the Bounty Acts Amendment Bill is part of the Government's industry policy which is directed towards the encouragement of manufacturing activities which are more specialised , low cost, competitive, innovative and export oriented. That industry policy, in turn, is part of the overall economic policy of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The alternative, such as it is, offered by the Opposition involves, in the industry area, more planning, more control and more smothering bureaucracy, and in overall economic policy a program which would undoubtedly lead to increasing costs and inflation-the worst thing, from the point of view of industry, that could occur. The honourable member should recognise that one of the most important things in respect of industry policy that one can do is achieve an internationally competitive cost position. That is, in fact, just what this Government has achieved. Thereby it has stimulated activity in both import competing and export industries. I agree that there has been some slippage in that regard in recent months. One factor in this was the appreciation of the currency in the period to August-September. That situation has now changed with a movement since then in the other direction. The honourable member had the gall to refer specifically to Labor's policy in respect of the motor vehicle industry . A key passage of that policy states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the context of substantial Government support for the industry, it is essential that the Government be involved in the formulation of plans-</PARA>
<PARA>Note the small 'p'-in short, planning-</PARA>
<PARA>for the industry's future structure. It is also necessary that the Government monitor and regulate to the extent necessary, pricing and component sourcing decisions of the major vehicle assemblers. A Labor Government will establish an Automotive Industry Authority to achieve this planning and regulation of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should note that the statement says 'regulate pricing decisions' of the major companies. One might as well nationalise them straight out. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, and in contrast to Labor's stated policy, the policy of this side of the House involves a plan with a capital 'P'-but within the parameters of that plan the market will determine the outcome. That has already had the effect that motor cars in Germany and the United Kingdom are already being driven around by engines made in Australia. The honourable member for Adelaide, straying somewhat from the subject of bounties, referred to the central feature of the Government's policy in this area, namely, export facilitation. The Government makes no apology for its emphasis on export facilitation. It is a powerful force which at the same time ensures firstly, the continuation of a sizeable industry in Australia and secondly, makes for a more export oriented industry, for cost reduction and for new investment in large scale-one hopes world scale-plants to produce particular components cheaply, while other components that would be high cost components if manufactured in Australia, are imported. It is also a powerful force for rationalisation and amalgamation in the industry. I ask the Australian people to compare these two approaches-a motor vehicle authority planning the industry, overseeing its pricing decisions and in general setting up a smothering bureaucracy to create an industry which would be a high cost island in the whole world economy, as against the proposals to which I have just referred that come from this side of the House. So much for the planning to which the honourable member referred. </PARA>
<PARA> He also referred to certain references which the Government has sent to the Industries Assistance Commission. The reference relating to a general reduction of tariffs was made in accordance with the terms of our acceptance of the report of the Crawford Study Group on Structural Adjustment in mid-1979. We said that we would complete the tariff review program then in progress, and after that send the reference. That reference has gone. I recall also that the Crawford study group said that action on that reference was contingent on certain other conditions prevailing, namely, the implementation of the general thrust of an industrial development policy, and a situation where unemployment in the country was not too high-in particular, not higher than, say 5 per cent, which was the figure quoted. At this moment, with unemployment edging higher than that, the Australian people can be sure, and industry can be sure, that the implementation of recommendations in that area will be undertaken carefully and gradually and with regard to the conditions of the Crawford report. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the honourable member for Adelaide mentioned the references to the Commission on Budgetary Assistance to Industry, I also refer to them. The bounties which are the subject of this legislation before the House, are a part of that assistance. The main budgetary measures referred to include industrial research and development grants, the investment allowance and the separate reference to export incentives. I stress that there is no intention on the part of the Government to reduce the net cost of assistance to industry. Rather, the Government is seeking to make sure that the assistance that it provides is as effective as possible in meeting the needs of industry. One benefit of this reference will be that it will bring the important issue of better depreciation provisions, which I believe are of key importance in enhancing the competitiveness of Australian industry, under close scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back more specifically to the subject matter of these Bills-the bounties in respect of drilling bits and non-adjustable wrenches. I make the general point that within the context of our industry policy, which is to promote a more low cost, competitive, export oriented industry, bounties do play a significant role. They are an integral part of this policy. The Government is committed to the reasonable and adequate protection of industry but of course within the long term context of lowering the general level of protection. These Bills are important in that context. </PARA>
<PARA> It can always be said that for a number of reasons and in a number of situations the use of a bounty to assist Australian industry in its production and sales in competition with imports is to be preferred. One such case is where Australian production is a relatively small part of the total sales of a product within the country. If a tariff is imposed, then over the whole of sales the level of the price is raised, whereas if the Australian production forms only a small part of that total and if the Australian production is paid a subsidy, then the general level of price is not raised. That assists in other directions. It is particularly important where the product is an input to another manufacturing process-for instance, where a firm is producing yarn which is turned into fabric and subsequently into clothing. If the price of yarn can be kept down, the price of the fabric can be kept down and hence clothing will be cheaper. Yarn production is one area in which bounties are provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Another circumstance in which a bounty can be a preferred method of proceeding is where for a short period an industry with low cost potential-the sort of industry suitable to the Australian climate-needs assistance to enable it to break through, so to speak, in competition with imports, into larger scale production and thereafter operate as an efficient, low cost and hopefully exporting industry. A case of such assistance is the drilling bits bounty. The bounty was initiated towards the end of 1979 by an Act of this Parliament eventually passed in 1980. One noted at the time that this was an industry with good potential for development in Australia. It is a highly technological industry and one which could be expanded particularly in the area of drilling bits for exploration use. It needed initial assistance to compete with imports in order to get into larger scale production. That is what the bounty has achieved. It is now before us for renewal. With what has been achieved, it is possible to scale down the bounty to half the preceding rate. That is being done . The Industries Assistance Commission has found that the greater part of the local industry is, with moderate levels of assistance, relatively efficient and its further development is consistent with the objectives of our industry policy . Thus the Commission recommended the continuation of this assistance at half the current rate, the industry having become to a significant degree established , for a further period. After 31 December this year, normal forms of assistance will be given. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps a third area in which a bounty can be usefully applied is in the context of adjustment assistance. The one certain fact of the industrial scene is that there will be change and the constant need for industry to adjust to change. There is no avoiding it; it is going on all the time. The second industry involved in the measure before the House, non-adjustable wrenches, is such a case. The principal firm involved has undoubtedly improved its market performance since the bounty was originally instituted and is rationalising its operations to adjust to the changing market situations. During this process the payment of the bounty enables it to continue this activity and to establish itself strongly in the market. From 31 December there can be a reversion to normal forms of assistance. Therefore a bounty has been proposed in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that this bounty Bill is an integral part of the Government's industry policy to foster a more low cost, technologically based, export oriented manufacturing industry. I come back to the point I made at the beginning of my speech. The most important thing that can be done to foster Australian manufacturing industry is to achieve a low cost situation, to contain increases in costs and to establish international competitiveness. We can boost economic activity in manufacturing in Australia only if local producers can gain orders in competition with imports or if they can gain orders overseas for exports in competition with the local manufacturers there and of other countries. That is the most important consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) criticised what this Government has done in its overall economic policy to contain inflation and increasing costs. I repeat that he has not put up any feasible alternative. We heard that the Labor Party, should it ever achieve office, would spend up more in various ways-including so-called job creation schemes at a cost probably of the order of $1 billion per annum. The effect of this spending would be to stimulate inflation and increase costs and this would tend to render Australian manufacturing industry uncompetitive. We are told that Labor would counter this by a so-called incomes policy, an incomes policy no doubt based, as I have heard other honourable members from the other side of the House suggest, on the ' special relationship' which a future Labor government would have with the unions . I suggest that that is just not credible; it is just not believable. I would ask: What special relationship? We have not seen any evidence of it. I think the only special relationship that I am aware of is one under which the unions say: 'We pay the Labor Party money, therefore you will do as we say'. In point of fact there is no credible or believable special relationship. If the Opposition wants evidence of that I suggest it go back to the time when the Labor Party was last in office and when the present honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) was not only the President of the Labor Party but also the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. At that time we had the greatest upsurge in costs and the greatest level of industrial disputation in Australian history. There is no evidence whatsoever of a successful incomes policy based on a so- called special relationship with the unions. As we all know the situation at that time led to a massive undermining of Australian manufacturing industry. That is something which this Government has been obliged to rectify. I repeat that the most important thing to do is to ensure that costs are contained and that we achieve an appropriate degree of international competitiveness. That is the basic element of this Government's general economics policy, as of its industry policy, supplemented by other measures including the bounty Bill now before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst the Opposition does not oppose the Bounty Acts Amendment Bill 1982, nevertheless, it has certain reservations about the overall industrial policy of this Government. This Bill extends temporary bounty assistance to Australian manufacturers of cement carbide drilling bits and non- adjustable wrenches and in itself is unexceptional. However, the industrial context in which this bounty and many like it will apply deserves closer examination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current depressing economic climate with a record number since World War 2 out of work, clearly indicates that something is seriously wrong. The extraordinary number of business bankruptcies, which have gone up steadily for the last six years, to 2,530 in 1979-80, also provides additional evidence that the Government's policies are not working. What is needed is a soundly based industry and business policy which will stimulate balanced growth and enlarge employment opportunities, and which will provide Australia with a firm foundation for prosperous economic growth in decades ahead. Unfortunately, what we get from this Government is a fragmented industry policy which applies bounties, subsidies, tariffs, tax incentives and other financial inducements in an apparently random fashion to various sectional interests. The overall plan for Australia's industrial development has not been spelled out by the Government. Whilst the rationale for each particular form of financial incentive in each particular industry is usually fairly clear, as indeed it is in the case of the Bill before us today, the direction and purpose of the Goverment's industry policy, and its relationship to Australia's future needs, have not been made clear. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases the Government's industry assistance policy appears to have been motivated by electoral considerations and the result has been the channelling of enormous amounts of taxpayers' money into subsidies for inefficient industries. Taxpayers in Australia have been well aware of the extent to which they have been subsidising primary industry over the years but the level of subsidisation of secondary industry is not always fully appreciated. I want to take an example that emerges from a study of these particular bounties contained in the Industries Assistance Commission's report No. 271 on cutlery, industrial knives and hand tools. This report concerns Sidchrome, a division of Siddons Pty Ltd, the producer of over 90 per cent of all locally made non-adjustable wrenches. Sidchrome has been receiving short term assistance as a result of a temporary assistance report in August 1980 which gave a bounty of 11c to certain locally produced non-adjustable spanners for a 12-month period commencing 1 July 1980. This was extended to 31 December 1981. At the same time, Sidchrome received tariff assistance at a rate of 25 per cent for spanners and wrenches from all general rate sources and Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus Sidchrome, through the combination of the existing long term tariff and the short term bounty, has been provided with an equivalent tariff of about 50 per cent since 1 July 1980. Added to this assistance, Sidchrome was receiving by -law entry on the importation of blanks for spanners from the plant in Hong Kong to 1 July 1980. This had the effect of providing very high effective rates of assistance to certain of Sidchrome's locally produced products. In fact the 1979 IAC report on spanners and wrenches pointed out 'The effective rate of assistance available for the finishing processes on open end spanners exceeds 100 per cent'. </PARA>
<PARA> I take Sidchrome only as an example of the level of protection on certain of our manufacturing industries in Australia. For much of the time we are not aware of this high degree of protection for specific industries. What are the benefits to Australia from this massive financial support to Sidchrome? In employment terms the number employed in connection with non-adjustable spanners and wrenches has declined from 457 in June 1973 to 378 in June 1977 and to 279 in June 1980. In terms of Sidchrome's profitability and its production of non- adjustable spanners, measured as the ratio of operating profits to funds employed, it was higher in 1978-79 and 1979-80 than in 1977-78, but was still less than the average profitability of the manufacturing sector in the corresponding period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us establishes a firm timetable for the level of assistance to be given in the case of non-adjustable wrenches. The bounty mechanism also provides for an exact costing of the level of assistance given in the Budget. That is very worth while because at least we know what we are paying for that level of assistance. So in both those respects the Bill is to be commended for setting a firm limit to the amount of taxpayers' money which is being spent on the protection of this industry. However, the major difficulty associated with all forms of industry assistance is to establish the purpose, the duration and the level of assistance that can be justified in terms of Australia's future needs. It is sadly apparent that in the past assistance has been applied indiscriminately in this respect. Nobody would deny that the restructuring of the Australian manufacturing industry will be a difficult job. But it is about time that we stopped talking about how difficult it is and will be and got on with the job because in the meantime the taxpayers are paying for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I wish to respond briefly to the speakers who have taken part in this debate. When bounty and tariff Bills come before the House it is very difficult to anticipate the level of interest that they will generate. Today I wish to compliment the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) and the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) for their contributions and to refer briefly to what the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) had to say in relation to his new found socialist instinct. I always thought of him as a moderate in this field. Nevertheless these days there is a new stream of strong left wing socialism in the field. First of all we heard about the aspects of the motor plan, which I found quite interesting, and today we had an exposition on the planned economy in terms not only of a prices and incomes policy but also of a government planning office, a doubt about the level and involvement of foreign investment and a managed exchange rate. One certainly can assume that we have found a brand new addition to the socialist left.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is probably worth passing off the comparisons which the honourable member noted regarding 1974. He referred to the tariff changes that we have been effecting in the last few years as being 25 per cent across the board. He made reference to record interest rates. Interest rates were higher in 1974. Reference was made to business failures. Once again, the rate was higher in 1974 . It goes to show that the Opposition never learns from its mistakes. Bourbonism is as rife and rampant with members of the Opposition as it has ever been. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member mentioned the Canadian experience. It is worth while pressing on from that experience to say that since Canada has had a planning office all foreign investment has left. Consequently there has been a downturn in the Canadian economy of sizable proportions. For those who might not believe it, there is a sizable matter to add to that. In this regard, the honourable member referred to aspects of investment in Australia. The Utah company is one with which the socialists have great difficulty in coming to grips. It is worth recalling that when that company was offered in Australia-the leases had already been thrown in by an Australian prospector-there was a substantial shortfall. It was not until the company became profitable that it was then picketed for what it managed to produce. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I table the documents containing the terms of the agreement on Australia's participation in the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers. The agreement gives details of the overall size and shape of the Australian contingent and the terms on which it will participate in the peacekeeping force. The documents are in the form of two exchanges of letters constituting the agreement between the MFO Director-General and me, as Australian Foreign Minister. I also table the protocol signed by Egypt and Israel on 3 August 1981 which is the basis for the establishment of the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers and which is enclosed in the first letter from the Director-General. An aide memoire is also attached to the first letter from the Director-General. This document, which is not of treaty status, provides guidelines to governments preparing to assign troops for service with the MFO.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that Australia and New Zealand have been requested by the MFO to provide the helicopter element of the MFO aviation support group, and personnel for air traffic control and air field services. The agreement with the MFO states that Australia will provide 99 military personnel and eight Iroquois helicopters. The helicopters themselves will be drawn from No . 9 squadron based at Amberley. In addition Australia will provide 10 staff officers for the Force Commander's headquarters. I had earlier indicated that there was a possibility that Australia might be asked to provide personnel for the MFO military police investigation unit. There is however no longer a requirement for Australia to provide them. Accordingly the total number of Australian military personnel in the Sinai MFO will be 109. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of personnel required for the Australian contribution is less than was earlier considered likely. Following discussions with the MFO considerable manpower economies were found to be practical. An important consideration is the number of functions, including provision of fixed wing aircraft and support services, that will be performed by other countries. The Australian contribution to the Sinai MFO will be for two years but this period may be extended by agreement. This is consistent with what has been agreed by the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Netherlands and New Zealand. It will be for the Australian Government to determine whether to consent to a renewal of the commitment. The agreement, and related protocol, which are binding in international law on Egypt and Israel as well as the MFO, establish the basis for the Australian participation and protect the status of Australian personnel in the force. </PARA>
<PARA> In the negotiations with the MFO it was important to ensure that Australia's contribution be integrated carefully with the contributions of the other participating countries and for terms and conditions of operations to be broadly similar. The agreement we have negotiated with the MFO is, on key issues, in equivalent terms to those which the MFO has negotiated with European countries and New Zealand, and maintains Australian sovereignty over Australia's contribution. In addition, the directive issued by the Chief of Defence Force Staff to the Australian commander specifically requires him to consult with Australian authorities if he receives orders which he believes are contrary to, or go beyond, the agreed purposes of the force. I table the directive. There is provision in the agreement for the Australian contingent to withdraw after giving adequate prior notification. What Australia and other participating states would regard as adequate prior notification would depend on the circumstances prevailing at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> In his statement to Parliament on 22 October on Australian participation in the Sinai peacekeeping force, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stated our requirement that no part of the MFO, including the United States component, should have any association with a United States rapid deployment force. The Government has received firm assurances on this matter from the United States Government. Given the importance of this issue, the Government sought and has received written assurances from the United States Secretary of State, Mr Alexander Haig. I table the letter from Mr Haig. Legislation adopted by the United States Congress which sets out the conditions for United States participation states clearly that members of the United States contingent in the Sinai MFO can perform only those functions specified for a United Nations force and observers in the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, and in accordance with the protocol which established the Sinai MFO. I table the text of this legislation. I repeat, the agreement which was negotiated with the MFO maintains Australia's sovereign control over the Australian military personnel who will be serving in the Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that by contributing to the Sinai MFO Australia can play a small but nevertheless important role in maintaining the momentum of the Middle East peace process. Not only is the Middle East crucial to international peace; it is also a region where Australia has substantial and growing bilateral interests. The Government believes that it is important to support the principle of returning Arab land to Arab sovereignty. It is the Government's hope that, following the return of the final third of the Sinai, the efforts of all countries in the region will be directed towards the wider question of an Arab- Israeli settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to reiterate the importance the Government attaches to resolving the Palestinian question. As the Prime Minister made clear in his statement of 22 October, a resolution of this issue is the key to peace and stability in the region. Failure to make progress provides opportunities for the Soviet Union and its allies to further their influence in the Middle East. The Government will be doing what it can to support the efforts of countries of the region and others such as the United States to establish a lasting and just peace in the Middle East. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) has made a statement on Australia's participation in the Sinai peacekeeping force and he has tabled some relevant correspondence and documents, but it is worthy of note that the advance party of the Australian contingent has already left Australia. At the initial stage, I should like to talk about the legal situation, which is worthy of comment. In May of last year, the Minister stated that the mandate for the force would be Article VI of Annexe 1 of the Egypt-Israel peace treaty of 1979. That is absolutely incorrect now. Article VI of Annexe 1 prohibits the United States from being a member of any force. There are nine paragraphs in Article VI. In each of those nine paragraphs there are nine references to a United Nations force. The peace treaty is based on United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Resolution 242 emphasises that the acquisition of territory is inadmissible and affirms the guarantees that territory is inviolable and that every state in the area will have political independence. Resolution 338 calls upon the parties to implement Resolution 242 in all respects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The framework for peace emphasises security being enhanced in the spirit of the United Nations charter and the presence of international forces. It provides for Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the representatives of the Palestinian people to participate in negotiations on the resolution of the Palestinian problem and that negotiations relating to the West Bank and Gaza should proceed in a certain way. It was further agreed that principles and provisions should apply to peace treaties between Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and that those treaties should be underwritten by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The remarks of the participants, made in September 1978 in the presence of each other, surely can be relied upon even now. The framework provides specific points which will govern a comprehensive peace settlement, with the future of the West Bank and Gaza and the resolution of the Palestinian problems in all its aspects. At that time, President Carter emphasised that the Palestinians would have the right to participate in the determination of their own future and in negotiations which will produce the final states of the West Bank and Gaza. These agreements provide the basis, he said, for progress and peace. The next day, President Carter explained that the documents would be signed by President Sadat and Mr Begin and witnessed by him. He further stated that the documents provided a comprehensive framework by which peace treaties could be negotiated with Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. He then said that the Camp David agreement defined relationships for Israel and her neighbours and the realisation of recognised boundaries, the granting of self-government and the guarantee that the Palestinian people may participate in the resolution of the problem, with these words in quotation marks:</PARA>
<PARA> After the signing of this agreement, no new Israeli settlements will be established in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>I should like also to refer to the letter written by former President Carter to the late President Sadat and to Prime Minister Begin on 26 March 1979. It has been claimed that this letter is a separate peace treaty. It is an international proposition, apparently, that one can have a peace treaty, as we call the Camp David agreement, but one can apparently ignore it by writing a letter on the same day. I think that it is incredible to have that sort of reliance because, whilst it was written on the same day as the treaty, it in no way forms part of the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, and perhaps more importantly in terms of international law, one cannot have an ancillary document to an international treaty which contradicts the basis of the treaty and then claims to be part of the treaty. The treaty provides for the peacekeeping force to be drawn from countries other than the super-powers. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The parties have agreed that if no agreement is reached between the parties, they will accept or support a United States proposal concerning the composition of the United Nations force and observers. </PARA>
<PARA>So the treaty is contradicted by that letter on two points. The letter envisages not only a non-United Nations force but also, in fact, a force led by one of the super powers. Everywhere else-that is, in the 1978 Camp David Accords, in the 1979 peace treaty and in the key Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which are the most authoritative United Nations pronouncement concerning peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict-the reference is to a United Nations force. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, and contrary to claims made by the Minister in the past, President Carter's letter is not an essential document which can be seen in conjunction with the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty. There is no evidence to the contrary, as the treaty refers to papers attached to it as 'annexes', 'protocols' and ' maps', and nowhere does it mention the letter sent by Carter to Sadat and Begin. Therefore, there is no legal basis for the Australian Government supporting a non-United Nations force in the Sinai. It makes a mockery of our sovereignty and supposed serious respect for international law when we use a letter written by the former President to the two principal protagonists in a war as the basis for commiting our troops in an area of conflict. How can it possibly be argued that a letter written by one to the other can involve the obligations of a third party? It surely cannot be argued. How can the Minister refer to the treaty, as he did earlier, as providing a mandate for the multinational force when in the nine paragraphs of Article VI there are nine references to a United Nations force and not a single mention of a multinational force? The Minister now tells us that the documents relevant to the multinational force are two exchanges of letters between the multinational force director-general and himself, as Foreign Minister, and that the basis for the establishment of the Sinai multinational force is the protocol signed by Egypt and Israel on 3 August. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the Minister makes up his mind. Looking at the protocol, one sees that it certainly does not refer to the letter by Carter to Sadat. The protocol refers to the fact that a letter was written-in May 1981, I might add, which was some time after the Camp David Accords-to the President of the Security Council, and, of course, there was an indication that they were unable to reach the necessary agreement, and it then goes on to talk about the various articles of the peace treaty, Articles 4 and 6. So the protocol itself is back to the Camp David Accords. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no mandate in our view. Australian forces have been sent to the Middle East because the Americans have asked that we send them. What could the Americans care about the Middle East if it were not for the oil? And what would we care about the Middle East were it not for the Americans? If we cared about the problems of refugees, about repressive government and about peacekeeping initiatives, we would first look closer to home. What about Kampuchea and Pol Pot and the problems particularly immediately to our north between Vietnam and China? Let us look at the chances we might have to take some initiatives in that area and to defuse the tension which certainly exists between Thailand, China, Vietnam and Kampuchea, which have millions of refugees who are likely to come to Australia. In the same process, if we want to talk about the world and how we should solve its problems, let us talk about the refugees, including the three and a half million coming from Afghanistan. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also make it very clear that there is an inalienable right for Israel to exist. It is the only democracy in the sea of Arab theocracies or worse. It has done much to make a fertile area out of a harsh environment. It deserves and is entitled to live in peace. However, the Palestinian question must be settled if there is to be any lasting peace. It is just not enough to say that a Palestinian state already exists and that it is called Jordan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) told Australians that our troops would participate if the Canadians and the British took part. Canada is not having a bar of the peacekeeping force and Britain is sending a platoon to help with administration. A Labor government would foster much closer relationships between Australia and Canada because it appears that we have much to learn from Canada, especially in dealing with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what Australian public opinion is. The Canberra Times said that there was no good reason why Australian forces should go all the way to the Middle East just to prove that we are an ally of the United States. The Sydney Morning Herald stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We shouldn't touch the Sinai Force with a forty foot pole. It is simply too much of a risk. </PARA>
<PARA>The legal aspects of the force have not bothered the Government. It was not until someone pointed out to the Government that since the Australian soldiers would not form part of a United Nations force they could not be covered by the provisions of the Repatriation Act, that action was taken. So the Act was speedily amended in March to ensure that all Australians serving with any peacekeeping force will be eligible to receive repatriation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Our force is in jeopardy, and not merely in providing logistic support to a group whose role is to man checkpoints, undertake reconnaissance patrols and set up observation posts. I quote from the United States Senate Joint Resolution of December 1981, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . only those functions or responsibilities which are specified for United Nations Forces and observers in the Israeli-Egypt Treaty of Peace. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is so and if that is the force's sole task, we must wonder why 600 men of the crack 82nd Airborne Division are to be the United States contribution to the Sinai force, to play the role of policemen. It is a role that could be played by somebody eligible for Dad's Army, but certainly not by the 600 crack troops of the 82nd Airborne Division. The fact that the men of that Division are an integral part of the United States Rapid Deployment Force has been overlooked by the Government. The Minister claimed that assurances had been given by the United States that no part of the proposed Sinai peacekeeping force, including the United States component, would have any association with the Rapid Deployment Force. It cannot be said that a soldier is in the Rapid Deployment Force in one minute and then back in the Sinai peacekeeping force in another, and not say that he is really part of the Rapid Deployment Force because he is trained to the limit to do that job. </PARA>
<PARA> In General Haig's letter to the Minister, we were given the assurance that no part of the proposed Sinai peacekeeping force, including the United States component, would have any association with the Rapid Deployment Force. But I make the point that it is part of it-virtually on leave, if one likes to have it that way, but going back into the Force. Our troops, irrespective of whatever legal safeguards the force may have in the imagination of the Americans, will be in a zone where there has been fighting for as long as anyone can remember. There has been continual war in the Middle East. There is no peace there. One- third of all weapons sold in the world last year ended up in the Middle East. Last year alone, the Palestine Liberation Organisation received an estimated $ 100m in arms. There are indications that Lebanon will become the battleground for a fight for the extermination of the PLO and for the destruction of the Syrian forces. The problems between Christians and Muslims in Lebanon have been exacerbated by the Syrians and the PLO. To this explosive mix, the Israelis could well be added because it seems that certain para-military groups want Israel to destroy the Syrians and the PLO. </PARA>
<PARA> One hundred and nine Australians will go to the Sinai. We wish them well and a speedy return. When Labor forms the next government, we will immediately review the role of the Australian contingent and exercise the option in the agreement- that is the two exchanges of letters between the Minister and the Director- General-which allows for withdrawal of the contingent after giving adequate prior notification. I hope that when we come to office the situation in the Sinai will be stable enough for us to withdraw the contingent, but we will judge the situation when we come to it. We would seriously consider whether the withdrawal of the contingent would jeopardise the safety of the rest of the Sinai force and, with this in mind, we would act responsibly. Finally, what will it cost, because we have had no estimates from the Minister?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I give my support to the Sinai peacekeeping force and to this statement, fully aware of the complexities and difficulties of the broader Arab-Israeli problem and recognising that any decision to send Australian troops overseas involves agonising and difficult decision-making. It has been a difficult question for the government but it does not seem to have been a difficult question for the Opposition. The Opposition has seen this as a United States force, which it is not, and it is therefore, by definition, simply wrong. For the Australian Labor Party, that is the beginning and the end of the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the irony of the Opposition's position is that it originally embraced the Camp David Accords and therefore was not opposed to the concept of a peacekeeping force as such. It would have supported an Australian commitment if the force was under United Nations sponsorship. But the Soviet Union said that the United Nations could not do this, and that was good enough for the ALP, no matter what the peacemakers themselves wanted. The Opposition regards this question of sponsorship as the crucial determinant as to whether we should participate in the force. But this is not an exercise in moot law. It is not an academic courtroom debate. It is about an important pragmatic temporary issue of great international and strategic importance to Australia and the world. It is part of an initiative for peace. certainly the original agreement, which this Parliament supported, referred to a United Nations force. This has changed only because the Soviet Union refused United Nations sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has not changed. The basic functions of the force, as outlined originally in the protocol of Annex 1, Article VI of the Egypt-Israel peace treaty, have not changed. The basic provisions and implications of the treaty have not changed. The nature of it and its basic thrust have not changed. The attitudes of the signatories to the treaty have not changed. The wider Arab world response to it has not changed. The original signatories, with the same honourable intentions, agreed to the change in the force sponsorship, but without altering in any way the fundamental nature of their quest for peace. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly all signatories to the Treaty would have preferred United Nations sponsorship, and that goes for the Australian Government as well. But we should not forget that each party has agreed to replace a non-United Nations force with a United Nations force should the United Nations change its position on this issue. We should remember anyway that United Nations forces are merely volunteered contributions by states, acting with the consent of the states on whose territory the force operates. That is what is happening with this force. Is not the co-operation of individual states in peacekeeping permitted under the Charter of the United Nations? The fact remains that limited force zones, as a major security aspect of the Sinai withdrawal, do require monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA> The status of this force, in relation to the peace treaty of march 1979, is misunderstood. The Carter letter of 26 March 1979 to establish a non-United Nations force was written in the context of the conclusions of the peace treaty and was also registered by Israel at the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with article 102 of the United Nations Charter as a document related to the treaty of peace. Moreover, the content of the letter was re-affirmed in 1981 by the parties in an exchange of letters between Egypt, Israel and the United States, which constituted an international agreement. It has been stated that, according to Article VI, paragraph 8 of the Annex to the peace treaty, the United Nations force was not supposed to include contingents from nations which are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. However, the 1981 Protocol tabled today provides in the second paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Treaty which relate to the establishment and functions and responsibilities of the United Nations forces and observers shall apply mutatis mutandis to the establishment and functions and responsibilities of the MFO or as provided in this protocol. </PARA>
<PARA>The Carter letter does not contradict basic provisions of the peace treaty. It supplements it by trying to solve a problem which could arise if some of the provisions of the peace treaty were not implemented due to the attitude of the Security Council. Given all this, surely we can recognise that, although this force and its sponsorship is important, we should not forget that it is only an implementing part of the major objective of the Treaty. It is an objective of peace for which the peacemakers should be applauded and assisted by nations such as Australia. Will peace ever be achieved if nations so desirous of peace always leave peace obligations and initiatives to others?</PARA>
<PARA> During the many months of debate on this issue the Opposition has raised a number of alarmist and misleading side issues. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has expressed concern that the Rapid Deployment Force of the United States of America would in some way affect the role of the United States component of this force. In fact a joint resolution of the United States Senate and House of Representatives has specified quite clearly that this will not be the case, as does the letter from the United States Secretary of State, tabled today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), which clearly states that there will be no connection and no overlap of responsibilities whatsoever between the Multinational Force and Observers and the RDF. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and others have also tried to establish that by our participation we are in fact playing an active role in the promotion of war. What a ludicrous proposition. We are contributing a small number of men, 109, to a peacekeeping force to monitor a peace treaty on peaceful territory at the request of two countries at peace. To ask why a force is necessary in those circumstances, as many have done, is to fall for the trap of using our perceptions and values to solve someone else's problems. It ignores the fact that the Sinai is an area of great strategic importance to both Egypt and Israel and has long been a battle ground for conflicts between them. </PARA>
<PARA> Israel is a small, insecure nation, surrounded by nations committed to its destruction and for which the sacrifice of captured territory is therefore a very traumatic experience. Given this history, both parties to the Treaty, particularly Israel, require the confidence and credibility of an international monitoring body. Both parties to the Treaty wanted this force. It is a function of peace, not war, that this force is required to perform. It can only perform those functions or responsibilities which are specified for the United Nations Forces and Observers in the Treaty of Peace and in accordance with the Protocol which established the MFO. Any examination of Article VI of Annex 1 of the Treaty should allay any doubts as to this peacekeeping function of the force. Surely the safeguards outlined in the Minister's statement can be accepted by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition leaders have been quick to join in the Western international chorus of condemnation of Israel, particularly her attitude to the autonomy talks, and have used this to question our participation in any peacekeeping force, as if Begin and Israel constitute a major barrier to peace and an incitement to war in the Middle East. It is Israel which has constantly sought peace in this region. It is the PLO, Iraq, Syria, Libya and other nations in the region which have prevented peace. It is they who have not recognised Israel's right to exist. It is they who must now make initiatives for peace. The Minister said as much in the second last paragraph of his statement. Those who say we should not support Israel in this peacekeeping force because Begin is obstinate regarding the autonomy process required by Camp David should remember that it was Begin who said he would not give up any of the Sinai. But what did he do when an Arab nation was prepared to talk peace with Israel? Israel returned all occupied Egyptian land, including Sharm-el-Sheikh and its naval base, the three strategically important airfields in eastern Sinai and the oilfields developed by Israel, all in return for what-for a piece of paper, for the acceptance through normal diplomatic channels of Israel's right to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the lesson there is that other Arab nations should make peace initiatives, even if only recognising Israel's right to exist. The West and the Opposition would do well to emphasise this rather than constantly seeking to isolate and condemn Israel. But in the absence of even this minor concession, is it reasonable for Israel to sacrifice her security further? I think not. After all, no Arab nation has ever sacrificed territory in seeking peace. No Arab nation has come forward saying that it will have the Palestinians; no Arab nation agreed to support an independent Palestinian state when it had the opportunity to do so between 1948 and 1967. Certainly the matter has to be resolved, as the Minister said in his statement. But before criticising Israel regarding the West Bank, Gaza, and Golan Heights, the Iraqi nuclear reactor, should we not expect a more conciliatory Arab attitude towards Israel. I say this simply to indicate that we should support the present peace Treaty but not expect all future peace initiatives to involve concessions only from Israel. It is not correct to assume that the peacekeeping force will incur the wrath of the wider Arab world as a result of the autonomy issue. Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other moderate Arab states have consistently taken the position that Egypt has the right to negotiate for the return of its sovereign territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not saying that no risks are involved for this force. Of course there is some risk, given the turbulent nature of this region and the presence of terrorists. But it is a risk which should be kept in perspective and not exaggerated and accorded the status of another Vietnam, as some members of the Opposition have falsely done. It is a risk which should also be weighed against the gain; that is, peace between two countries which have spent much of their recent histories fighting each other in an area of the world which is vital to the West, including Australia. Also, when assessing the risks of Australia's involvement in this force, when expressing concern regarding a wider Arab response, it is dangerous to overstate the concept of Arab unity and togetherness, which is often done. This is a myth which has been perpetrated to maintain a rallying point for domestic, unstable Arab regimes; it is a myth that it is only the existence of Israel which prevents the solution of the Palestinian problem and therefore the achievement of Arab unity and integration, and peace and stability in the Middle East. Anyone who knows anything about the complexities of inter-Arab state politics recognises this as a myth. Peace will come only slowly and perhaps only on a bilateral step by step basis, as recognised by Camp David. But to see this force as a stumbling block to future peace in the region ignores the realities of the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> My other concern in supporting this force centres around the fact that any reading of the Camp David Agreements and any study of the relationships which existed between Carter, Begin and Sadat, makes it quite clear that this is a treaty between three leaders who, with good will and understanding, achieved a peace that they genuinely desired. Those desires may still be present, but the three men are not. This was the kind of relationship which history does not often deliver to us: enemies who became friends through acts of statesmanship in the face of enormous personal and domestic political dangers. My initial support for this force was to ensure that Australia would help this historic, bilateral quest for peace in an area of the world in which disputes had in the past been settled by war and in which in the future, from this example, they may be settled by peace initiatives, even if only gradually and on a one to one basis. My concern now is that the three signatories to that Treaty are no longer on the scene. It is to Mubarak's credit that he has maintained Sadat's position regarding the Treaty. But I am concerned that domestic and regional pressures may crowd him, once the Sinai has gone from Israel. It is essential, therefore, that a credible force be in place to ensure that the provisions of the Treaty are respected and to give both Begin and Mubarak the confidence and respect in the Treaty which others in the region may try to dissipate. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, one should consider what would happen if the West did not support this force and this Treaty. We would simply be pandering to the rejectionist states such as Iraq, Syria and Libya and to organisations such as the PLO and others who are committed to Israel's destruction and a revival of continuous tension and war in a region where two major allies of the West are setting an example of peace through negotiations based on good will, understanding and a recognition of the other party's rights. I am very pleased to be able to support the statement by the Minister. As is the case with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the men comprising this force go to the Sinai with my best wishes. I certainly hope that our contribution will play a small part in ensuring the success of this very historic peace treaty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I point out that the Opposition is concerned about the safety of the force which has been sent to the Sinai, and the fact that that safety is largely dependent not on the Australian force but on other elements of the force which will be established in the Sinai. It has been said in this House in past debates that it is not an area in which conflict is likely to or can take place. I would like to believe that, but I do not. The deficiencies in the Australian law which affords protection to members of this force are being corrected by legislation at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those things aside, there are elements reflecting on current and future defence policy relating to the commitments of peacekeeping forces. There is an historic element about the commitment of forces on the basis on which this force is being committed which must leave members of this Parliament unsure and concerned about the long term implications. The initial commitment is for two years with an option of renewal. The parallel which was drawn some considerable time ago by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) to events in Vietnam was a parallel of the nature and the commencement of the commitment and did not in any way relate to political stability in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said in this debate that the Australian force has adequate protection and that we have assurances from our allies that this force will not be subject to involvement in activities which are outside the narrow confines of its area of commitment. I would point out to the House that the excuse for the escalation of the war in Vietnam was a totally trumped up proposition of a military activity which was subsequently admitted, after half a million lives were lost, to have been completely fallacious. The Middle East is the cauldron of conflict in the world at the moment. It is the area where the greatest dangers exist and where mistakes in foreign policy could cost the world the most . It is no nearer a real solution now than it was a year ago or 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some rapprochement between Egypt and Israel. The Camp David Accords were probably an achievement in themselves and an achievement for the Carter Administration. They are not necessarily accepted by the Reagan Administration and there is evidence at least to suggest that the Reagan Administration does not intend to seek from Israel compliance with those Accords . Certainly whilst at one end it is arguable that the Camp David Accords are being complied with, that is not arguable on the basis of the total provisions in the Accords. If someone enters into an agreement whereby he is prepared to accept that a small portion of that agreement is honoured and the remainder of the agreement is cast aside and he takes no action, and apparently has no intention of taking action, which would bring about the whole of that agreement being complied with, then he will not have gone anyway at all towards a resolution of the problem. It is likely that there will be changes in the attitudes of the Egyptian Government as a result of the change of presidency and the change of administration. It is likely that such changes will not show themselves quickly because it is not the nature of things that quick changes take place on policy matters and certainly it would not be the nature of events in the Middle East for Egypt to change its policy at a time when it has certain advantages by maintaining its present position at least until the position in the Sinai is clear. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the situation of the Australian peace keeping force, it is evident that the structure of the force has been designed to minimise Australian involvement and to maximise protection of that force so that it is highly unlikely that it will be in a vulnerable situation. The realities are that we already have outstanding commitments which have not at this stage been called up in relation to Namibia to provide a force if it ever should come to pass that the South African Government agrees to democratic elections in that country or that the world bodies through international pressure should bring about a situation in which that area is given what is its entitlement, that is, the right to choose and to determine what form of government and by whom it will be governed. In the event that such a situation arises, given that a substantial Australian force has already been offered and committed to that area, it is doubtful under the existing defence arrangements whether a significant force could have been provided to the Sinai while the obligation to the commitment to Namibia existed and Australia remained prepared to meet that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a serious matter of policy which the Government has not confronted and which apparently it does not intend to confront in respect of the defence forces. Limited funds are available for the development of the Australian defence forces. One would imagine that the prime responsibility of the defence forces should be the defence of Australia and the development of defence forces for that purpose. It is an obligation under which the Opposition, and I would hope the Government, acknowledges that there are occasions when Australia's defence forces should be committed to activities which are not defence oriented in nature but which are in fact an extension of obligations under Australia's foreign policy and Australia's role as a member of an international community. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem that I see with the current policy on our Defence Force developments is that it is likely, especially if this type of commitment is to be entered into and the commitments to Namibia and to others are to be entered into and maintained, that a greater immediate requirement of the Australian defence forces will be for the provision of forces for this type of purpose. There is no equipment program and there are no training programs. As I understand it, a reduction in the Government's commitment to the Australian Army is currently taking place. The result is that the section of the defence forces which is most likely to be called upon in the immediate future to undertake a role in which some active military participation could take place is the one that is being most neglected and most seriously eroded in its capabilities by the non-provision of essential equipment and the current reductions in training programs. </PARA>

I think the members of the Army are conscientious members of the Australian defence forces and that they are serving in circumstances which are unsatisfactory and which the Government should do something about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the current cost cutting exercise it is the Army which bears the brunt. If one looks at the Government's announced program in 1976 one will find that such equipment as surface to air missiles, anti-tank weapons and a variety of other light to medium weapons were urgent requirements of the Australian Army. If one examines the answers to questions which have been placed on notice over a period by my colleagues and I one will find that the Army has not received that equipment and also that in many cases that equipment has been dropped from the Government program. If honourable members care to check with their local Citizen Military Forces unit-the Army Reserve unit-they will find that in the last fortnight members of the Reserve have been required to sign vouchers which remove from the Department of Defence the obligation to pay attendance money for the next 10 weeks. They are being told that if they do not sign these documents they will not be entitled to attend parades. I ask the Government: Having spent several million dollars on advertising to get people into the Army Reserve last year, is it serious in its proposition now that these people have to renounce their rights to attendance money?</PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying is that the big Budget items, the glamour items which look good on paper, have first priority in our defence forces. But our defence forces have requirements and commitments which are to do with foreign policy and are directly derived from foreign policy. It is normal, in fact it is usual, that the Army carries out these obligations. Yet we are committing a limited force-we could not have committed a major ground force-to an area where the highest levels of arms technology in the world exists, where the risks are significant, despite efforts to play down those risks, and where the likelihood of an armed conflict between the international force, as it is called, and some of the elements in the area is highly probable. We are committing that force with clapped out equipment which will be of a lower standard than any other armed force in the world would provide. The Government has no intention at this stage of providing the basis of our defence forces with modern equipment in areas in which we would expect them to be competent and in which they would be required for their personal defence. Australian armed forces, with obsolete equipment are going into an area and the Government will ask others to provide the equipment and the security which is necessary for our defence forces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affiars (Mr Street) this afternoon on the details of the Australian contribution to the Multinational Force and Observers, the 109 men-99 helicopter military personnel with 8 helicopters and 10 staff officers-in a commitment for two years to be withdrawn or renewed as we see fit. I think the outstanding aspect, or quality, of this debate so far is the way in which the Australian Labor Party, the Opposition, has in effect admitted the feebleness of the arguments that it put up last year or during the months of this debate. Honourable members have significantly moderated those arguments that they still retain and they do not seem really to believe them. Where now do we hear the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) saying that there are not enough men in our armed Services to join in the MFO? Where do we hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) still saying that we should not deal with the Government of Israel, that it is the greatest danger to peace in the world today? Where do we hear the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) saying that the whole thing is unnecessary? Where do we hear the arguments that it is an open ended commitment or that it will damage our trade relations with the Arab states?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do hear some of the old arguments again but, as I said, in a much more moderate form and it is pretty clear that they do not really believe them. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) referred rather feebly to public opinion polls but was unable to quote any, other than an editorial or so of many months ago. He also referred, as did the honourable member for Corio, to the old Vietnam analogy which his own Party does not and cannot take seriously. This is not a participation in a war; it is a participation in a peace. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also used the argument that his Leader used last year, that this is all a long way from home, ignoring the strategic importance of the Middle East to the whole free world-but even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not seem to believe it. He attached a bit more importance, it must be said, to his distinctive argument-I have to say distinctive because no one else in the wide world understands it or accepts it-that there is something illegal about the whole thing, the whole commitment, that President Carter's letter is not in conformity with the treaty and that the conveyance as it were- he speaks like a solicitor when he is talking on these matters-is ultra vires in some way. Although we do have a protocol which incorporates the treaty, we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's legal point which, it must be said, the Government of socialist France does not accept or even see, nor does the Government of Italy and they are both participating in this MFO. The Government of the United Kingdom, the Government of the Netherlands, the Government of Norway, the Government of New Zealand, the Government of Columbia and the Government of Fiji are all unable to see the fine legalistic point that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about countries that are participating. All of those countries are participating but are unable to see the beauty of his fine legalistic point. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did revive his old rapid deployment force argument although, of course, no one takes that seriously. I think that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, from the way he spoke, does not take it seriously. We have several reasons for not doing so. We have statements by everybody involved that they are not involved in a rapid deployment force, which is many years off and in any case is of a completely different character. We have the letter from the Secretary of State of the United States of America stating that there will be no connection and no overlap of responsibilities whatsoever between the MFO and the RDF. He expands that point in some detail in his letter of 19 February 1982. We have the directive from the Chief of Defence Force Staff to the Commander of the Australian contingent which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If you receive orders which you believe are contrary to, or go beyond, the agreed function, mission and tasks of the ACMFO . . . you should inform the COMDMFO-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Commander of the MFO-</PARA>
<PARA>That you cannot comply with the orders and indicate the reason. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the event of . . . a serious rift in relationship between the parties to the Camp David Treaty . . . you are to seek my instructions as to whether some or all ACMFO personnel should be temporarily withdrawn . . .</PARA>
<PARA> In an emergency in which reference back to me is not practicable, you may, consulting with the COMDMFO and the Australian Ambassador at Cairo, order such withdrawals of ACMFO personnel as you see fit. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no basis whatsoever in the idea that there is some connection between the MFO and the rapid deployment force not yet in existence. Nevertheless, the Opposition still trots it out, I have to say again as I said in the beginning, with very little conviction. It is clear that the basic motivation for the Labor Party's opposition-allowing obviously as one must for a certain honest concern that everyone experiences and feels when Australian troops go overseas, and it would be ridiculous not to allow for that-to this contribution to the peace of the world is the influence in its ranks of the socialist left, the influence of its association with the Palestine Liberation Organisation and, the influence of its hostility to the American alliance or, indeed, to any alliance except perhaps those involved with countries of a radical or revolutionary disposition. It is of a piece with its opposition to the North West Cape base, its opposition to the acquisition of HMS Invincible-because that represents participation in an alliance-and, of course, most currently its opposition to the Sinai commitment. Most worrying of all is the Labor Party's association with the Palestine Liberation Organisation and its terrorists, an association which remains as strong today as it was in the past. Indeed, Senator Georges of the Labor Party was in Beirut the other day celebrating the seventeenth anniversary of the PLO. His trip, according to the Australian-Israel Review of February of this year, was paid for by the United Palestinian Workers, an Australian affiliate of the PLO. But I suppose that the most interesting current example is the tour of Australia by Vanessa Redgrave. While at first sight it may seem to be passing from the sublime to the ridiculous, or from the solemn to the absurd, I am afraid that to understand Labor's opposition one must go into these apparently, at first sight, absurd details. Vanessa Redgrave, an extremely talented actress, was making a tour of Australia to promote her film Occupied Palestine. She is a lady who believes that zionism is identical with fascism; that Israel is a fascist state and must be destroyed. She is a supporter of the PLO and is now working on a new film financed by some Arab states to show that zionism and fascism are identical and that zionists worked with the nazis to destroy jews in the concentration camps of World War II. That shows what a peculiar lady she is. She belongs to an English trotskyist sect which has affiliations here and toured Australia. She was welcomed by certain members of the Opposition in cities as far apart as Newcastle and Perth. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris ) attended a civic reception for her in Newcastle and was reported in the Press as saying how much he admired her courage in working for the Palestinian revolution. Senator Coleman expressed similar sentiments at meetings in Perth. </PARA>

If the Leader of the Opposition gives half an hour or so to any artist of note who visits Canberra or Australia he will be doing nothing else, because they are pretty thick on the ground. The only reason this artist attracted the interest of the Leader of the Opposition was her association with the PLO.

I do not think that even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would believe that the Leader of the Opposition was interested in the lady because of her artistry. He was interested in her because of her politics, her association with the PLO, and the kind of views she holds, which I have outlined. It seems to me extraordinary that the so-called alternative Prime Minister should be prepared to associate himself with a lady who has such infamous views, but that sort of thing explains Labor's completely unconvincing attitude on the matter. It can only be explained if looked at in terms of Labor's association with the PLO and hostility to the American, on indeed any other, alliance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to his statement to the next step of the peace process in the Middle East. It is certainly the next step as far as Israel, Egypt and the MFO generally are concerned. That is the movement towards autonomy for the Palestinians. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and every other member on this side of the House has said, we regard that as an essential part of the whole package; it was part of the basic Camp David agreement. We are now entering stage 1 of the process. The Opposition has said that it is very enthusiastic about stage 2 but is quite unwilling to first go through the necessary stage 1, which is what the MFO is about. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, there will be a good deal of discussion before this whole matter is completed but I take some satisfaction from and certainly a great deal of interest in the autonomy proposals which currently form Jerusalem's basis for negotiations under the Camp David Accords. I have the agreement of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to incorporating these proposals, as published in the Australia-Israel Review of March 1982, in Hansard. I seek leave for that incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ISRAEL'S AUTONOMY PROPOSALS</PARA>
<PARA> The following are the Israel Government's proposals for Palestinian autonomy which currently form Jerusalem's basis for negotiations under the Camp David Accords. The text was released by the Israel Foreign Ministry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Camp David Agreement signed on 17 September 1978 between Egypt and Israel, with the United States signing as a witness, agreement was reached on a plan for the solution of the problem of the Palestinian Arabs that includes a proposal for full autonomy for the Palestinian Arabs living in Judea, Samaria and Gaza. The manner of establishing this autonomy, as well as its powers, were to be determined in negotiations between the signatories (Jordan was invited to participate, but did not respond). It was Israel that first raised the idea of autonomy that was later to serve as the basis of the Camp David agreement. For the first time in the history of the Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Judea- Sumaria and the Gaza district, they were offered an opportunity of this kind to conduct their own affairs by themselves. Since 1979, talks have been held for the implementation of this agreement; there were intermissions in the negotiations, but talks were resumed intensively in the summer of 1981, leading to a thorough-going clarification of the positions of the parties. At these talks Israel put forward its proposals with regard to the self-governing authority (administrative council), its powers, responsibilities and structure as well as other related issues. The main points of Israel's proposals, as submitted in the course of the negotiations were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Scope, jurisdiction and structure of the self-governing authority ( administrative council):</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Camp David Accords set forth the establishment of a self-governing authority (administrative council) that will comprise one body representing the Arab inhabitants of Judea, Samaria and the Gaza district, who will choose this body in free elections, and it will assume those functional powers that will be transferred to it. Thus the Palestinian Arabs will for the first time have an elected and representative body, in accordance with their own wishes and free choice, that will be able to carry out the functions assigned to it as an administrative council. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The members of the administrative council will be able, as a group, to discuss all subjects within the council's competence, apportioning among themselves the spheres of responsibility for the various functions. Within the domain of its assigned powers and responsibilities, the council will be responsible for planning and carrying out its activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Powers of the self-governing authority (administrative council):</PARA>
<PARA> 1. a. Under the terms of the Camp David agreement, the parties have to reach an agreement on the powers and responsibilities of the authority. Israel's detailed proposals include a list of powers that will be given to the authority and that, by any reasonable and objective criterion, represent a wide and comprehensive range of fields of operation. Without any doubt, the transferring of these powers constitutes the bestowal of full autonomy-in the full meaning of that term. </PARA>
<PARA> b. The powers to be granted the authority, under these proposals, are in the following domains:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Administration of Justice: Supervision of the administrative system of the courts in the areas; dealing with matters connected with the prosecution system and with the registration of companies, partnerships, patents, trademarks, etc. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Agriculture: All branches of agriculture and fisheries, nature reserves and parks. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Finance: Budget of the adminstrative council and allocations among its various divisions; taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Civil Service: Appointment and working conditions of the Council's employees . (Today, the civil service of the inhabitants of Judea-Samaria and Gaza, within the framework of the Military Government's Civilian Administration, numbers about 12,000 persons). </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Education and Culture: Operation of the network of schools in the areas, from kindergarten to higher education; supervision of cultural artistic and sporting activities. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Health: Supervision of hospitals and clinics; operation of sanitary and other services related to public health. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Housing and Public Works: Construction, housing for the inhabitants and public works projects. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Transportation and Communication: Maintenance and co-ordination of transport , road traffic, meteorology; local postal and communications services. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Labour and Social Welfare: Welfare, labour and employment services, including the operation of labour exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Municipal Affairs: Matters concerning municipalities and their effective operation. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. Local Police: Operation of a strong local police force, as provided for in the Camp David agreement, and maintenance of prisons for criminal offenders sentenced by the courts in the areas. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Religious Affairs: Provision and maintenance of religious facilities for all religious communities among the Arab inhabitants of Judea-Samaria and the Gaza district. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. Industry, Commerce and Tourism: Development of industry, commerce, workshops and tourist services. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The council will have full powers in its spheres of competence to determine its budget, to enter into contractual obligations, to sue and be sued and to engage manpower. It will, moreover, have wide powers to promulgate regulations, as required by a body of this kind. In the nature of things, in view of the free movement that will prevail between Judea-Samaria and the Gaza district and Israel and for the general welfare of the inhabitants, arrangements will be agreed upon in the negotiations, in a number of domains, for co-operation and co -ordination with Israel. The administrative council will, hence, have full scope to exercise its wide-ranging powers under the terms of the autonomy agreement. These powers embrace all walks of life, and will enable the inhabitants in the areas concerned to enjoy full autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Size: The size of the administrative council must reflect its functions and its essential purpose; it is an administrative council, whose representative character finds expression in its establishment through free elections, by the Arab inhabitants of Judea, Samaria and Gaza. Clearly, the criterion for determining the number of its members must be the functions that the council is empowered to perform. We propose, therefore, that the number of members will conform with the functions listed above. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Free Elections: Elections to the administrative council, under Israel's proposals, will be absolutely free, as stipulated in the Camp David agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties will agree upon the modalities of the elections, as a matter of fact, in past negotiations a long list of principles and guidelines has already been prepared in this matter. In these free elections, all the rights pertaining to a peaceful assembly, freedom of expression and secret balloting will be preserved and assured, and all necessary steps will be taken to prevent any interference with the election process. The holding of an absolutely free and unhampered election process will thus be assured in full, under the law, and in keeping with the tradition of free elections practised in democratic societies. These elections will, in many respects, constitute a new departure in the region around us which in most of its parts is not too close to the ways of democracy, and in which free elections are a rare phenomenon. It is of some interest, therefore, to note that Judea- Samaria and Gaza, under Israel's Military Government since 1967, have exemplified the practical possibility of totally free elections in these areas. In 1972, and again in 1976, Israel organised free elections in these areas based on the tradition and model of its own democratic and liberal tradition and cutsom; voters and elected officials alike concede that these were free elections in the fullest sense. The elections in the administrative council will be organised and supervised by the central elections committee whose composition has been agreed upon by the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Time of elections and establishment of the self-governing authority ( administrative council): The elections will be held as expeditiously as possible after agreement will have been reached on the autonomy. This was set forth in the joint letter of the late President Sadat and of Prime Minister Begin to President Carter, dated 26 March 1979, setting forth the manner in which the self-governing authority (administrative council) is to be established, under the terms of the Camp David agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Within one month following the elections, the self-governing authority ( administrative council) is to be established and inaugurated, and at that time the transitional period of five years will begin-again, in conformity with the Camp David agreement and the joint letter. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Hence, every effort will be made to hold elections without delay, once an agreement is reached, to be followed by the establishment of the self-governing authority (administrative council). </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Following the elections and the establishment of the self-governing authority (administrative council) the military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn, as withdrawal of Israeli armed forces will take place, and there will be a redeployment of the remaining Israeli forces into specified security locations, in full conformity with the Camp David agreement. Israel will present to the other parties in the negotiations the map of the specified security locations of the redeployment. It goes without saying that all this will be done for the purpose of safeguarding the security of Israel as well as of the Arab inhabitants of Judea-Samaria and Gaza and of the Israeli citizens residing in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. All of the above indicates Israel's readiness to observe the Camp David agreement fully and in every detail, in letter and spirit, while safeguarding the interests of all concerned. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4V4">Mr COLEMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposals refer to the setting up of administrative, self- governing councils. It will be the first time the Palestinians there will have an elected representative body. They deal with the powers under Israel's proposals, that will be given to these bodies for the administration of justice, the courts, agriculture, the civil service-which numbers about 12,000-schools, hospitals, housing, transport, traffic, postal and communications services, labour exchanges, municipalities, local police, religious affairs, tourism, industry, commerce, workshops and so on. I am not saying that they are adequate, let alone perfect, but they seem to indicate good faith on the part of Israel. They form the basis for confidence that the next step will be taken. They are certainly a basis for reasonable discussion-if members of the Opposition are reasonable and serious about the next step towards Palestinian autonomy, in which they claim to be even more interested. I welcome the Minister's statement. It is a major contribution to the peace of the world and something of which Australians may be proud.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision about Australia participating in the multinational peacekeeping force in the Sinai desert is not one which the Australian Labor Party supports. Had the peacekeeping force been under the auspices of the United Nations it would have had our full support. However, unfortunately the Soviet Union indicated that it would use its power of veto in the United Nations Security Council. As a result, Egypt and Israel had to ask the United States to put together this multinational force outside the auspices of the United Nations. We can thank the Soviet Union for the fact that this country is divided on that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, a number of countries will participate-Norway, Fiji, Colombia, Australia, New Zealand, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Italy and, of course, the United States. I understand that Uruguay is available to participate if required. It is a tragedy that it is not a United Nations peacekeeping force. Such a force would have had the total support of the Australian people and would have been able to participate in the peace process that began with the signing of the Camp David Accords and the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. I do not want to go over all the matters raised in the debate which took place when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced that Australia would contribute to that force, but I wish to deal with a few matters that have arisen since. Some rather irrational people in our community, and others who seem to have a vested interest in the Camp David process failing, have dragged a few red herrings across the trail. One is that Australian troops would be used to evict Israeli settlers from Yamit when the multinational force went in. Anybody who has been watching television in recent weeks would have seen the heartbreaking scenes that have occurred when Israeli troops have themselves had to evict Israeli citizens from Yamit. One political party, the Tami party, under Mr Abuhatzeira, unfortunately has threatened to withdraw from the coalition over this issue. It is in favour of the Yamit settlers staying there. The Israeli Government has offered $230m-which I think frankly is outrageous-of which each family will get about $250,000 to withdraw from Yamit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Who would be a settler? Lots of people would have liked to be settlers in Yamit. It has outraged a lot of Israeli citizens that people should be paid to go out of that area. The simple fact of the matter is that no Israeli government could survive 10 minutes if it permitted Australian troops or any foreign troops to participate in evicting Israelis from Israeli territory. The proposition is nothing short of outrageous. It is hard enough for them to evict their own people; it would be impossible to allow it to be done by foreign troops.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Vanessa Redgrave's name has been mentioned in this debate. One could hardly ignore some of her statements. As has been said, she is a great actress. Unfortunately, she is a very distasteful individual in all other aspects. She is , to put it bluntly, a nut, an anti-Semite and a member of the Workers Revolutionary Party which aligned with a group in this country, the Socialist Labor League, could have held its annual general meeting in a telephone booth. They belong to the extreme Trotskyist organisations that advocate the violent overthrow of society. It is unfortunate that she has been given some credibility in our community. She has even been disowned by Tony Benn, who has described her as unstable and, as I said before, a nut. </PARA>
<PARA> Before she left Canberra she claimed that Australian troops would be blown to bits by the Israelis. To suggest such a load of nonsense is an obscenity. I would hardly imagine that Israel, along with Egypt, would invite the Australians in to keep the peace and then proceed to blow them to bits. What sort of perverted logic would lead one to the weird conclusion that Israel would do that ? It is too absurd for words. All Israel has to do to get rid of the Australian troops is not invite them in the first place. If Israel did not want the peace process to proceed, it need not have withdrawn from the Sinai and it need not withdraw from the last portion of the Sinai on 26 April. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the Australian troops will be at some risk. From 1976 to 1979, 48 Royal Australian Air Force personnel were in that area and to the best of my knowledge there were no problems. At that time they were patrolling an area and separating combatants. I understand that 109 people going in will be doing much the same work-patrolling borders with helicopters, doing some administrative and communications work, and work of that nature. Nobody can give any unequivocal assurances that nobody will be injured. It is impossible to give that sort of assurance. There must always be some risk. Knowing the factors that operate there, I can only suggest that the risks must be miniscule. Our personnel will not be separating combatants or warring parties as they were from 1976 to 1979; they will be separating people who are trying to bring about a genuine peace between two countries. As someone suggested recently, the greatest danger to them will be getting a bad dose of sunburn down at Sharm el Sheikh. Having just come back from that region, I can agree with that. </PARA>

<PARA> The two countries, Egypt and Israel, have vested interests in working towards peace, for military, political and economic reasons. It has been suggested that, if Israel and Egypt want to bring about peace, why do they need other parties there. That view fails to understand the geography of the district. In the past, when attacks have been made, they have been surprise attacks. In 1973, when Egypt crossed the Suez Canal and attacked the 600-odd Israeli troops who were on the Bar-Lev line, they were able to break through fairly quickly. However, fortunately, because of the structure of the Sinai, because of the Mitla and Giddi passes, they were not able to get straight through to Israel quickly. That gave Israel the time to regroup its forces and to throw back the Egyptians from that area. However, had they been on the Sinai borders of Israel after the 1948 war, that same sort of strike could have gone straight into the heart of Israel. There would have been no chance of Israel defending itself properly. The other point is that it gave the air force about 40 minutes warning period. Egyptian planes travelling across the Sinai would take at least 40 minutes to reach the present boundaries of Israel whereas if they attacked from the Sinai they would be over Tel Aviv or Jerusalem in a matter of minutes. The point I make is that a period of trust has to develop between Egypt and Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to a change in leadership, we have seen what happened with the assassination of Sadat. There is no democratic process in Egypt as there is in Israel, so Israel needs some sort of guarantee to cover such a situation when there might be a change of leader and a change of heart. That is why this multinational force-preferably a United Nations force-ought to be there; in this period of getting together and working out relations, there is that guarantee that there cannot be a sudden change of heart. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested by some, including some Israelis, that after 26 April Egyptians may return to the Arab fold, become militarily aggressive and prepare to attack Israel again. I do not believe that that will happen; I do not believe that that is the object of Egypt. I believe the Egyptians genuinely want peace. I went to Cairo and met and talked with many Egyptians, including the Foreign Minister, Dr Boutros Galli-an outstanding man-who expressed the views of Egyptians. He said that for a whole range of reasons-political, social and cultural-they want a genuine peace with the Israelis. I am totally convinced of the Egyptians' sincerity. They have lost thousands and thousands of young men and have lost enormous economic benefits for all their people during this constant 30-year war. I am absolutely convinced that Egypt wants a genuine peace . I am also sure Egypt knows that if Israel is attacked again after this present withdrawal but then recaptures the Sinai there is no way Israel will ever withdraw for a third time; it just will not happen. In other words, I believe this is the last chance to establish a genuine peace in that area. </PARA>

Eshkol said: 'I am the Prime Minister of 3 million presidents'. We must not encourage those hardliners in Israel who do not want to make peace, who would like to have a greater Israel, who would like not to withdraw from the Sinai, who would like not to talk eventually to the Arabs about the settlement of the problems of the West Bank and Gaza. If the Sinai process does not proceed I believe that the chances of convincing those Israelis who are sceptical now would be an absolute impossibility in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me conclude by saying that the next step in the peace process, of course, is to resolve the question of what is going to happen on the West Bank and Gaza. If, as I said before, the Sinai peace process proceeds, I believe there will be encouragement for the Israelis to take a different approach to how they are going to resolve the problem of the West Bank. I am not going to sit in the safety of my home in Gosford and say what decisions people should make in that area. It is for the Israelis, the Jordanians and the Syrians to decide that in discussions between themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of talk about Israel's intransigence. What about Arab intransigence? Only one Arab country has recognised Israel. None of the others has made that move. We have heard a lot of talk about how the Palestine Liberation Organisation contains a moderate force and how Arafat will meet with Western leaders and say: 'Yes, of course we recognise that Israel must exist'. But the next day, having convinced the Western leaders that he is a very genuine , sincere and moderate sort of person, in arabic he says exactly the opposite. The only two Arab PLO spokesmen who ever spoke out publicly were assassinated. This is a problem for the PLO. I recognise that problem but it is one which it must resolve itself. It is not a problem for other countries to resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> The intransigence of the Arab countries over 30 years is the cause of all their problems. If they had accepted the 1947 partition Israel would now be a country the size of the Gold Coast. But it has been their refusal to accept Israel's right to exist that has led to the present situation. It is up to the Arab countries and the PLO to say: 'We recognise your right to exist; let us get down now to the business of solving the problem of the Palestinian refugees on the West Bank and Gaza'. I believe that ultimately these problems will be solved and a genuine peace will be brought about. Until that time, unfortuately we are left with all we have which is the process before us at the moment. </PARA>

In relation to the United States, who can detract from the efforts made by President Carter to bring about a series of incidents which culminated in the Camp David talks? This was an isolated example of a genuine attempt to achieve peace in a part of the world in which such an objective would seem almost impossible bearing in mind the hazards, the difficulties and the traditional enmities involved. One would feel that the most sterile area in the world to produce a peaceful solution would be anywhere in the volatile Middle East. But President Carter pressed on. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to my next heading-Sadat. Someone asked me the other day: 'Who would you name as one of the great men in your limited experience who has made a contribution to his fellow men?' That question had me stumped. If we applied that question to the times with which we in this chamber are most familiar, President Sadat would be a real possibility. He had everything to lose-I do not know that he had much to gain-when he grasped the nettle and travelled to Israel . He made the move knowing full well that he would inevitably not only attract the anger of his own people but also would be isolated from them. It is not a very pleasant experience to be isolated from one's own people. But he went to Israel; he pressed on. </PARA>
<PARA> I can remember that one of our members got up in our party room-I am going to leak a party secret-and said: 'We have only to set the date because inevitably Sadat is going to be removed from the scene; he is going to be assassinated'. I well remember that occasion. The man who said it was the honourable member for Bradfield, David Connolly, a man who has had vast experience in the Middle East, a man who was a career diplomat and a man for whom I have a great deal of respect. It was obvious that Sadat was at all times subject to the threat of assassination, and it happened in a most brutal way. A great man was removed from the scene. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to my next heading-Lebanon. It is remarkable how people can get terribly upset about an occasional death here and an occasional death there. Forgive me for making such a comment on Saint Patrick's day, but a few people also get knocked off occasionally in Ireland. These deaths are terrible and brutal. Deaths and casualties are occurring in other parts of the world as a result of brutal warfare. But in Lebanon it was a case of genocide. Tens of thousands of people have been brutally slaughtered. The statistics are there, if anyone thinks I am exaggerating. I and no doubt the honourable member for Robertson and other people who have been closely watching this evolution of disaster, misery and slaughter, are looking for one thing, and that is the eventual spread of peace-I know this seems an almost impossible dream-to the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to my final heading-Palestine. I am going to combine all the points I have raised in the few minutes I have left. I do not think that any fairminded person would argue or even question the fact that the Palestinians should be settled. But we should not do a deal and say: 'We will settle the Palestinians providing you get rid of the Israelis'. Oh no, that would not be a solution at all. I had the opportunity in Washington to talk to an aide of Mr Atherton. Honourable members many recall that the Atherton round of talks took place prior to the Habib round of talks. Mr Habib is currently visiting the Middle East and making every effort to try to find some solution. One gets a little worried when people say that there is no solution, there is no answer to the Middle East problem. Does one stop cancer research because there is no apparent readily available cure for cancer? Of course not. Who keeps trying on the Middle East problem? It is the United States. It is quite remarkable that anything initiated by the United States comes under fire from certain people. Anything initiated by the United States has to be wrong, it has to be under suspicion, there has to be some ulterior motive, we have to be playing with the possibility of another Vietnam. Never is it suggested that this country is taking an initiative to secure peace, peace which cost the life of Sadat. The media of the United States stands indicted for looking for something to use against the President, whoever he may be, looking with suspicion on any move that is made to support the countries that have true democracy. This attitude is positively sickening. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us combine all of these motives. I had the opportunity of having discussions, not with Mr Atherton, but with his second-in-charge in Washington. I then went on to London and had opportunities of discussing matters with Mr Dean who was the expert with the British Government on Middle East affairs. They concurred in this respect: When the Camp David scheme of things eventually reaches its finality, which is a matter of the withdrawal from the Sinai Desert- that is the final act in this drama-then the whole of the resources of those who are genuinely seeking peace in the Middle East should be used in an attempt to find a solution to the Palestinian problem. I suppose that begins with the West Bank. What would we do? The reality seems to pass through this chamber. Many people will not fairly face up to the fact that if we do not have the assistance and co-operation of the United States of America and an assurance that she will come to our defence, then who in hell will come. I would like to know which super power, middle power, little power or any other power will assist us. Has anyone indicated that he is concerned about this country? We then turn to people in high places-I have had that great opportunity-who say: 'Australia is not the sort of country that holds our coat'. They have indicated that they are prepared to stand by and act with the United States in matters that are of world-wide importance and which are associated with the security and defence of the principles which we hold dear. My goodness, the people who stand together to support Western democracy are dwindling away. They are fading out of the picture . </PARA>
<PARA> I now deal with the matter of the Sinai Desert and the Multinational Force and Observers. I will confess quite frankly my own feelings about this. I lived in great apprehension that this Government might have decided not to go to the Sinai and turn its back on one of the great episodes of peace in our history. I had the opportunity of flying with our helicopter squadron out of Ismailiya. We flew across the Sinai Desert on the ordinary routine daily inspection tour. It was an experience that I will never forget. We flew across the Sinai and down to the Israeli border. We then flew to the coast and came back along the Red Sea area to Ismailiya. It took us a full day. We flew along the roads and I asked: ' Why are you flying along the bitumen roads?' The pilot replied: 'Because we might have to land and if we have to land we do not want to land on the desert because it is absolutely infiltrated with mines. There are thousands of mines still lying around'. That sort of thing occurs every day. I detected very promptly from the discussions I had with members of the Egyptian Government and with Pierre Hutton, our own Ambassador, that that unit, which was part of a very extensive peacekeeping force, was held in the highest regard. The ability, the dedication and the no-nonsense attitude of these Australian fliers was recognised and respected. So Australia was flying a flag and being held in the greatest repute. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Australia providing a force to go to the Sinai, what is the alternative? The alternative would be that any lip service paid to peace in the future would be purely that-lip service. We would say: 'We are not prepared to take part in this operation but we want the support and the assistance of the United States. We want to be regarded as a country that is right up to the forefront when it comes to the defence and the offence-if you like-of the democratic group of nations'. I do not want to talk again about Vietnam. I was the Minister for the Army when we wound up the war. I did have something to do with the final stages of that regrettable era. What would have been the result if the so-called Western bloc had stood firm? Maybe thousands of lives would have been saved. What would have been the result if John F. Kennedy had been alive or someone who would have taken decisive and prompt action? Maybe that war would never have occurred. Maybe that terrible tragedy that cost Australian and other lives may never have occurred. We are taking part in the Sinai peacekeeping force and we should be damn proud to be there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I get on to what I basically want to say about the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), I should like to take up a couple of points that were made by Government supporters during their addresses. For example, the honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean), in speaking of the legal basis of the Sinai peacekeeping force, adopted a critical attitude towards the Labor Party for pointing out that it would not support a force which was not within the terms of the original Sinai agreement, which entailed a United Nations-backed peacekeeping force, on the ground that we had permitted the Soviet Union to exercise a veto on us. As I said in the previous debate, I have absolutely no brief for Soviet foreign policy anywhere in the world, let alone in the Middle East. But the simple fact of the matter is that there was never a Soviet veto exercised on a United Nations peacekeeping force in the Sinai. The Soviet Union did not have to exercise a veto because no majority on the Security Council could be found in favour of a Sinai peacekeeping force to necessitate a veto being exercised. I wish that the Government would leave that argument alone, because it is not one that will stand up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) claimed that the Labor Party had changed its position in a number of areas associated with the force, one of them being that it is no longer claiming that we did not have the troops to do the task. If the proposition, when we originally discussed this matter, had been what subsequently emerged, we probably would not have put that argument. But if the honourable member casts his mind back to the time, he will remember that the discussion was on the commitment of a battalion or half a battalion-two companies. That being so, I would say that what has eventually emerged indicates that we were correct in our assessment, because the force that the Government is committing is nowhere near that size. </PARA>
<PARA> Our opposition to the commitment to the Sinai peacekeeping force remains, but it is to be exercised within the way in which the Labor Party traditionally exercises its opposition when it opposes a commitment of Australian forces overseas by the Government. We are concerned that, once the commitment is made, every support is given to the soldiers while they are there and that they have appropriate legal protection. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) raised some very pertinent points during this debate as to whether the legal protection is actually adequate for the forces operating there. We do question the way the force is being finally prepared, despite the fact that the Government has had very considerable notice for it. Everything is extremely hurried. We have had a hurried amendment to the Repatriation Act. I was aware, from the conversations I had when I was in the Middle East, that the logistics for the force, its location and the way in which it would be deployed, were all being very hurriedly prepared by our officers there. It seems very likely in these circumstances that mistakes will be made. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to certain areas where mistakes may well have been made. The points that he raised must be answered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This commitment places Australia in the middle of an extraordinarily complicated and dangerous political area and situation. It is quite true that the force will supervise a disengagement between two parties which wish to be at peace. It is not true that it will be located in an area in which all interested parties, including some interested parties which occasionally use the Sinai, necessarily accept the basis of the peace. It is also not clear what the future course of relations between the two parties will be. It has been quite evident since the ascension of President Mubarak to that position in Egypt that there has been a shift in the Egyptian line. It is quite evident that the Egyptians are attempting to re-establish their relationships, at least with the conservative Arab States, and to assert some degree of leadership in the Arab bloc. That is a situation which we ought to welcome, but it creates a different political situation from that at the time this commitment was foreshadowed. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side, the Israeli side, there has been a distinct change of attitude in Israel since the time of the signing of the original peace treaty. The Israelis have unquestionably, on the other occupied territories, become more strongly opposed to any further concessions of territory-opposition to further concessions possibly even in the context of a possible Arab recognition or mutual negotiations with the Jordanians. I suggest that that will create a degree of tension in some areas of the Camp David process which remain. I shall come to that matter later. This force will oblige us to have views on all these matters. We shall have our profile significantly raised in the Middle East as a result of our participation in this force, and states who have hitherto not been interested in what we have had to say about the general situation in the Middle East will become very interested indeed. We shall be obliged to have a more sophisticated and detailed understanding of the region's affairs than we have had to this point. So far we have not displayed the sensitivity. Nowhere is this clearer than in the Government's rather belated efforts to conform to its original promise to ensure that there should be no connection between the Multinational Force and Observers and the United States Rapid Deployment Force. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it important to have this matter clear? I think that there are two reasons, and neither of them relates particularly to how the Labor Party might feel about the matter. They relate to problems that we confront in that area. The first reason is that other countries in the region with which we are friendly are very hostile towards and fearful of the rapid deployment force. It was quite evident to those of us, both Government and Opposition, who toured the area just after Christmas that in Saudi Arabia, in the emirates and in Jordan, the leaders of the governments that we met saw absolutely no value whatsoever in the American notion of a strategic consensus and absolutely no value in the rapid deployment force. They feared that it would provoke Soviet involvement. They feared that it would destabilise local populations if it were brought into the area and create a situation of difficulty for the rulers. They feared ways in which the United States might use the force. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason why we must make clear the separation of the MFO from the RDF is that the three main parties to this agreement-Egypt, Israel and, of course, the United States-have all in their various ways offered support for the Rapid Deployment Force, including the use of facilities, and have also offered support for the general American strategy in the area of a strategic consensus against Soviet initiatives. Given that situation, it is highly likely that the Arab powers in the area which are not parties to this agreement will be highly suspicious of the nature of the force when it goes into the area. That is why it must be crystal clear that the two forces ought to be separated. So, from the outset, we of the Opposition, anticipating this, have argued that the Americans ought not to commit a unit of the eighty-second airborne division to that force but ought to draw their forces from elsewhere-from other sections of the US Armed Services that are not associated with the Rapid Deployment Force. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not because we of the Labor Party need to be convinced that the MFO will not be used as part of the RDF. I am prepared to accept a congressional resolution on that matter. The other Arab states in the area, an area rife with paranoia and suspicion, will not be so inclined. Yet when I raised this matter last October, at Question Time, I was blown out backwards by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and nothing was done until a month ago when the Minister scampered about discovering what by then had become a fait accompli and revealed to the Australian Press, despite the fact that it had been raised in the House last October and ought to have been quite obvious to him, that he was ignorant of the fact that a unit of the RDF was going to be used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that is the degree of sensitivity to Middle Eastern issues that is to be associated with this commitment, we shall have some problems here. In this whole process we have been very protective of the American position. We have manoeuvred in precisely the directions which the United States wanted vis-a-vis its European allies. The Europeans, on the other hand, have manoeuvred to incorporate a more broadly-based notion of a Middle East settlement within the framework of their MFO commitment. We had nothing to say on this matter; certainly nothing to say to the Egyptians, the Israelis and the Americans. We must now develop some views. One of the problems with which we are now confronted is that this involvement increases pressure on us to have views on complex matters which will quite dramatically affect our ability to remain on friendly terms with both Israel and the Arabs. Whether we accept responsibility for a broad Middle East settlement-I presume from the Minister's statement that we do-we have definitely accepted a responsibility for what remains of the Camp David process, as we are there to keep the peace between the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> What are our views on the outstanding differences associated with the Camp David process? What are our views on the question of automony of the West Bank? Do we accept the Egyptian view that it must have full atonomy, that the Arabs on the West Bank must have that autonomy with no further Israeli settlement in the area, to be followed in five years by an act of Palestinian self-determination? If that is our view, are we going to protest as West Bank Arab politicians become the object of assassination attempts as Arab homes are dynamited or as the Israeli military beats up Arab demonstrators?</PARA>
<PARA> When we visited the area we met Mayor Freij, a mayor on the West Bank who, whilst a supporter of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, has called upon that organisation to recognise Israel. He revealed to us the full extent of the extraordinary difficulty he has experienced in co-operating with the Israeli authorities. What are the Government's views going to be on that? What will it say to him? The Government did not have to say anything to him a few months ago but it does now because it is involved in the Camp David process. Or, is the Government going to accept the Israeli view of autonomy, that 30 per cent of the West Bank now belongs to Israel, to be settled at will by Israeli settlers and to be fully incorporated-that is the whole of the West Bank-at the end of the five year period of experimentation within the nation state of Israel? If that is our view, are we to support Israel in the United Nations when it runs into trouble on this issue and needs to be defended diplomatically? We know nothing of this from the Government and we have heard nothing about it from the Government speakers. The Government has put us in it; now it must give us some answers. The Government is now involved and it must make a stand. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the question of the Palestinian people? They are supposedly involved in the next stage of the Camp David process. The Egyptians believe that now is the time for the Palestinians to be brought into discussions. They want to involve the PLO, yet Israel will not negotiate on any basis acceptable to the Palestinians and vice versa. What is going to be our stand? This may be more immediate than honourable members think. There is some PLO activity in the Sinai . I would like to know what the Government's instructions are to members of the MFO who might come across a PLO operation. Will they report it or intercept it, taking sides in that continuing conflict which is not strictly related to the particular area of their competence? No public answers have come forth from the Government on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What about Jerusalem? That question is also involved in current Camp David negotiations. Does the honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean) agree with the Egyptian view that Arab Jerusalem is part of the Arab West Bank of the Jordan, that Arab citizens of Arab Jerusalem should vote in elections for the autonomy council? Israel does not accept this. It regards Jerusalem as part of Israel. What does the Government think about this? Does it agree with the Pope, who has argued that Jerusalem ought to be an international city? We need to know what the Government thinks about this. We did not need to know that a few months ago because we were irrelevant to the process. The Government has now put us right in it; now, what are its views on the matter?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us go a step further, because the Minister invites us to when he talks about a general settlement in the Middle East. What are our views in other areas of Arab-Israeli relations? Israel is intimately involved in the situation that is developing in the Lebanon. When we were in northern Israel, on three nights we saw large numbers of Israeli tanks on the backs of trucks moving northward into the border area with Lebanon. It was quite evident to us that at least the option of a massive Israeli attack in the Lebanon was being created by the Israeli military. An attack has certainly been threatened in a certain set of conditions. It may eventually be a justified attack, or it may not, but one thing is certain: Since we have so actively raised our profile in the area, the nations in the area are going to want to know what we think about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members do not think that is going to be asked of us, I refer them to their own Government's response to the Israeli annexation of the Golan. This is one matter on which I did agree with the Government in its Middle Eastern policy. But its opposition to the Israeli action was in contrast to the past record of the Government, when it very rarely said anything about any development in the Middle East. When the Israelis annexed the Golan, the Australian Ambassador went straight into the Israeli Foreign Ministry to express the Australian protest. That is a signal of what we can expect in the future. We are going to be obliged to have views on these issues. These views will embarrass us in our relations with the Israelis or they will embarrass us in our relations with the Arabs. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House have said that Australia ought to have an opportunity to speak to all sides and to have our views taken seriously by all sides. That was the reason for our opposition to the MFO commitment. We did not want to involve Australia in that process because we do not believe that the sorts of circumstances in which we are going to be involved as a result of this commitment are going to enable us to make that serious contribution. We have lost a substantial amount of our standing in the Arab world. That will not produce any retaliation, but the Arabs take us as a less serious and independent power than they once did. I think in terms of peace in the area and in terms of the sort of contribution we could make to it, that is a very great shame indeed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating the tabling of certain documents by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) relating to Australia' s participation in the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers. Those documents consisted of two exchanges of letters constituting the agreement between the MFO Director-General and the Australian Foreign Minister, the protocol signed by Egypt and Israel on 3 August 1981, which was the basis for the establishment of the Sinai multinational force, and also an aide-memoire, which is attached to a letter from the Director-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I consider that this statement is the latest action in a very serious attempt by the Government to inform the Parliament and the Australian people and to promote debate on this issue of Australia's participation in a multinational force in the Sinai. I compliment the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in particular on the manner in which they have encouraged debate on this issue. Whatever the views of honourable members about the final decision reached by the Government, I believe that all honourable members should acknowledge that the Minister has taken very deliberate action to canvass in this House the issues involved and to encourage public debate even before the Government eventually decided its position on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the decision, which was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 28 October last year for Australia to participate in a multinational force, was influenced by the discussions which preceded it in this Parliament, in the Government members party room and in the public arena. Certainly I had to be satisfied on certain questions before I was happy about our participation in the multinational force. In the end I was happy to support a commitment to such a peacekeeping force if several strict conditions were met. </PARA>
<PARA> These conditions were, in fact, met and spelt out in the Prime Minister's statement and they reflect the manner in which the Government has listened to the public debates on the matter. For example, our participation was made conditional upon the force being a truly international one. The international size of our commitment was to be maintained so that there was no question of it involving more and more personnel over time. The structure of the force has been clearly spelt out and the responsibilities of Australian commanders are defined. Moreover, I would not have been happy about our involvement without the clearly expressed wish on behalf of both Israel and Egypt for an Australian participation, not just for reasons of presentation but for the strict and basic reasons concerning the legitimacy of the force and our right to be there as part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> An important element of the Prime Minister's statement last October was the emphasis he gave to the need to accommodate the aspirations of the Palestinian people. I think we should dwell on this matter because some of the critics from the Opposition would be well advised to examine that part of the Prime Minister' s statement with great care. I suggest that it represents the greatest shift in the policy of any Australian government towards an acceptance of the claims of the Palestinian people that we have ever had from any spokesman for any government in Australia. Furthermore, I submit that such a shift in emphasis would not have been possible without an Australian commitment to a peacekeeping force which would help guarantee the security of Israel's southern border. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer in this respect to the speeches which have been made by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) both at the time of the Prime Minister's statement last October and today in this House when he spoke on the statement by the Foreign Minister. The honourable member for Robertson pointed out the desperate need of the Israeli people to be assured that the rest of the world was prepared to play a part in guaranteeing Israel's security. Only by some practicial demonstration of a willingness by the international community to guarantee Israel's borders could the Israelis even begin to feel confident about entering into negotiations on matters concerning Judea, Samaria and the Golan Heights. In my view, Australian policy would not have reflected a shift towards an acceptance of the rights of the Palestinians without at the same time ensuring that we were giving a definite commitment to a process of peace in the Middle East. The only workable commitment to a process of peace in the Middle East is in the form of the Camp David Accords. If they fail, no other process will even begin to operate in the Middle east. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to draw attention to what the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) had to say when he spoke in the debate last October. Most of what he had to say constituted, frankly, a justification for Australia's involvement in a multinational peacekeeping force. There is no doubt in my mind that he personally supports the Government's decision in this matter. However, he stated in this House that he supported the Australian Labor Party policy because that policy reflected the results of public opinion polls. It should be noted that at the time the honourable member for Wills seconded the Caucus resolution which determined the Labor Party's official attitude, none of the four national public opinion organisations in Australia had taken any polls on the issue. It is clear that the official policy of the ALP was forced upon the honourable member for Wills by the internal power situation of the party. In particular, the official ALP policy reflects the influence of the attitude of the socialist Left faction, particularly in Victoria, which is adamantly anti-Israel in its policies and rhetoric. This attitude was reflected in the speech of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) on this subject. He has openly declared his adherence to the socialist Left. His attitude on this issue was to require Israel to give away all her negotiating points in the Middle East without offering any accompanying guarantee of her right to live within internationally accepted and secure borders. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt some risk is associated with the Government's decision. I want to comment on that. None of us who support this policy of participating in the multinational force should do so in any sort of adventurous spirit without considering our responsibility to the servicemen whom we are committing to the Middle East. While it is essentially a peacekeeping force to supervise the handing over of territory from one friendly power to another, we must acknowledge that in view of the instabilities in the Middle East it still involves some risk, however small. Every honourable member who supports the decision to participate in the peacekeeping force must be prepared to accept responsibility for that risk. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, I had some queries that I needed to have settled in my mind before being prepared to support an Australian commitment. Frankly, I developed substantial doubts, particularly after the Israeli air attack on Beirut last year. My view then was that this Israeli action, which even her friends found hard to justify, raised the temperature in the region so much that there was a substantial risk that any peacekeeping force would be a target for armed elements in the region outside the control of both Israel and Egypt. I also questioned the need for such a force if in fact both Egypt and Israel agreed upon a withdrawal procedure. That point was eloquently answered by the honourable member for Robertson, as I have already mentioned. Israel needs to be assured that the rest of the world cares about her security if she is to accept encouragement to enter into further negotiations on other issues.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been much criticism of the reluctance of Prime Minister Begin of Israel to enter-indeed, of his opposition to entering-into negotiations on the West Bank and about settlement policies involving Israeli communities established on Arab land. Frankly, my preference would have been for Mr Perez of the Israeli Labor Party to have won the Israeli election last year. In my view there would have been a greater chance of a fresh approach to negotiations with a new government in power in Israel. However, Mr Begin did win, although very narrowly, and he is Israel's Prime Minister with whom the world must deal. He won in a democratic election. We must not take his apparent reluctance as the last word on this subject as far as negotiations on other matters are concerned. Let us remember that the late President Sadat, who was welcomed in Israel as a harbinger of peace, was in the 1973 war condemned by Israel as a warmonger and as a threat to international peace. Prime Minister Begin of Israel only a few short years ago was saying adamantly that while he was Prime Minister he would not give up one inch of the Sinai. Now he has signed away the lot. An international guarantee of the security and integrity of Israel's right to exist is the key to greater Israeli flexibility on West Bank and Palestinian issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit that our participation and the participation of other democratic nations in a peacekeeping force would give us greater leverage in persuading the Israeli Government to be more forthcoming on these negotiations than we would have if we were not involved in such a peacekeeping force. I strongly recommend that the Government use the influence that it will have with Israel as a result of our participation in this force to encourage Israel to enter into meaningful negotiations on these other issues. Both the Israelis and the Palestine Liberation Organisation say publicly that they will never recognise the other, but privately many Israelis and many PLO activists give other assurances. It appears that neither wants to play this last card of recognising the other before being assured that the other side will make a concession simultaneously. Obviously, the world must encourage both sides to have the confidence to take this step. One important and essential element of that is to ensure that Israel has the right and is recognised internationally as having the right to live within secure and well-defined borders. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with the contention which is obviously the key, as I understand it, to the Opposition's argument; that is, that this force should have been a United Nations force and if it were a United Nations force they would be prepared to support it. Perhaps we would all prefer it to be a United Nations force. Nonetheless I suggest that it would not give it any greater legitimacy than the present structure has. Let us ask ourselves: What is so morally superior about a United Nations force? Certainly it is desirable, but if we are looking at legitimacy and the moral right of a force to be in place, why is it any more superior? Did our armed contingent in Zimbabwe, for example, which served so effectively and I thought with bipartisan support in the supervision of elections in that country, lack legitimacy because if was not a member of a United Nations force? Certainly that contingent faced some risks, albeit minimal , because the country contained at least three competing armies and other armed elements and only weeks before that country had been fighting a vicious and cruel civil war. None of us, in committing our troops to that country, albeit for a peaceful operation, could have been certain that they would not face attack from an uncontrolled guerilla group in the country. Did the Opposition oppose our involvement in that exercise on the basis that it was not a part of a United Nations force? Indeed, I suggest that apart from the Commonwealth connection, that part of Africa impinges less on our direct international interests than does the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider also the Papua New Guinea contingent which went to Vanuatu in 1980 when that country's security was threatened by rebellion on Santo. Any one who is familiar with the situation knows that the Papua New Guinea force could not have got there without Australia's help in terms of our skilled technical personnel who were on secondment to the Papua New Guines force at the time. The support of the Australian Government was canvassed and was sought specifically for that involvement. Did the Opposition rise up in condemnation because the Papua New Guinea force which went there, with our blessing as I understand it, was not a United Nations force?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the matter of our participation in the Korean war. That ostensibly was as part of a United Nations force. Was our participation in the Korean war any more moral than would otherwise have been the case because it was formally approved by the United Nations? I doubt that those who have suffered any misgivings about the appropriatness of our involvement there are terribly impressed by the fact that the allied forces in Korea had the United Nations imprimatur. It appears to me that what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Opposition spokesmen are saying is that they will agree to our participation in the Sinai force if it has the backing of the United Nations. But it depends on a number of factors outside our control. I submit to this House that if we have an agreement which is acceptable to the major parties directly involved, namely Egypt and Israel-we have been requested by them to participate-and if it is a matter on which hinges the whole success of any future negotiations, we have a responsibility to consider very seriously any request to participate in such a force. I accept that there may be some element of risk, however minimal, with our participation but I believe that Australia, as a responsible member of the international community with an interest in ensuring that the peace process in the Middle East continues, is successful and develops in other directions and encompasses many more aspects of the Middle East problem, and as a responsible nation in good company with others, should participate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) and the Government have failed to answer one very vital question about the force, and that question is: What is the force going to do? I will go back over some of the arguments and some of the justifications that were presented previously by this Government. In a statement on 22 October 1981 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . as the text of the Treaty makes clear, that complete withdrawal is conditional on the existence of a peacekeeping force which will supervise both the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai and the implementation of security arrangements agreed on in the Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on in that statement the Prime Minister established as the main argument for the force the need to ensure that Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai is being carried out in accordance with international commitments. I stress the point that the force 'will supervise the Israeli withdrawal' because-and I have not heard any Government supporter consider this question-less than two weeks after the Prime Minister's statement the Israeli Prime Minister pulled the rug completely from under the position of the Prime Minister and of the Government. In addressing the Israeli Cabinet early in November Prime Minister Begin stipulated-and I want Government supporters to listen to this carefully:</PARA>
<PARA> No country should label its participation as the supervision of Israel's withdrawal from occupied territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a proposition in which the Prime Minister stated explicitly to the people of Australia that the main purpose of our going into the Sinai is to supervise Israel's withdrawal and the Israeli Prime Minister saying that no country should label its participation as supervision of Israel's withdrawal. He was talking not only about Australia. There also happened to be European powers which in fact had great difficulty in getting Israeli acceptance on Israeli terms for the involvement of European forces in the Sinai peacekeeping force. The main argument presented by the Government and by the Prime Minister has been denied by the Israeli Government itself. Either the Prime Minister believed what he said at the time he said it or else he has misled this House and this Parliament. Prime Minister Begin's ex cathedra statement has not been mentioned and I must confess that in the statement today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) there is no reference at all to the justification for Australian participation in the Sinai peace force. We had a whole lot of housekeeping details in submissions and in the attachments but the basic proposition of what the Australian force is going to do there has been cut out of all statements by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had an opportunity in the last couple of days of having a talk with a very senior representative of the British Government. This question was posed to him: What is the role and responsibility of the peacekeeping force? He could not answer. At least he was honest. He could not answer except to say that both sides had expressed an interest in it and that the United States was anxious that it should take place. But this whole question of conformity with Annex 1 of the Camp David Accords indicated throughout that there would be a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces and as that withdrawal took place the peacekeeping force would move in. I quote from Article I of Annex I:</PARA>
<PARA> As Israeli armed forces withdraw, United Nations forces will immediately enter the evacuated areas to establish interim and temporary buffer zones . . .</PARA>
<PARA>All through Annex I, which is the basis for the commitment of the force, is this argument of phased movements of the peacekeeping force as the Israeli forces withdraw. What has happened is that the Israelis have insisted that this does not take place in contradiction and in contravention of the Camp David Accords. They have said quite explicitly that the peacekeeping force will not be allowed to be put in place until the Israelis have withdrawn in their own way. So all the argumentation, all the references in Annex I of the Camp David Accords have been completely by-passed. I return to the basic question which I ask of the Government: What is the main job of the Australian contingent as part of the peacekeeping force? The argumentation before of the Prime Minister was that it is to supervise the Israeli withdrawal. This is demonstrably not the case. That was the proposition which was put to this Parliament and to the Australian people. So we have a situation in which the Australian forces are going in to carry out a responsibility that is no longer relevant. The Australian force is going into one of the most difficult areas of the world, and as the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) pointed out one of the most dangerous and volatile areas in the world, with no justification that has been spelt out by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like on this occasion to quote my good friend and colleague, one of the Government supporters, who put forward a view but unfortunately as a Government supporter he was not able to influence the final decision of the Government. In a paper he wrote last year he said:</PARA>
<PARA> With its southern flanks fully secured by the Force (particularly by virtue of the US presence in the Force), Israel would be more likely to engage in serious negotiations, and to make serious concessions for the purposes of solving the West Bank, Gaza, Old City of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights issues . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the argumentation that he then proceeded to attack, and this is his answer to that proposition:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in recent history supports this view. If anything, it seems likely that the more secure Israel feels to the South, the more free it would feel to take military action against, for example, the PLO and Syria. </PARA>
<PARA>That analysis has been effectively brought to fruition because that is precisely what is going to happen. We have seen that the Begin Government has deliberately torpedoed the United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 which is the very basis of the introductory or preambular statement to the Accord. That resolution simply calls for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territories occupied in the 1967 conflict. We have seen the expansion of the Israeli settlements on the West Bank, in defiance of the Accords. We have seen the annexation of the Golan Heights on 14 December 1981. We have seen the assertion of sovereignty by Israel over the whole of Jerusalem. We are talking about the whole concept of peace in the Middle East. We are talking about a need to attach ourselves to the Camp David Accords. But one of the major partners has quite deliberately set out -and this has been going on for some months, in fact years-on another course. On re-election Prime Minister Begin stated explicitly to the Knesset what he intended to do. He stated quite explicitly that he was going to annex the Golan Heights. He stated quite explicitly what his attitude was to the city of Jerusalem, and he has gone on and on. I quote one more statement which was made to the Knesset on 5 August 1981. In all of the discussions about Camp David and Australia's involvement which have taken place since then, we know what Prime Minister Begin's aims, objectives and accomplishments have been. He said that the autonomy agreed upon at Camp David means neither sovereignty nor self- determination. He is re-writing Camp David for his own benefit. He said that the autonomy agreements set down at Camp David are guarantees that under no condition will a Palestinian state emerge in the territory of Western Yeretz Israel. These statements are in direct contradiction not only of the spirit of Camp David but also in fact of the articles of Camp David. Australian forces are being sent by this Government to participate in what is called a peacekeeping force. The argument is that it will be a contribution to peace. But when one of the partners has shown by its actions that it is flagrantly opposed to both the spirit and the words of the Camp David Accords, what chances of success are there? I must confess that I have to agree with the very pessimistic account given by a member of the Government in a very closely reasoned and closely analysed piece. He finished up by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> To conclude. By becoming part of the Force, we place ourselves hostages to fortune, in that we can be affected by events that we can neither predict nor control and we subject ourselves to risks that cannot be calculated. </PARA>
<PARA>I thoroughly agree with that statement. That is precisely what we are doing. As the honourable member for Swan has pointed out, by our participation we are now placing ourselves in a situation in which we have to respond and we have to take a public position on all the issues of the Middle East. I do not think the Government is capable of carrying that through to its logical conclusion because it is an area, a part of the world, where the complications are manifold. We have introduced a new notion into our foreign policy. I do not suppose the challenge will hurt the Government very much but, given its past performance, it is certainly going to fall down on it. Our basic concern is that we are putting our forces there without any real justification explained to the Australian people. The justification that we have given in the past has been negatived by the Prime Minister of Israel. He stated quite explicitly that he would not put up with the justification that the Prime Minister explained to the Australian people and to the Parliament. To argue that this will contribute to peace in the Middle East is fallacious. I think the propositions put forward by the Government member bear very close study. Certainly I would agree with the propositions. I turn now to the only point of a policy matter that was made in the statement this afternoon, which was of assurances that were supposed to have been received from the United states on the question of the relationship between the MFO and the rapid deployment force. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our requirement that no part of the MFO, including the United States component should have any association with a United States rapid reployment force. </PARA>
<PARA>He stated 'any association with a US rapid deployment force'. That was the proposition put by the Prime Minister back on 22 October 1981. Now, as the honourable member for Swan has pointed out-he pointed it out last year-the unit that will be going into the Sinai is a unit of the rapid deployment force. In the statement the Minister has stated that Australia has insisted that the US component should not have any association with the United States rapid deployment force. I have quoted from the Minister's statement. How can the Government possibly argue that it should have no association with the rapid deployment force when a unit of the 82nd Airborne Division, which is the tooth group, a front line of the rapid deployment force, is to be part of the peacekeeping force? There are a number of issues on which I feel the Australian people have been misled. They have certainly been misled on the main arguments put back in October 1981 by the Prime Minister about the justification for Australia's participation. That has been torpedoed by Prime Minister Begin. The whole notion of peace in the Middle East has been torpedoed by the present Israeli Administration because everything that is intended to be achieved by the Camp David Accords has been beaten by the Prime Minister of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come to a statement that there should be no association between the rapid deployment force and the MFO we find that one of the units of the rapid deployment force is the United States component in the MFO. I believe that the Government has still a great deal to explain. I will state quite deliberately that this Government, as in past adventures such as Vietnam, has deliberately misled the Australian people. Regrettably, we cannot change the decision that has been made. The Australian forces are off to the Sinai. We wish them well and we wish them all a safe return. But, regrettably, it is the basis of a Government policy that the Opposition strongly opposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In entering a debate like this, having listened to other speakers, one is always impressed by the fact that most speakers approach the issues that are raised in the Parliament in terms of their preconceived commitments and preconceived attitudes towards the Middle East. I suppose that being the case-I am certainly not exempt from that-I approached this debate on the basis of one who has had within my own Party and in the Parliament a long standing commitment to the right of the State of Israel to exist within safe and secure borders. But, despite that commitment and having recently visited the whole region of the Middle East for some five or six weeks and having participated in discussions with political leaders in a vast range of countries which included Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Syria, Israel and Egypt, I came back more than ever convinced that it was no longer good enough for Australia as an important middle-power to commit troops to any part of the world, particularly to a region in which we have never been a nation exerting a major influence. We have never sought to exercise a major influence there and we should not commit troops, until such time as we have thought through the foreign policy objectives in which we are involved when committing those troops.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Boxer Rebellion, all on the basis that we were asked by a super-power. On every occasion we had not thought through the foreign policy implications. In the last war there was a threat to Australia in which we were involved and we are still paying the penalty for our involvement in Vietnam because we did not think through our foreign policy objectives on that occasion. I do not believe, and I do not accept the view, that we responded to a request from Israel or that we responded to a request from Egypt in this matter. We responded to the pressures of the United States of America that is why again we have a commitment, in which our foreign policy objectives are, I might say again , far from clear. I put it to the Minister that it sounds easy to say 'what we are about is securing the peace'. But if one goes, as I have with my colleagues, to the various states, the view of peace and how it is obtained in Saudi Arabia, the view of peace and how it is obtained in Israel, the view of peace and how it is obtained in Iraq or Egypt, are all quite different. If we are to have troops in the Sinai, if we are to have a commitment in that area militarily, we have raised the expectations. There is no doubt about this because it was expressed very firmly to the delegation of which I was a member, by no less a person than the Prime Minister of Egypt. He said: 'Now that you have a commitment in this region, we believe you will have a continuing political involvement.' That involves, I believe, a degree of maturity and sophistication in the determination of foreign policy objectives which has certainly not emerged in this debate nor from anything the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister to say that the Government's objective in committing troops to this region is to secure the peace. In the Middle East I sat at a table with a group from this Parliament led by a senior Minister who has acted as Foreign Minister on a number of occasions. A senior Arab politician who holds a position of some importance in his own country asked-as he was entitled to do-why we were committing troops to the Middle East. He was expecting some reservation to be expressed about our involvement in the Camp David process, certainly about our commitment of troops to the region. The answer given, presumably on behalf of the Government, was that we had sent troops to the Middle East as part of the Camp David process in order-I quote from a note that I made in my diary at the time-'to secure the return of Arab lands to Arabs'. One can get away with that sort of statement in private on some occasions but will not ultimately be able to say one thing when speaking to the leaders of the Arab world and another when speaking to a state such as Israel. I have no doubt as to what the reaction of the Prime Minister of Israel would have been to such a statement. If the Government of Israel has made anything clear in terms of the Camp David process it is that in that regard it did not want any commitment from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us follow this line of reasoning a little further. What is the position of this Government? I say at the outset that I do not believe that the Camp David process is dead. It is not dead because at least two powers are seriously involved in negotiations. But it is in great jeopardy because the views of Israel and Egypt as to autonomy and what it means differ greatly. Similarly, their views about the future of a Palestinian State are diverse. As a result of this commitment, it will no longer be possible for the Government or the Foreign Minister to skate around the problems of the Middle East by the use of generalities. I refer to some of the problems that have been raised by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). The Australian contingent is a nominal force and I do not believe that it is under any great military threat. Probably the average Australian serviceman faces greater threats when he is involved in exercises such as 'Kangaroo 81' or any other exercises with which the Australian military forces occupy themselves. But what is the Australian peacekeeping force to do if it has brought to its notice the fact the there are Palestinian Liberation Organisation insurgents operating in its region? Is it to report the fact? Is it to take action to try to secure and apprehend the offenders or is it to ignore the problem? They might seem like simple questions, but given the complexity of Middle East politics they raise very serious political questions which have to be answered. Up till now it was easy for us to say that our policy on the state of Israel was that we believed-it has certainly been my position-in its right to exist within safe and secure borders. There is no question about that. I see that the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney) is nodding his head. But as a result of the commitment which we have now made I ask him-because it is a difficult question to resolve-about what borders are we talking. That is the question that we will be asked. Are we talking about Israel's borders of 1948? Are we talking about the borders of 1967, or about those of the present? The government of Israel has strong views about its borders. It has recently annexed the Golan Heights. There are strong arguments in support of that action. Those who represent the Arab viewpoint also have strong feelings about it. I ask the honourable member for Phillip, the Minister for Science and Technology, (Mr Thomson), who is at the table, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who say that we support the right of Israel to exist within safe and secure borders, whether those borders include the Golan Heights. Do they include the city of Jerusalem? These are the questions which we as a parliament have now to consider and face. I submit that it is no longer of any use, or a positive contribution to this debate, to indulge in the exercise in the rhetoric that we have had in this House today. In my view it does not really matter what the socialist left in Victoria, or some sections of it, might think, what the Labor Unity group might think or what certain groups within the Liberal Party of Australia might think. What is important is that this nation, as a nation, should have a set of clearly defined objectives in regard to where we are going in the Middle East. I do not believe that we know. There is as much division within the Government on the issue as there is in any branch of the Labor Party. Australian society is clearly divided. Obviously, a great deal of further consideration and discussion is needed. I believe that great things have already been achieved in this area. The Camp David Accords constituted a major step forward. If I was given cause for hope on my recent tour it was in the strength and the commitment that I found in Egypt. One honourable member has already mentioned it but I reaffirm it . I believe that that commitment means that Egypt sees itself not only as a major power in the Arab world, one that is concerned to recognise Israel, but also as one that is aware of the history of the Jewish people and the problems that involved the founding of the Jewish state. It approaches those problems with some sensitivity and sees itself as capable of interpreting to the rest of the Arab world Israel's very real fears about its own security. </PARA>
<PARA> Two things distinguish Israel from every other state in the region: Not only is it a viable political democracy but also every Israeli knows there is no war Israel can afford to lose. That has coloured their attitude, not merely to the peacekeeping process, but also to the whole question of how to resolve problems. Therefore, some time must elapse for a new set of relations to be capable of emerging in this trouble spot. I submit that in this situation Australia had an alternative role to play, that of an important middle power. We are not seen by any nation in the region as a super-power. Nor are we seen as one which could not act as an honest broker. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern is that by acting in a way which would suit the short term objectives of the present Amercian Administration we find ourselves in a situation in which our capacity to act as an honest broker in the region has been to no small extent significantly mitigated. I believe that, given the complexities that are involved in that situation, it would have been better for Australia, for the State of Israel and I think for the moderate Arab States if Australia had maintained its role and its capacity to act as an honest broker rather than yet again climbing aboard the American gravy train and accepting its objectives for this area. Ulti- mately I will be more interested in hearing a speech from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in which he outlines in some detail the answers and the views that this Government has to the very real and detailed problems that confront every nation in the Middle East that is concerned to effect a lasting and permanent peace in that region. to date we have been able to survive with glib generalities. That is no longer an option. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1982 is to make a wide variety of changes to the tariff rates applying to many industries in our country. Sixteen broad categories of goods are involved in the changes. Some of them are very small, such as the wheelchair industry which employs only 55 workers, and some are very large such as the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, which employ about 120,000 workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition to these changes which indirectly and directly have an important bearing on the lives of many tens of thousands of Australians, the Bill provides for other amendments. The first to which I would like to draw attention involves changes to preferential tariff rates for certain goods from developing countries . The second category involves some additions to the list of goods accorded special preferences under the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement. The third category is the addition of electric soil heating apparatus to the list of goods agreed to under the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will not oppose the Bill because we believe that its provisions are all aimed at desirable objectives, in particular the maintenance of employment in a wide variety of manufacturing industries in Australia and also the encouragement of freer trade with our close neighbours, the countries of the South Pacific Forum, including New Zealand. However, while we do not oppose the Bill we take particular objection to the decision of the Government to impose a tariff duty on the importation of wheelchairs. It is not that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to the retention of a wheelchair manufacturing industry in Australia; on the contrary, we believe it is highly desirable that the capacity to make such items locally be maintained. However, the effect of a tariff is to raise the price of imported wheelchairs as well as to enable higher prices to be charged for locally produced wheelchairs. Where wheelchairs are provided free of charge by the Government, such an impost does not disadvantage those who must use them, unless they are taxpayers like the rest of us. We are then left to pay the taxes on these wheelchairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Not all wheelchairs needed by Australians are provided free of charge. What is more, the scheme which provides free chairs is so inadequately funded by the Government that hundreds of people are missing out on provisions to which they are entitled. Those who must pay for their wheelchairs as a result of import tariff duties can contribute as much as $300 a chair to the Government coffers. The Labor Party believes that this tax on wheelchairs is an abomination. This particular tariff change was introduced into this House during 1981, the International Year of Disabled Persons. This matter was raised by the Opposition on 2 June last year when the wheelchair tariff was first put before this House as part of the Customs Tariff Validation Bill. At that time we pointed out that the tariff proposed by the Government was significantly higher than had prevailed before 1 January 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the history of this matter. Prior to 1980, many imports of wheelchairs came from the United Kingdom at a preferential tariff rate of 15 per cent but on 1 January 1980 this preference was abolished so that the tariff immediately jumped from 34 per cent to 36 per cent. The Government sought Industries Assistance Commission advice on this issue and, following a report from the IAC, the present arrangements were decided upon by Cabinet. In the first year, duty of 30 per cent is to be maintained with a reduction to 25 per cent in the second year and 20 per cent thereafter. Still we do not get down to the old preferential rate of tariff of 15 per cent. I repeat: All of these rates are higher than the original British preferential rate. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition objected to this tax on the disabled-I emphasise that it was a tax on the disabled, first introduced in the Year of Disabled Persons-the response we received from the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore), who out of courtesy is in the House and I acknowledge that, was as I will read. I am sure that he will be ashamed when I remind him of the words he used which were:</PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Australian Labor Party has a bleeding heart from time to time, but the relevance is to industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I think we can introduce measures which are both relevant to industry and which show that we have a bleeding heart, from whatever side of the Parliament we come . I believe that it is indifference that allows the present tax on wheelchairs to continue and the Minister should stand condemned while he allows it. I am sure that after he has heard my words he will go away from this chamber much more resolved to change this tax, much more resolved to get rid of his indifference on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this measure provides a degree of protection to industry does not excise all of its possible impacts. There is an alternative way of assisting industry which ensures that the prices of goods do not rise. This technique was recommended by a minority of the IAC commissioners who provided advice to the Government. It is to provide a bounty or subsidy for local production instead of a tax on imports. I readily admit that, although I mentioned that taxpayers are paying for the wheelchairs provided to the disabled free of charge, with a bounty those taxpayers will, unless we manage to get a little more efficiency into the wheelchair manufacturing industry, be paying somewhat more because the bounty would be payable not only in relation to wheelchairs which are going to those who receive them free of charge but also in relation to those wheelchairs for which people are being charged at present. So, a bounty lowers the price of a good; a tariff raises it. I believe there is a strong case to be made out for a bounty to be payable on wheelchairs to lower the price of wheelchairs rather than having this extra tariff, over and above what was payable, applied to wheelchairs so that the poor unfortunate people who are obliged to use wheelchairs have to pay an extra amount into the coffers of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Already we have bounties in Australia for the production of penicillin. The Government seems to have understood the logic in that case. Not surprisingly, Government Ministers have also understood it for agricultural tractors. Another of the Ministers now present in the House, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson), is a National Country Party Minister. He would readily remember that bounties are payable on tractors but not on wheelchairs. Why not wheelchairs? At the end of my speech, I will move an amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time, setting out the concern we have which is shared by organisations such as the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled. My amendment will also suggest the Government consider replacing tariffs with a bounty. The cost of such a scheme would be only about $250,000, since the bulk of wheelchairs are imported. Furthermore, much of this $250,000 would be offset by the reduced public cost of wheelchairs which are already provided through hospitals and the Aids for Disabled Persons Scheme. In other words, the Government could avoid this inequitable situation at very little cost at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Having indicated this particular and important objection to the Government's decision as provided by this legislation, I want to conclude with some more general remarks about industry protection policy of which this Bill is an important part. The protection debate has a very long history in Australia. One of the principal purposes for establishing the Federation of Australia was the desire to create a free trade zone or a common market among the six colonies which had been established in 1900. Since Federation the notion of free trade zones has been extended both in Australia and overseas. In Australia, the public has accepted that there are vital mutual benefits to be gained from developing trade with the various small island nations of the South Pacific. Substantially, free trade has been achieved in relation to the products of those nations through the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement. Similarly, substantial liberalisation of trade has been achieved in respect of New Zealand under the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement which may be replaced shortly with a closer economic relationship. But we have had no announcement on progress reports on that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party fully supports these developments. We are as aware as anyone of the benefits of trade. Recognition of these benefits, however, does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that Australia can maximise its well-being by throwing itself open to entirely free trade. Such a step seems to be favoured by many in the National Country Party and Liberal Party ranks. We read of their 'impertinent' and 'modest member' groups respectively. I prefer to call them economic and social illiterates. I notice that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) is sitting on the front bench in distinguished company. I gather that he is at least a visiting member of the 'modest member' group. I trust that is the case, because I am just about to send a letter to every manufacturing industry in the electorate of North Sydney to make sure that they are in no doubt of where his allegiances lie. I refer to those who are involved in that group as economic illiterates. I believe if they notice the consequences of their actions they can also be classed as social illiterates. I notice that the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) has come into the chamber. He is, of course, a much more distinguished and open member of the 'modest member' group and I certainly make that charge about him. </PARA>
<PARA> It is more instructive to consider the views of the head of the world's most important free trade zone than to consider the views of the honourable member for North Sydney or the honourable member for Mackellar when it comes to this matter. That zone is, of course, the Commission of the European Communities-that is the European Economic Community. The President of the Commission of the European Communities, Mr Gaston Thorn, visited Australia recently and among other engagements addressed the National Press Club in Canberra. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, would realise that my remarks about free trade are relevant to the Bill before us which deals with Customs tariffs. I want to quote what President Thorn said about the common agricultural policy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we do not spend money on agriculture in order to conquer foreign markets by means of subsidised exports. We do it to guarantee a reasonable standard of living for the eight million people who work on our farms. For us this is a social and political necessity. </PARA>
<PARA>President Thorn went on to explain that while unemployment in Europe exceeds 10 million, it is 'just not a realistic option' to reduce assistance to agricultural industry. He pointed out that 'all the industrialised countries protect and subsidise their farmers'. It can be seen from these remarks that there is no delusion in Europe about the need for protection of jobs in agricultural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Since Australia is one of the countries which lose export opportunities as a result of this situation-of course, what is happening in the EEC is repeated in the United States of America and Japan because of protectionist policies in those countries-where is the logic in exposing our 1.2 million manufacturing jobs to unrestricted import competition? This is not to argue against the need for restructuring, for concentrating on those things that we do well. But there are too many in the Government ranks in particular who are suggesting that there should be a blind acceptance of the nonsense in so many cases being put up to us by the Industries Assistance Commission whereby we can phase out-that is the kind of phrase-so many jobs just because they are in industries which are ' uncompetitive' or 'inefficient', without any application to the great challenge of deciding where the new jobs should be found. I am not suggesting that those new jobs are not to be found elsewhere. But what I am suggesting is that leaving it to the free market economy like the ideologues on the other side of this Parliament are doing, does not create those new jobs. In particular where is the logic in this when our balance of trade and current account is in chronic deficit and our unemployment level is the highest in post-war history?</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the average nominal tariff in Australia is only 15 per cent. Admittedly in Europe it is lower than that-it is 6 per cent. But this disparity is not as great as many, including the honourable member for Mackellar who is a great advocate for lowering tariffs across the board, would suggest. This disparity is not as great as so many who seek a drastic reduction in tariffs seem to believe and in the context of world wide restrictions on Australian exports is not, in the current circumstances, at all unreasonable. Moreover, it must also be made clear that non-tariff barriers, such as government procurement preferences, restrictive labelling and specification standards, delays in import licensing and so on, are far more significant in many overseas countries than they are in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have a free trade world. The gradual liberalisation of our trade remains a vital objective and one which must be given particular priority in relation to countries in our region. In addition, of course, the Labor Party is aware that manufacturing industry can be revitalised in Australia and can be subjected to greater import competition as a result. We are particularly aware that productivity improvements in such circumstances are essential for ultimate growth without extensive inflation. But, in accord with the findings of the Crawford inquiry, and in accord with the views of the European Communities Commission President, whom I quoted earlier, such a process must be pursued directly before employment is threatened by reduced protection, particularly at a time of high and rising unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to refer to the IAC a reference on ways of achieving a general reduction in protection is completely at variance with the sensible attitude which I assert I have just given to this House. This is no time to be considering general reductions in protection, particularly because the various industry reviews, in many cases, have only recently been completed and in some cases have yet to be implemented. A substantial degree of adjustment is already under way in the manufacturing sector. Considerably more can be expected from decisions on the motor vehicle industry, the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, and some of the decisions made in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This structural change is now occurring in a very depressed environment. Despite being a beneficiary of orders placed by the resources industries, the metal trades industry is now expecting much slower growth in 1982 than it enjoyed last year. Honourable members do not have to take my word for this. I ask them to look at the Metal Trades Industry Association report which was given at the end of last week. The report was given publicity at the weekend and in the early days of this week. This is the experience also of many other industries. For example, the chemicals industry faces a very bleak future. Despite this more depressing condition, considerable changes are being made. In 1982, 41.3 per cent of metal trades firms were engaged in company restructuring compared with 29.1 per cent in the previous year. In some sectors, such as white goods, virtually every company was involved in restructuring in 1981. I welcome the restructuring that took place in that industry. </PARA>

Together I hope we can achieve similar restructuring in other industries, but I do not believe that by just using the tariff mechanism that can be achieved. Clearly, there is little need for further cuts in protection to induce change on occasions. All of our eggs should not be put in what I call the sticks basket-the negative basket of just cutting tariffs. Cuts in protection at this time are likely to discourage investments and lead to deindustrialisation rather than to restructuring. The Opposition is firmly committed to providing manufacturing industry with a secure environment in which growth is a central objective of the change which must occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill, like the Bounty Acts Amendment Bill, about which I had something to say earlier today, is consistent with the objectives that I have outlined, but it alone is not sufficient to achieve growth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment. I wish to make some general remarks about the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. The Opposition is very concerned about the problem of wheelchairs for invalids. Actually, we were rather puzzled at the Government's behaviour in bringing in this provision during the International Year of Disabled Persons. Anyone who has talked to representatives of disabled persons groups will know that they are not happy with the Government's initiatives in this area. In a sense I believe that this further provision adds insult to injury. There is absolutely no reason for this provision. We again call on the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) to reconsider the provision on humanitarian grounds and to do something about it. We will be pressing as hard as possible for a change in these provisions as far as wheelchairs are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the remainder of the Bill, although we have in general supported tariff changes, I want to comment on the tariff philosophy of this Government. As the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) has mentioned, the Government 's tariff philosophy is really very much tied up with its general economic philosophy. The Government uses tariffs as the only form of industry policy. Anyone who knows anything about what is going on in the Government ranks will know that honourable members are very divided over this issue precisely for that reason. They do not really have a coherent industry philosophy, particularly a manufacturing industry philosophy. They simply use the tariff philosophy. Some Government members want to strengthen the tariff, some want to weaken it and others want to keep it as it is. I believe this is a totally discredited way of approaching the whole question of the manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The tariff is merely one possible means of ensuring a healthy manufacturing industry. To think that somehow by progressively reducing tariffs, through the use of the tariff and the quota, as the Industries Assistance Commission appears to think, the Government will force some kind of restructuring on the Australian manufacturing industry-increases in efficiency, the kinds of amalgamations of industry that are required and so forth-is simply nonsense. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) admitted in an in-depth article in the National Times the other day that economics is an inexact science. What we have to recognise in relation to the IAC is that it is full of economists who have a one value orientation and bias in relation to that inexact science. Their orientation and their bias lies away from protection and is an attempt to ram efficiency down the throat of Australian manufacturing industry through the use of the so-called private enterprise or free market mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that with the disastrous consequences of this kind of dogmatic approach to the market mechanism that we have seen in the United Kingdom, Europe and every day in the United States of America we would have at least learned that this mythical creature-the free market and all its supposed mechanisms that are supposed to work wonders-does not exist. If government intervention in the form of tariffs or other forms of government intervention were removed this would have been exposed as a myth by now. However, we find that the so-called experts of the IAC are wedded to that philosophy and approach . The Treasurer's remark about economics as an inexact science is proved in the bias and the economic principles which this group of economists has adopted in its recommendations. Indeed, in the various reports that it has produced, including a report about the likely state of the Australian economy in the 1990s , one can see quite clearly the presuppositions that they have. They are the presuppositions of Friedmanite economics, which we totally reject. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot hope to restructure industry simply by adjusting tariffs. One must have a policy which uses the tariff as one means in an overall strategy to change the face of manufacturing industry. No one doubts that such changes are urgently needed at present. Although the Government pretends that it is protecting manufacturing industry, it is gradually being run down. Although some members on the Government side are holding the line to some degree in relation to tariffs and quotas, the fact is that we are seeing a progressive rundown of protection and, at the same time, we are seeing no positive policy to restructure industry or to help it develop. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague suggests, that is clear and correct, and anyone who represents an electorate in which manufacturing industry plays a primary role will know that that is true. We have, therefore, a situation in which we need a much more comprehensive and positive approach. Whenever we suggest to honourable members opposite such a positive approach on manufacturing industry, what do they do? They rave about government intervention. They talk about intervention as though it is something weird and monstrous. The fact is that intervention involves a rational planning process with respect to manufacturing industry. This kind of process is absolutely essential if we are to get anywhere with the development of manufacturing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me point out to honourable members opposite what the alternative is if we run down our manufacturing industries. Unemployment will go through the roof. It is already disastrous. It will reach shocking proportions if manufacturing industry continues to be run down. This does not mean that we shall protect every and any industry whether or not it is efficient. Of course not. We need restructuring in industry, but we need that restructuring to be done in a planned and guided fashion, and to ensure that workers in industries which are not sufficiently efficient will be moved into new industries in which they will be able to use their skills or be retained in new skills, so that we can continue apace of employment in manufacturing industry. We have heard nothing from the Government in relation to these matters. We have only heard about the great debate in the Liberal Party between those who maintain that we should reduce tariffs and those who maintain that we should keep tariffs at their present level. These two are pseudo alternatives. We need something extra. We need considerably more extra. We need to think in terms of a planning policy in which protection has an important role. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say something about what that role would be in a coherent manufacturing policy. We need something other than protection being given to companies without any conditions, without any strings attached, so to speak, as is the case with the present Government. After a big debate in its party room, it decides to give a certain level of protection and it gives that level without any conditions being set. What we would do as a government is insist on new and efficient methods in those industries. We would make protection conditional on restructuring, on steps towards restructuring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We certainly did not wipe out any industry in the way in which this Government has done. This Government has wiped out manufacturing industries in the last five years under the pretence that it is still protecting them. This Government has been taking a totally dishonest approach to the whole matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Protection can be used as an effective weapon. I agree with those who say that protection should not be entirely free. It should be earned by companies. They should be required to show that they are taking steps to be more efficient, that they are restructuring, that they are introducing new levels of technology, and that they are investing in new modes of production. But all that is not happening now under current policies. All we are getting is, from time to time, tariff proposals put before the House-some to reduce tariffs and some to increase them-but we are not getting in any way a coherent manufacturing policy. This is just one aspect of the Government's general incoherence in relation to its economic policy. The nonsense that has been spouted by the Treasurer in the last few days indicates he has not learned a thing from the Lowe by-election. He has not yet recognised, even, that there is an economic crisis in this nation and that part of that crisis is in manufacturing industry. He has learned none of the lessons. He is trying to tell us, as he did last week, that everything is roses. It is a totally dishonest approach. He obviously does not even read the newspapers. We have heard nothing from the Minister for Industry and Commerce ( Sir Phillip Lynch) about what will happen to manufacturing industry, except the policy on the car industry which came out recently and which will be a disaster for that industry. There are no proposals to help those who will lose their jobs in the car industry by creating new jobs in other areas of manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that we used a great deal more rational planning in our approach to the whole economic system, in particular to manufacturing industry. Here the tariff can be a very important weapon. It can be very positive in protecting our industries, and that will have to continue for some time-not unqualified protection, but protection which is coupled with a principle that we want movement towards greater efficiency, that we want to encourage investment in new machinery, and that we want to be able to be internationally competitive in these industries. The idea that simply by reducing tariffs one can make industries internationally competitive has been rejected all over the world. The reason why many Australian manufacturing industries are not competitive has to do with fundamental planning and structural factors about the origin of those manufacturing industries and has very little to do with the whole question of whether one reduces tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> While we support the Bill in general, we call on the Government to produce a coherent strategy on manufacturing industry and on the question of protection, and we shall not be put aside by the fact that the Government constantly leaks stories to the newspapers about fights in the Liberal Party. It is about time that the Government decided on a policy, and brought it before the House, on the question of protection and tariffs as a whole. Secondly, we oppose the provision in the Bill in relation to wheelchairs and urge the House to support the Opposition's amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I continue the remarks that I commenced last evening. Because of the time constraints applying then and now, I have only limited time in which to make one point which I have been anxious to develop. That is the difficulty of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, operating in the very creative field of broadcasting and production for the benefits of Australia, being subject to the dead hand of the Public Service Board. The Dix report of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission addressed its mind to that factor and talked about a new management structure. I made the point last evening, as one who was closely associated with the creation of the commissions now administering Telecom Australia and the postal services, that it is very important to break away from this dreadful problem of public service domination of wages and terms and conditions of employment. In other words, if one is in the creative aspect of production of material, particularly for broadcasting or film, one needs to have people who do not have that sort of weight on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am in support of what the ABC Staffs Association said when it appeared before the Dix Committee. The proposition was put forward: Why not do something such as the British Broadcasting Commission charter provides? It has the right to fix its own remuneration and terms and conditions of employment. That is fair enough . But, in looking at the tragic record of the Australian Broadcasting Commission , we see that, despite the fact that there might have been legislative encouragement to say that it had some autonomy, in fact it did not. I think it is important to realise that the Dix Committee also recognised that in the structure of management we need to have as commissioners, in my view, at least one staff member from the technical side and one from the production side. They are the real genus of the ABC's activities. It is not much good surrounding the ABC with a whole lot of well-meaning people who are not involved in the day-to- day difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make the point again: The Public Service Board has a very sad record in industrial relations. In fact, it seems to have a vested interest in strikes or stoppages. If one looks at the Professional Radio Employees Institute of Australasia dispute, which stopped the whole airline industry in Australia, and one then notes the indictment of the Public Service Board by the arbiter appointed by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, one can almost accept that it was determined to guarantee that the officers of the PREI were not going to get wage justice. This is the point that I was trying to develop last evening. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members look at the Dix report, they will see the analysis that, whilst the staff is certainly of some mixture, 60 per cent are program-related. The Dix Committee makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore the ABC as a broadcaster should be aligned with other broadcasters.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the point of what we are about. We then come to the question of what happened in this Parliament in 1976. The late Eric Robinson introduced legislation to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act. In the course of his speech on that he indicated that it would enable the Commission to have:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . greater flexibility in its staffing arrangements. In future-</PARA>
<PARA>Said the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>creation or reclassification of positions within the Commission, and the determination of salaries or salary ranges, will no longer require the approval of the Public Service Board . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Now, what a myth that was. That was a statement made by the Minister in November 1976. It must astound the Parliament to find that, on 1 December 1976, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wrote a letter to the same Minister saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Following the decision last night to allow the Broadcasting and Television . . . Amendment Bill to proceed in its present form, I think it is highly desirable that the ABC fully understand the Government's position on the question of co- ordination of pay and conditions of staff throughout the Commonwealth sector, which passage of the Bill will not in any way alter. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words the Commission will now still be obliged to do whatever the Public Service Board indicates. As the Staffs Association submission says, from then on the General Manager of the ABC just did whatever he was told to do by the Public Service Board. It created frustration and all the problems that anyone associated with statutory corporations experiences in trying to compete, if I may use that word, with the private sector when dealing with the public and also in getting the most talented people. It did nothing for the benefit of the ABC. The rigidity of the Public Service Board is notorious. </PARA>
<PARA> I have led up to this argument. There was a long case to assist the engineers in the ABC. They had some parity some time ago with those who were called the operating officers. The operating officers had gone ahead of the engineers because the Public Service Board, for some reason or other, determined their salaries in a fashion that left the engineers behind. It is deemed that the engineers were left behind because of the wage indexation position. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, after a long case which was completed last year, in October, Mr Booth, the Public Service Arbitrator, gave some form of justice back to the engineers and increased their salary to bring them up to some form of parity. They received about an 18 per cent increase in salary. In fact they needed a 32 per cent rise to get them back to where they were in 1974. Now, because of the metal trades decision that was made in December of last year, I might add, not October, further offers of salary increases will be made by the Public Service Board. It has in fact offered increases to the operating officers. That is fine. They are entitled to it. But, in the process, the Board will deny any further increase to the engineers, which again creates disparity and guarantees that the Commission will face difficulty in being able to function effectively. I make very clear the fact that 70 per cent of program faults are technical ones. Since colour television was introduced in 1974 no routine maintenance has been carried out in this area. There are only 411 engineers now as against a staff requirement of over 700. In the last six weeks, eight have left. Who would want to stay in an organisation where one cannot even get salary justice?</PARA>
<PARA> When the ABC wrote to the Department of Industrial Relations and asked: 'Can we not give an increase to the engineers?' the answer from the Department of Industrial Relations was: 'No, you cannot.' What does it mean if the Act says one thing and the Department of Industrial Relations says: 'No, you are not going to do that'? Does the Government really want the ABC to function in this form? The answer is that it certainly does not. Does it want to give wage justice to people who have the skills, training and expertise to do it? It certainly does not. Why is it that the dead hand is still applying to the ABC? It is about time the responsible Minister urgently intervened in this case, as of tomorrow, and asked that these people be given the same salary justice as the others are getting. He should tell the Public Service Board and the Department to operate effectively in this field. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is the most comprehensive review of the ABC that has ever been undertaken. Over the years a number of inquiries have been held into the operations of the ABC. I suppose in many respects it was prudent that this particular inquiry took place at the end of 50 years of operation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It is a most extensive report and it is very comprehensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is any one criticism of it-I do not lay blame on the Committee itself- it would be this: At this time in the development of the electronic media in Australia, perhaps something even more than just this inquiry into the ABC should have been undertaken. I believe we have reached the stage where we are on the verge of many new technological developments and where there will be major changes in the structure of broadcasting and telecasting in Australia in the coming years. At this stage Australia does not really realise exactly where it is in terms of that development. I suppose after those millions of dollars and all those hours that were spent on the inquiry it is a little late for me to come in here and say that even more work should be done on the future of the media in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the situation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) specialised in his speech in one particular area of the ABC's operation. I suppose that is fair enough, because the Dix Committee report is an incredible document. It is certainly one of the biggest reports that I have seen on any statutory body in Australia. In the few brief minutes that I have available to me, I too would like to touch on some of those aspects of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose most of the publicity that has been gained for this report falls into two areas. They concern the name change of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the establishment of a national broadcasting organisation and, indeed, the right of the ABC to accept commercial sponsorship for its programming in the future. In terms of the name change for the ABC, I suppose we could argue that it is desirable to have established a national broadcasting organisation. I would agree with the Dix report that the Australian public knows , recognises and respects the ABC as its national broadcasting organisation. In this respect obviously the name 'Australian Broadcasting Commission' must stay. Although, as I say, we might be able to argue to widen the horizon of the national broadcasting organisation, I do not think we should forget the respect that has built up over the 50 years of the ABC's existence in Australia. I suppose if we do want to widen the scope of the Commission, if we do want to change the commissioner structure of the ABC, if we want to separate particular aspects of the ABC's present operations and, for instance, establish a separate authority for the orchestras and a separate authority for education, a case for doing that too can be argued. But basically I believe that the charter and aims of the ABC should remain as they are. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of commercial sponsorship provisions that have been recommended by the Dix Committee to the ABC, I am afraid I am really in two minds. If we examine what has happened in overseas commercial sponsorship of public broadcasting organisations, I think we can probably understand that attitude. It is true that the Australian Broadcasting Commission at the moment does undertake a number of joint productions. The ABC has gone into partnership with overseas broadcasting corporations and, indeed, some private organisations in the production of programs. That has worked very well. From a close examination of what has happened in the United States of America in commercial sponsorship of public broadcasting, I think we probably do have room to be fearful of what could happen to the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Dix is perfectly right inasmuch as he argues that if we were to open the ABC to some corporate sponsorship it would not mean that every 13 minutes there would be a commercial break of 90 seconds plugging everything from cornflakes to new motor cars. That would not be the situation at all. But it would mean that substantial sums of money could be poured into that organisation for the production of television programs. I know the friends of the ABC and a number of private citizens have brought to the fore their fear that the very independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission could be brought into question if that situation were allowed to exist; that if an organisation such as, say, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Limited were prepared to lend or give substantial sums of money to the ABC for commercial productions, BHP or similar organisations could be subjected to major criticism in future programs and in fact an analysis in the current affairs area of the Australian Broadcasting Commission could even be left out because of that criticism. That may or may not happen but the risk is always there. I think it would be very dangerous for this Parliament to give an open cheque to the ABC to start taking commercial sponsorship for its programs unless we do have a complete guideline as to exactly how that commercial sponsorship will operate and exactly what might be involved in allowing that corporate sponsorship to come to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that not one person in this House would like to think that the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission might be subjected to these sorts of commercial pressures if such sponsorship were undertaken. I do not really think that the commercial sponsorship of the Commission would be the panacea for all its ills. It is true that over the years the ABC has been subjected to financial cuts by the Government. Perhaps that is fair enough. But I think if we analyse just where those cuts have happened, how the ABC management has adopted those cost-cutting measures, we will see that perhaps all is not well in the state of Denmark in terms of the ABC's operations at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that other honourable members who are sitting in the House tonight could cite examples of just what has happened in the ABC. I think one of the classic cases occurred in Brisbane, when the cuts were first made and everybody from the gardener to the security officers were immediately fired. The ABC then went out and hired a private security firm for a weekend during which it was undertaking a major pop concert promotion on its station. I understand that the cost of providing that private security service just for that weekend amounted to more than the total wages of the gardener, the concierge and the security people in the ABC for a full 12 months. This illustrates the calibre of some of the decisions that were made within the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn my mind back to those very early days when I first entered this Parliament in 1976. If any honourable member were to examine my maiden speech he would see that I mentioned the Australian Broadcasting Commission in that speech and reminded the House of the very grave difficulties that the Commission faced in its management structure and the calibre of its middle management as long ago as that. Dix has confirmed exactly what I said in those days. In fact, the classic quote from his report is when he describes the management of the ABC as the mediocre directing the activities of the mediocre. That is probably right. I think in many ways the ABC management structure is a bit like Topsy, it just growed. Incompetence has developed within the ABC management structure. In some areas of the ABC we have almost a degree of nepotism and many of the decisions which have been made, especially over the last 10 or 15 years, have not been good decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I thoroughly agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when he says that if we are to clean out the whole structure of the ABC the first thing we should do is to look at getting it away from the Public Service Board structure. How a creative organisation such as the ABC, a broadcasting organisation that can, in theory, be the finest of its kind in the world, can operate under the present circumstances frankly is beyond me. The fact that that Public Service structure is there, the fact that creative personnel are restricted by that structure, can really mean only that the ABC can never reach its true potential. I am sure that we are all aware of very talented people who have gone into the ABC and I guess in many respects have served their apprenticeships there, but then have gone on to the commercial organisations or have left the whole industry completely and utterly disillusioned and gone into another industry altogether. It is essential that we get that Public Service Board restriction completely away from the organisation and that we give the ABC management the right to hire and fire its staff in order to get rid of the incompetence, to start getting a proper management structure there, to get rid of the nepotism. Let us get the thing down to a finely honed organisation that can start producing some of those programs which we know the ABC is particularly capable of producing. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the Dix report that is of particular interest to me is the fact that Dix stated in the report that there must be a complete revision of the accounting structure of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. On reading that, I was interested to note that he came up with certain suggestions and applied most of his recommendations to the physical cost of ABC programming. But if we are to restructure that financial system we will probably have to go a little further than that. I am sure I am not the only member of this House who realises some of the very great difficulties which have existed within the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Because of the 13 1/2 years I spent in the media I have a very close relationship with many members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I saw successive Ministers about a situation that developed in my home State of Queensland, a situation which was commonly referred to as the Hunt case. It went through the courts about 18 months or two years ago. I believe that to a great extent this whole matter was given a certain amount of whitewash . It had to do with the letting of contracts; it had to do with the appointment of staff; it had to do with the claiming of expenditure. I am sure that the results of that left many people within the organisation not particularly happy with what went on at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that sort of doubt about the physical day to day management of the ABC that must make a great number of us worry about what is happening within that organisation. It must make us pose the questions of whether the ABC structure is completely and utterly rotten as it exists now. Whether management personnel were getting kitchens and extensions put on to their homes, whether carpets were being borrowed from prop areas to be put in certain homes, whether the sons of certain staff members were being hired by the Commission I suppose was for the court to find out. We all know the result of that. But that really indicates the way in which the ABC has been allowed to develop under the present system. I believe that is really what Dix should be all about. I believe that the whole organisation should be completely and utterly cleaned out. Frankly, I believe that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is almost at a stage where we have to start again. If we can start again, if we can get that structure right, if we can get the staffing right, I believe that we will have one of the finest broadcasting organisations in the world. The ABC has proved over the years that it is capable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members might recall the issue which I raised last night but on which I was unable to conclude my remarks because the debate was interrupted. I wish briefly to raise the matter again in relation to the issue of passports by passport offices in Australia. If a married person wishes to travel overseas the issue of a passport is contingent upon that person having the passport application endorsed by his or her spouse, or if the couple are separated, upon the applicant signing a statutory declaration stating that he or she does not have any financial obligations to his or her former spouse. There is no provision on that statutory declaration for the applicant to declare a financial obligation to children of that former marriage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have confirmed with the passport offices at Sydney and Canberra that the position that I have set out is correct. However, when speaking with a senior officer for the policy division of the Department of Foreign Affairs I was informed that the opposite applied, that is, that the statement on financial obligations to a former spouse also included maintenance obligations paid in accordance with a court award to the former spouse on behalf of their children. I have a specific case in my electorate involving a lady who came to my office and complained to me that her husband had received a passport from the Sydney passport office to travel overseas. He had signed a statutory declaration stating that he had no financial obligations to her as the former spouse. But he omitted to say that he did have financial obligations towards two children of their former marriage. A Family Court order does exist for maintenance to be paid by that husband to those two children through the former spouse, that is, through the former wife. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the matter needs to be clarified. This gentleman may have made a false declaration. The Department needs to clarify the situation by altering the wording on the forms that are offered to people who apply for passports. I would like the matter to be referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). I ask him to clarify the discrepancy between the view of the Department and the passport offices and to give clear directions to the Department's policy division and the passport offices on the interpretation of the statutory declaration forms. I would like him to advise me whether as a result of these investigations and clarifications the person who signed the statutory declaration has indeed falsified a statutory declaration form. </PARA>
<PARA> This is only one case that has come to my attention. Obviously this happens hundreds or even thousands of times every year through the passport offices in Australia. In fact, I can recall that some years ago when I intended travelling overseas I certainly had to get the authority of my wife on the form before the passport would be issued, and I think that is correct and proper. If, however, the marriage has broken up and there is a legal separation surely the situation should prevail in which the applicant has to complete a statutory declaration not only to the effect that there are no financial obligations to the former spouse but also that he has no financial obligations to children of that marriage, particularly when those financial obligations are the result of a decision of the Family Court or indeed of any of the courts of the States of this land. I would like that clarification from the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been prompted to speak in the adjournment debate because of a telex I have which indicates that it is not uncommon for bulk carriers to remain for four or even five months off New South Wales coal loading ports before they are loaded. For example, ships that came in in November 1981 are only now being loaded. They face demurrage charges of about $ 10,000 a day and sometimes higher. I know of one case in which a company now faces demurrage costs which are higher than the actual value of the coal cargo that was taken out. This is not the only problem with the coal industry. I think many people in Australia believe that the coal industry is booming, that it is a major resource development. But the reality is that it is facing very serious difficulties indeed. It is showing declining investment. It is showing deferral and perhaps termination of projects. It is facing huge wage rises, uncertain markets and seriously reduced profits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year 60 per cent of New South Wales coal companies either made a loss or a very small profit. The biggest problems are associated with industrial disputes, shipping delays, wages, declining productivity and State and Commonwealth tax takes from the industry. Let us look at some of the imposts on the industry in New South Wales in recent years. Rail freights have gone up by 80 per cent in two years, the last rise being 25 per cent in one hit. Port loading charges went up by 47 per cent in the last year. Royalties in New South Wales have gone up by 800 per cent over the last 10 years. Super royalties are being introduced on coal by the New South Wales Government, to my knowledge for the first time in this country. In addition, the New South Wales Government has moved to take over private coal rights without any guarantee of adequate compensation for the owners. Let us have a look at the situation in New South Wales vis-a-vis Queensland. The Joint Coal Board figures that were released some weeks ago showed that for the 1981 year New South Wales coal exports increased by 1.3 per cent whereas Queensland's exports increased by 39 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Queensland's exports increased by 39 per cent. If I may turn to the coal industry in Queensland, it also has been hit very hard by other imposts from governments. Front-end payments of many millions of dollars for infrastructure, royalties and rail freight charges have imposed a tremendous disability and liability on coal companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I invite honourable members to look at the wage increases in this industry. I have to return to the position in New South Wales where the responsible Minister offered and agreed to an award increase of $63 a week to the combined coal mining unions. That was the highest bid that the unions looked for. It is my understanding that they would have been very happy with a much lower wage increase. To the coal companies it represents an increase of more than $120 a week when overtime, shift allowances and penalty rates are included. The average wage for miners on the South Coast is in excess of $800 a week to which has to be added 28 per cent to allow the companies to pay pay roll tax, compensation insurance, facilities and all the rest of it. The Federal Government has moved to impose an extra levy of $1 on exports and this is at a time when the industry can ill afford to meet that impost. In fact, the $10m that is budgeted for as a result of the export levy will not be achieved by the Federal Government this year because of lower production levels and because of shipping delays. </PARA>
<PARA> The coal industry is the largest industry in Australia. It is helping to maintain Australia's balance of payments. It is worth about $2 billion. Last year it was worth $1.6 billion. However, the industry now faces huge cost pressures and market uncertainties. In addition, unionists must realise that they are pushing their own self-destruct button because strikes and excessive pay demands are not only jeopardising the Australian industry but also their own jobs as buyers of Australian coal will continue to look to other countries for more reliable suppliers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very touched, listening to the remarks of the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie), and I know that the miners in Lithgow whom he represents will be very interested to hear his remarks. This evening I want to refer to the enormous groundswell of concern and resentment among age pensioners as a result of a number of ill-considered and provocative statements by a number of Ministers over the last seven months. Those statements quite deservedly have led to a wave of bad publicity for this Government. I guess that the Sunday Telegraph of 6 September last year was a fair sample when it ran the headline of 'Pension Blitz: Crackdown on old folks' life savings'. The lead paragraph stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government this week plans launching an all out-blitz on pensioner' s savings. </PARA>
<PARA>These statements, while they lead to a public relations disaster for the Government, still fall neatly into the same pattern that has been used by this Government habitually when it has been planning to introduce an unpopular measure. The process has been to fly a kite for a while, test the wind, back off for a while, repeat the process and then finally move in for the kill. The whole process began in August 1981 when the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) representing the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) said:</PARA>
<PARA> It has become evident that there is a growing practice of avoiding income for pension purposes, or even more commonly for pensioner fringe benefits. There is no essential difference, so far as the general community effect is concerned, between this and tax avoidance. It is, quite simply, the welfare face of the income rigging coin. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall therefore be moving during the Budget session of Parliament to tighten up the relevant legislation to prevent income avoidance for pension purposes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing happened. A follow-up statement from the Government suggested that it might have its proposals ready for March but, instead of legislation, pensioners were treated to a tirade of abuse from the Minister for Industry and Commerce ( Sir Phillip Lynch), a person who appears to delight in scaring old people. The latest headlines have again suggested that the Government may be backing off before moving in for the kill. The Sunday Telegraph of last Sunday carries the headline 'Fraser Backs Off Pension Blitz'. The article begins:</PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government is to defer its crackdown on schemes used by rich people to get the pension. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is part of the process of flying the kite, then backing off and finally moving in. As the Opposition has said, the fact that pensioners are living longer ought to be a source of national pride. It ought to lead to Government action to provide our senior citizens with security and comfort in their old age. Instead, the scrooges in this Government prefer to talk of blitzes, crack-downs and millionaire pensioners. To listen to these scrooges one would think that pensioners are living off the fat of the land. In fact, the reverse is true. When the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) won government in 1975 on the promise that the real value of pensions would be preserved, the pension stood at 23.2 per cent of average weekly earnings. Now, its value is down to about 21.6 per cent of average weekly earnings and, unless the tax threshold is raised, an increasing number of pensioners will pay tax on their social security benefit and other income as inflation continues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this week we read reports in the Press of statements made by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots expressing concern at the operations of cross charter arrangements between Qantas Airways Ltd, Australia's international airline, and other international airlines. It was probably timely that this particular situation was brought to the attention of Australia, especially in light of the fact that the international civil aviation policy review which was promised last year did not happen, especially in fact that there has been, to their credit, some loosening up of the operations of Qantas, Australia's international airline. Certain information has come to me concerning some of the concerns of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation that evolved concerned arrangements between Qantas and the Indonesian international airline, Garuda Indonesian Airways, on cross charter operations between Denpasar in Bali and Darwin and between Denpasar and Port Hedland in Western Australia. I think it only right that I bring to the attention of the House the arrangements that have been made in those cases and indeed to the one particular situation that evolved. The incident happened on 17 January 1982 and concerned the flight plan for the Garuda operation from Denpasar in Bali to Darwin on the QF/GA joint flight on that day. The aircraft arrived in Darwin's control zone at a distance of 45 miles from the point of touchdown. In fact it called up on VHF at 45 miles and at that stage had in fact penetrated controlled air space by about 60 miles. In other words, other aircraft in that area were not made aware of the presence of the Garuda flight and opposite direction traffic could, I suppose, theoretically have been placed on a collision course. </PARA>
<PARA> The meteorological conditions for Darwin on that day required 60 minutes of holding fuel for thunder-storms and low clouds and with normal minimum fuel the endurance for the aircraft would have been about 268 minutes. On examination of the flight plan-I have a copy of that flight plan-it was revealed that the endurance was in fact 233 minutes. Indeed, it has been reported on very good authority from the Department of Transport people in Darwin that that DC9 aircraft arrived in Darwin with only about six minutes of fuel remaining. That is a very serious operation indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Denpasar-Port Hedland operation, perhaps it is even more frightening because the aircraft used on that route is an F28, also on cross- charter to Qantas. That aircraft operating between Port Hedland and Bali frankly , to my knowledge, does not meet our Australian safety standards. For example, that particular F28 aircraft does not have a ditching certificate, does not carry life rafts and has only basic flight instrumentation. I suppose part of the problem is the fact that Garuda is not a carrier recognised by the International Air Transport Association. Further reports-these have yet to be confirmed-indicate that certain passengers have boarded their DC9 aircraft and have been allocated seats without seat belts. Indeed, it has been brought to my attention that in another case a person sat in a seat on that flight and not only were there seats without seat belts or buckles but also seat belts that were in existence had to be tied in a knot in front of the passenger. This was the required safety standard. Obviously, when we enjoy one of the greatest safety standards in civil aviation in the world, we should express concern at this sort of situation if it is developing. This is at a time when Trans Australia Airlines is technically bankrupt and Ansett Airlines of Australia is complaining that the traffic has declined in Australia. Why should our national carrier make arrangements with other foreign carriers in a situation such as this when TAA has excess DC9 capacity and is not filling it to the utmost and when Airlines of Western Australia have F28s fully available for that operation? Why should we go to a foreign carrier and undertake cross charter arrangements from those carriers? I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). Thank goodness a major investigation of this situation is being undertaken by his Department and, indeed, Qantas. We cannot afford for a moment to let Australia's air safety record be impinged upon. Nor can we afford to relax our vigilance while the present situation remains. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer tonight to the subject of housing and to the many thousands of Australians who are struggling either to purchase a home, or to continue to live in one that they have bought in the last few years. In the course of that struggle they are finding it extremely difficult, because of soaring interest rates, to keep up their repayments. As we all know, interest rates are at the highest level in this country's history and likely to rise even further. The Fraser Government's total mismanagement of the economy, in regard to taxation and housing especially, is an absolute disgrace. If the economy continues to be managed in this way one needs little imagination to see Australia heading towards bankruptcy. That could well happen unless something is done to reverse the draconian policies that the Government has pursued for six years and is continuing to pursue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to quote a letter from a constituent in Seaford, in the southern part of my electorate of Isaacs, because it typifies the position of so many thousands of Australians. The writer, after introducing herself, says:</PARA>
<PARA> We are a young couple who have only moved into our first home in July. We were so proud that we had finally made it . . . We had not even paid our first payment on our dream home when the news came through on the interest rate increase-another $21 a month over one year a nice penny, over 25 years, enough to make us cry. Everything is going up and our dream of a house and a family is being shattered, really shattered. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>From this letter it sounds like we have driven ourselves into a corner and gone in over our heads with debts. No we haven't. We bought an average three bedroom home, we pondered and mused before doing so, really throwing around our finances and worked on the figures. Yes, we could cope. Then came Medibank increases, electrical, gas, rates, food, clothes, everything has gone up since then and there is talk of interest rates going up again. We are honest and hard working people, but the way things are going my husband will have to get a second job. As for starting a family, we just simply couldn't afford it. We are becoming increasingly more disillusioned and bitter in the way the little person has to pay for everything. I have written to the Treasurer and Housing Minister and all I have received back was a letter, so patronising and offering absolutely no real answers. We need answers and something to look into the future for, some hope, because frankly life looks pretty miserable for us and many other people in the same position as us. </PARA>
<PARA>That typifies the situation of so many Australians. Once again I ask the Government to revise its economic policies, in regard to housing and interest rates especially, because they are crippling many people, particularly those who are least able to afford it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the House once again to a serious problem affecting my electorate and various other electorates in New South Wales. It was referred to earlier by the honourable member for Calare (Mr McKenzie). It relates to bottlenecks in coal shipping which have been causing absolute disaster to both the profitability of the New South Wales coal industry and the earnings of coal miners generally. The honourable member for Calare quite properly pointed out the enormous delays in the shipping of coal and mentioned some that were of up to five months duration. As I understand it, delays of four months are very common. I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that today it was announced that exports scheduled from Newcastle, Port Kembla and Balmain next month have in fact been totally abandoned by the coal companies. They are unable to get their ships into the loaders as a result of continual disruption. Another factor is the failure of the New South Wales Government to complete even one major addition to the coal loading capacity of the State since it came into office almost six years ago. It has cancelled the building of the proposed Botany Bay coal loader and produced a situation in which very little additional capacity for export exists in New South Wales. The monumental disruption that is caused at coal loading points by unions which in many instances are closely associated with the Communist Party of Australia has resulted in a disastrous pile-up of ships, particularly outside Newcastle but also off Port Kembla and Balmain. The cancellation means that earnings from the contractual exportation of about two and a quarter million tonnes of coal, worth some $120m, have been lost to this country because of an incapacity to export if from New South Wales ports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is an incredible situation. It is all the more incredible when it is recognised that last year in Queensland, for example, according to a recent Joint Coal Board report, the volume of exports increased by some 39 per cent, whereas New South Wales exports increased by a little over one per cent. There is an evident difference between the approach of the New South Wales Government and that of the Queensland Government to the question of getting the product to the market place. Apparently there is a commitment in Queensland to meet contractual obligations and allow the coal mining industry to earn profits so that those who work in the mines can share in them. In New South Wales the failure to provide facilities and, in fact, the actual restraints imposed on coal mines-as in my electorate, where the New South Wales Government refuses to allow the transport of coal by road to the new coal loader, which is not yet open; we keep waiting in hope, requiring that it be taken entirely by rail-will impose an immense cost burden on the industry and bring about the closure of some mines. There were reports in my electorate today that two mines were scheduled for closure. I am glad that the coal company involved has said that at this stage it is not its immediate intention to close them, but there is no doubt--</PARA>

It is about time the New South Wales Government did something positive to correct this disaster, which today is being evidenced by the cancellation of one whole month's shipment of coal.

To illustrate my point I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter sent by the Council of the City of Preston to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) and a letter from the Council of the Shire of Whittlesea to me on the subject.

<PARA>CANBERRA, ACT 2600. </PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> Council, at its meeting held on 15th February 1982, considered with concern correspondence received from your Regional Director advising that officers of your Department will no longer be provided to assist at Australian Citizenship Ceremonies which are conducted by this Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Following consideration of the matter, Council resolved to object to the decision and advise you that this Council will not hold any further Ceremonies unless officers of your Department are in attendance. </PARA>
<PARA> Council reluctantly made this decision in light of the following-</PARA>
<PARA> The Ceremonies are held in accordance with a Commonwealth Act of Parliament and are, therefore, a Commonwealth responsibility. Local government merely assists the Department in presiding over the Ceremony and providing civic buildings and refreshments etecetra. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of your Department to withdraw from Municipal Ceremonies appears in conflict with the Government's announcement made on 6th November 1981, to examine ways of enhancing Citizenship and increase awareness of its significance . </PARA>
<PARA> This Council, as is the practice with many others, goes to considerable length and, I might add, expense, to make the Municipal Ceremony as meaningful as is possible. For example, at Preston, a number of distinguished guests and the Municipal Band are present; there is a presentation of native trees and an Information Folder; and at the conclusion of the evening, a light supper is provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The attendance of Departmental officers is important as they are able to identify the Candidates taking the Oath or Affirmation and provide considerable assistance in the smooth running of the evening. </PARA>
<PARA> The attendance of Departmental officers also ensures that any queries raised by Candidates are able to be answered on the evening. It is certainly much better to deal with problems on the evening than have to refer matters back to your Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Council has also directed that its concern over this matter be communicated to its Parliamentary representatives and to the Municipal Association of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Council looks forward to your advice that the decision will be changed. </PARA>

<PARA>Thomastown, Vic. 3140. </PARA>
<PARA>Dear Dr Jenkins,</PARA>
<PARA> Council at its meeting on 22 February 1982, discussed the matter of the holding of ceremonies for the conferring of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA> You may be aware that Council conducts, on average, three Australian Citizenship Ceremonies per year with approximately 150 persons being conferred with Australian Citizenship at each ceremony. Over the many years that Council has been conducting these ceremonies, thousands of residents of this municipality have been conferred with Australian Citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA> Council is aware of and agrees with the great importance placed on the reception of Citizenship and is only too willing to assist the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in making the Citizenship conferral ceremony a memorable occasion for new citizens; however, Council is concerned at the increasing demands being placed on staff as a result of the conducting of these ceremonies and at the lack of assistance provided by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> You will be aware that over the years, Council has sought assistance from the Department in providing officers to help in the conduct of the ceremonies, however, little or no positive response has been received. (It should perhaps be pointed out that Council is well aware of the assistance provided by the Department in the processing of applications, forwarding of details to prospective citizens, etc.)</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated, Council is well aware of the importance of these ceremonies and has always been willing to provide a suitable venue, etc., for these ceremonies; however, Council's over-riding concern is the fact that more and more emphasis is being placed on Council staff to conduct and arrange various aspects of the ceremony without the assistance of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated, previous requests for assistance have proved fruitless and Council has directed that I again seek your assistance in bringing appropriate pressure to bear, at the Federal level, on the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to ensure that Council is assisted in every way possible in the conduct of Citizenship Ceremonies, including, where necessary, the provision of personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> Any assistance you may be able to provide in this regard would be most appreciated. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr Street</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) My attention has been drawn to a document entitled Japan's Independent National Defence and Its Potential which was referred to in the Japanese Diet on 30 March 1981 by Mr Tetsu Noda, a member of the opposition Socialist Party. Mr Noda said in the Diet that no mention is made in the document of where it was prepared. He also said that it must have been prepared by the Japanese Government, about ten years ago. Government representatives from the Japan Defence Agency denied in the Diet any knowledge of the report and also denied that the Defence Agency has ever conducted research on the development of nuclear weapons or on delivery systems for nuclear warheads.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The document includes a statement that, if the operation of the Tokai-1 nuclear power station at the Tokai plant of the Japan Atomic Power Company were to be converted to producing plutonium for military purposes, the annual production of plutonium would amount to about 240 kilograms. The document includes a further statement that such a level of production would permit the manufacture of about 20 nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA> The Tokai-1 nuclear power reactor has been subject to IAEA safeguards since September 1967. Since December 1977 the safeguards arrangements have derived from an IAEA safeguards agreement (IAEA document INFCIRC/255) covering all peaceful nuclear activities in Japan. This agreement was concluded pursuant to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which Japan ratified in June 1976. Japan's ratification of the NPT means that it accepted a legally binding commitment not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Japan's NPT-safeguards agreement with the IAEA provides for verification that nuclear material in Japan's nuclear industry is not diverted to non-peaceful or explosive purposes. Moreover any significant change in the operating method of the Tokai-1 nuclear power reactor would be reported by IAEA nuclear safeguards inspectors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has not authorised any study of a uranium enrichment plant to be built in America.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV4">Mr Hodgman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the honourable member to the general reply to Question No. 458 which appeared in the weekly Hansard of 10 June 1981, but would add the following comments:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Special arrangements were made by the Department of the Capital Territory in 1981 to assist disabled people, including the setting up of an IYDP Secretariat for the Australian Capital Territory. The Secretariat was staffed by officers of my Department and carried out a range of functions including the servicing of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Committee for IYDP appointed by my predecessor in mid 1980, advising voluntary organisations in the matter of IYDP project funding, and the taking of measures to promote the 'Year' generally throughout the local community.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) With regard to employment of disabled people, there was more than 100 per cent increase in the number of disabled people absorbed into the Australian Capital Territory work force in 1981 compared with figures for the previous year , results which can be attributed in no small degree to the thrust provided by the Australian Capital Territory's spokesman for the campaign, IYDP Advisory Committee Chairman, George Colman.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of the Capital Territory worked closely with the Public Service Board on employment for disabled people and currently is involved in a pilot study which could be extended to other parts of the Service.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) Improved access for disabled persons to Departmental premises and to facilities in Canberra generally is a matter of some concern to my Department. The Department of Housing and Construction's access program has included an extensive survey of government offices in Canberra which has received my Department's full support. That work is ongoing.</PARA>
<PARA> A range of projects undertaken by my Department in 1981 to mark IYDP included large scale modifications to government-owned homes occupied by disabled tenants , the construction of special gardens for disabled visitors situated within our National Botanic Gardens, the allocation of a number of government owned cottages to organisations caring for disabled groups and improved access for disabled people to a number of sporting and recreational areas in and around Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department produced a brochure showing the city location of 193 parking bays set aside for the exclusive use of disabled drivers. A brochure highlighting picnic and recreation points catering for the special needs of disabled people will shortly be released by my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No special budgetary allocations were made in 1980-81 for Departmental IYDP projects. In addition to public sector expenditure on IYDP (in the Australian Capital Territory it is estimated to have been in excess of $1.6m) the Australian Capital Territory community benefited from two special grants made to the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Committee for IYDP in January 1981: a grant of $50,000 for the children under the Children's Service Program, and $26, 000 from the Community Development Fund for other projects and general administration. Additionally, the non-government Australian Capital Territory Planning and Co-ordinating Committee for IYDP received two community grants both also from the Community Development Fund, to fund its operations, $18,000 in mid 1980 and a further $23,000 in January 1981.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Dependants' pensions have not been increased because successive Governments have concentrated available finance on ensuring that incapacitated veterans and war/defence widows are adequately compensated in terms of pension and have the best possible medical treatment facilities available to them. In this way, the whole family receives the benefit of increased pensions and allowances and the primary purpose of repatriation pensions, as compensation for service-related disabilities, is achieved. Any proposal to increase the dependants' pension payable to the wife or widow of a disabled veteran would need to be considered in the Budget context.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The rate of $4.05 per week was set in 1964.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There have been no new or extended benefits for the wives of disability pensioners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Yes. There is limited space on board H.M.A.S. Adelaide and the long delay, which was unavoidable, occurred because of the large numbers of people who were waiting when the inspection period commenced, 2125 people visited the ship in the three hour inspection period; 1100 in the first 80 minutes.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) People visiting the ship were given a copy of the ship's 'Welcome Aboard' pamphlet which contains considerable information about the ship as well as the portion dealing with the ship's name. In addition, static displays and explanation boards were in locations throughout the ship. The sailors manning them were available to provide any additional information required.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Because of space limitation in ships it is not possible to cut down waiting times when large numbers of people attend. Every endeavour is made to keep the waiting time to a minimum. In future people waiting to board will be advised of the estimated time likely for them to complete their tour.</PARA>
