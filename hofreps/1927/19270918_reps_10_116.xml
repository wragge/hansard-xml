This shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Booth</inline> arrived at the goldfields on the Bulolo River in September, 1924, and that the rush to the Edie Creek field commenced in September, 1026. During the early stages of the rush, and for some time after the Administration had established a hospital on the field, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Booth</inline> rendered conspicuously valuable service in attending to the sick, and her ministrations extended to both natives and Europeans. She converted a &#34; boys&#39; &#34; house into a hospital for natives, and nursed white patients in her own home. The greatest number of cases which came under her care at any one time was 32, the total number of patients nursed by her being about 130. In additionto drugs and dressings supplied to her by the Administration, she used a considerable quantity of her own stock of medicines. She also supplied both natives and miners with green vegetables from her own garden, for which she refused to accept payment. </para>

            <para>. -In the discussion of the Budget in this Chamber, in the press, and among the public a prominent place has been given to the subject of migration. The policy of the Labour party in that regard is clear and definite and requires no elaboration by me. We all recognize that as in Australia, the land is under the control of the State governments they must be held chiefly responsible for settling the newcomers that enter the country; but as the Commonwealth Government is making huge sums available to the States to stimulate migration it has the right to expect effective results and if these are not being obtained it is entitled to suggest to the State authorities that other methods should be adopted. One thing quite patent to-day is that we must cease spending public money on the present migration methods. The success of the country depends upon the production of substantial wealth, and in spite of the manner in which honorable members opposite, from the Treasurer downwards, have juggled with figures during this debate, it is evident that real wealth is not being produced in sufficient volume to justify us in continuing the present policy of unrestricted migration. Some honorable members opposite seem to imagine that we have only to bring people here to ensure their success ; but that is a fallacy. That aspect of the  subject  is admirably dealt with in the leading article which appears in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Evening Sun</inline> of yesterday&#39;s date from which I quote the following : - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>It is now generally admitted that migration should be regulated- by &#34; absorbability,&#34; but the curious delusion still persists that the migrant necessarily creates his own absorbability - that he employs enough people to support him by his reciprocal efforts. The theory is archaic, for, obviously, the individual is only self-supporting when adjusted to the mass and machinery activities of the community, which, in these days, are exceedingly complex. Unless enterprise can readily absorb the newcomers they should not be flooded in, for such a policy involves the danger of widespread unemployment and of political turmoil. The &#34; misguided enthusiasts &#34; who advocate the wide-open door must endeavour to modify their enthusiasm by the consideration of economic facts and of sound political strategy. </para>

          <para class="block">It is ridiculous for gentlemen like the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Elliot Johnson)</inline> to assert that every migrant provides for his own absorption. The fact- is that we are not able to-day satisfactorily to absorb in our industries the people who already reside here. There is far more unemployment in Australia than there should be. The various State governments, and particularly the new Liberal Government in South Australia which came into office with such a fanfare of trumpets, should be ashamed to allow the present situation to continue, much less to aggravate it. Although the position in South Australia is worse to-day than it has been since the 1914 drought, the Government there is already making strenuous efforts to stimulate migration. Honorable members of the Labour party, will be quite willing, when the conditions are suitable, to do everything in their power to bring to Australia a reasonable number of migrants of the British and other Nordic races ; but existing conditions are not now favorable for that to be done, and they are infinitely less favorable for the flooding of the country with Southern Europeans. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Prowse) quoted certain figures last night with the object of showing that the area under cultivation in Australia had increased in recent years, and he then dealt with the number of persons unemployed in our pastoral and agricultural areas. I also have abstracted certain returns from Bulletin No. 20 of our <inline font-style="italic">Summary of Production</inline> which show that in 1915-16 the area under crop in Australia was 12.484,512 acres, whereas in . 1925-26 it was only 10,201,276 acres. Doubtless the larger figures for the first-mentioned year were due to the fact that in consequence of war conditions our primary producers were urged to put every possible acre under crop; but I submit that as we were able to put that area under crop in 1915-16, we should be able to put an additional area of at least 10,000,000 acres under crop to-day. In 1915-16 the number of persons employed in rural occupations in Australia was 351,909, whereas the number so employed in 1925-26 was only 374,134, or only 22,225 more than in 1915-16. These figures are the more remarkable when  Ave  bear in mind that in 1915-16 the flower of our manhood was engaged abroad on military service. In the ten years that have followed many of the young men of the community who in 1915-16 were too young to engage in Avar service, have reached the prime of their manhood, and there is no doubt whatever that if the  way  were opened to them they would be glad to follow rural occupations. I daresay that the great bulk of the increase of 22.225 persons  who  are occupied in these pursuits, to-day over the number so engaged in 1915-16, are ex-soldiers who have been placed on the land under various repatriation schemes. These figures show that Australia is not producing the substantial wealth that she should be producing. If the honorable member for Wannon rnakes inquiry, he will find that the fault lies  Avith  the Government that  lie  supports. He came into this House with the great ideal of making two blades of grass grow where only one had grown previously. Whether he intended to do so  by  his own efforts or  by  the introduction of a new brand of fertilizer I cannot say; but the figures and the facts show that uc has not achieved his objective. Since the war, this country has been in the hands of Liberal administrations. The only consolation to be derived from the fact is that if they are given sufficient rope they will hang themselves. Tasmania fell into a parlous condition financially, because of its objection to Labour governments; but the people of that State have now found it necessary to hand over the administration to the Labour party. It cannot be denied that under Labour rule Tasmania has progressed.  </para>

              <para>- Some excuse is always found .when Labour succeeds. The fallacy of the theory that Labour cannot govern has been proved in Tasmania. The present budget, although presented by a Liberal administration, has been caustically criticized by its supporters. I suppose that the reason they would give for supporting the Ministry is that, no matter how bad the devil may be, it is the devil they know. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> smiles. He is inclined to judge all Labour men by the actions of extremists, and. not, by the sane programme of the Labour party, which will one day be put into operation again in &#39; the Commonwealth.

              <para>- The honorable member did not recognize his own statements. I expect him to back them up. The honorable member for Wakefield whom I have known in parliamentary life more than other honorable members, frequently urges the Government to economize. I hope that he will protest against the appointment of so many commissions. With his wide knowledge that extends over many years of political life he should, be in a position to give the Prime Minister a substantial case to answer. Which commission is to be scrapped ? Is the Development and Migration Commission to be allowed to continue its enormous expenditure, for which we can see no return? Migrants can be absorbed without the aid of the commission. The honorable member may tell the people that they need not be afraid of the national debt; and it should be remembered that the value of the assets represented by railways, waterworks and other public utilities amounts to many millions sterling. Yet if we go into the most progressive districts in the Commonwealth, we find much of the land fenced off and held out of use. It has been &#34;soonerized.&#34; When Labour first came into power, it recognized the seriousness of this land blight, which is patent to everybody. The railways, our national asset, run through large tracts of rich land that are not being put to full use, and the immigrants are placed on outlying areas where the soil is less fertile, if not infertile. Never has the Labour party failed to advocate water conservation as one of the best means of developing the country. </para>

Even the Butler government, the present Liberal administration in South.

              <para>- I ask the honorable member not to anticipate my reply. I am quite able to tell the story of the river Murray locking scheme, as far as South Australia is concerned, and the honorable member knows that. Chaffey Bros. and not <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J</inline> oseph Cook started the river Murray scheme, and helped to develop the Renmark irrigation settlement. In the early nineties an agitation arose for the development of the river Murray. The Labour party at that time, although in embryo, was large enough to exert an  influence on the government of the day. In consequence, Charles Kingston instituted a system of village settlements. Does the honorable member for Wakefield say that I am not correct in my statement? </para>

              <para>- The honorable member claims credit for Peter Gillen, but when it comes to the loss on the scheme, he blames the Labour party. I admit that the scheme was not the success that was anticipated of it, but it was bread cast upon the waters, because many of those settlements started by the communal groups are being worked to-day by settlers with greater success than the returned soldiers are having with the blocks upon which this Government settled them. The locking of the river Murray was not initiated by the Liberal Government of South Australia. </para>

              <para>- That is the position in respect of the locking of the river Murray, yet honorable members opposite continually urge that the Labour party is totally opposed to immigration. We should be only too glad to stand behind a sane system of immigration that will help to develop this country. South Australia adopted a boy immigration scheme as an experiment, and the present Government is continuing it. Some weeks ago I challenged honorable members supporting the Government to name one boy immigrant who had been settled on. the land and become a producer in his own right. </para>

              <para>- It would be a poor Britisher who would not be able to keep himself in a country like Australia. I believe that the boy immigrants are keeping themselves, but would the honorable member say that our policy of immigration is to bring people here simply to keep themselves? Our object is to place people on theland so as to develop this country. Even if the boy immigrants are keeping themselves, I suggest to the honorable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Atkinson)</inline> that they are enduring a hand-to-mouth existence. The exportable real wealth of this country is increasing every year, notwithstanding the statements of the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> last night. Had the public been able to listen to the honorable member over the wireless when he was delivering his speechlast night it would not have thought that he was speaking of an Australia teeming with wealth, in which a strong and virile people is engaged in developing our resources. </para>

              <para>- I do not object to immigration. I was an immigrant myself; I was not born in Australia. I am prepared at all times to admit all the immigrants needed to develop this country, but I contend that if the country were properly managed, and opportunities made available, it would not be necessary to bring immigrants here : they would come of their own volition. If the land were not locked up in big holdings, there would be ample opportunity for the absorption of immigrants. Let me refute the Jeremiahs who have delivered flaccid speeches in actual condemnation of the government which they support. The honorable member for Forrest is perhaps the worst of them all, yet he is the last man who should sing the dismal tune with which he so constantly favours us. From 1915-16 to 1925-26 the number of persons engaged in the agricultural industry increased by only 22,225, and I suggest that the majority of these are returned soldiers who have been repatriated by the Government. The Labour party is always willing to assist the primary producer, and to give him the same fair deal as it would give to working men. The people have subscribed to the Paterson butter scheme, which has stabilized the butter industry in this country. </para>

              <para>- From the point of view of the dairymen, it has, at any rate, helped to stabilize the industry. We pay increased prices, not only for our butter, but also for the milk that is delivered to our doors every morning, but we do so cheerfully because we know that the money is helping a necessary industry to carry on. What we do object to is the enormous profits made by the middlemen. On page 53 of the trade statistics in Commonwealth Bulletin No. 27, covering the period from 1915 to 1925, it is shown that the value of agricultural products exported in 1915-16 was &#163;11,377,334, and that in 1925-26 their value was &#163;34,245,641. </para>

              <para>- I said that there was less land under wheat. While, however, there was less land cultivated for wheat, and while there were only 22,000 more people engaged in agricultural pursuits, the value of agricultural products exported advanced from &#163;11,000,000 to &#163;34,000,000. It is evident, therefore, that this is a very profitable industry for those engaged in it. </para>

              <para>- That is the question for which I was waiting, because I have the figures here with which to reply to it. In answer to the honorable member for Barker, I shall quote the relative values of the production of the pastoral industry in 1915, and in 1925-26. In 1915 the estimated value of pastoral production was &#163;70,144,000, and its value per head of population was &#163;14 2s. 4d., while the pastoral production prices index number was 1,743. The value of these pastoral products, based on the 1911 prices, was &#163;40,243,000, or a value per head of &#163;8 2s. In 1925-26 the estimated value of pastoral products was &#163;113,327,000. Thus it will be seen that during that period the value of pastoral products increased from &#163;70,000,000 to over &#163;113,000,000, in a country which, according to honorable members opposite, is blighted by the Labour governments which are in office in some of the States. It will be seen that the Labour party is quite prepared to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before if it is given the opportunity. The value per head of population of the pastoral products for 1925-26 was &#163;18 18s. 3d., and the price index number was 2,050. The value of the products for that year, based on the 1911 prices, was &#163;55,281,000, or a value per head of population of &#163;9 4s. 6d. ? Does the honorable member want anything more to convince him that this is a glorious country, and that Labour administration can show the way to secure all necessary migrants, and to pay our interest bill? This Government is leading Australia into a position so parlous that it is exciting adverse criticism even from its own members and press. And now the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> produces the latest oracle who seeks to bring about financial salvation, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lennon</inline> Raws. Undoubtedly our excessive borrowing, if continued, may bring about our destruction. It is comparatively easy to borrow if one can find a friend who believes in him. The financing of the country on loans does not require the qualities of a statesman. Colloquially speaking, I have been a &#34; mug &#34; hundreds of times, and have &#34;had my ear bitten &#34; by persons who had my confidence. So long as Australia can show assets such as I have referred to it is the easiest thing in the world for Parliament to borrow. Later, the problem will arise as to who shall pay the resultant taxation. This Government has done nothing but nourish its friends.&#39; Only recently it granted the pastoralists relief to the extent of &#163;54,000. Yet it has no compunction about placing a burden of &#163;25 on every man, woman and child in Australia through the medium of indirect taxation through the Customs House. If the Government is sincere in its protestation that it wishes to develop Australia, it should disclose our true position. Honorable members opposite are continually adopting the role of Jeremiah, and traduce Australia, but I have every confidence in the country. I consider that, some clay, when it is properly governed, it will be a model to the world. That will not be achieved by bringing boy labour to Australia, and by inundating our sugar industry with cheap Italian labour. This Government has Italianized the sugar districts in North Queensland. </para>

              <para>- It is not. I speak on the authority of a newspaper report which appeared in my own State. This Government has failed to reduce taxa tion, which is now greater in the aggregate that when Ministers first took office. It has certainly reduced taxation as it applies to its supporters, and when the Labour party succeeds to the Treasury bench it may justifiably pursue tactics similar to those employed by the party opposite, and so balance the ledger of equity. Not only has this Government failed to reduce borrowing, but it has increased the public debt. My contention is that it was not necessary for Australia to borrow one penny during the regime of this Government. In conclusion, I reiterate that the Government nas claimed to have reduced taxation, but has failed to do so. It has also claimed to have protected the Commonwealth through the medium of its tariff, in which effort it has again failed. </para>

            <para>. - I give my meed of praise and congratulation to the Treasurer for having produced his fifth budget so soon after the meeting of Parliament at Canberra. In previous years the honorable gentleman has presented his budget within a few weeks after the termination of the financial year, but this year the postponement of our meeting has prevented that. The honorable gentleman has always put into force the practice which he advocated before he attained ministerial rank, that of presenting the budget at the earliest opportunity, so that Parliament may control expenditure. Various honorable members have indulged in the exposition of nostrums which, they &#39;claim, will cure our financial ills. The honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> spoke for an hour and a half, and did nothing except delve into the ancient history of South Australia. The honorable member quoted masses of statistics from the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Tear-Booh,</inline> which we can all read for ourselves. I leave the criticism of the budget to our selfappointed financial experts-, such as the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> and the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett).</inline> The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> is also one who endeavours,  at times, to assume the mantle of a high financial genius. </para>

              <para>- The New States question has been raised on two occasions in the Parliament, once during the last Parliament, and once during this session. When it was last raised it was referred to the constitution session which was to have been held as soon as Parliament came to Canberra. Unfortunately, that session has been postponed. Until an amendment of the Constitution is effected, the existing machinery, which is archaic, must continue to creak and grean. A royal commission has been appointed to investigate the Constitution and make suggestions to this Parliament as to any alterations that may appear desirable. I have my doubts as to the effectiveness of that idea, and would like to know when the constitutional session is to be held. I have associated myself actively with the New States question, and I consider that this Parliament should deal with it during this session The sooner it is done, the better it will be for all concerned. The development of Australia is being hampered because our Constitution is out of date. Australia is like a boy who has outgrown his clothes. The Constitution may have been excellent when it was framed, but the natural evolution of the Commonwealth necessitates its being re- cast. Many important matters are being held up that can be adjusted only after an amendment of the Constitution has been effected. When the referendum bills were before this House two years ago, only two members dissented from the view that the proposed amendments of the constitution were desirable. Unfortunately the people did not agree to them; but I submit that those of us who live cheek-by-jowl with the constitution know more about it than does the average man in the street, to whom the constitution is just a word. He does not know what is in it or how it has worked, and to ask him to express an opinion upon contentious amendments is to waste time and money. </para>

Although Parliament approved of the expenditure, only &#163;2,428 is to be spent, the original plans and specifications having been so altered that the benefit which will accrue from the remodelling is problematic. Is it right, when a member has succeeded in getting the approval of Parliament to certain expenditure for the benefit of his constituents, that the Government should reduce or cut it out entirely?

Several questions have been asked byvarious honorable members as to when a poll will be taken, and what progress is being made in the preparation of electoral rolls, but they have elicited no information. Having regard to the unanimous decision of this House that a poll should be taken, the Government should, without further delay, announce when the issue is to be submitted to the people.

          <para>The budget disclosed an actual surplus of &#163;2,635,597 for the year 1926-27. Of that sum, &#163;2,000,000 has been allocated by the Treasurer to naval construction and a reserve for defence, &#163;250,000 to science and industry investigation, and &#163;200,000 to civil aviation. Nobody will object to the allocation for investigations directed to the improvement of science and industry, because many primary and secondary industries could be greatly benefited by systematic research. . I cordially approve of the amount set aside for civil aviation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alan</inline> Cobham, in his book <inline font-style="italic">To Australia and Back;</inline> said that Australian climatic and geographical conditions were ideal for the development of aviation. I am glad, therefore, that the Government proposes to encourage civil aviation ; but I suggest that it is hardly consonant with that policy to prosecute, for what the magistrate declared to be merely a technical offence, a gentleman who has played a prominent part in pioneering Australian aviation : I refer to the prosecution of Captain Percival. His machine was quite airworthy; but he did not hold a certificate. I know him to be a very experienced pilot. Many times I have flown with him; indeed, I was with him only a few weeks ago on a flight in one of the allegedly un-airworthy machines. If all our planes, military and civil, were as airworthy as that one, there would have been fewer aviation accidents in Australia during the last few years. </para>

              <para>- Some years ago the Government established an aerodrome at Ballina, in my electorate, but negotiations were later entered into between the Defence Department and the local municipal council, in consequence of which the localgoverning body took over the aerodrome as a public reserve, on the understanding that it would be available for use as an aerodrome whenever it was required. A piano landed on it only last week, and some little time ago Captain Percival also made use of it. I suppose this is one of the few aerodromes in Australia that might be put into what I shall call the casual class. In my opinion the Government acted very wisely in placing this area under local control, for instead of it becoming overgrown with grass and weeds, .and being rendered unsafe as a landing ground by reason of sand drifts, it is being maintained in a usable condition. </para>

          <para>Some time ago, in reply to a question, the Postmaster-General informed me that it was the intention of the Government to establish an aerial mail service between Sydney and Brisbane, but he could not tell me when the service would be put into operation. I suggest that in consequence of the great saving in time which would follow the inauguration of the service, it should be instituted as soon as possible. The planes could use the Ballina aerodrome, and link up with the aerial services that operate from other centres. Notwithstanding that such services between the Australian capital cities might in a small degree compete with existing travelling and mail facilities, they should be established, for they would provide avenues of employment for pilots who have completed their training in the Air Force, enable the principals of huge business concerns to make rapid journeys between the various capitals for consulta tion purposes, and ensure the rapid transit of important commercial, public, and private documents. </para>
          <para>An amount of &#163;100,000 of the surplus has wisely been ear-marked for the purpose of assisting to educate soldiers&#39; children. </para>
          <para>The provision of &#163;200,000 to form the nucleus of the National Insurance Fund is evidence of the sincere desire of the Government to inaugurate an effective scheme of national insurance within Australia. I had the honour to be a member of the Royal Commission on National Insurance. The commission sat for three and a half years, and made exhaustive inquiries into such widely differing subjects as maternity questions, pre-natal and post-natal ; casual sickness, accident, invalidity, unemployment, destitution, old age, and superannuation. There is hardly a major experience of human life  which is not relevant to one or other of the subjects upon which it had to inquire. The commission submitted four reports in all. I am glad to say that the recommendations it made in respect of unemployment have received the commendation of the extremists in both the employing and employed classes of our community, and also of the huge body of moderate opinion in both camps. It is a matter of considerable satisfaction to the members of the commission that, notwithstanding the thorny nature of this subject, they were able to submit a report which has been subjected to practically no criticism. The principle upon which the report was based was that as the average Australian wage-earner was unable, during the period of his active work, to save sufficient to maintain himself and his dependants in reasonable comfort in his old age, but was always obliged to live up to his income in order to feed and clothe his family, provision should be made to ensure him a reasonable degree of comfort in the evening of his life. In order to make that possible, the commission suggested that a fund should be established to which employers, employees and the Government should contribute. I am informed that the bill which the Government is having drafted, after considering the recommendations of the report, is  almost ready for presentation to Parliament; so I shall withhold, for the time being, any further comment on this subject. </para>
          <para>An amount of &#163;70,000 has been set aside for the purpose of prospecting for oil in Papua and New Guinea, and for making a geo-physical survey of Australia. Ever since my election to this Parliament I have advocated that Papua and the Mandated Territory should be prospected for oil. In spite of what has occurred at Roma recently, it is still arguable whether oil will ever be discovered in Australia in commercial quantities; but every geologist who has visited the Mandated Territory has expressed the conviction that oil will be discovered there. The Dutch and German geologists, who examined New Guinea prior to the war, as well as our own geologists, who have explored it since our occupation, are unanimous on that point. I understand that the original intention of the Government was to spend the whole of the money available for exploratory purposes in Papua, but I am glad to say that it has now been decided that exploration shall also be conducted in the Mandated Territory. It may be possible to conduct a geo-physical survey of these territories as well as of Australia. A party of scientists recently visited New Zealand with the object of making surveys there under what is known as the Elbore system. I trust that this, or some equally satisfactory method, will be adopted by the geophysicists who will be employed to carry out the Australian survey. </para>
          <para>Seeing that a new government has been elected in New South Wales, I suggest, that the time is opportune&#39; for the Government to make fresh representations to that State, with the object of getting it to proceed immediately with the construction of the proposed bridge over the Clarence River at Grafton. The Lang Government, of nasty memory, promised several times to push on with this work, but did nothing. Perhaps it felt that if it remained inactive until the bridge was actually required to provide through connexion for the new railway, the Commonwealth Government might itself take the work in hand. It is not disputed that the building of this bridge is a State responsibility. In these circumstances I trust that the Government will adopt my suggestion and renew its representations on the subject. </para>

          <para class="block">The advantages of a railway from Yass to Jervis Bay through Canberra would be many. We have an excellent port at Jervis Bay, and it is not connected by rail with the Federal Territory or Sydney. Thereare too few deep sea ports in Australia., and none of them should be neglected. The Naval College at Jervis Bay and the Military College at Duntroon are supposed to work in concert, and railway connexion between them would be advantageous. Such a line would connect the Federal Capital with a deep sea port of its own, which could be developed as an overseas port, and the connexion of Yass with the Federal Capital by railway would provide another outlet to the sea for the southern portion of New South Wales. I hope that vested interests will not prove strong enough to prevent the consummation of this proposal. I have in mind the fate that has overtaken Twofold Bay, Jervis Bay, the </para>

          <para>During this debate much has been heard concerning Australia&#39;s financial position and adverse trade balance. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> referring to Customs duties, said that he was a prohibitionist. I, also, am a prohibitionist with regard to the tariff and many other matters. For some years our imports have been in excess of our exports, and, unfortunately, many primary products that are grown in Australia are also imported. Even butter, for example, is brought into this country from overseas. Primary products such as wheat, maize, oats, barley, potatoes, eggs, poultry, honey and beeswax are all imported, although we also export them. It seems extraordinary that they should be imported at any time. Flax, to the value of a million and a half sterling, is imported, although we grow excellent flax in Australia. Such importations should be prohibited. In 1920-23, sugar to the value of &#163;6,590,314 was imported. In the following year, sugar imports were valued at &#163;209,787,000, a decrease of over &#163;4,000,000. Then there was a progressive decrease until 1924-25, when the value was &#163;35,356. That small sum is probably accounted for by the sugar representing ships&#39; stores. To maintain our White Australia policy, and for many other excellent reasons, we have decided that no sugar shall be imported from other countries, provided that that commodity is sold in the capital cities at a certain price&#34;. The sugar agreement expires next year, and I am glad to say that the Prime Minister is committed to the renewal of the agreement. Opposition to it has come from the southern States, because  some honorable members do nor. understand the position of the industry, or, if they do, they wilfully mis-state it. It is said. that bounty is paid; but bounty has never been received by the industry. During the war years, when Australian manufacturers were obtaining sugar at a&#39; price very much below that at which it could be obtained outside this country,  they  were able to build up reserves that were afterwards capitalized, and, now that the sugar market has been stabilized, the same firms claim that the agreement is doing them an in jury because they cannot show the big profits on their watered capital that they previously enjoyed. The industry is a shining example of what can be done by proper use of the tariff. No doubt arises as to the quality of Australian sugar, and its price does not appreciably affect the cost of living. The indirect advantages of keeping the northern part of Australia settled with white people far outweigh possible disadvantages. I hope that, when the agreement is renewed next year, malicious misstatements concerning the industry will not be repeated. </para>

              <para>- I have heard it from a. few of them, and it principally comes from Victoria, particularly from the growers of fruit for canning purposes. In 1924-25, unmanufactured tobacco to the value of &#163;2,004,92S was imported into Australia, although tobacco of high quality is grown here. Excellent tobacco is grown in the Tamworth district, and the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> has been very assiduous in championing its merits. I have been a tobacco-grower in that district, and I claim that our flue-cured tobacco is an excellent article, which should not be choked off the market by propaganda insinuating that Australians will not smoke Australian tobacco. If Ave  cut down our tobacco imports by half  Ave  should save &#163;1,000,000. The importation of our agricultural products and groceries has increased tremendously, the value of the imports in 1920-21 being &#163;8,127,079, while in 1924-25 it had risen to &#163;10,542,590. There is no need to import agricultural products into Australia, nor is there any necessity to import canned fruits and vegetables, biscuits, and a great number of other groceries and confections which are at present brought in. In that matter, again, I am, with discrimination, a prohibitionist. If we cut out the imports of agricultural products and groceries we should save &#163;10,500,000 a year, which would assist to rectify our adverse trade balance.I am not aware that that balance does much harm. I have even read arguments to the effect that an adverse trade balance is no detriment to a young country, but I am not prepared to debate it. The honorable member for Wimmera took an active part inthe operations of the Dried Fruits Control Board, as he desired to see dried fruits exported from his electorate. The honorable member claims that he is a low tariffist. In that regard I am a prohibitionist. </para>

              <para>- It is the only one I have heard put forward in this chamber. In 1923-24 Australia imported butter to the value of &#163;191,828, and last year the imports of butter from New Zealand were enormous. Recently the Tariff Board inquired into the proposal for an increased duty on butter. It started to take its evidence in March of this year, and concluded it in May. I was one of the last who gave evidence in support of the application. When the inquiry closed no evidence had been given against the proposed increase. When the House met in September the Minister admitted that he had received the report of the Tariff Board, and, in answer to a question of mine a few days ago, he stated that it would be placed on the table of the House very shortly. The House will rise in a few weeks&#39; time, and I hope that the matter will not be delayed until the eleventh hour. Every honorable member, whether he represents a metropolitan or a country constituency, knows the parlous position of our butter industry, and I feel confi dent that an increase in the tariff on imported butter would meet with the approval of all honorable members. Prohibition should be extended to many other of our imports. Only a few days ago I read that the South African Government had notified an economic conference that it would not withdraw the prohibition it had placed on the exportation of ostriches and ostrich eggs. Australia should take similar action with regard to its stud rams and ewes. We are very shortsighted in allowingour competitors in South Africa and the Argentine to import our prize stock and have the advantage of our many years of research work. </para>

              <para>- That is so. Even at this late hourthe Government should close down on the export of stud rains and ewes, and so allow Australia to retain for a. longer period its present wool producing supremacy. I agree with the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> that it would be of advantage if Australia took action with regard to the protection of our primary products, but our secondary industries should also receive a measure of protection and encouragement. But by the findings of our courts of arbitration we have created artificial boundaries in our secondary industries which should be withdrawn. The party to which I belong has as a plank of its platform, &#34;piece work, and payment by results.&#34; Our primary producers are entirely dependent upon payment by results. If a farmer does not work, he does not obtain results, and very often when he does work he does not obtain a profit. The principle could well be applied to our secondary industries. The hewer of coal, and the shearer are paid by results, and both are members of the A.W.U. As that union apparently stands for the principle of payment by results, it should not oppose its application to our secondary industries. Our arbitration court judges have stressed the point that an advantage would accrue to Australia if the principle had general application. At present employers have to pay a certain wage, irrespective of whether the wage-earner gives an adequate return for what he receives or not. It is generally overlooked that it is not the employer who pays the wages. Wages are paid for out of his products. If the employer does not obtain adequate production for his wages, he is unable to continue merely as a philanthropist, and that creates unemployment. One of the causes of unemployment is the absurd claim advanced by many of our skilled trades that payment by results would be to their disadvantage. It is the only way to obtain efficiency in any skilled trade. I admit that it cannot be applied to all trades, and I instance the work of the navvy and the clerk, but wherever possible it should be applied by the arbitration court, and this Parliament should supply the judges of that court with a suitable act upon which they maybase their interpretations. </para>

            <para>The Government has decided to provide suitable transport - or to arrange for suitable transport at a cost not exceeding &#163;10 per soldier permonth - for recreation for certain classes of soldiers. Provision of this nature will be made under departmental medical advice, and will be limited to soldiers totally and permanently incapacitated as the result of spinal, head, pelvic or hip injury, organic cerebral, or spinal disease, and double amputation cases above or at the knee, whose means of locomotion, because of war disablement is permanently restricted to wheel chairs or cots. </para>

          <para>The committee may think that that is a big concession ; it is not. </para>
          <para>A considerable time ago the Red Cross Society supplied seriously disabled soldiers with means of locomotion to enable them to get into the open air and visit their friends. In the majority of cases a motor cycle was provided that could be driven from the sidecar. In the course of time those vehicles depreciated to such an extent that their upkeep became prohibitive to the soldiers, who had to maintain them out of their pensions. Accordingly the Government was asked to replace the worn-out vehicles from public funds. As the number of beneficiarieswould be limited, the cost would not be excessive. The Treasurer has announced the Government&#39;s policy, and I ask honorable member&#39;s to note the limitations contained in these words - &#34; whose means of locomotion, because of war disablement, is permanently restricted to wheel chairs or cots.&#34; That means that, if a soldier can get about at all he will get no benefit from that provision. On Armistice Day, honorable members may have seen an ex-officer watching the ceremony in front of Parliament House. He was barely able to move on two crutches. I was in hospital with him in 1919, and at that time he was able to move only his head and neck, the re3t of his body being paralyzed owing to a severe head injury; but by indomitable will and pluck he is able to get about to a limited extent. In 1921, when he could be carried from hospital, the Bed Cross Society supplied him with a motor cycle. Finding that too rough, he was able to obtain a light car, which he now drives. The upkeep of that car is a heavy drain on his pension. One would think that he would be provided for by the Government ; but he is excluded from this new provision because he is not permanently restricted to a wheel chair or cot. Other ex-soldiers similarly situated are also debarred. In an interview with the Prime Minister, I quoted the case of an ex-soldier whose right arm has been amputated at the shoulder, and whose right leg has been removed at the hip joint. Notwithstanding his serious disablement, he is doubly disqualified because his double amputation is not above or at the knee, and because, being able to move about to a slight extent, he is not permanently restricted to a wheel chair or cot. The Minister for Repatriation has chosen to draw a line, of demarcation between different classes of double amputations. Great though the disability, I, with one leg amputated, suffer in comparison with honorable members who have the use of both legs, the difference between us is small in comparison with the difference between me and the man who has suffered a double amputation. It would be as easy for a blind man to understand or comprehend the beauties of the sunset, or for a deaf man to appreciate the charms of a musical composition, as for any person enjoying the use of both legs to understand the thousand disabilities suffered by a man who has lost two limbs. &#39; I am afraid that many honorable members may not understand the effect of the Government&#39;s proposals, and I shall therefore place before them the views of the various soldiers&#39; associations.

            <para>Regarding the regulation recently promulgated by the  Repatiation  Department, dealing with the provision of free motor transportation to certain classes of severely disabled cases, we believe that the authorities have not conceded that which the united associations asked for, it being our considered opinion that double amputees of any class, without reference to recreational facilities, should be provided with free motor cars, and not motor transportation. Specifically, we wanted a motor car for each double amputee, and not the provision which the department has offered. </para>

As far back as last March, I had received  assurances from . practically every member of the Government that the matter would be dealt with almost immediately. The Prime Minister went so far as to say that he hoped to announce the decision of the Cabinet in the following week. But it was ultimately resolved to defer the decision until the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Howse from abroad. As I have said, that honorable gentleman has determined the matter unsatisfactorily to us, though I feel sure that he sincerely believed that he was giving a generous decision. </para>

            <para>. -  I have been informed from numerous sources that the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> has been circulating within the precincts of Parliament House the contents of a telegram which he is alleged to have received from the Government Resident in North Australia to the effect that I am the biggest shareholder in a mine there in which aboriginals and half-castes are employed at slave or sweated wages. During my parliamentary career I have at times been compelled to make some rather straight statements respecting the administration of the Minister for Home and Territories in the Northern. Territory; but I have at all times made my statements to his face, and not behind his back, andhe has had the opportunity to defend himself. I regard that as the golden rule of politics. I have never either inside or outside of this chamber circulated statements respecting the Minister which are incapable of proof. Common courtesy surely demanded of the Minister that he should have advised me of the receipt of this telegram, or else regarded its contents as confidential until he hadan opportunity to make them public . It is only a weak case that needs bolstering up by the methods which the Minister has employed. I feel sure that the honorable gentleman will not feel proud of his conduct when I have explained the facts of the case. I challenge him to make the question involved one for the consideration of the select committee proposed to be appointed to investigate aboriginal affairs, or any commission that may be appointed in that connexion. It is at least due to me that such a course should be adopted, in view of the circulation of the telegram. It was based on an article published in the Darwin <inline font-style="italic">Times.</inline> I have had occasion, in discussing previous budgets, to draw attention to the fact that that newspaper has received contracts at prices far in excess of other contracts for the printing of the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette,</inline> and, needless to say, it entertains no love for me on that account. But even that newspaper did not state that I was an employer of natives. It suggested, as a result of articles arising out of my discussion of the exploitation of aborigines, that I should make inquiries into certain matters affecting a mine in which I was interested. That was the inference ; no definite statement was made. I now propose to give the House the facts, for the purpose of clearing myself. It is almost three years since the original prospecting syndicate, of which I was a member, ceased control of the mine. These facts could have been ascertained by the Minister by reference to his own department. The interest I hold in the mine is one-twelfth of the original syndicate, in which there were four shareholders, and, therefore, the other three held eleven-twelfths of the total interests. That is sufficient to prove that I am not the largest shareholder. However, hearing these statements in the House from various honorable members on both sides, I immediately wired to Melbourne, anticipat ing that the matter would be raised in this chamber last week. I telegraphed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> Gibson, legal manager, Temple Court, Melbourne, as follows :  - </para>

Any person who says that I, or you through me, employed one aboriginal at Shackle mine, is a most contemptible and scurrilous liar. Challenge Marr to come out of House and say so. Playford is south.

        <para class="block">The original syndicate spent sums running into thousands of pounds in an endeavour to develop one of the biggest gold propositions in the North; but its limited cash prevented it from doing those things that were necessary. One by one the members of the little working syndicate were forced to cease contributing to it, and then a tribute was let. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Toupein,</inline> who is the recognized manager on behalf of the syndicate, hearing that the tributor was about to employ natives, immediately proceed ed to the mine and challenged him on the matter. The answer he received was that that was his intention. The two men quarrelled and fought, and the tributor received such a terrific hiding that he left the Northern Territory, and has not been in it since. That is the only occasion during the period of my connexion with the mine when there could be any suspicion of employment of halfcastes or aborigines. The members of the syndicate have done a great service under tremendous difficulties. They have battled  hard,  and have spent all their cash. In justice to them and myself the Minister should have adopted the straight course. He should have brought the telegram to me or kept it to himself until such time as he was prepared to use it. I do not care how much he retaliates, provided I  have  an opportunity to reply, which courtesy I have always extended to him. I think the House will agree with me that it is not cricket to carry awire round the House and show it to honorable members without giving the accused person an opportunity to defend himself. For that reason I make this statement, in the hope that the matter will be definitely cleared up, and I suggest that it be referred to the proposed select committee or commission. Personally, I am prepared to resign my seat, if by any action, or by any method whatever, I was ever a party to the employment of natives in mining operations in the Northern Territory. </para>

            <para>. -  The honorable member has referred to a matter which he says is of great importance to him, to me as Minister, and to the North generally. He must recognize that, when some time ago he spoke of the exploita tion of aborigines in Northern Australia, he used very strong language regarding the control of the department over which I preside. He then named me,  the  &#34; Minister for black labour,&#34; to which I replied that although I was the Minister for black aborigines of the Northern Territory, because the aborigines are our care as much as the white population, I was a White Australian. It istrue that I received a telegram from the north ; but I deny the statement of the honorable member that I hawked it round the chamber showing it to everybody. </para>

              <para>- It is an official wire, and it will be treated officially. The matter was held in abeyance, because an opportunity for discussing it had not come before the House. It was my intention, when the subject was next raised in this chamber on private members&#39; day, to make a statement upon it. The information has been received since the proposal to appoint a select committee was last under consideration. If I have been wrongly advised, I am prepared  to  give full information in the  House,  when I receive replies to the telegrams I have despatched. If injustice has been done to the honorable member, I shall be prepared to admit it  frankly.  The statement was made by a responsible official in  the  Northern Territory. If he has done wrong, made a mistake, or alleged against the honorable member that which is untrue, the House will know it. </para>

I did not inform the honorable member for the North eni Territory about the incident, but I did not regard the telegram as a secret, when it was openly shown to three members on this -side._ </para>

            <para>. - I corroborate the remarks of the honorable member for Yarra. The telegram was undoutedly shown to us. I believe from what I have heard, and from what I know myself, it was also shown to honorable members opposite. I do not know the contents of the telegram that passed between the Government and the officials in the Northern Territory, or whether the information was supplied voluntarily; but, without prejudging the case, if the official concerned had erred in the way he apparently has, he is not to be trusted by any Government. I lay the blame on the Minister for disclosing the contents of a secret telegram. If the Prime Minister, or anybody else, received a telegram containing a serious charge against an honorable member, such as that levelled at the honorable member for the Northern Territory ,he should go direct to the honorable member concerned, or else indicate to him that it was intended to ventilate the matter in the House. That would give the individual concerned an opportunity to deny the impeachment. </para>
