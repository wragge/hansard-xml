The Duchess and I are deeply grateful for your generous words, and I will not fail to convey to the King, my Father, the expressions of duty and loyalty to the Crown and Person of the Sovereign which it contains. The King and Queen retain the most vivid recollections of their visit to Australia when, as your Address recalls, he opened the first Federal Parliament 26 years ago. </para>
                    <para>It is a source of the greatest pride to me that I should have been commissioned by the King to open the first meeting of the Commonwealth Parliament at Canberra, and thereby to inaugurate the new Capital City. The Duchess and I rejoice to have been associated with the people of the Commonwealth on this great and historic occasion. We shall always remember our visit to Australia, and to-day's culminating event as one of the proudest and happiest memories of our lives. </para>
                    <para>We pray that our present tour, and especially the ceremony of to-day, performed, as it has been, in the presence of representatives of various parts of the Empire, may be the means of drawing still closer the ties of loyalty, kinship, and affection, which bind together all members of the British Commonwealth. </para>

                <para class="block">The news of the sudden death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> must have come as a shock to every member of this Parliament. He had become a familiar figure to us all, and,I feel sure, was generally regarded as a guide, philosopher and friend, who never failed, when asked, to assist in the unravelling of intricate questions of parliamentary procedure. To new members, particularly, the assistance which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> was always ready to give was extremely valuable. There are few men who have occupied a seat in this House who have not owed to him a deep debt of gratitude in this regard. It is with profound sorrow that, at our meeting to-day, we miss his once familiar figure from its customary place. It was a great gratification to him that he was able to take his place at the table at the inaugural meeting of the Parliament at Canberra in May last, his ambition to be in the service of the Parliament at the time of its removal to the permanent capital of the Commonwealth being very strong. The motion will commend itself to every honorable member. We shall keep very dear the memory of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale.</inline> We held him in great admiration as a parliamentary official, and also as a public servant of the best type. I feel sure that honorable members, would wish to tender their deepest sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Gale</inline> and to the family of the deceased officer. </para>

In seconding the motion, I associate myself with the remarks which have been made by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and the right honorable the Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> was a trusted officer of this House, and always rendered excellent service. He was held in the highest esteem by every honorable member. He had the goodwill not only of honorable members, but also of every official of the Parliament. As the Prime Minister has said, the loss of such a valuable public servant is a severe one. I, in common with the majority of honorable members, was indebted to him on many occasions for the advice that he was able to give me out  of  his extensive store of constitutional knowledge and parliamentary procedure. I join in the expression  of  regret at his sudden death, and trust that it will be of some consolation to his widow and family to learn of the high esteem in which he was held by those who were brought into contact with him. </para>

He devoted his life and great talents to the service of his country, and was happy in the manner of his death, for he passed away among the surroundings in which he had spent his active life. The Commonwealth lias lost a loyal and zealous servant, and "we a good friend and wise counsellor; one from whom every member could seek advice with the absolute assurance that this would be given without party bias.  His  knowledge was wide and thorough. None questioned his authority on parliamentary procedure or his sincerity. And now he, who was for over a quarter of a century a figure so familiar to us all that he seemed an integral part of the National Parliament, has. gone, and we are left to carry on as best we may without his aid.  His  memory, however, will live. I join in extending to his widow and family heartfelt sympathy, and I feel sure that the words that have fallen from the lips of honorable members to-day will be treasured by those whom he has left behind.

                    <para>. - For some years, and in a period of considerable turbulence, I occupied the position of  Speaker  of this House, so I have a particular reason for taking this opportunity to express my deep appreciation of the wonderful assistance and counsel that I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale,</inline> often in difficult circumstances and in trying situations. It has been truly said of him that not only was he an efficient officer, but also the guide, counsellor, and friend of every occupant of the Speaker's chair, and of every individual member of the House. "Whenever an honorable member approached <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> for advice in connexion with the procedure of the House his assistance was most cheerfully given. I know of no man who had a more kindly disposition, a more tender heart, or greater solicitude for the welfare of honorable members and the staff of the House. I deeply regret his loss to this Parliament, and also to the country, of which he was so valued a citizen. </para>

                        <para>-  Before putting the question to the House, may I be permitted to say how deeply I feel the loss that this House has sustained through the passing away of our late <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk. Mr. Gale</inline> met the obligations of his office with marked ability and courtesy, and a high sense of duty. He had a thorough knowledge of the law and customs of Parliament, and he most readily placed that knowledge at the command of honorable members and his fellow officers. The smoothness of the proceedings of the House was often due to his advice. He had the highest respect for the dignity of Parliament, and was jealous of its high traditions. Personally he was of the kindest disposition. He was thoughtful of others and most considerate in his relation with his fellow officers. He was particularly loyal in his friendships. It has been said " There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend - and his excellency is beyond price." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale</inline> has left behind him a record of service which will be an inspiration to his successors. May it be a true consolation to his widow and family to know how highly his services to the Commonwealth are appreciated. </para>

                <para class="block">Melbourne. This is so especially in regard to entrance doors and passage ways, which are more numerous than we have been accustomed to. In order to avoid confusion, I propose, with the concurrence of honorable members, to adopt the following practice in the taking of divisions : - When the bells are rung, the corner doors will be closed, tout the other doors will be left open. This means that honorable members will be able to enter the chamber not only by the main door from King's Hall, but also by the doors immediately behind me, and those leading from their party rooms. The rule when the House is in division will be that the tellers will record the names of only those honorable members who are within the line of the back row of seats. For division purposes the passage ways round the chamber will be regarded as being outside its limits. I feel sure that these arrangements will commend  themselves  to honorable members, and I ask their assistance in giving effect to them. </para>

                        <para>- It is very probable that the Bankruptcy Act will be brought into force at the beginning of next year. It would be highly inconvenient to endeavour to bring it into operation in the course of- a judicial year, but arrangements are now being made with the States for accommodation and staff, and for the service of judges, and those arrangements have reached an advanced stage. I hope, therefore, that the act will be in operation at the commencement of the next judicial year. </para>

We are now proceeding to make that investigation, and it is hoped that a final settlement will result. </para>

                            <para>The money voted by Parliament for air defence is being spent for that purpose and for no other. It must be borne in mind that the building up of an. air force necessitates a considerable outlay in hangars, workshops, aerodromes, and buildings for the accommodation of personnel, &amp;c., as well as in the training of pilots and mechanics. Up to the present the bulk of the money allotted for air defence has been expended on these services, and the Force has relied chiefly for its aircraft on the gift equipment supplied to Australia by the Imperial Government at the conclusion of the war. These machines are, however, suitable for training purposes, and while they were available, the Government would not have been justified in scrapping them in favour of more modern aircraft. The supply of gift equipment is now becoming exhausted and a commencement is being made this year to re-equip the service units and portions of the flying training school with more modern types. </para>

                        <para>- At this stage I have no desire to discuss this very important report which deals with the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line; but, in view of the rumour in circulation, that the Government intends to dispose of the line, or place its fleet of vessels out of commission, and knowing the great injury that such a course would inflict upon the primary producers of Australia, I should -like an assurance from the right honorable the Prime Minister that neither step will be taken until honorable members have had an opportunity to peruse the report of the Public Accounts Committee, and the matter has been brought before Parliament for consideration. </para>

                    <para>. - I have the honour to present this, my fifth consecutive budget, and the first presented in Canberra, the permanent home of the Commonwealth Parliament. Delay in its delivery has been inevitable owing to the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra, which has prevented Parliament from sitting in the earlier months of the new financial year. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The budget is based on a great achievement in co-operation. That achievement is expressed in the financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States which provides for united action in the redemption of Australian public debt and the common management of future borrowing. This real combination of the financial interests and policies of all the Governments of </para>
                <para>Australia can be regarded as the coping-stone of our continuous efforts for securing co-operation in national activities. </para>
                <para>The consequent re-adjustment of Commonwealth finances is reflected in the figures now submitted. The method of presentation of accounts adopted last year, which had bean made necessary by the continually extending co-operation of the Commonwealth and State Governments, enables the effect of this readjustment to be readily seen. </para>
                <para>To enable the details of the budget to be understood, I shall first briefly describe the terms of theagreement. </para>

                <para>In view of the insurmountable difficulties in providing without experience of federation some permanent basis of financial relationship between the Federal and State governing authorities, the Constitution merely required the Commonwealth to pay three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue to the States for ten years, and gave Parliament authority to decide what should be done thereafter. </para>
                <para>After many conferences had unsuccessfully attempted to find a satisfactory and permanent arrangement, the power thus given to Parliament was exercised in 1910, when provision was made for the States receiving from Commonwealth revenue <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments of 25s. per annum during another period of ten years and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provided. </para>
                <para>This system of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments was unsatisfactory in many respects. The Government has accordingly been seeking a permanent settlement of the problems of Federal and State finance on a basis free from the objections attaching to the present payments and, at the same time, mutually satisfactory to the Commonwealth and the States. To this end, the Commonwealth has in recent years met the States in conference to discuss various proposals for the adjustment of financial relationships. Prior to this year, however, no progress was made, and it became evident that while the Surplus Revenue Act remained in operation no progress would be made. </para>
                <para>The Surplus Revenue Act was, therefore, repealed in April last, and the States invited to meet the Commonwealth in conference in June. </para>
                <para>The proposals considered at earlier conferences aimed at giving the States, financial independence by separating the taxation fields in which the Commonwealth and the States operated. </para>
                <para>Other avenues of settlement which would secure better methods for the management of Australian borrowing and the redemption of public debts were examined in June, and a settlement is now proposed which attains these objectives and at the same time makes the States financially secure. </para>
                <para>The proposals placed by the Government before the States were briefly - </para>
                <para>The whole of the public debts of the States at 30th June, 1929, to be taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para class="block">The Commonwealth to make substantial contributions towards interest and sinking funds on State debts; and </para>
                <para class="block">A final settlement to be made in respect of transferred properties. </para>
                <para class="block">In framing these proposals the need for avoiding undue disturbance of Commonwealth and State finance and the claims of the States for the continuance of equitable financial assistance from the Commonwealth were considered. The proposed scheme accordingly provided that the Commonwealth should share the obligations of the States for the payment of interest on their debts and for the provision of sinking funds. </para>
                <para>The States Grants Act 1927 provides that, subject to any agreement made between the Commonwealth and the States and adopted by the Parliament, the States shall be paid during the present year a sum of £7,734,990, which is tha equivalent of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for 1927-28. The intention now is that, in lieu of these payments, the States shall receive financial assistance from the 1st July, 1927, in respect of interest and sinking fund payments on State debts, on the basis provided in the draft scheme submitted to the States. </para>
                <para>Towards interest on the existing debts of the States, the Commonwealth is to contribute annually a sum equal to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments for 1926-27, namely, £7,584,912. This is to be a fixed contribution for a period of 58 years from the 1st July, 1927, during which period the extinction of the State debts existing at 30th June, 1927, will be effected by means of a sinking fund of 7s. 6d. per annum for each £100 of debt. Towards this sinking fund the Commonwealth will contribute annually 2s. 6d. and the States 5s. The Commonwealth contribution on the existing debts will be approximately £80S,000 per annum. </para>
                <para>On all new State debts there is to be a sinking fund to provide for redemption in 53 years from the date of the raising of each new loan. The contributions to this sinking fund will total 10s. per annum for each £100 of debt, and will be shared equally by the Commonwealth and the State concerned. The amount of new borrowing will determine the annual cost of this sinking fund. </para>
                <para>The adjustment in respect of transferred properties is to be made by the Commonwealth assuming liability for so much of the State debts bearing interest at 5 per cent, as amounts to the agreed value of the properties. This will benefit the States to the extent of £165,533 per annum, as in the past interest hat1 been paid at per cent. </para>

                </para>
                <para>The benefits of the scheme, however, cannot fairly be measured by the visible relief to the States. The real benefits lie in the prospective enhancement of the credit of Australia and savings in interest through the better management of debt and new borrowing. </para>
                <para>Our experiences in Australia and abroad furnish ample evidence of the adverse effect of competition between Australian Governments for loan moneys. The plans now proposed for the creation of a permanent and complete Australian Loan Council are therefore of the greatest importance. The power for good of the present Loan Council, which has been acting on an advisory basis during the last four years, has been diminished by the fact that th% important State of New South "Wales has for a period held aloof. </para>
                <para>The common interests of the Governments of the States and the Commonwealth in the loan market fully justify the creation of the Loan Council. Where there are common interests the best results can be obtained only by co-ordinated action. Independent action inevitably brings disadvantages to all. </para>
                <para>The Loan Council now to be created will consist of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Treasurer of each State, and will consider all questions relating to future borrowing. All borrowings will be conducted in accordance with its decisions - the Commonwealth acting as the common borrower except in certain cases where other action is deemed by the Council to be more advantageous. </para>
                <para>Permanent effect cannot be given to these proposals unless the Constitution is altered so as to confer on the Parliament of the Commonwealth power to make laws for carrying out the proposals. The draft agreement by temporarily adopting such provisions of the scheme as can at once be made effective, ensures that the advantages of united action will immediately accrue as from the beginning of the two-year period commencing on the 1st July, 1927. Before the expiry of this period the Government proposes to seek an amendment of the Constitution to confer on Parliament power to make laws for the permanent adoption of the scheme. </para>
                <para>The proposals of the Commonwealth were favorably received by the States and were exhaustively discussed at conferences held in June and July last. </para>
                <para class="block">Minor amendments were made in the scheme as originally drafted, and subsequently the Sydney conference resolved : - " That this conference approves in principle of the draft agreement and the amendments thereto which have been circulated, and that the agreement be now referred to the law officers of the Commonwealth and the States for drafting alterations prior to being finally endorsed by the Commonwealth and the States." </para>
                <para>Friction between the Commonwealth and the States is always likely to arise under a temporary and uncertain basis of financial relationship. These proposals, which will shortly be submitted to Parliament, provide a permanent and satisfactory basis. </para>
                <para>The Government confidently believes that their adoption will assure that good relationship between Commonwealth and States which is essential to the welfare of Australia, and will at the same time be of great financial .advantage to the people as a whole. </para>

                <para>On the 11th July last an approximate statement of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the year 1926-27 disclosed a surplus of £2,623,6S6 in the year's transactions. The actual surplus was found to be £2,635,597. </para>
                <para>Honorable members can appreciate the excellent work of the Treasury, officials in being able, within a few days of the close of the financial year, to arrive at the result of transactions totalling more than £15,000,000, which result varied only to the extent of £11,911 from the actual, despite the fact that figures in considerable detail had to be obtained from all parts of the Commonwealth, from London and from' New York. </para>
                <para>The estimated surplus for the year was £.149,381. The actual surplus, £2,635,597, was £2,4S6,216 in excess of the estimate. This excess is made up as follows : - </para>

A further sum of £200,000 is now set aside from the surplus to extend the activities of civil aviation in order that greater benefits of transportation by air may be provided for the people of Australia. </para>

                <para>The net increase of £1,552,478 in Customs and excise revenue is made up of an increase of £1,642,100 in Customs revenue, and a decrease of £S9,622 in excise revenue. </para>
                <para>It is interesting to compare the experience of the United Spates of America with the experience of the Commonwealth in estimating receipts from the Customs tariff.  In the year 1925-26, the Customs revenue of the United States totalled $579,000,000, which was $32,000,000, or 5.8 per cent, over the budget estimate. Last financial year the Commonwealth received in Customs revenue £31,S32,600, which is £1,642,100. or 5.4 per cent- in excess of the budget estimate. </para>

                <para>This excess was almost wholly made up of land tax, £304,900, and income tax, £620,278. The increase in land tax was due to higher valuations and a reduction in the arrears of tax, whilst the additional returns from income tax were mainly due to a reduction in the arrears of tax outstanding. </para>

The chief factor was the special issue of florins to commemorate the opening of the first Parliament at the Federal Capital City. </para>

                <para>As I have previously given a detailed explanation of the increase in expenditure from revenue of £698,029, I will content myself at this stage by pointing out that £390,790 arises from expenditure under statutory obligations, mainly invalid and old-age pensions, war pensions, and wine export bounty. The expenditure under Miscellaneous Services increased by £204,151, arising chiefly from the expenditure in connexion with the visit of the Duke of York, an additional amount required to pay the guaranteed price to cotton growers, and temporary assistance to Tasmanian apple growers. </para>
                <para>There was a reduction of £255,515 in the deficit on business undertakings.

                <para>The increase in War and Defence Services is made up of £254,918 in interest and sinking fund on War Loans, and £216,904 in War Pensions. These items total £471,822. A decrease of £145,529 in the expenditure for repatriation of soldiers and other war and defence services produces the net increase of £326,293. The increases referred to are beyond the control of the Government, as they automatically accrue. The additional interest and sinking fund is almost wholly due to the redemption operation which falls due in December next, when loans bearing interest at the rates of 4½ per cent. and 5 per cent. respectively will be replaced by a loan bearing a higher rate of interest. </para>

The increase in the estimated expenditure for the present year is due in the main to the provision of new services, the adjustment of salaries by the Public Service Board of Commissioners to the increased cost of living, and the additional expenditure consequent upon the transfer of Parliament and the Administration of Government to the Federal Capital City. </para>

                <para>At that time the drought-stricken part of Queensland had caused, and was still causing, heavy losses of sheep, which have been estimated by competent authorities to total 8,000,000. In the southern parts of Australia, over quite a wide area, excessive rains had caused an epidemic of foot-rot, which resulted in a reduction in the number of bales and also considerable losses both of sheep and lambs. </para>
                <para>These factors were, however, far more than counterbalanced by the excellent season over a great part of Australia, and especially in New South Wales and even in Queensland in the districts which were not affected by the drought. The result was that the average weight per fleece shown was well above the average, and the sheep numbers, notwithstanding losses, showed a general increase. Even in Queensland the gain in the better districts reduced the total net losses to- something like 3,500,000 sheep, while in New South Wales the numbers reached a level not equalled since 1892. The total estimated production was 2,630,000 bales, practically all of which was sold, the carry over to the new season being negligible. </para>
                <para>Prices have been generally upon an even basis during the year, and closed up very firmly owing to German, Russian, and Japanese demand, with very considerable support from the Australian mills. A feature of the wool season's competition has been the increased importance of the Australian consumption, which has been referred to in all the Australian centres as a factor in maintaining prices. </para>

                <para>An important alteration has been made in the British tariff, which will enable Australian fortified wine to compete on moro favorable terms in the British market. The effect of this alteration is that the preferential advantage of Australian fortified wine over certain Spanish wines which competed very strongly with Australian wines has been increased from fid. per gallon to 4s. per gallon. </para>
                <para>This alteration of the position may involve reconsideration of the rate of bounty payable on the export of fortified wine in the light of experience as to the result of the more favorable terms now applying to Great Britain. In any reconsideration of the question due regard will be given to the necessity of maintaining and extending the export trade in fortified wines. </para>
                <para>The export trade in fortified wine has substantially increased by reason of the bounty of 4s. per gallon provided by the Wine Export Bounty Act. During 1926-27 the quantity of fortified wine exported rose to 2,212,000 gallons, on which bounty was paid to the amount of £442,410. The essential object of the bounty, namely, the ensuring of reasonable prices to grape-growers, is being observed. By an amending act passed early this year, the rate of bounty was reduced to la. 9d. per gallon. In addition to this payment a refund of the excise duty payable on the fortifying spirit contained in the wine will be allowed, under the drawback provisions of the Customs Act, making a total payment on the fortified wine exported of 3s. per gallon. </para>

                <para>The amount estimated to be received from land tax in 1927-28 is £445,900 less than the actual collections of last year, due to the following concessions to taxpayers. </para>
                <para>Retrospective Assessments</para>
                <para>The Land Tax Assessment Act grants to the Commissioner of Taxation power to make retrospective assessments during a period of two years. An assessment is issued and the amount thereof paid by a taxpayer, who during a period of two years from the date of such assessment may, by means of an amended assessment, be called upon to pay an additional amount of tax, because- of a check valuation by the department of the land owned by such taxpayer. </para>
                <para>The issue of such retrospective assessments gives valid cause for  complaint  on the part of taxpayers, who are entitled to expect that, as in the case of other taxes, assessments issued in the first instance should, as far as possible, correctly indicate the amount of their indebtedness to the department. It is. therefore, proposed to abolish the practice of issuing such retrospective assessments. </para>
                <para>It is further proposed that assessments of land tax shall be divided into triennial periods, and that the value at which any area of land or any interest in an area of land shall have been included in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> assessment of the year which is the first year of a triennial period shall, subject to certain necessary provisions to meet special circumstances, not be increased during the currency of that triennial period. </para>

                <para>To curtail such unremunerative work, and at the same time obviate the delays now caused in the issue of land tax assessments, it is therefore proposed to add a proviso to section 39 (2) of the Land Tax Assessment Act, eliminating from consideration for land tax purposes individual shareholding interests which do not amount in the aggregate to £500. </para>

                <para>It is .proposed to remodel section 66 of the Land Tax Assessment Act so as to provide that where the Commissioner of Taxation is satisfied that the returns from land which is used for primary production have been seriously impaired by reason of drought or adverse seasons, or other adverse conditions, the Relief Board may release the taxpayer wholly, or in part, from his liability for land tax in respect of that land, notwithstanding that he may own other 'land. </para>
                <para>The object of this proposal is to afford relief to a primary producer when hardship would be imposed upon him by requiring him to pay land tax assessed on an area of land in respect of which he has already suffered loss from these causes. </para>

                <para>The land tax was first imposed in 1910-11 with a tax of Id. where the taxable value is £1, increasing uniformly by 1.30000th of Id. with each increase of £1 in the taxable value until a maximum rate of 6d. was reached, which rate remained constant in further increases in the taxable value. </para>
                <para>In 1914-15 the uniform increase was 1.18750th instead of 1.30000th of Id., and the maximum rate was increased to 9d. </para>
                <para>In 1918-19, as a war measure, the rates of tax were increased by 20 per cent. In 1922-23 the increase of 20 per cent, in the rates was remitted. The rate of tax at present payable is, therefore, that which was imposed in 1914-15, and the Government now proposes to make a reduction in those rates of 10 per cent. </para>
                <para>Owing mainly to this reduction in the rate of tax, and to the concessions which I have outlined, the revenue estimated to be received from the land tax is £445,900 less than the actual collections of last financial year. </para>

                <para>To facilitate the settlement of differences between landowners and the Taxation Departments regarding the valuations of land, the Government proposes to appoint a board of review, to which appeals can be made by the taxpayer. The board, which will operate on the same lines as the Income Tax Board of Review will consist of persons who have had such experience in the value of land that they will be competent to deal with appeals. The decisions of the board will be final, but provision will be made that questions of law arising out of the appeals can be dealt with by the High Court. </para>

                <para>When the Government's federal aid roads policy was enunciated in last year's Budget, it was intimated that the annual grant to the States of £2,000,000 would be provided out of existing revenues to the extent of £500,000, and £1,500000 would be obtained from road users by means of the Customs Tariff. When the Federal Aid Roads Bill was submitted to Parliament, only three States had intimated their intention of co-operating with the Commonwealth. As it appeared that the whole of the additional revenue would not be required during last financial year, the Government decided to waive for the time being certain additional duties proposed. Now that the whole of the States have signed the Federal Aid Roads Agreement, it will be necessary to impose these additional duties. The House will be informed of the full details of these duties later in the day by the Minister for Trade and Customs. The increased revenue for road purposes will account for £500,000 of the estimated increase in the Customs and excise revenue, leaving £747,522 to arise from normal increases. </para>

                <para>The presentation of the fifth financial statement of the present Government affords a favorable opportunity for a review of its financial operations and policy. </para>
                <para>The outstanding features of the Government's financial policy have been rigid economy in departmental administration, the progressive reduction of wartime taxation, measures to enhance the national credit by the systematic extinction of debt and common management of borrowing, the improvement of banking machinery and marketing methods, humanitarian legislation to ameliorate the lot of the sick, the aged, returned soldiers and their dependants, the immense extension of postal and telephone facilities, a five-years' programme of Defence development, and the fullest co-operation with the States in national development. </para>
                <para>A comparison of 1921-22, the last complete financial year before the Government took office, with the present financial year, indicates the effect of this policy on our finances. </para>
                <para>The leaders of the present Government have, during the whole period since 1921- 22, had control of the finances. The following reductions in taxation have been made, which are cumulative, and are carried by each succeeding year. </para>
                <para>In 1923, a 25 per cent, reduction in postage was made, notwithstanding which the position of all officers had since been bettered, and the conditions of the postal and telephonic services generally had been greatly improved. The number of telephones in Australia has been more than doubled. Provision for. continuous services is being made over practically the whole of Australia. </para>
                <para>Income taxation reached its peak in 1921-22, being then 70f per cent above the original rate of 1914-15. Successive reductions in 1922, in 1924, in 1925, and in 1927 have reduced that rate to only 8 per cent, above the original level. The amount of non-taxable income has been raised from £100 to £300, and many additional concessions granted, such as the increased deduction for children from £26 to £50, deductions for vermin-proof fencing, medical expenses, &amp;c, and the non-inclusion in the income of 5 per cent of the value of the home. As a result, only £9,800,000 income tax will be collected this year as compared with £16,790,000 in 1921-22, despite the great  development that has taken place in the interim and the number of income taxpayers having been reduced by 550,000. </para>
                <para>The land tax was reduced by 20 per cent, in 1922, and is now being reduced by another 10 per cent., bringing it below the level of the tax imposed in 1914, while additional concessions in the abolition of retrospective assessments, the extension of the relief clauses, and a triennial valuation are being given this year. </para>
                <para>The war-time profits tax, which in 1921-22 returned £1,306,708, has since expired. </para>
                <para>The direct taxation collected in 1921-22 totalled £22,048,4S3, whilst the estimated collections in 1927-2S are £13,750,000, a reduction .of £S,298,4S3. In the same period, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> burden of direct taxation fell from £4 to £2 4s. Id., a reduction of more than 45 per cent. </para>
                <para>The Customs revenue, however, has increased despite the fact that in 1922 the duties on barbed wire, wire-netting, and galvanized iron and, in 1923, the duty on sulphur, were replaced by bounties, while in 1925 revenue duties on some 49 other articles were reduced or' abolished. </para>

Every budget debate is characterized by a request for even more liberal concessions than those which caused practically half this increase in expenditure. </para>
                <para>The other half of the increased expenditure has been incurred in rendering further financial assistance to the States. If the Commonwealth had not accepted this responsibility, the taxpayers would not have escaped the burden, but would have paid it through additional State taxation. Of this increase, £2,000,000 is provided by the Customs tariff for federal aid roads. This is more in the nature of a charge on road-users for services rendered, rather than taxation. It is in the same category as railroad fare? £1,050,533 additional is being paid ir connexion with the financial agreement to settle on a permanent and satisfactory basis the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. The bulk of this amount is a contribution to the sinking fund, which will more than repay itself in improved national credit. </para>
                <para>The increased expenditure on service*1 of the works debt is partly due to the pro vision for the systematic extinction of the debt which was made by the Government when it established the national debt sink ing fund in 1923, and the balance is made up of new borrowing for migration, the River Murray Waters Scheme, and for developmental works, the bulk of which is really assistance to the States. </para>
                <para>Quite apart from the specific reductions of taxation already quoted, the Government's policy has steadily lessened the drain on the taxpayers of Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable members will recollect that in connexion with the scheme for road development throughout the Commonwealth, duties on petrol, chassis' and rubber tyres were submitted to the House in July, 1926, by which it was anticipated that additional revenue to the amount of £1,500,000 would be collected during the then financial year and would form portion of the Commonwealth's financial contribution to the scheme. At that time the Premiers of certain States contended that their Governments would not agree to the scheme; so it was not deemed necessary to raise the full £1,500,000, and consequently the proposed extra duties on tyres and chassis were withdrawn. At that time it was anticipated that the extra 2d. a gallon on petrol would yield a revenue of £983,000, that the increase of 2£ per cent, on chassis and parts would yield £270,000, and that the extra 6d. a lb. and 15 per cent, on rubber tyres and tubes would yield £308,000. Since the action taken by this Parliament last year, when the proposed duties on chassis and tyres were withdrawn, in view of the total of £1,500,000 not then being required, the position has materially changed, in that all the States have agreed to participate in the scheme. To conform with the policy of the Government, the agreement necessitates the raising of an additional sum of nearly £500,000 this financial year. It is proposed, therefore, to increase the rates of duty on motor chassis under the intermediate and foreign tariff schedules only by an additional 5 per cent, on unassembled, and 7-J per cent, on assembled chassis. This will make the unassembled chassis free under British preferential tariff, but dutiable at 12^ per cent. under the intermediate tariff, and at 17i} per cent, under the general tariff. The rates on assembled chassis will be 5 per cent, under British preferential tariff, 20 per cent, under intermediate tariff, and 25 per cent, under the general tariff. The motor chassis imported into Australia for the year ended 30th June, 1927, were valued at approximately £12,250,000, of which £7,500,000 represented chassis from the United States of America. Chassis imported from the United Kingdom were valued at approximately £3,000,000; those from Canada at £1,000,000; and those from other countries at approximately £500,000. It will, therefore, be seen that, had the increased duties now proposed been in operation last year, they would have affected imports to the value of about £9,000,000, and yielded a revenue of about £550,000. For various reasons it is not expected that the figures estimated for last year will be reached during the coming year. It is probable that the twelve months ended '30th June last, represented the peak year so far as the importation into Australia of motor cars and chassis is concerned. Moreover, seeing that it is not proposed to increase  the  duties «n British chassis, the Government hopes that the increased duties under the foreign tariff will result in a certain amount of the trade now done with the </para>
                <para class="block">United States of America being transferred to Britain. Whatever happens, the duty on petrol, together with the extra duty now proposed on foreign chassis, will, it is hoped, total the full amount of £1,500,000, to which reference has already been made. The estimates and the statement before the House have been carefully framed. Although made primarily for revenue purposes, and in accordance with the promise of the Government as outlined in the Prime Minister's policy speech, the action now proposed will, it is hoped, be a further step towards the realization of that interEmpire economic development that is so desirable in the interests of all the members of the British Commonwealth of nations, and will tend to reduce the unfavorable trade balance with the United States of America. Honorable members will notice also that an increased margin is given to those persons who assemble imported chassis in Australia, and thus provide employment in Australia. The scheme of road improvement, which is now being carried out in co-operation with the States, must commend itself to all sections of the community, for the reason that it will assist to develop the assets of the Commonwealth. Land transportation in Australia in the future will undoubtedly be carried out chiefly by motor vehicles. This is the motor age. For the motor traffic of the future we must have suitable roads The new duties now proposed will enable us to raise the revenue necessary to meet the Commonwealth's obligations under the agreement already entered into with the States. The proposal before the House is in accordance with the publicly announced policy of the Government which. I submit, has been endorsed by the electors. It should be remembered that the making of roads provides a considerable amount of employment and that the whole of the money expended will circulate and be retained in the Commonwealth. Honorable members will recollect that there are already two tariff resolutions on the table of the House which, though not yet passed, are in operation. This resolution forms a part of the budget proposals and will operate from tomorrow morning. </para>

                            was a valued public servant whose life was devoted to his onerous duties. In the prime of life, when his services were of the greatest value to the Commonwealth, he was unexpectedly cut off.  His  probity honour, and integrity were unquestioned, his ability unrivalled.

                            had the confidence of the Government and, I believe, of every member of this House as well as of the business community with which he had to deal.  His  place cannot easily be filled. As Minister I appreciated his worth as well as his loyalty.  His  passing is a great personal loss. I feel that these few, though sincere words, and their endorsement by a  sympathetic House, will be appreciated by his sorrowing widow and family who will miss a true husband and father.

                    <para>This measure is necessary to cover expenditure from revenue for a period of  two mouths, pending the passing of the Appropriation Act, for the services of the year 1927-2S. The amount to be appropriated by the bill, as honorable members will notice by a perusal of the papers before them, is £4,069,925, made up as follows: - £1,486,500 for departments and services other than business undertakings and Territories of the Commonwealth; £1,S22,720 for business undertakings; £60,705 for Territories of the Commonwealth; £200,000 for refunds of revenue; £500,000 for Advance to Treasurer. The bill is based on the estimates of expenditure for the financial year 1927-2S, but no new services are included. Provision is made to cover the pay-day which falls on the 2nd December. The sum of £3,369,925 is provided for in this bill to meet the ordinary services of departments. This amount is less than one-sixth of the total amount of £20, 202, 60S which has been provided for these services in the Estimates of 1927-28, and, added to the provision of £4,S51,495 in Supply Bill No. 1, makes a total of £S,221,420. This amount of £8,221,420 compares with five-twelfths of the total provided for the present financial .year, which is £8,41.7,790, and is less also than five-twelfths of the appropriation for 1926-27, which amounted to £S,247,095. In addition to the amount of £3,369,925, provision is made for refunds of revenue to the extent of £200,000, and Advance to the Treasurer £500,000. As honorable members are aware, the advance to the Treasurer is to meet unforeseen requirements and also to carry  on works in progress at the 30th June last. These will subsequently be covered by an appropriation for additions, new works, and buildings for 1927- 2S, which, I hope, honorable members will soon have an opportunity of discussing. It is desirable that the bill should be passed as soon as possible, as it is necessary to cover the first pay-day in October. </para>

                        <para>.- I realize that it is necessary to bring down a supply bill at this stage in view of the fact that provision has to be made to meet Commonwealth obligations in the early part of next month ; but I take this opportunity of entering my protest against the numerous supply bills that have been brought down during the last year or two. The time has arrived when we should, as far as possible, deal with the finances of the country at the close of the financial year. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I em coming to that point. It may be urged' in connexion with the particular bill under consideration that that course was impossible, in that the parliamentary machinery had to be removed from Melbourne to Canberra, and Parliament could not have met sooner than it has done. However, I have heard nothing up to the present time as to what arrangements are to be made for the future. Obviously, if the Parliament is not to meet in the winter months, there should be some explanation to guide honorable members in regard to future financial arrangements. If we are not to meet until three months after the close of the financial year, as in the present instance, we shall have to grant Supply for a number of months to carry us over the winter, and then, as we are now doing, grant a further supply for a couple of months until the budget has been passed by the House. That would be an altogether unsatisfactory arrangement, but I did not hear anything in the budget speech in regard to what was proposed. So far as I know there has been no public announcement on the matter up to the present time. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter for the Government; but it  i3  desirable that honorable members should know whether the Parliament will sit in thu winter, and if not, what financial provision is to be made for the purpose of tiding the Government over the recess. Obviously something must be clone. We cannot go on allowing the House to be closed during the whole of the winter months without proper provision being made for an early consideration of the finances. I do not know whether the Treasurer intends to alter the financial year, or whether the present arrangement will continue. If there is to be no change I fail to see how Parliament can remain in recess for the winter period. It seems to me that it will have to meet just  as it did in Melbourne. The Treasurer might have taken us into his confidence, because it has been freely circulated in the newspapers that Parliament will not sit in the winter months. Honorable members are now at a loss to know what to expect. We cannot go on granting supply to the Government if it does not recognize the financial year as it exists. It should bring down its budget within a reasonable time after the close of the year, in order to obviate the necessity of granting supply so frequently. Under present circumstances money is expended, as the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> suggested, before Parliament can discuss the expenditure on the Estimates. Too often there is undue delay in the discussion of the Estimates, with the result that when honorable members attempt to bring about a reduction in expenditure they are politely told that the expenditure has already been incurred, and no reduction can be made. A clear basis of procedure should be laid down, now that Parliament is installed in its new home, and the sooner that is done the better for all concerned. We could at least satisfy the public desire to know the intention of the Parliament. The Government may intend to alter the financial year, or may have in view some other method of overcoming the difficulty. It may propose to continue the sittings in the winter months as heretofore; but the matter should be settled without delay. There should not be a recurrence of the present situation, with Parliament meeting three months after the opening of the new financial year, and being asked to grant a couple of months' Supply to carry on the services of the country until  well towards Christmas. I expected to hear something on the subject during the course of the Treasurer's budget speech. </para>

                    <para>I propose to refer briefly to the position into which we are drifting in connexion with public borrowing. I shall have occasion to refer to the subject in dealing with the budget, but I take this opportunity of mentioning the appalling position in which we now find ourselves in regard to trade balances. As the Treasurer pointed out in his speech, we have amended the tariff on two occasions in the last few years. It was anticipated that as a result we should be able to manufacture in Australia many articles that were previously imported, and that the trade balances would show a marked improvement in our favour; but instead of that the position has become much worse. </para>

                            <para>- No matter what tariff is imposed, if we borrow outside of Australia we shall have to take goods instead of the money, and the result will be an adverse trade balance, which practically means providing employment for people in other countries while our own people go short of it. For the year 1926- 27 the Commonwealth had an adverse trade balance of nearly £20,000,000. Its indebtedness overseas at the 30th June last was £130,635,131 in London, and £10,356,930 in New York, a total of £140,992,061. The Treasurer tells us that our New York indebtedness is now over £15,000,000, ' indicating that if we cannot obtain all that we want from Great Britain we are going to America to get it. That will result in more goods being brought into the Commonwealth from the United States of America, which takes a small quantity of goods from Australia as compared with what we get from that country. </para>

                            <para>- Of course. At the 30th June, 1920, the Commonwealth indebtedness in London was £91,778,559, and in New York nil, showing an increase up till June last of £49,213,502. The matter is very serious; it is idle for us to talk about reducing our indebtedness when it is allowed to increase overseas. The States' indebtedness at the 30th June, 1926, was £349,695,298 in London, and £9,529,436 in New York, a total of £359,224,734. At the 30th June, 1920, the London indebtedness was £266,307,448, and the New York indebtedness nil, so that the increase since 1920 totals £92,917,286. This financial drift must be checked, although I realize the necessity for developing the country, and providing money for that purpose. Should we constantly borrow abroad, or should we not confine ourselves to borrowing in Australia such sums as we cannot obtain out of revenue for our requirements? That matter demands our earnest consideration. From 30th June, 1920, to the 30th June, 1927, the Commonwealthand States indebtedness overseas was increased by £142,130,788. The total annual interest bill on Commonwealth and States debts is £23,138,939 payable in London, and £816,069 payable in America: These figures, which are the latest available to me, represent the annual interest on the Commonwealth debts as at the 30th June, 1926, and the annual interest on State debts as at 30th June, 1925. Our imports from United States during 1925-26 were valued at £37,234,257, and our exports to America at only £12,953,877, leaving a balance of £24,280,380 in favour of America. If the Commonwealth and the States borrow extensively from America this adverse trade balance will become very much greater, because all our loan money from abroad must be received in the form of goods. In other words, if we raise a loan of £20,000,000 iu the United States of America, we commit ourselves to the purchase pf American goods to that value. I remind the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> that the tariff can never become effective if by foreign borrowing this country commits itself to the purchase of large quantities of foreign goods. During the first nine months of 1927 Australia imported from America goods to the value of £30,896,000. This is a matter so serious as to demand earnest consideration. I have touched on it only briefly to-day, because it will require to be further considered when the budget is under discussion. My reason for mentioning it now is that there seems to be an overwhelming desire on the part of Australian Governments to place loans upon the American market. The sooner we restrict our borrowing abroad the better for all concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I believe it will. I have heard a good deal about the prevalence of a drought, and my own observations lead me to doubt that the crop this year will be nearly as good as it was in former years. The dry spell may not be general throughout the Commonwealth, but large areas are affected, and in them sheep are dying through lack of food. The prosperity of Australia depends largely upon the proceeds of the wool clip and wheat crops. What will happen to us if that revenue is lost, having regard to the large amount required each year to pay interest on a huge national debt? Undoubtedly we shall have difficulty in meeting our obligations. I have realized for a long time that since the war ended, Australia has been very fortunate; it has enjoyed a long series of good seasons, and has received high prices for its wool and wheat. Last year we had bountiful crops, and received good prices for our products, especially wool. In this way, large amounts of money were brought to this country, and if this wealth is lost to us in any year the country will suffer severely. </para>

                            <para>serious position is arising in connexion with immigration. I refer particularly to migrants from Europe, other than Great Britain, and non-European countries. The large influx of people from Southern Europe and nonBritish countries, is doing serious harm to the workers of this country. About two years ago when the subject was discussed in this House, and at various intervals since, we were assured that the influx of southern Europeans would bo reduced to definite proportions. Special conditions were to apply to Italians, each migrant being required to have a prescribed amount of money on landing, and to be of good health and character. In almost every State of the Commonwealth, thousands of good Australians are unemployed and unable to get work, whilst newcomers who are not British citizens are able to get employment. Can we expect our people, especially men who have families dependent upon them, to remain satisfied with this state of affairs? In the Newcastle district about 2,000 men are unemployed. Men flocked to that centre from various parts in the expectation of getting employment in the big works there, only to find that no openings for them existed. From South Australia and other States I hear the same complaint about the employment of Maltese while good Australians are walking the streets in idleness. Nothing will cause a greater feeling of resentment amongst the native-born population than their inability to get employment when new arrivals fare so much better. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that to be true. Employers should be more considerate to our own people, and when workers are wanted preference should be given to those already here. If, after the available local labour is absorbed, employment is available for others, well and good; but I take exception to a policy which forces our own men to walk the streets in semi-starvation while newcomers, many of whom send their earnings overseas, are given employment. The money of the foreigners, other than the amount required to buy a bare subsistence, does not continue in circulation in this country. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. This state of affairs is not in the best interests of the country. It is futile to talk about developing the country and introducing immigrants, when thousands of our own able-bodied men are unable to get work. During the six months ended 30th June last, the arrivals from Italy totalled 3,648, and the departures 652, leaving an excess of 2,996 arrivals. The total number of European arrivals was 8,982, and of departures 3,250, leaving an excess of 5,732 arrivals. Of non-Europeans there were 2,839 arrivals, and 3,310 departures, so that there were 471 more departures than arrivals. The grand totals in respect of both European and non-Europeans were: - Arrivals, 11,821; departures, 6,560, showing a net gain of 5,261. We are often told that the percentage of foreigners arriving in Australia is low in comparison with the number coming in from Great Britain ; indeed, we have been assured on many occasions that the foreign immigrants represent not more than from 8 to 10 per cent. of the total. </para>

                            <para>- For the six months ended the 30th June last the arrivals from Great Britain numbered 46,165, and the departures 35,840, the excess of arrivals over departures being 15,325. We discussed this matter two years ago, and the Prime Minister then promised to keep an eye on the influx of Europeans other than British. As a matter of fact, the number of immigrants from European countries was limited; but the only limitation placed upon Italians was that they must be persons of a reputable character, possessing so much capital, and the result has been that the great majority of those who are coming to Australia, other than from Great Britain, are Italians. I have not a word to say against Italians or other Southern Europeans; they make good citizens of Australia; but we cannot afford to allow thousands of our own workmen to remain unemployed while strangers come here and secure work. We must, therefore, do something to restrict the influx of these immigrants. It may be said that I am dealing with a delicate question that must be handled carefully; but all matters of domestic concern are within our control, and under international law immigration is a matter of domestic concern. There is, therefore, no reason why the Commonwealth Government, if it has grounds for doing, so, should not restrict, as far as it deems necessary, the influx of immigrants. America has found it necessary to regulate, control, and restrict immigration, and it must be apparent to all that the time has arrived when Australia should act similarly. If we could absorb all those who seek to come to our shores, everything would be right, but we cannot do that. Two years ago the Prime Minister said that we were maintaining a certain balance, and that all but about 10 per cent. were British immigrants. The figures for the six months ended the 30th June last show clearly that there has been one nonBritish immigrant to every three British immigrants. We have heard complaints about the influx of assisted immigrants, but these non-British people who are coming to our shores arc not assisted immigrants. </para>

                            <para>- It has been said that quite a number of. them come to Australia under contract, and that they find ready employment in certain parts of Australia. There is bad feeling in many places because of that suspicion, but I say nothing about that. I think that those people make good citizens. My sole point is that the time has arrived when, in the interests of our own workers, action should be taken to prevent this continued influx. These new arrivals appear to secure preference of employment in certain directions. It is no credit to employers that they show them preference. </para>

                            <para>- That state of things cannot continue. No doubt a contract has been let for building the railway in question, but I think that provision ought to have been made in the contract to give preference to our own people who are willing to work, and capable of doing it. It is not a light matter for a man, unable to find employment in the southern States, to go to the Northern Territory, where he anticipates securing employment on railway construction works which he knows are in progress there, only to find himself turned down because the work has been given to people from overseas. I ask leave to continue my speech at some future date. </para>

McGregor, who was so recently appointed to fill the place made vacant by the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale,</inline> and acted in that capacity in this chamber for the first time to-day. In the circumstances I arn sure that honorable members will have no desire to proceed with business, but will wish to adjourn as an expression of their sincere sympathy with the wife and relatives of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGregor,</inline> and as a mark of their appreciation of his services. </para>

                <para>Words cannot express our feelings at this moment. Earlier in this sitting we carried a resolution of sympathy with the relatives of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gale,</inline> the late  Clerk  of the House, and expressed our great regret at. his demise. A few moments afterwards we heard the announcement from the Chair that a new  Clerk  had been appointed. Now we are faced with the tragic fact that that  Clerk,  too, has passed away. I am sure it is the wish of honorable members that the House should now adjourn, and that our action in thus terminating our proceedings should be taken as an expression of our sincere sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGregor's</inline> wife and relatives in their great sorrow. </para>

                    <para>.- I join with the Prime Minister in the expression of sympathy with the wife and relatives of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGregor,</inline> and of regret at his sudden death. Fate appears to have followed us to our new home. Only to-day we carried a resolution of condolence with the wife and relatives of our late beloved <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk, Mr. Gale,</inline> and now his successor, after a few short moments of office, has also been called away. These tragedies indicate that the officials of the House have heavy and exacting tasks to perform, and we should do our best to ease their positions. "We extend heartfelt sympathy to the widow of our deceased  Clerk,  and we trust that she and his relatives may receive some little consolation from the knowledge that he died in the performance of his duties to his country. </para>
