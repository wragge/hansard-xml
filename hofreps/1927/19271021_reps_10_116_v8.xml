                    <para>- My remarks referred to all governmental buildings in the Federal Capital Territory, and I merely suggested that Parliament will soon have to consider whether the wiser policy would not be to erect only permanent structures. That course would not affect the rate of transfer of public servants to Canberra, because the proposals already adopted are based upon the erection of a permanent administrative building, and not upon the erection of further temporary buildings to accommodate the administrative staffs. </para>

                        <para>- The position is as follows :  - Several companies are at present engaged in prospecting for oil in Papua and New Guinea, and some of them have incurred considerable expenditure in connexion with the sinking of bores and other exploratory work. Applications, in a number of instances, have been received for subsidies in aid of boring, but it has not been practicable to deal with them, as it is not considered that sufficient work in the nature of preliminary geological surveys has been carried out in the areas concerned to enable it to be determined whether the prospects of the occurrence of oil reasonably justify the granting of financial assistance. In view of this situation, and of the desire of the Government to do all in its power to encourage and assist the search for oil in Australia and its Territories, arrangements have been entered into with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to undertake extensive surveys in Papua and New Guinea. Two geological parties are to be provided by the company, and an Australian geologist, or perhaps two, will be attached thereto. In addition, an aerial survey is to be made by members of the Australian Air Force. and aerial photographs are to be made of the country flown over. These photographs are expected to be of great value to the geologists. The parties will work in Papua from October to March and in New Guinea from April to September, in each twelve months. It is anticipated that the surveys will extend over a period of about three years, and will cost about £50,000. Flight-Lieutenant E. Wackett, in charge of an aerial party and two Seagull amphibian aeroplanes, has recently reached Papua after a successful flight from Melbourne, and is about to enter upon a preliminary aerial survey. Two of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's geologists, Messrs. Nason Jones and E. L. MacPherson, have also arrived in Papua, and are making advance arrangements in order that an immediate start may be made with the geological surveys when the parties are complete. Messrs. W. H. Stronge and H. C. Stotesbury, surveyors, left. Sydney for Papua by the <inline font-style="italic">Morinda</inline> on Wednesday last. Messrs. Wm. Gray, Harland, and Mackenzie, surveyors, are <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> to Australia, per s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Ormonde,</inline> and should reach Sydney about the9th November. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. R.</inline> K. Richardson,  deputy  chief geologist of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who is to take charge of the surveys, will leave Toulon for Australia on the 4th November. He is said to have had very wide experience, and to be an able administrator. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Simon</inline> Papp, geologist, will leave London for Australia on the 7th November. It is, therefore, expected that the surveys will have progressed substantially before the end of the year. In the meantime, boring operations at Popo (in Papua), at the new site selected by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, are being steadily pushed forward, a depth of 669 feet having been reached at the date of the latest advice from the field. The bore last previously sunk was abandoned before penetrating the petroliferous areas, the drilling difficulties encountered in the gassy mudstone stratum having proved insuperable. It is possible that there may be similar difficulties in connexion with the present bore, and, in order that the best technical advice and assistance may be available in the event of such a contingency arising, the company is bringing out its senior drilling technical expert, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> R. Clark, who will proceed to Popo and make a personal study of the problems to be solved. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clark</inline> is due in Melbourne from London on the 7th November. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to a question of privilege. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> asked a question this morning about the responsibilities of members of the House Committee in regard to appointments to the parliamentary staff. In regard to a recent appointment to the engineering department, I understand that public applications were not called for the position, and that a person who was not a returned soldier was appointed. When the matter was raised in the House Committee, I was informed that it did not come within the functions or powers of the committee to discuss it, and the replies that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> gave to"day to the questions asked, by the honorable member for Reid, force me to the conclusion that a member of the House Committee is merely a figurehead who has neither duties nor responsibilities. If that is so, I shall at once tender my resignation from the committee. </para>

                        <para>.- I have been a member of the Library Committee for some years, but I have never been under any misapprehension as to my duties and responsibilities. The members of these committees are merely dummies ; the  President  and  Speaker  exercise all the authority and power. A committee may come to decisions, but only on sufferance, for the  President  or the  Speaker  may over- ride it, and render its decisions null and void. This is an absurd situation, as I have said on previous occasions in this House. All that the members of a joint committee can do is to give advice; but their advice may be ignored. As a matter of fact, membership of these committees does not carry with it honour, distinction or prerogative. </para>

I have been a member of the Library Committee, for about two years, and during that time I have attended its meetings fairly regularly, which is more than can be said of  some  members of the committee. </para>

                        <para>. - I throw the insult of the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. DuncanHughes)</inline> back in his face. It is well known that the work of these committees has been futile for many years. As a member of a committee who has attended every meeting which the  President  called - and meetings were invariably called only at the end of a session - I am able to say that we were asked to approve only of what had already been done. The position became so unsatisfactory that I decided to resign from the committee, and I think other honorable members will be well advised to do the same thing. </para>

                        <para>.- When I was a member of the House Committee we considered the wages of the waiters employed in the refreshment room.  We  were in. a generous mood and tried to do the right thing by suggesting that their wages should be made the same as the wages of those performing similar duties outside. An increase of 2s. 6d. per week was granted which, however, did not bring their wages up to the ruling rate. A further increase of 10s. a week was then conceded. In order to show the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> 1 may say that during the following week one of the waiters was dismissed ; so that the department actually made a profit. I wrote to the  President,  objecting to the manner in which the decision of the committee had been thwarted and asked for a special meeting of the House Committee to be called. But no other meeting was called, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> had their way, and I did not then attend any further meetings of the committee. </para>

The position of electrician in this building became vacant, and the electrician employed here - I am not sure whether he is a permanent officer - who is a returned soldier, was denied the opportunity of applying. I believe that the position was given to a man who is not a returned soldier. I should like to know if this is the case? If it is, I shall have more to say. </para>

                        <para>.- I understand that a question of privilege should be founded on a motion ; but I do not wish to raise the point of ' order against myself. I appreciate the fact that, up to the present members of the committees appointed by Parliament have had no opportunity to notify the public of the discharge of their functions, as the proceedings of these committees are not reported. I therefore welcome the opportunity of saying a word or two concerning my own distinguished services on the committee of which I am a member. The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> complains of being only a figure head on the committee of which he is a member. If the honorable member plays a quiescent part on any committee there must be something wrong. You, sir, as the  chairman  of the Library Committee, are aware that its meetings proceed in the most orderly and peaceful manner. I attribute our great success to the fact that you, sir, have always wisely abstained from bringing forward any controversial matter. Such matters, I understand, you deal with yourself. Consequently, acrimonious utterances are never heard there. The members of the committee are usually engaged  On  inquiries into such matters as the suitable exhibition of an early transcript of Captain Cook's diary, or other questions upon which there is absolutely no difference of opinion. Like the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes),</inline> I have noticed that we always get a respectful hearing for anything we have to say. I have moved motions which have been seconded by a member of another party, and been carried unanimously. Sometimes the honorable member for Eawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> moves a motion which I oppose, and it is negatived on the voices without discussion.

In this instance, I thought it well to give all honorable members ah opportunity to express their views on the subject that has been raised. Since I have been  chairman  of the Library Committee, its meetings have been held regularly, and so far as possible, at fixed periods. These meetings have been well attended, and the transaction of business has sometimes occupied as much as two  hours  or even more. All the subjects brought before the committee have been fully discussed by its members. </para>

Last night the Treasurer said that he had consulted the savings bank authorities in South Australia, in relation to it, but he did not saye whether they would co-operate with him. The Treasurer did not state whether he had consulted the men in control of the State Bank of South Australia, the principal authority in that State conducting a housing scheme. In any case, before introducing this legislation, he should have obtained an assurance from the State' governments that they would introduce into their parliaments the legislation necessary to give effect to this scheme. </para>

When I said that I had consulted with the State savings bank authorities I referred to the savings banks of New South Wales and Victoria. When in South Australia recently I met the Premier and Treasurer of that State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> L. Butler, the Under-Treasurer and  Chairman  of the State Bank, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> R. Stuckey, and other members of the State Bank Board, and discussed with them the general principles underlying this bill. Some of the provisions- of clause 9 are the result of that discussion. I can assure the committee that the advice of the authorities in the several States is, to a large extent, incorporated in this bill. </para>

In that case I should like to know whether the Federal Capital Commission, as at present constituted, would be an "Authority" in terms of this clause. I am aware that if the commission does not come within the scope of the clause, it can be made to do so; but I should like to know whether, as at present constituted, it is an authority to which money could be loaned, and whether the Government contemplates making the commission the chief beneficiary of the trust fund which will be constituted under this statute. </para>

                    <para>.- In view of the refusal of the Government to include the War Service Homes Commission as an " Authority " in terms of this clause, I should like to know what is meant by the term " a prescribed Commonwealth authority." If the War Service Homes Commission is not such an authority, there can be no prescribed Commonwealth authority. The only other Commonwealth house building authority is the Federal Capital Commission. The term appears to be superfluous. </para>

                        <para>- The reason given last night for refusing to include the War Service Homes Commission within the scope of this clause was that a returned soldier, under existing legislation, is able to secure a generous advance for the purchase of a home. But I have been advised by returned soldiers on the staff of Parliament that, in order to secure a home in the Federal Capital Territory, they are required to deposit a sum equal to 10 per cent. of its cost. I protest against such discrimination; it is unwarranted and unjust. The scope of this clause should be liberalized to include other authorities. </para>

                    EARLE PAGE  (Cowper- Treasurer [12.12].- The Federal Capital Commission as at present constituted is an authority which could be prescribed under this clause. Whether the Government will create a special body to deal with private housing in the Federal Capital Territory is a matter for determination in the future. That position would be met by the term " territorial authority." The Federal Capital Commission already has authority, subject to the approval of the Treasurer and the concurrence of the Loan Council, to borrow money. This bill will provide it with additional powers in that direction.

                        <para>- Yes. It is contemplated that the commission will participate in the scheme. Moreover, should the State Savings Bank of New South Wales establish an agency in the Federal Capital Territory as is proposed, it could come within the scope of this clause. The Minister has already promised to inquire into the matter of the deposit necessary for returned soldiers living in the Federal Capital Territory who wish to obtain homes. That promise will be fulfilled. It is the intention of the Government to give as liberal terms to returned soldiers residing in the Federal Capital as to those in other parts of Australia. </para>

If honorable members will study the measure they will see that it will be impossible for returned soldiers to benefit unless the government is prepared to comply with the provisions of its own bill.

                        <para>- No; because the War Service Homes Commission could not participate in any advance by the savings bank unless it complied with the conditions laid down in this bill. Advances under the War Service Homes Act are limited to £950. That is the point which I am trying to impress on the committee. Something should be done to rectify this anomaly. The Government should not compel the States to amend their legislation unless it is prepared also . to bring its own legislation into line. </para>

That is the position in a nutshell. The attitude of the Treasurer will not stand investigation. The accepted policy of the Commonwealth is to give preference to returned soldiers; in this case preference is being given to civilians. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer has invited the six States to increase the limit of their advances for housing from £750 in New South Wales, £950 in Victoria, £700 in South Australia, £600 in Western Australia and £850 in Tasmania to £1,800. If that is a proper course to pursue, the Commonwealth should be prepared to follow it by raising the limit under the War Service Homes Act from £800 to £1,800. No one has suggested that the basis on which assistance is now extended to ex-soldiers should be materially  different  from that contemplated under the bill. We merely ask that the returned men be allowed to participate in the benefits of the Government's housing. scheme without losing any of their existing rights. Apart from the financial advantages that the War Service Home? Act accords to them, the department gives advice, and its general supervision and paternal interest constitute advantages that one cannot fail to appreciate. I am surprised at the obstinacy of the Treasurer in refusing to adopt the suggestion of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that the whole of the discussion this morning and last evening is due to confusion regarding the status of the soldier in the community, and the sources of the moneys made available for war service homes, and for the homes to be built under this scheme. The terms under which war service homes are provided are more liberal in Australia than in any other part of the world, and the returned man will retain his rights; but he may also come under the present scheme. He is in the same position in that respect as any other citizen. </para>

                        <para>- That argument is applicable to every citizen. Honorable members apparently fail to realize the source of the money made available. That raised for war service homes is obtained by way of loan by the Commonwealth Government, and, no matter what interest may be paid, it is made available to the returned man at 5 per cent. No charges for administration are imposed. The scheme covered by this bill must bear the whole cost of administration. Honorable' members now suggest that a returned man should receive950 under the War Service Homes Act, and come under the present scheme for the balance of the money if he should wish to build a home worth £1,600 or £1,700. That would be impossible, if we are to maintain the terms now offered with respect to war service homes. Furthermore, the financial complication would be too great. How could we determine which money was to carry certain, administrative charges, and which was to be free of those costs? If the desire is to liberalize the conditions for returned men, we should do it by an alteration of the War Service Homes Act. The money used for war service homes comes direct from the Government, while the funds for the housing scheme will be derived from the savings bank, so that there are two distinct sources of supply. There can be no distinction under the bill between returned soldiers and private citizens. </para>

                    <para>. I am. not satisfied with the Treasurer's explanation. Under this measure there is a distinction between' the soldier and the private citizen. In many cases the returned man wishes to increase his dvance. His family may be growing, and he may need more housing accommodation. He still has a mortgage on his property, and he will be unable to obtain the same advance as will be made available under the bill to other members of the community. He cannot mortgage his present dwelling unless the department gives its consent. Apparently the Treasurer has realised this difficulty, because I notice that a proposed amendment appears in print for the insertion of the following new sub-paragraph in clause 9, requiring that the commission must be satisfied that the schemes administered by the authority contain provisions under which :  - </para>

The latter would be able to obtain an advance up to £1,800, while the man who fought overseas would be limited to £950 under the War Service Homes Act. I want the Treasurer to tell the committee how any man with a mortgage on a war service home could receive the benefit of the scheme. If an amendment of the War Service Homes Act is required, why does not the Government make a declaration that it will give ex-soldiers the same benefits as those proposed to be conferred on others? </para>

I do not think that the general public or the returned soldiers themselves would be content with such an anomalous position. I know that the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> is willing to do everything he possibly can for the returned men; but we should have a declaration from the Government that they will not be permitted to suffer injustice. They are meeting their present responsibilities well, and I believe that the department made a profit during the past year of about £23,000. We should not ask the States to amend their housing laws until we have brought the war service homes legislation up to the same standard. Let us practice what we preach. If the Government is not prepared to do the fair thing it should take responsibility in regard to what might happen. </para>

                <para class="block">It is idle to talk about the war service homes scheme as the beginning and end of everything. That scheme was intended as a recognition by the people of the Commonwealth of the priceless service rendered to the country by the returned soldiers. The war gratuity and other things went into the scale, and the soldiers were distinguished from the rest of the community because they had done things which the rest of the community had not done. Then they fell back among the civilian population, but surely they should not now lose anything that those who remained behind will obtain. It would be a curious thing to give a person £5 because he had done a heroic deed, and later when you are giving £7 10s. to other people, to cut him out because you had previously given him a fiver for saving your life. The Treasurer and the leader of the Opposition mean the same thing, but they do not say it in the same way. The soldiers ought to be in' as good a position, as far as the benefits under this measure are concerned, as the civilians who did not go to the war. Whatever is given to the soldier under the War Service Homes Act is given to him because he belongs to a special section of the community, and he should receive that over and above what everybody else is getting. I agree with the Treasurer that the money has to be found somewhere, and that we have to pay a price for it. Nevertheless, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> am entirely opposed to any attempt to cut the returned soldiers out of anything they would have got if they had never gone to the war. If the soldier has a war service home on which there is a mortgage, he is as much entitled to borrow under this act as any other member of the community. </para>

                    <para>.- It is evident that the right honorable member who has just resumed his seat was absent from the committee last night, when we had a most informative debate as to the extent to which this measure would apply to war service homes. The War Service Homes Commission is not an authority entitled to receive money under this bill, and last night the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> moved an amendment to alter the definition of " authority " so as to include the commission. Unfortunately, the committee did not accept that amendment. The right honorable member said that the soldiers ought not to be in a worse position under this bill than the civilians, and that contention should appeal to every one. But the returned soldiers may be in a worse position under this bill. There is one workers' homes scheme in operation, that of Queensland, under which many returned soldiers do not benefit because the income of those qualified to borrow is limited to £260 a year. Those with incomes below that amount receive special advantages, such as being able to borrow money at five per cent., and having to make a deposit of only five per cent. of the cost of the home. The Treasurer insists that the State Governments should extend the special facilities they have provided for a special class so that houses to a value of £1,800 may be' built for other citizens. Though the States may not desire to extend these facilities because of the risk involved, the Treasurer insists upon their doing so. The returned soldier's income, however, may disqualify him from coming under the bill, or he may already have a house under the war service scheme. He is precluded in either case from obtaining the advantages of this bill. The bill makes provision for the workers' homes scheme to be amended, but that scheme is not available to returned soldiers whose incomes are in excess of £260. The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> thinks that the housing scheme is entirely fair to returned soldiers; but in my opinion these men will not get a fair deal if the committee is prepared to accept the niggardly promise on the part of the Government that there will be an amendment of the War Service Homes Act. </para>

                    <para>. - There is no doubt about the sincerity of the Government's desire to do the fair thing by returned soldiers. It seems that the returned soldiers have the same right as any ordinary citizen to come under this bill at any time. The members on this side of the House are genuine in their efforts to get something  done for returned soldiers. Nevertheless, I think that the returned soldiers are not in as good a position under this bill as is the ordinary civilian. ' The ordinary citizen can borrow up to £1,800 for a house, but the returned soldier is limited to approximately £850. That, however, is not a matter which the Opposition should push forward at this juncture, because the money for the two schemes will come from different sources. If it is desired to benefit the soldiers, I have no doubt that the Treasurer, and the other members on this side of the chamber, will give a helping hand toward the amendment of the War Service Homes Act. </para>

                    <para>.- - Honorable members on the other side of the committee are correct in saying that any citizen, whether a returned soldier or not, can come under this scheme, but we are talking about the mcn who have already applied for, and obtained, homes under the War Service Commission. About 30,000 men have already come under that scheme. The homes that were built for these men for £850 are not now sufficient, in many cases, to accommodate the children coming into them. Perhaps 50 per cent. of the men with these homes would now like to make additions to their dwellings if they were in the position to do so. If the Government will make a declaration that it is prepared to put the soldiers on. the same footing as ordinary citizens, this discussion will probably be allowed to drop. Ministers ought to make such a declaration. I think I am safe in saying that a very big percentage of the men who bought houses from the War Service Homes Commission are not in a position to-day to lodge their families properly. It is time we came to the rescue of those families, and placed them in the same position as that in which we are placing the ordinary citizens to-day. The Treasurer has said that if we want to give these privileges to the returned soldiers there is a proper way of doing it, by the amendment of the War Service Homes Act; but why should not a declaration to the effect that that will be done, be made this morning by the Government before the bill is passed. </para>

                    <para>.- I had intended to reserve any remarks I might have to make on this bill until its later stages, but I have come to the conclusion that there is something underlying the attitude of the Treasurer. There seems to be no doubt that the Government has decided that it will do nothing in any way to assist the housing scheme. What it has decided to do is to provide money for some other body to take over the housing responsibility. If members were to talk from now until they leave to go to the Melbourne Cup I do not think it would make any difference in the attitude of the Government. The Government would have to change its policy if it were to extend the provisions of this bill to the returned soldiers, but this it will not do, nor will it give us any assurance that it will alter the War Service Homes Act to give soldiers the same concessions as are provided for those who will benefit under this measure. This matter has been under consideration by three members of the Australian Council of the Nationalist party - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Cox, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> A. Hemsley, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Gordon, with others. These gentlemen have been holding a conference in Canberra, and there is no doubt that they have been brought here to impress it upon the Government that under no circumstances is the Common wealth to became directly involved in any housing scheme. </para>

                        <para>- It is clear from the wording of clause 6 that the Government has no intention of carrying out a housing scheme. When we were discussing the States Grants Bill the Treasurer laid down the principle that the Government that raised the revenue should spend it; but in the bill before us he proposes to depart from that principle. While the Government is prepared to raise money for a housing scheme, it will not accept the responsibility of spending that money. I cannot understand opposition being raised to the laudable and reasonable proposition that returned soldiers should be given the same privileges as are extended to the general public. The disrespect shown by the Government to the opinions of honorable members opposite is probably due to the fact that a Supreme Council of Six has been sitting at Canberra during the last few days. I know the history of some of the gentlemen who comprise that council; I know their determined nature. It is apparent to me that their presence in Canberra is due to their determination to keep the Government under their hand. </para>

                        <para>- I want to show that the Government's proposal is not a genuine housing scheme. As individuals, ministers may have humanitarian ideals, but because of their environment and the pressure of people outside they will not give effect to a scheme of housing which is in accord with the ideals of the Labour party. That outside pressure is sufficiently strong to prevent the Treasurer from doing what I believe he would be willing to do if he were at liberty to follow the dictates of his own conscience. Unfortunately the returned soldiers have to suffer because the Government is not at liberty to put into effect a scheme which would be of advantage to 'the community. I hope that the people of Australia will realize that this Government never had any intention of putting into operation the housing scheme it promised on the hustings. It is shocking that in a democratic country with the liberal franchise of Australia people should suffer because those who for the time being by chance happen to occupy the Treasury bench dare not bring forward a Housing Bill other than one which upon examination proves to be a sham and a delusion. I regret also that, apparently at the dictation of an outside council, the Government is opposing an endeavour to extend the benefits of the bill to returned soldiers. </para>

                    <para>.- Two facts seem to have emerged from this interesting and informative discussion. One is that it is the evident desire of all honorable members that every facility should be given to returned soldiers to secure homes. The other is that, although the object which honorable members of the Opposition seek to attain might possibly be secured by an amendment of the bill now before us, the proper way to attain it is by an amendment of the War Service Homes Act. It seems to me, however, that having established the fact that it is the desire of honorable members that every facility open to civilians should also be extended to returned soldiers, in addition to whatever advantages they may now derive under the War Service Homes Act, if this bill is once passed it will be an unanswerable precedent for an amendment of the War Service Homes Act. In these circumstances, therefore, I suggest that honorable members of the Opposition should no longer insist on getting from the Treasurer a declaration of policy in regard to returned soldiers and should allow the clause topass. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened with great interest to the discussion on this clause. I appreciate the fact that the position is difficult, but I should be sorry if any undertaking were given by the Government that the WarService Homes Act will be amended in. the direction of increasing the maximum advance to £1,800. That would involve the country in an expenditure of which I  Gould  not approve, and would also from this time forward place soldiers who are applying for advances for houses on an incomparably better footing than many thousands of their fellows who have obtained advances in the past. I should like to suggest the possibility of so amending the bill now before us as . to leave it open to returned soldiers who own houses at the present time to extend them under the housing scheme for which provision is made in this bill. At the present time I have in hand the application of a returned soldier for an additional £60 or £80 to add another room to his dwelling.. His wife has become a permanent invalid, and he has found the additional accommodation necessary. His request has been refused. I have taken up the case for him, but  so  far I have failed to alter the decision 'of the War Service Homes Commissioner. I cannot help thinking that the Government is getting into a somewhat untenable position if a refusal is given to the request of a soldier to extend his house beyond the £800 limit, while at the same time money is granted on exceptionally easy terms to ordinary civilians up to £1,800. I do not profess  to have at my command a satisfactory solution of the problem. All I say is that it is a problem that is worthy of the earliest consideration of the Government, and that it would be better to postpone for a few days the discussion of that part of the bill dealing with this particular matter, to see if in the meantime we cannot arrive at a solution satisfactory to the whole committee. </para>

                    <para>.-- Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 2 does not appear to me to be sufficiently definite. At certain periods of the financial year there may be an excess of deposits over withdrawals. At other periods of the year the withdrawals may be greater than the excess of deposits in, say, the first quarter of the year. I suggest that the Treasurer should insert an amendment providing that only such excess deposits as are disclosed as the result of a whole year's operations shall be made available to the commission for housing purposes. Should the scheme be worked on a quarterly basis, it will fail to give the stability which is essential. Almost invariably certain quarters show an excess of deposits over withdrawals, irrespective of the general trade and prosperity of the country. No doubt the commissioners could recoup themselves by drawing on loans made available to them by the Commonwealth Bank, but we should be very careful when dealing with savings bank funds, and endeavour not to prejudice the stability of the institution or shake the confidence at present reposed in it by depositors. </para>

                <para>If the money is available the lending of it should not be a matter for the judgment of the commission. The question should be, is or is not money available, the commission having no option but to exercise its powers with the maximum of 50 per cent. of the funds available. My interpretation may be wrong, and I am subject to correction, I consider it desirable that the commission should have power to determine what proportion of the surplus, not exceeding 50 per cent., shall be invested. With all humility, I suggest to the Treasurer that he should withdraw from both paragraphs the words " available for investment," and substitute therefor the words "desirable to be invested." That would make the position quite clear. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not desire to traverse again the ground that I covered yesterday in my second reading speech; but I must point out that if this clause is agreed to in its present form there will be no possible hope of Queensland coining within its provisions. Under one of its housing schemes, Queensland is at present advancing up to 95 per cent. of the valuation of homes. Under this clause it would be necessary to advance only up to 90 per cent. Yet the clause sets out that the powers of the State housing authorities must be " increased." So far from widening the scope of that Queensland scheme, this measure would have the effect of narrowing it, for it appears to me that this provision is mandatory. </para>

                    <para>. - The point raised by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> is good or bad, according to the way in which one looks at it. Let us assume that an authority in Victoria which lends money for housing will lend up to a maximum of £S00 on the valuation, but will not go beyond that; or will not lend to persons whose salary is in excess of £300 per annum; or will not lend to persons who desire to purchase a house already built. Under this measure it would not be possible to make money available to that authority unless or until it was equipped with the power to lend up to a maximum of £1,800 to persons whose incomes did not exceed £12 per week, either to build or buy a house. It may be said that this provision would prevent the authority in. Victoria from availing itself of the money that may be made available under this bill; but that has been done designedly, for as we . are the lenders of the money, we think that we have the right to impose the conditions under which it shall be made available. What I should like to know is, whether it would be necessary for Victoria to modify her scheme so that the whole of the money which she has available for the encouragement of housing - that is, the money which she provides for herself and the money which we provide for her - must be made available on our conditions? Or would it be practicable for her to make her own money available under the conditions existing at present, and to make 'our money available under our conditions. Let me put it in another way. Money is available from source A, which is the State, and from source B, which is the Commonwealth. Would the provisions of this clause be satisfied if the authority in Victoria said that it would make the money from source A available under State conditions, and only the money from source B available under Commonwealth conditions ? </para>

                    <para>.- If the words of this clause bear their obvious meaning, the position is not as the right honorable member has put it. It appears to me that the States will not be able to take advantage of this measure unless they make all the money that they raise themselves, as well as all the money that we provide for them, available under the conditions which are set out in this clause. The States at present recognize the necessity for having different schemes to meet the varying needs of their people. Queensland, for instance, has a scheme, under which a lesser percentage of the valuation of a property, but a larger aggregate amount is made available to people within a certain limit of income; but she also has a more generous scheme which is restricted to people who have not the same income facilities. One scheme is called the Workers' Dwellings scheme and the other the Workers' Homes scheme. If Queensland desired to take advantage of this legislation, she would be obliged to amend both schemes to provide that persons whose income did not exceed £12 per week should be eligible to receive an advance up to £1,800, provided that the amount did not exceed 90 per cent. of the valuation of the property. </para>

                        <para>- Then I submit that although the members of such a commission may have expert knowledge of savings bank finance, they will not individually or collectively have any knowledge of housing schemes. Notwithstanding this, they are to be the final arbiters in any negotiations with the State authorities. The officials associated with the two schemes in operation in Queensland have had considerable experience in this branch of business; but their recommendations can be brushed aside. The bill provides in the most definite terms that the members of the commission, who have had no special experience in this class of business, shall be satisfied that all the conditions have been complied with. If the conditions are too rigid the States cannot benefit. If the clause had been framed in such a way that the housing authorities could negotiate with the commissioners there would be less objection to the proposal. </para>

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Dr. EARLE</inline> PAGE (Cowper- Trea raised by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> I may say that the position can be illustrated by a reference to the present situation in the States. There are two schemes in operation in Queensland. The Workers' Dwellings Scheme provides for a maximum advance of £S00, a deposit of 20 per cent., and is for the benefit of person's in receipt of not more than £416 per year. The Workers' Homes Act provides for an advance of £600, a deposit of 5 per cent., and is for the benefit of persons whose income does not exceed- £260. If one of those schemes were amended to comply with the provisions of this bill the difficulty would oe overcome. The conditions provided in the bill would be met if the authority was operating under a scheme as liberal as that under consideration. A State could operate two schemes, one to suit a particular class and quite independent of this proposal, and another giving more liberal terms. If a State wishes to work under only this scheme, it will be at liberty to do so if itliberalizes its provisions to the . extent required by the bill. In practice an authority operating under this bill may utilize its own resources, and those provided by the Commonwealth Savings Bank, for the one scheme; but there is no necessity for it to do so, so long as it complies with the conditions laid down in this measure. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> believe the point raised by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> would be met by the addition of the words " at least," so that the clause would read " at least 90 per cent, of the valuation." </para>

                    <para>.- Some confusion has arisen owing to the fact that two classes of business are to be dealt with under the proposed housing scheme. The various States have provided their own schemes, and have endeavoured te help persons needing financial assistance: but this bill proposes to go further. As I understand the position, the proposal is to use the State agencies; but that  connot  be accomplished under existing State legislation. The States must therefore amend their legislation to enable them to borrow money for the purposes set out in the bill. </para>

I also suggest that after the word " specified " in the same paragraph the words "in respect of moneys borrowed under this scheme," should be inserted. If that were done the States could continue to function as at present, and at the same time use the money to be made available under this bill. If that is not done a certain amount of confusion will arise. The intention of the Government is to assist in providing for certain classes of persons specified in the bill, and every effort should be made to simplify the procedure. </para>

Whether we use the word " amended " or " increased " we cannot get away from the difficulty mentioned by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore).</inline> If we increased the amount to be advanced to £1,800, and reduce the deposit, there might be an increase in the aggregate. The use of the word "increase" may be justified, but the point I am making is that the bill should provide that the State authorities should, as far as is possible, increase the number of persons to whom money should be advanced and decrease the amount of the deposit. </para>

                        <para>- Power should be given to authorities to advance at least 90 per cent., which is an extension of the powers they already possess. This proposal necessitates an amendment of State laws. It is not a matter of extending the facilities, but of amending the power of the authorities to do certain things. It involves curtailing the powers of the States. If the paragraph included the words " at least " the States which wished to do so could come under the  scheme. </para>

This measure provides that every State wishing to come under the scheme must amend its laws before doing so. Apparently there is some ambiguity; but the clause provides in effect that not one penny will be advanced to any authority unless it alters its charter, so that all moneys advanced will come within the purview of clause 9. </para>

The amendment of the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> if agreed to, would mean that every penny received from the Commonwealth would have to be treated by the States in a special way unless they brought the whole of their housing schemes into conformity with the Commonwealth scheme. Let us suppose that a State desired to retain a scheme to provide the poorer members of the community with homes on a deposit of 5 per cent. Seeing that this bill provides for u minimum deposit of 10 per cent., not one penny of federal money could be applied to the building of homes for those people; the money would have to be reserved for 'the purchase of more expensive homes for persons in receipt of bigger incomes. That would not be in conformity with the expressed intention of the Government. </para>

The Government of that State desires to continue to help them; but if this amendment is agreed to. the money received from the Commonwealth would have to be utilized in providing homes for per sons with larger incomes. The scheme in operation in Queensland provides for a maximum advance of £600 to persons whose income is less than £260. The amendment would mean that the large sums of money required for the Queensland housing scheme would still have to be found by the State without any assistance from the Commonwealth, for the reason that the scheme iu operation there is not one in respect of which an advance would be approved. </para>

                    <para>. - I object to the amendment being withdrawn unless another amendment is moved which will make it clear that the various State authorities will not be compelled to alter their existing machinery to come within the scope of this legislation. Under this clause as printed no State will be able to borrow money for housing unless it amends its legislation to comply- with the requirements of this  measure. For fifteen or twenty years the States have been developing schemes for the purpose of providing houses for the people. Western Australia has taken action along these lines since  1910,  and the eastern States instituted their housing legislation prior to that date. Honorable members should be quite clear as to the meaning of the bill. The impression I have gained is that no State will be able to receive an advance under it until it has amended its housing legislation. It has been pointed out that the States have adopted advances of varying percentages of the valuations made; but those who have studied building operations in Australia during the past ten years would hesitate to advance up to  90  per cent. as proposed under the bill, if they were lending their own money. A contractor recently informed me that workmen in Canada lay from  1,000  to  1,200  bricks a day. Some years ago I saw houses in the model suburb of Daceyville, New South "Wales, that had been erected for  £450,  and were equal in value to those now costing from  £1,100  to  £1,200.  If we insist upon advances up to  90  per cent. of the valuation, the Commonwealth will have to accept the responsibility for writing off losses in many cases. </para>

The Treasurer said that the State authorities would not keep the money advanced by the Commonwealth separate from their own funds ; but under the amendment they would be compelled to do so. The point I wish to make is that no federal money would be available for the most deserving cases that the State authorities are meeting to-day. Commonwealth funds would be provided only for the benefit of those persons with substantial salaries and requiring large homes. </para>

                    <para>.- I submit that the clause as it stands attains the object that the committee has in view. which is to make the Commonwealth scheme supplemental to those of the States. The crux of the matter seems to be the question whether a  90  per cent. limit should be imposed. The borrowing authority being entirely responsible for the repayment of the loan, it should be left to decide for itself the percentage to be advanced. All that the authority is required to do is to pass legislation in accordance with this bill. Having fulfilled that condition, it will receive the money, and I contend that it should then be at liberty to do what it pleases with the funds placed at its disposal. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to speak on this clause at a reasonable length as I refrained from speaking on the second reading of the bill. This is a bill  of great importance, as it involves the spending of a considerable sum of money. There is some obscurity in the drafting of this clause, particularly of paragraph a 2. I think honorable members who have read it will agree with me that it is a very difficult clause to interpret. I have read it a number of times, and given it more than one interpretation. It provides that the maximum amount to be lent by the authorities to any one person' should be £1,800, and should be 90 per cent, of the valuation made. I take it that the intention is that the maximum amount is to be 90 per cent., but I am not clear myself that that is the effect of the clause as it is drafted. I suggest to the Treasurer that he omit the words "shall be " in the part relating to the advance up to 90 per cent., and substitute "may be not more than." The clause would then be more understandable to the general public. There are two types of persons, two different types of owner, contemplated by this bill. There is first of all the small man, and the proposal to supply him with a house is based on humanitarian principles, and upon the desirability of every man having a house of his own to live in. But this bill goes further than that. It also contemplates the giving of assistance to the bigger man. "When the Prime Minister brought this matter forward in his policy speech I did not understand that there was any intention to provide housing for the well-to-do man, or to provide houses of the larger and more costly type. I do not think the provisions for supplying homes under this bill should be extended to what one might call mansions, and I am of opinion that if a man requires a £2,000 house the proper way for him to get it is through the ordinary business channels. I think that under this scheme it would be better for two men to have houses costing £1,000 than for one man to have a £2,000 house. Instead of increasing the size of the houses which are to be provided, I would prefer to see a larger number of houses built and a reduction made in the cost of construction. This leads me to say a word or two upon the attempt made in England a few years ago, under the supervision of the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Neville Chamberlain)</inline> to put up a great number of houses very quickly. It was found impossible to obtain sufficient labour to build- the houses of brick, and experiments were made with steel houses. A scheme was evolved for the erection of different types of houses, and specimen homes were shown in different parts of England. I saw one of these demonstration houses myself in London, and it was stated in the House of Commons that they could be constructed in large numbers at a very much less cost than brick houses could be. I quite admit that it was the intention of that scheme to get a large number of houses built very quickly, and that it was the dearth of labour for brick houses that led the Government to adopt this particular idea. But it, might be advisable to investigate the possibility of constructing houses of several types in Australia. If we adopt a housing scheme it is surely, in part at any rate, because there are people here urgently in need of houses. I ask the committee to consider whether it might not be possible for other types of houses to be constructed in Australia at a smaller cost, and in greater numbers, than at present. </para>

This is a Commonwealth housing scheme .and it is just as appropriate for us to suggest methods and types of buildings to the State authorities as to lay down the amount or percentage to be advanced on land, and the cost of the dwelling to be erected.

                    <para>Last week I paid a special visit to Glasgow in order to see for myself what was being don? in this direction by Lord Weir and by others who ave designing and building houses of different types, and I came back feeling very hopeful of the future, after what I had seen. </para>
                    <para>The idea of steel houses comes strange to many people, and especially perhaps to those who. have never seen one. and who imagine it as a sort of petrol tin, hideous to look at, and uncomfortable to live in, but I do not think, if they saw the houses I saw in Glasgow, they would maintain that view at all. Indeed, as far as the house constructed by Lord Weir is concerned, it is a misnomer to call it a steel house. It is really a house constructed with a timber frame, lined with steel plates, upon the outside, and upon the inside with a material which I think is composed of compressed wood pulp and asbestos, but which looks rather like' smooth brown cardboard. </para>

                    <para>I agree in the main with the honorable gentleman who said that the idea of demonstration houses had been a failure. I saw one of the houses : the type is very attractive, but I dare say it would need slight alterations, to make it suitable to the heat of the Australian climate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> went on to say - </para>
                    <para>But why has it been a failure? It has been a failure because the building industry has deliberately set itself against the adoption even of demonstration houses, and they have gone so far as to threaten any local authority which put up even a pair of houses - so that people might see what it was which was being, offered - that the whole labour would be taken off in houses of any other type. ... I think if it had not been for the opposition of the trade unions and the building industry, and the employers as well, these demonstration houses would have been erected in a great number of places; and I think that once people had seen the kind of thing they were they would have insisted upon having them. </para>

                <para class="block">It is arguable that it would be better to have more houses of cheaper construction than fewer houses of a better type. At any rate, that point should be given every consideration. When speaking on the great housing achievement of Great Britain, the Treasurer mentioned that to the enid of December, 1926, 411,791 houses had been built under various British schemes. According to the House of Commons <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 10th May last, the houses completed in Great Britain with government assistance, from 1919 to March, 1927, numbered 545, 2S7. The clause opens up also the subject of second mortgages. As I understand it, one of the purposes of the bill is to provide for advances to a considerable percentage of the value of the property to exclude the possibility of a second mortgage being required. In his second-reading speech the Treasurer said that where the rate of interest on a first mortgage was 6£ or 7 per cent., rates of from 9 to 12 per cent, on second mortgages were excessive. I do not agree with him. The second mortgagee has very poor security for his money, and it is not unreasonable that he should have a proportionately high rate of interest. Bates of from 9 to 12 per cent, are, therefore, not too high on second mortgages. In any case, the possibility of the presence of the second mortgagee cannot be avoided in any housing scheme unless the amount of the advance is 100 pei1 cent, of the value of the property. It is useless, therefore, to advance the argument that 90 per cent, of the valuation should be lent to the home builder in order to save him from raising a second mortgage, and the question is narrowed down to the simple issue whether 90 per cent, should be advanced on a particular house. At the present time, as honorable members know, there is a considerable shortage of money for investment, and values of city properties are high. I think the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> will agree with me that there is every prospect in the not very distant future of a slump in city values. Of course, under this bill, the risk will fall upon the State authorities; but, nevertheless, it is undesirable for this Parliament to declare that 90 per cent, is a proper proportion of the value of a property to lend to a home builder, or to indicate to the State authorities that they may advance to that amount. The ordinary trustee can advance up to 66 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I know that it is more arguable that 90 per cent, should be loaned on a house worth £1,000 than that that advance should be made on one worth £2,000, but even in the former case it means that another £100 has to be found by the borrower from his own available cash or through a second mortgage. In these days of high wages, the unmarried man on the basic wage, which is based on what is necessary to keep a married man, his wife and three children, may quite reasonably be expected to save something towards getting a house for himself when he marries. That is the time when a man would usually require assistance under a housing scheme. To my mind, it would  be wise to limit, not only the percentage which may be loaned, but also the maximum which may be advanced. In this respect. I think we ought to be guided by what is done in other parts of the world. Notwithstanding his quotations of what has been accomplished in Great Britain and on the continent as well as in the various States of Australia, the Treasurer has not suggested that in any part of the world a maximum advance of £1,800 is provided for in any housing scheme. That fact should make us pause. Is Australia so prosperous that we can afford to make advances up to 90 per cent. on a maximum value which is 50 per cent. higher than the maximum in Great Britain ? I think the maximum in Great Britain is £1,200. In order to test the' matter. I move - </para>

                    <para>.- There is no State Savings Bank in Tasmania, but there are two institutions which are really public institutions, one operating in Hobart and the other in Launceston. I am afraid that we may have in connexion with the allocation of money under this bill a repetition of what occurred some time ago when the State of Tasmania made money available in connexion with the agricultural bank. On the first morning after it was known that an amount of £50,000 was available for advances, the whole of the money was applied for and absorbed in Hobart, the other portions of the State getting none of it. I suggest that the Treasurer should make provision for this money to be allocated on, say, an electorate basis. I am in favour of the amount of the advance being reduced to £1,500, but I do not see eye to eye with the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> as to the proportion of the advance being reduced from 90 per cent. to80 per cent. </para>

It deals only with the outer and newer suburbs-, I desire the scheme to be made applicable to the older and more crowded areas. At present, in Sydney and Melbourne in particular, thousands  of families are living under the worst housing conditions in Australia. They are overcrowded, their conditions are in-' sanitary, and their children are growing up under altogether unfavorable auspices. A Commonwealth housing scheme should cover these areas. I regard this as only . a partial scheme. It provides for the  erection of freehold detached cottages, but altogether overlooks the claims of those who reside in the congested inner suburbs of big cities, where land can be purchased only at very high prices. It would be impossible on account of these high prices to buy allotments in these areas for building either detached or semi-detached cottages.I can see no reason why we should not follow the example of many great cities in other parts of the world and resume considerable inner suburban areas for the purpose of erecting on them substantial tenement houses or flats, and of providing parks anil gardens and playgrounds for the children. If such a scheme were applied to these areas, the conditions of life in thom would be entirely changed. I think the Commonwealth Government could very well take up this proposal. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment. Some time ago, at a conference of the South Australian branch of the Australian Labour party, I was successful in having a pious, and perhaps somewhat similar, motion carried to the effect that the States should undertake the building of homes along the lines mentioned by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett).</inline> I do not believe in the private ownership of property. If we could initiate a system. of State ownership of homes for the people, it would be wise for us to do so. There is nothing unusual or even original in this proposal. In various parts of the City of Adelaide cottage homes have been erected for invalid and indigent people. Bight in the centre of the city itself we have what are known as the Elder cottages, which were erected 20 or 30 years ago through the generosity of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Elder, whose name is renowned even to-day for his public spirit and beneficence. These cottages occupy a large block of land having frontages on Angas and Wakefield streets, and even to-day they are eagerly sought after by people in need of homes. Though they have been in occupation for more than twenty years, they are in an excellent state of repair, having been built under the best of conditions. They are convenient and comfortable, and are in no sense whatever slum cottages. The trust which controls thom charges a rental which is sufficient to cover maintenance and depreciation, and the scheme has been an outstanding success. We should be well advised to follow the example which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Elder set so many years ago. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment has been suggested by the savings bank authorities for the purpose of ensuring that the funds that may be made available under this bill shall be dealt with in such a way that the utmost benefit will follow the expenditure. It is felt that it would not be desirable to make large inroads into the funds simply for the purpose of discharging mortgages at, say, 7 per cent., and so saving only about½ per cent. to the individuals concerned, when by so doing other persons would be prevented from obtaining advances to buy or build homes. The- object of the amendment is to ensure that the greatest good shall be done for the greatest number, rather than that an almost insignificant measure of relief shall be granted to a few individuals. </para>
