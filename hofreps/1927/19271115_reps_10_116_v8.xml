                        <para>- No. The sale of the Line has been the subject-matter of a motion of want of confidence, and the views of honorable members on the subject have been obtained. If a sale had to be ratified by the Parliament, the only effect would be to prevent the Commonwealth from getting full value for the ships. </para>

                        <para>- As I was asked several questions upon this subject last week, I proposed, after questions on notice had been disposed of, to make a short statement in regard to it. In reply to the honorable member's specific question, I may say that only two men were shot by the expeditionary force, and the shooting was a defensive measure. The personnel of H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> has been employed only at the base camp, as I explained to the House last week. The further information in my possession is this : - Following the establishment of the base camp adjacent to the beach at Malaita, which became known as Base "B," it was decided to form an advance base at about seven hours' march inland. This base was duly established early in the month, and named Base "A." A small party of sailors from the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> was sent there as a reserve, to be called upon only in the case of some grave emergency threatening the safety of the force, which I am glad to say has not arisen, nor has it been necessary to make any request for the employment of our sailors on active operations. Scouting parties of police, strengthened by European volunteers, have been operating from Base " A " and have been in touch with the disaffected natives concerned in the massacre. Some arrests have been. made and two natives have been killed in self defence. Base " A " is now being moved to a point in the centre of the area occupied by the disaffected natives, and the situation is so well in hand that the naval force is being withdrawn. The operations will be carried out by the native police and a few volunteers, the remainder of the volunteers being withdrawn. These operations will possibly be tedious, for strict orders have been issued that their object is the arrest of the participants in the massacre and that punitive measures are not to be adopted. The unhealthiness of the climate has unfortunately caused a few casualties in the naval force, and for this reason alone it is being withdrawn from the island at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                    <para>.- I find it necessary to take this action owing to the Government having placed an order for £100,000 worth of radium with a foreign company. I intend to deal with this subject from a non-party view-point, to focus public attention on what has recently occurred and to direct attention - to the necessity of assisting an Australian industry. It is common knowledge that an order for £100,000 worth of radium has been placed with a Belgian firm known as Radium Beige, which has a complete monopoly of the sale of radium throughout the world. There is a radium deposit at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Painter,</inline> which is about 80 miles east of Copley, a station on the Oodnadatta line, and in the electorate which I have the honour to represent. It has been known since 1911 that radium existed at Mount Painter. Reports were obtained from the field at that time. The present company was formed in 1914, and up to the present has expended on developmental work the sum of £8,000. It has been found necessary to increase that expenditure considerably because the mine is situated in precipitous country at a height of from 3,000 feet to 3,450 feet above sea level, and is not easily accessible. The company has been obliged to utilize camel transport to get its ore to the railhead. If it can obtain orders from the Government for supplies of radium it will, spend £5,000 on road construction, £5,000 on the purchase of a new concentration plant, £1,000 on additional plant for the refinery at Dry Creek, £4,000 on motor transport, and £2,000 on further, developmental work ; a total of £17,000. The ore is mined and concentrated at Mount Painter, then transported by camel teams to Copley, and from Copley to Dry Creek by rail. If the company could become properly established, the industry would benefit not only South Australia, but also the whole of the Commonwealth. The transport of ore, stores and passengers would augment the railway revenue to the extent of £2,000 a year. I give these particulars to convince honorable members of the value of the industry. The company has given the Government every opportunity to purchase its radium. On the 23rd July last, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tricks,</inline> the manager, wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> as follows : - </para>

                    <para>We are informed that it is the intention of the Federal Government to purchase about £.100,000 of radium for the purpose of establishing a radium bank. We are not aware that, the Government has yet taken definite steps to obtain the supply contemplated1, and it is on. this matter we desfce an interview with, the Prime Minister. Quite recently at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Painter</inline> in the north of South Australia, u vast field of rich, radium bearing ores has been, discovered, situated about SO miles due east, from Copley railway station, between Oodnadatta and. Port Augusta. The company formed for the purpose of opening up this field is theAustralian Radium Corporation No Liability, and' which we represent as directors. We have - taken- particular care that our technical information is accurate,, as we consider we arein a position to supply, the Federal Government with its radium requirements. Our chief" drawbacks are inaccessibility, of the field, and . in order to overcome this difficulty, the company has already expended a considerable sum iii road construction, but there remains a further 5' miles to csnstruct at a' cost of f 5;000, andi over very rugged- and precipitous - country. At present we are obliged to rely on camel transport for carriage of plant, goods - and' material, and this means is far too slow- and costly. When the road construction has been completed we shall be able to send to the field adequate concentrating machinery by motor transport, and also despatch by the same means large quantities of concentrates to the rail head at Copley, thence by train to the company's treatment works at Dry Creek near Adelaide. When the mines and works are in full operation, a large number of men will be employed. The expenditure contemplated is iis follows: - </para>
                    <para>Hoad construction . . £5,000 New concentrating plant . 5,000 Additional plant ut re- 1,000 finery </para>

                    <para>We would point out that if the company i* given the opportunity of supplying the Federal Government with the required radium, it could be made available in about nine months, and at a favorable price. The Federal Governmentwould not only be encouraging a purely Australian industry, but would reap considerable railway revenue from carriage of concentrates, ores, general merchandise", machinery and passenger traffic. Our company has already produced radium from the mines at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Painter,</inline> and within the last month has sold 55 milligrammes of radium element. Radium from South Australia is now in use at the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Herman</inline> Lawrence, of CCH ins-street, Melbourne. </para>

He was evidently unaware that the local company could have supplied ten milligrammes immediately. The fact that there are 5,073 persons in Australia suffering from cancer, certainly indicates the need for the immediate purchase of something which is believed to have a curative effect on this dread disease; but it is also a strong reason for placing an order for its supply in the hands of a local company. It is well known that a powerful Belgian company practically has a monopoly of the sale of radium, and if the Australian company can be crushed out of existence, which is likely to happen if it does not get this order, its monopoly will be complete, and it can charge the medical fraternity whatever it likes for radium. Under his agreement with the Government <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burrows</inline> must come to Aus-' tralia. He cannot start operations immediately he arrives. Hospitals will have to be established in the various places, depots will have to be equipped, and staffs of experts engaged. By the time that can be done the order could be supplied by the Australian Radium Corporation. The order which the Government has placed for £100,000 worth of radium is, I understand, the largest on record, and unlesssomething extraordinary happens anorder of the same magnitude is not likely to be placed again. If this struggling Australian company could get this order,, or get equivalent assistance from the Government, an industry which is essential for the welfare of our people would become established, a hundred men will be immediately set to work in the radium field in South Australia, further employment will be provided at Dry Creek, and an opportunity will be afforded to dispose of the by-product, uranium, which is used for the colouring of tiles and paints. The facts in regard to this matter .are well summarized in the following affidavit : - </para>

                    <para>. - On the 8th November I promised the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hurry)</inline> that I would at the earliest convenient date make a complete statement regarding the purchase by the Government of £100,000 worth of radium, its application, and delivery. The desirability of acquiring a national supply of radium for the treatment of cancer was brought under the notice of the Government by the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D. Cameron)</inline> early this year, when he mentioned a Queensland citizen who was suffering from a malignant growth, and had to go to America for radium treatment. The matter was referred to the Cancer Research Committee which I had appointed in 1925 to advise me as to the treatment of cancer by radium or other means. Members of that committee were unanimously in favour of the establishment of a national radium supply under the control and direction of the Government. While inquiries were being made by the committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burrows,</inline> the well-known London specialist in radiology, arrived in Sydney to advise the Government of New South Wales on the same subject. The first information in connexion with the Australian company referred to by the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> came before me when I resumed ministerial duties in July of this year. The statement by the honorable member that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> had written on the 26th July last, stating that he had no knowledge of any decision by the Government to purchase radium was perfectly true, because at that time Cabinet bad not discussed the subject. We were informed that the utmost secrecy had to be observed in all negotiations for the purchase of such a large parcel of radium. In July I had an interview with a Melbourne doctor, who is  chairman  of directors of the Australian Radium Corporation. He informed me that his company was prepared to supply the .Government with any radium required from their mine at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Painter,</inline> in South Australia, but I gathered from that interview that the company had no stock of radium on hand, and that it would not be in a position to deliver any considerable quantities for nine months or perhaps a year. In the correspondence received from the company there was no indication when any radium could be delivered; but at interviews between its representatives and the Director-General of Health, . and also with myself, it was stated that no delivery could be made for seven months, and that at the end of this period, deliveries would be made at the rate of 100 millegrammes a week. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but the interview of July was before any order had been placed. The company communicated with the Department of Health on the 23rd July, stating that it was in a position to produce and sell to the Government all the radium required. On the 26th July the Director-General of Health replied advising the company that he had no knowledge of any decision of the Government to purchase radium ; but that should the question arise he would see that its letter was placed before the Minister. Shortly afterwards the Cabinet decided to purchase a supply of radium, and a small committee of experts, consisting of a leading surgeon and two physicists, was convened to advise concerning the details of its purchase. Both the physicists had recently been to Europe and America and had given the closest attention- to problems of radium production, preparation and. therapeutic use. . This committee met on. the 16 th August, and, after giving, consideration to the position of the Australian Radium Corporation and the representations whichhad been- made on its behalf, advised as follows? - </para>

This recommendation was approved, and the High Commissioner was cabled accordingly. Throughout the whole proceedings, subsequent to the decision of Cabinet, the closest secrecy was observed, as it was believed that if it were known that the Government was negotiating for the purchase of such ' a large quantity of radium the price would rise. I can give honorable members an assurance that all aspects of the case were before me, including the claims made on behalf of the Australian Radium Corporation.

                    <para>Having given deliberate consideration to the various aspects of the use of radium in Australia, the many difficulties in administration that would inevitably be encountered, the necessity for introducing its use to medical men of Australia by an expert, and, in particular, to avoid the perpetration of errors which may have tragic results, we' consider that it is highly desirable to obtain, if possible, the services of one of the leading English experts for a period of three years. </para>

                <para class="block">This recommendatioo was so impressively worded and was so obviously rational, that the first step taken was to engage <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burrows,</inline> one of the best experts in England, for a period of three years. Clearly, too; the proper course to follow was to associate Che- expert with the purchase of the radium. It is not sufficient to buy radium. Radium' is- prepared' in many ways for surgical1 use, and' there can be no1 question as to the advisability of the expert superintending the purchase, pre^ paratio'n and delivery of it. In view of the strong1 recommendation of the committee that the expert's Of the British Government, the scientific authorities of the National" Physical Laboratory of England, and' the world's greatest authority on radium1- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest'</inline> Rutherf bfdshould be associated with the purchase, the relative merits of - purchase in Europe and in Australia- were carefully considered. It- was felt', that the advantages* in favour of ' the  f ormetf were so  great' that1,, takea in conjunction with the fact that1, a considerable delay would' be inevitable if the order were placed in Australia, the ' Government decided' to adopt the recommendation of! its- expert advisers, and place the order through the High Commissioner. It is expected that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burrows</inline> will leave- England about the middle of December. I hope he will proceed at once in conjunction with, local committees which will probably be formed in each capital city, to make definite arrangements for making the radium available. The terms of the agreement under which it has been purchased are that the whole of the 10 grammes will be delivered in three months. Pour grammes are now in process of mounting, which is a laborious process, and will be ready for despatch within three months from the 26th October. Owing to the large increase in the incidence of cancer in Australia, the problem of its cause and treatment has been under serious consideration by the Government. Honorable members will recall that, in 1924, after my return from the fourth Assembly of the League of Nations, I spoke in this House about the incidence of tuberculosis and cancer, and indicated the necessity for the Government to cooperate with other countries which had agreed, at Geneva, in September, 1923, to have a world-wi.de inquiry into the cause and treatment of cancer. I referred to the use of X-rays and radium, and said then that great advances had been made in the treatment of certain forms of the disease by these means. Today the use of radium in certain classes of skin cancer shows a large percentage of cures, if applied before the secondary invasion of glands has occurred. My personal experience as a surgeon, and my experience in the administration of the Department of Health, have convinced me that the increase in the incidence of this disease in Australia is appalling. During the last 27 years there has been a decrease in the general death rate of 37 per cent. Infant mortality has declined by 55 per cent., and tuberculosis by 50 per cent.; but the cancer death rate has increased by 58 per cent. It is impossible to conceive a more alarming situation for any country. Statistical records show that, in the case of females between 45 years and 59 years of age, one death in every four is due to cancer. The use of radium has been most beneficial in certain types of cancer occurring in women. Not only has it cured the disease ; but in every case it has afforded relief from the pain and discomfort associated with it. It is estimated that nearly 600,000 of the present population of Australia are doomed to die of this malig nant disease, and that, if it continues to increase as it has increased during recent years, "750,000 of the people now living in Australia will succumb to it. Honorable members must recognize that there should be no delay in obtaining sufficient supplies of radium, so that any effective treatment by its use may be placed within the means of every man and woman in Australia. If the treatment effects 25 per cent, of the cures and relief of pain that are claimed for it, considerably more radium will shortly be required. </para>

                        <para>- Prom the information obtained from my technical advisers and every other source I can find no support for the statement that the necessary radium could have been purchased in Australia, and delivered within a reasonable time. The Australian company stated that at the end of seven months it could produce 100 millegrammes a week. Subsequently the production was given as 100 millegranim.es a month, but I am prepared to accept the former statement. If the position that I have outlined be true, no government would be justified in delaying for many months the purchase of our supplies of radium. We should obtain the best material from the most reliable source, with the least possible delay. I have no hesitation in saying that had I again to advise the Government - and I admit that all the information that has been given on this subject to-day was before me when I previously considered the purchase of radium - I should not alter my recommendation. In view of all the information that has been obtained on this subject, no government with the interests of Australia at heart would hesitate to take immediate action to purchase the necessary supplies of radium. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the motion of the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey),</inline> which has relation to the extraordinary and unprecedented action of the Government in purchasing £100,000 worth of radium from a Belgian company. As 90 per cent, or more of the radium that is sold throughout the world is handled by Radium Beige, that company has practically a monopoly ^ of that article. In 1904 radium was <inline font-style="italic">\^rst</inline> discovered in Australia. In 1911 a brochure was issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Verran,</inline> then Premier of South Australia, containing the locations of the various uranium bearing fields of Australia. On the 23rd July, 1927, letters were sent to both the Minister for Health and the Director of Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston.</inline> In October a long explanatory letter was sent to the Prime Minister, to the effect that Australian radium, equal in quality to the imported article, was available for the Government's requirements. Up to that time both the Minister for Health and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> had stated that they had no knowledge of any intended purchase of radium, but it is an extraordinary coincidence that on the 29th August of this year an order for ?100,000 worth of radium was placed abroad. I cannot understand why the Minister did not give the Australian company an opportunity to supply this order. The Minister referred, without exaggeration, to the sufferings and mortality due to cancer, and said that supplies of radium were urgently required. He has been in the Ministry since January, 1925. When the Cancer Research Committee was formed in Sydney, this Government granted ?5,000 towards the purchase of radium. Now it has placed an order for ?100,000 worth of radium, and it has sought to justify the secrecy of its action on the score of urgency. The use of radium for cancer treatment is beyond the experimental stage, therefore it is very necessary that Australia should exploit its own sources of radium. There are millions of tons of uranium-bearing ore at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Painter,</inline> in South Australia, and radium has been produced there. I have with me a small tube of Australian radium containing 50 milligrammes. It is a minute quantity, worth ?500, and at night its colour is a beautiful phosphorescent green. The Minister has wisely not questioned the quality of the Australian article, since it is in use in Australia. The company has spent about ?8,000 in establishing a concentrating plant at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Painter,</inline> and a refining plant at Dry Creek, and also in repairing roads. The Minister has ignored the repre- sentations of the Australian company, and secretly placed an order for radium with a Belgian company. The Minister has made out a weak case. He would give one to believe that there is no radium in Australia, whereas there is quite a good deal. I propose to show that the urgency mentioned by the Minister does not exist. The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> sent several telegrams to different people who are known to have radium, and the replies to these give a good idea of the quantity of radium at present in Australia. The quantities in. possession of hospitals are as follow - </para>

            <para class="block">It will be seen, therefore, that there is quite a large quantity of radium at present in the hands of hospitals and private practitioners in Australia. The Government now proposes to order ten grammes, which is the largest order ever given in the history of radium purchases. The quantity already in Australia, plus two or three grammes, which might be purchased at once, could have carried the Commonwealth &lt;on for a considerable time. It would then have been possible to have bought in Australia the rest of the radium required. The Minister has not yet given satisfactory reasons why at least a portion of the order was not placed in this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burrows,</inline> who is coming hefe, has recommended that two young men should be instructed in the use of radium, and that they, in turn, should pass on their knowledge to the practitioners of this country. It will be necessary to build up an organization to use the radium, and a certain period of time - at least two months - will be required in which to teach these men the use of radium. A further period of time, from two to six months, will be necessary for them to instruct other medical practitioners. Radium cannot be kept in an ordinary laboratory, but. must have special accommodation provided for it. Leaden safes must be constructed to protect users from its influence. The Minister has not satisfactorily explained why the Australian article has been ignored, and why that extraordinary and secret commission for the purchase of ?100,000 worth of radium was placed overseas. </para>

In the debate certain facts have been given. Indisputably, there are uranium  deposits in Australia carrying radioactive properties from which radium chloride of a satisfactory degree of purity has been obtained, and has been used with efficacy in some metropolitan centres. But the Minister, who interviewed individuals representing a company which is working such deposits, tells us that they were prepared to produce .only 100 milligrammes of radium . a week. As there are 52 weeks in a year, it would have taken the company two years to produce ten grammes, which is the quantity the Government has purchased. </para>

Any medical practitioner who has practised, as I have done, in outback areas, or any one who has been in touch with such practitioners, and yet states that this matter is not urgent, has not looked at it in a serious light. It may be true that there are no cases awaiting radium treatment in private institutions or in public hospitals ; but it is ridiculous to suggest that the existing sources of supply in Australia are sufficient to meet the requirements of 6,500,000 people. </para>

Ten years ago, when I was working in Edinburgh in association with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dawson</inline> Turner, we used radium for treating certain types of malignant diseases ; but the methods employed were quite different from those which have been developed more recently. Since thevalue of the new method of treatment has been revealed, an extraordinary demand has arisen for radium, and the wisdom and foresight  of the Minister in charge of Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse)</inline> has been demonstrated beyond question, for on his advice the Government has just negotiated the largest purchase of radium that has ever been made. The action was taken immediately the curative properties of the treatment were reasonably established. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Australian field should be exploited; but I am not prepared to allow human lives to be lost simply to bolster up a corporation which is interested in extracting radium from certain deposits that exist in South Australia, or out of it. A corporation which claims to control the output of ' what is said to be the richest uranium deposit in the world should have no difficulty in obtaining capital to carry on its operations, or in disposing of its products. There is a world-wide demand for radium, which sells at something like £10 per milligramme. I feel sure that, ultimately, honorable members opposite will realize the wisdom of the Government in authorizing the purchase that has been made. This radium will become available far sooner than any that may ultimately be available from Australian deposits, and it may thus be the means of saving many valuable lives. Every one who has conducted a medical practice of any extent, or who has access to the  records of our public hospitals and other institutions, must realize the urgency of the matter. I approve of the action that the Government has taken; but I trust that the local corporation will proceed with' its radium extraction project, for I am sure that it will find that every milligramme that it can produce will be eagerly snapped up, not only by private medical practitioners, but also by various hospitals, medical institutes, and scientific research organizations throughout the civilized world. </para>

                    <para>.- Honorable members generally must have listened with feelings of serious misgiving to the speech which the Minister in charge of Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse)</inline> delivered this afternoon. Moreover, they must regard with much apprehension the attitude that the Minister and the Director of Health have adopted on this subject. Had I been told privately that the Minister, whom we have always regarded as a true friend of our suffering community, would have adopted an attitude like this, I should have flatly refused to believe it. The Minister's conduct is beyond my comprehension. He has told us this afternoon that since 1925 lae has devoted special study to the subject of cancer, and that he is thoroughly acquainted with the serious effect which this malignant disease is having upon the coinmtinity generally. He submits the plea of urgency as the justification for ithis extraordinary action of placing an order for radium with a foreign company in preference to an Australian industry, yet it has . taken him two years to make up his mind to order a quantity of radium for therapeutic use. How can he expect us, in these circumstances, to believe that he regards the matter as urgent ? The Minister also told us that when, on the 28th of August, he made his decision to purchase this radium through the . High Commissioner from a foreign country, lie was familiar with all the circumstances in relation to the supplies of radium available in Australia. That statement was not correct, and he knows that it was not correct. </para>

                        <para>- At your request, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I withdraw the statement; but I intend to prove that what I said was correct. The Minister said that when on the 28th of August he placed the order for radium with a foreign country through the High Commissioner, he was acquainted with all the facts relating to the supply of radium in Australia; but if honorable members will read the speech which he delivered this afternoon, they will find that the whole argument of the Minister rests upon the one point that the Australian company could not supply deliveries at an early date. He also said that he did not know until Tuesday last, when the representative of the local company interviewed him, what quantities could be supplied, or at what times supplies could be delivered. </para>

                        <para>- To support me in this very definite conclusion I have the statutory declaration of Mr.' A. Bowler, a director of Australian Radium Corporation, dated 10th November, which states -  that no inquiry was received by our company on any matter relating to time of supply, price, or any question whatsoever from the Health Department, or from any other Government department. </para>

                <para>This, I assert, proves absolutely the case I have advanced against the Minister. Even the promise made to the company by the Director of Health, that it would be advised when supplies of radium were required, has not yet been honoured. The Minister has failed to substantiate his claim that the matter was one of urgency. Admittedly the requirements are urgent; why did he not arrange to co-ordinate the sources of supply, and get a portion from the Australian company? </para>

No matter from what angle we view this question, we can come to no other conclusion than that the Government has not acted in the best interests of the Commonwealth. It has neglected an important Australian industry. Of what use is its profession of loyalty to Australia when it deliberately passes by an Australian industry and places with a foreign company an order which an Australian company could have supplied?

                        <para>- The policy adopted by the Minister will cause delay, and his attitude is a miserable pretence. If the radium was required urgently, the Minister could have obtained some of it in Aus- " tralia. The honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Nott)</inline> said that the Australian company would be able to find a market for its product in other parts of the world. That may be so; but the Government should have given a lead by placing this order with the Australian company. Por its serious neglect of an important Australian industry, the Government merits the censure of the people. </para>

                    <para>. -  The subject before us is a difficult one for laymen to discuss, particularly when both the Minister in charge <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse)</inline> and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> are members of the medical profession, and, no doubt, acted on the advice of scientific experts who are well knowij, not only in Australia, but also in other parts of the world. Our first duty in this matter should be to express to the Minister our gratitude for having obtained the radium at all. Although from some time past a good deal has been heard of the use of radium in the treatment of cancer, it remained for the Minister in charge of Repatriation to obtain supplies of radium for that purpose. He has, moreover, placed an order for  a  large quantity. </para>

                        <para>- It could rightly be contended that the supply of radium for the treatment of cancer was not a matter .for the Commonwealth, but for the States, but, seeing that there is little likelihood of the States takingaction in that direction, we should be thankful to the Minister for what he has done. Our gratitude is due also to the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. D. Cameron)</inline> for having brought this matter forward in the first place. Those of us who have had any connexion with hospitals, and are aware of the importance of radium in the treatment of cancer, naturally are glad that supplies of radium are to be obtained with a view to reducing the mortality from that dread disease. I, therefore, do not suggest that the contract with the Belgium company should be cancelled. Nevertheless, I feel that the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> spoke very reasonably, and has made out a good case In my opinion, the matter should not be allowed to drop, but should be fully investigated by the Government. Until recently I was not aware that radium was found in Australia. Perhaps I was alone in my ignorance, . because I find in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Y earBook</inline> reference to Australia's radium production. When they placed the order * with the Belgian ".ompany, the Minister and his advisers knew that radium was obtainable in the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>A local company was prepared to give a guarantee that Australian radium would be available when required. It also stated that the element could be produced at a k lower cost than the imported article, and up to its standard. I do not speak as a prohibitionist or excessive tariffist, but if we have this element in Australia, of a satisfactory quality, and procurable at a suitable price, it is only right that we should endeavour to develop its produc-  tion. Doubtless, there was some necessity to preserve secrecy when letting the contract for such a large amount, but surely that condition would not have applied to the purchase of a smaller amount. Even if the full amount were ordered from abroad that should not have prevented the plac-  ing of an order with the local producer for a smaller quantity, so giving the Australian industry an opportunity to prove itself. I must confess that I cannot find  any very clear indication in the statement by the Minister that the claims of the Australian producer were adequately considered. I ask the honorable gentleman whether any of the scientists who advised &lt; the Government even considered the merits of the Australian production. </para>

                        <para>- The subject is a scientific one, and it not for the layman to cavil at the decision of scientists. However, it is the duty of this House to be conversant with the report of the scientists as to the potentialities of the radium industry in Australia, so that it may be guided by it in. future. As "a general rule I am not a supporter of the granting of bounties, and it appears to me that this is an instance in which a bounty may very likely be asked for, because of the lack of opporfunity to develop the industry owing to business not being forthcoming. Last year this Parliament passed a Precious Metals Prospecting Act. Surely the development of radium iri Australia is of greater moment. This Parliament also passed a Federal Aid Roads Act to assist an activity which is being well attended to throughout Australia. Surely the provision of the roads necessary for the production of Australian radium would also be beneficial to the Commonwealth. While being critical of the action of the Government, I must admit that the community is under a considerable debt of gratitude to the Minister for having ordered this radium, whether from Belgium or anywhere else. Yet I do not think one should be debarred from raising the question whether this important element cannot be satisfactorily produced in Australia. The more important the commodity - as in this case - the more desirable it is that it should be produced in Australia, if that is possible. I suggest to the Ministry that the matter should be reported upon by the Development and Migration Committee, acting in conjunction with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. </para>

                    <para>.- The matter of urgency has been abnormally ' stressed this afternoon. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse)</inline> has  apparently just discovered that cancer is a serious scourge. As far back as 1923 statistics revealed the fact that cancer had the second highest mortality amongst malignant diseases, therefore the urgency for finding a remedy with which to treat the disease was just as strong years ago as it is to-day. It is well known that radium was used for the treatment of cancer many years ago. For that reason all this talk of urgency is so much camouflage. The Minister, in interjection to the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes),</inline> said that experts in London had advised against the use of radium produced in Australia. Could one expect anything else. I should be glad if the Minister would give the name of the specialist who made that recommendation. We are informed that the Commonwealth Government has acted mainly on the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burrows.</inline> That' gentleman came to Australia a couple of years ago, and was granted an honorarium for his services. Two-thirds of that honorarium was donated by the world's radium combine. He is now coming to Australia to supervise the use of the radium which he purchased for this Government. It is common knowledge » that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Burrows</inline> is the representative of the radium combine. That combine, like many others, is running true to form by working its confidential advisers into the councils of this Government. This Government is purchasing from Belgium £100,000 worth of radium. That is .to come from the Congo, produced under the sweating conditions of black labour. We are familiar with the Belgian atrocities in the Congo, and with what is occurring there to-day. It does not matter how the unfortunate black is sweated, or under what conditions he has to work to produce the radium, the article supplied by the combine must come to Australia. We have been told that it is a matter of great urgency that this 10,000 milligrammes of radium should come here immediately. From the information placed before this House it might appear that none of bur large hospitals or institutions are able to obtain a supply of radium, of which the total supply in Australia amounts to 1,700 milligrammes. The honorable Minister contends that, if the 10,000 milligrammes is not brought to Australia immediately, human life will be endangered. I ask the honorable gentleman how long it will take to prepare suitable housing for that quantity of radium? He knows perfectly well that if it is inadequately housed its presence in Australia will be a greater menace to the community than its absence 4 would be.. The Government has not the necessary organization to distribute it. I contend, therefore, that all this talk of urgency is merely a red herring drawn across the track, and there is more in it than meets the eye. The honorable member for Herbert stated that there is a &lt; certain amount of radium in Australia - of a certain quality. ' The honorable member was unable to refute the fact that the commodity could be produced in the Commonwealth, so he endeavoured to cast a doubt on its quality. It is very unfortunate- that the Government should allow this order for £100,000 to go out of Australia, and at the same time refuse to make a thorough investigation: into the practicability of securing radium, in Australia. The use of radium to counteract disease is in its embyro stage,, but apparently the industry must go out of existence in Australia because of the hostile attitude of this Government. Such an order as the Government hasplaced would be of great benefit to this industry; but in this, as in every other instance, it has given preference to a, foreign combine. Having declined to assist this languishing, but important, industry, the Government will shortly be confronted with inability to obtain supplies of a commodity so essential to the preservation of human life. The action of the Government in this and in hundreds of similar instances, clearly indicates that it is its intention to destroy Australian industries in order to assist foreign monopolies. I deplore its action, and trust that, if it cannot cancel the contract, it will enter into some arrangement, even if it means the expenditure of money whereby only one half of the quantity required will be obtained from this foreign combine. As the Treasurer is piling up a surplus every year, and the Government of which he is a member- is willing to spend millions of pounds on warships for the destruction of  iLiiman  life, it should give some assistance to an Australian industry producing a commodity so essential to the preservation of human life. It is the duty of the Government to place the order with the Australian industry, and also to give it sufficient financial assistance to enable it to compete with its foreign competitors. I earnestly ask the Government not to allow such an imporant industry ' to lanquish, but to give it every possible assistance, and to cease from continuing the policy of preference to foreign combines. </para>

                    <para>in regard to this matter. In the first place I wish to emphasize a fact well known to the medical fraternity in Australia, that no. person in the Commonwealth has given the treatment of cancer by radium closer attention than the Minister in charge of Repatriation, who is largely responsible for a sum of  £120,000  being raised in New South Wales to assist cancer research. When a private member, the honorable gentleman strongly urged the establishment of such a fund in «tbat State, which commenced with a contribution of  £5,000  from the Commonwealth Government. This fund enabled expert advice to be obtained, and was largely responsible for the Government being able to purchase  £100,000  worth of radium, which will place Australia in a more satisfactory position in the matter of cancer treatment than any other country in the world with the exception of the United States of America. Many of the assertions of honorable members opposite are grossly inaccurate. Reference has been made to the secrecy observed in connexion with this purchase. Surely honorable members are aware that the quantity of radium in the world is limited, and as supplies are being eagerly sought by other countries, it was necessary to proceed cautiously. Had we not done so we might have obtained only' one half of the quantity we have secured for the  £100,000  spent. Our expert advisers in New South Wales urged that the utmost caution should be exercised in this matter. Another point raised by honorable members opposite was th'at in order to assist those controlling a radium deposit in South Australia, which has not yet reached the full stage of development, .the Government should wait nine months. Even at the expiration of that period, the mine would .not be able to produce one hundredth .part of our requirements. It  Avould  then be two years before it would be able to produce the quantity the Government has purchased. If the full quantity required could be made available from the local deposit immediately, it would have to be sent to the National Physical Laboratory in London and placed upon the applicators for testing purposes before it could be used in Australia. </para>

<para>The present system of inspection throughout Australia is on the whole proving satisfactory, but would be considerably improved if it were practicable to have all the fruit intended for export examined at the packing shed or at the orchard as well as at the ship's side. On Tuesday last I was asked by representatives of the Tasmanian Fruit Advisory Board to re-arrange the system in Tasmania by placing the supervision over the exportation of apples under the direction of a State officer vested with Federal authority. I am considering the representations made by the Tasmanian Advisory Board. </para>

                            <para>No. It is not the intention of the Government to cancel these gazettals. Dumping duty can be collected only if the price at which the articles are sold for export to Australia is less than the fair market value in the country of export, and if, in addition, the articles are landed in Australia at a duty-paid cost which is less than the manufacturer's wholesale selling price of similar Australian-made articles. Dumping duty is payable in few instances, as the above conditions seldom exist. </para>

                    <para>In view of the following statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce when introducing the Northern Australia. Bill on the 2nd July, 1925 : - " As in the case of the Murray Waters Commission, this commission will prepare schemes relating to development. It is intended that it shall, at the outset, prepare two sets of schemes, one outlining its ultimate aim during a period of five years, and the other setting for the the first year's programme directed to that end. The Government and Parliament will, therefore, have placed before them not only the whole of the works upon which the commission proposes to embark, but also those which it intends to- undertake during the first year " - will the Minister state what developmental proposals are being made by the North Australia Commission regarding that work which it intends to undertake during the first year in accordance with the statement abovementioned ? </para>

                    <para>No developmental proposals have yet been submitted by the North Australia Commission. The Northern Australia Act provides that, as soon as practicable after its appointment, the commission shall prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme for the development of North Australia, (that is that portion of what was previously the Northern Territory north of the 20th parallel) together with information and explanations in detail in relation thereto. With a view to complying with the provisions of the act, the commission has been actively engaged in collating the necessary data preliminary to submitting a detailed scheme of development for North Australia. The commission has since May last, when travelling became practicable after the wet season, traversed a considerable portion of the central and eastern districts of North Australia, and' has during the past two months been investigating also the potentialities of the Victoria River district in the western portion of North Australia. As soon as the commission has completed its investigations and considered the data collected it should be in a position to submit a scheme of development for North Australia.

On the estimated crop for 1927-2S the proportion is likely to be somewhat less. The production of linters, that is, the portion of the. crop which can be used as a substitute for kapok, usually forms about 5 per cent, by weight of the seed cotton, and 5 per cent, of the estimated crop of seed cotton for 1927-28 would be about 300,000 lb. As his quantity forms only 4 per cent, of kapok requirements, it is not proposed to refer the matter to the Tariff Board.

                        <para>On the 29th September I asked a question with regard to the number of British and other typewriters in use by departments of the Commonwealth Government. The reply waa that during the five years ended 30th June last year, 1,119 typewriters were imported from countries other than Great Britain, while only 36 were imported from Great Britain. As this Government professes to believe in the principle of British preference, I ask the Prime Minister is he prepared to follow the lead of the New Zealand Government, which recently purchased British typewriters to the value of £54,000, and will he in future give preference to British over American and other foreign goods? </para>

                        <para>Since the War Pensions Act was passed in 1914, the rate of pension provided for a totally incapacitated soldier has been increased by amending acts from ?2 to ?4 4s. per fortnight. In addition, special rates of pension and allowances for the more seriously incapacitated, up to ?12 per fortnight, are now provided. .All these foregoing pensions are exclusive of the pensions of the dependants. </para>
                        <para>Similarly the pensions payable to the dependants of deceased soldiers have also been increased. Under the War Pensions Act 1914-16, the pension of a widow could not exceed ?2 per fortnight, but under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act 1920 the minimum rate is ?2 7s., and she can receive up to ?4 4s. per fortnight, exclusive of the pensions for her children. Payments for children were originally provided at 10s. per fortnight, but subsequently the rates were increased to 20s. per fortnight for the first child, 15s. for the second child, and 10s. per fortnight for the third and others. Arrangements are now in course for the increasing of third and other children's rates to the level provided for the second child. Special rates are provided for children whose parents are both dead. </para>

                                    <para>A commercial four-seater - machine whilst on a regular weekly run crashed when making a landing at an aerodrome en route. The machine contained two passengers in addition to the pilot. All were killed. The pilot had joined the service of the company about three weeks before the date of the accident. Prior to joining the company, he had flown approximately 200 hours on machines of an almost identical type, and after joining the company had flown some 12 hours on the type of machine in which the accident occurred. He had been over the route on three prior occasions, and had landed at this aerodrome. The machine was found to have been thoroughly airworthy prior to flight. No evidence could be found of any subsequent defect developing, or that the pilot was other than medically fit. The evidence points to the fact that the machine stalled following an incorrect approach to land. </para>

                                    <para>During a solo flight by a pupil of a civil flying training school the machine - a light aeroplane - was seen to get into an inverted position at approximately 1,500 feet. In this position it assumed a steep gliding angle, crashing on to a set of electric tramway cables suspended on poles. The pilot was killed and the machine burnt. From the evidence it appears that the pilot had had 6 hours 25 minutes dual instruction, and flown 52 minutes solo prior to the accident. He had been grunted permission to practice steep turns at a height of 2,000 feet. Whilst engaged on this practice, and following a steep right-hand turn, the machine assumed an inverted position, from which it would have automatically recovered if all controls had been centralized. Apart from the instruction to centralize controls when in difficulty, no instruction had been given the pupil in inverted flight, as this is a very advanced form of aerobatics. The conclusion arrived at was that the inverted position of the machine was caused in the first instance through the pilot's inexperience in carrying out a steep right-hand turn, and that the failure of the machine to return to normal flying position was probably due to the control column being forced forward either - </para>

The pilot, in evidence, stated that the rudder control jambed following a steep right-hand turn carried out whilst coming in to land, and the conclusion arrived at was that this jarab- ing was in all probability caused by the feet ef the passenger interfering with a corresponding rudder bar in the passenger's cockpit. </para>

                    <para>Those machines which may now be described' as obsolete or obsolescent represent, in the majority of cases, the climax of the development of aircraft design towards the end of the war. With the exception of certain types, such as the light aeroplane which is designed especially for the private owner, ,and certain commercial types, post-war aircraft design has, up to the present, not resulted in any marked advance on the war-period types. In point of fact, development in design of British Air Force aircraft has in the main been along the lines of increased flying speed, with a resultant increase in the difficulty of operation. The types of engine in use in Australia compare favourably in respect of reliability with those used in otlier countries. </para>

The performance of an aircraft designed to fly under certain conditions of atmospheric density will decrease as the density of the atmosphere decreases. Thus in warmer parts of Australia, where in consequence atmospheric density is low, an aircraft cannot be as heavily loaded as under conditions of greater atmospheric density. This is a factor which must be borne in 'mind for safety in flying. On the other hand, weather conditions are, generally speaking, superior to those of other countries; s'o much so, that it is generally agreed that from a climatic point of view Australia is an ideal country for flying. </para>

Surveys of the whole of that section of the river between Wentworth and Echuca, and of the Mumimbidgee River, have not yet been completed. Pending completion thereof, the sites of the whole of the weirs and locks to be constructed above Mildura cannot be determined. While the costs of these weirs and' locks should on the average be somewhat lower than many of those already put in Ininti, it is quite possible that the ultimate cost of the whole of the works set out in the agreement will be in the vicinity of £14,000,000. The attention of the four contracting Governments was invited to this question by the River Murray Commission in its report for the year 1926-27, which was recently tabled in this House. In that report the reasons for the increase in the expenditure over that contemplated when the agreement was drawn up are set out. The report in question also indicates that owing to the increased costs of these works, the programme of construction for the period up to the 30th June, 1932, has been definitely limited to certain essential works which are set out in the report. </para>

                <para class="block">As I stated in my speech, on the second reading of the Land Tax Assessment Bill, now that a permanent settlement of the Commonwealth and State financial relationship is contemplated, and indeed in sight, which will keep the Federal Government in the field of income taxation for some years at least, attention has been directed towards the removal of anomalies and inequities in the Income Tax Assessment Act which past experience has disclosed. This bill contains a great number of amendments designed to remove  the3e  anomalies and inequities. A taxation bill is essentially a committee measure, but I propose now to deal at some length with the matters contained in this bill to enable honorable members to study the proposals therein with a full knowledge of their purport and of the Government's intentious. It should be borne in mind that the concessional proposals in the bill are additional to the proposed reductions in the rates of tax by 10 per cent. - except in the case of companies - as already announced in the budget, and to the reduction of the minimum tax from £1 to 10s. This bill is distinguished from previous similar measures by the much greater number of concessions to taxpayers which it contains. The principal of these I shall outline. First, there is the deduction of losses from profits. This is to permit a taxpayer who has suffered a business trading loss in one year in excess of his assessable income, if any, from other sources, to carry forward the loss or excess of the loss over the other income, as the case may be, as a deduction to be made from the assessable' income derived in the next succeeding four years, before assessing that income for tax. The next is a deduction of expenditure, to increase productivity of land. It proposes to grant a deduction in the case of a person carrying on primary production on any land of the expenditure incurred by him for - (i) eradication or extermina- i tion of animal or vegetable pests from the land ; (ii) .the destruction and removal of timbers, scrub or undergrowth indigenous to the land; the destruction of weed' or plant growth detrimental to the land; the preparation of the land for agriculture; ploughing and grassing the land for &lt; grazing purposes; and the draining of swamp or low-lying lands, where that operation improves the agricultural or grazing value of the land so drained. There is a provision liberalising the depreciation provisions for machinery and plant, including those of primary , industries. The purpose of this is to extend the existing provisions of the law relating to the complete writing off over a period of years of capital invested in plant, machinery, &amp;&lt;:., owned and used by the taxpayer in the production of income - when the taxpayer has selected the prime cost basis of calculating his deduction - so as to include the cases of taxpayers who have worked on the diminishing value basis. This will provide for obsolescence in all cases. A further provision grants to primary producers carrying on agricultural or pastoral pursuits a deduction for depreciation of capital employed to construct fences, dams and other plant, and improvements on land owned and used by them for purposes of those pursuits, but not including improvements used for domestic or residential purposes. The bill removes a serious anomaly which has prevented many purchasers of sheep in the wool from securing a deduction from the ultimate proceeds of the sale of the wool, when shorn, of the original purchase price paid for it, and provides for the effective taxation of the vendor in all cases in respect of the sale price of the wool. A concession is granted in respect of gifts to eharitable institutions, &amp;c. Deductions are allowed for so much of the taxpayer's assessable income as is donated in cash or is used to purchase gifts in kind to public charitable institutions, public universities and colleges affiliated therewith, public funds established and maintained for providing money for the construction or maintenance by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, a State or territory of the Commonwealth, of a public memorial of the Great War, and  public funds established and maintained for the purpose of providing money for public charitable institutions or for the relief of persons in necessitous cases. There is another provision, the purpose of which is to attract capital into Australia from outside sources. This object is secured by repealing the present provision which renders an Australian borrower indirectly liable to pay to the commissioner the income tax payable by the absentee lender, when the borrower has no means of recovering the tax from the absentee, and by refraining from compelling a company carrying on business in Australia indirectly to pay the income tax payable by an absentee shareholder on a dividend received from the company. There are other concessions relating to gold-mining in the Mandated Territories. Lessees in these Territories are brought into line with those in Australia who are not subject to income taxation in certain circumstances. Other concessions are made to encourage trade between Australia and these Territories. To protect the revenue against  subterfuge the bill confines to bona fide cases the existing deduction permitted of the sinking fund required to amortize expenditure by lessees on improvements of building leases where they have no tenant right in the improvements. The revenue is also protected from loss in cases where the commissioner is of the opinion, that partnerships between husband and wife have been entered into for the purpose of relieving either the husband or the wife, or both of them, from any liability to tax which would have accrued if the partnership had not been formed. There is also a provision relating to profits from walk-in, walk-out sales, &amp;c. An amendment has been provided to re-express the original intention of Parliament regarding exemption from tax in walk-in, walk-out sales of pastoral properties of profit on the sale of livestock used for breeding purposes, and to overcome the effect of recent judgments of the Supreme Court of Victoria and the High Court in the appeal of <inline font-style="italic">Weatherley</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">Commissioner of Taxation,</inline> whereby a sheep-farmer was declared to be entitled to the exemption mentioned, even though the sale of the breeding stock happened in the ordinary course of his business and was not associated with the termination of his busi' ness. Those are the main features of the bill. I shall now deal with them in detail. </para>
                <para>As regards the deduction of losses from subsequent profits, this proposal is to be associated with the present provisions of the law, which require the income tax for a year to be paid on the preceding year's income at the rate applicable to an average of the incomes and losses of that preceding year and of the four years preceding it. Under that scheme, all losses accruing in a five-year's period are taken into account in ascertaining the annual average of the net result of the five years' operations of the taxpayer. The annual average income thus obtained is then used to ascertain the rate of tax which is to be payable on the actual income of the year preceding the year of assessment. That income is not at present diminished in any way for assessment purposes by any part of it which may have been required by the taxpayer to make good any of his previous losses. The experience of the Taxation Department of the operation of the present averaging scheme under the law is that it operates inequitably in the case of persons who have sustained losses, and that, therefore, it requires amendment to give very much-needed relief to those persons. Close examination of several schemes has been made to discover one which would represent some advance on the present method towards a greater degree of equity,  haAdng  regard to th^ necessity for reasonable certainty as to revenue for the annual budget and for reasonable cost of administration. In committee I shall deal with various schemes. The Royal Commission on Taxation discussed many suggested to them, but I think it will be found that the scheme proposed by the Government will, from the point of view of the taxpayer, give a fair measure of equity, and at the same time a promise of reasonable economy in administration. Absolute equity in. a taxation measure is not economically attainable, however desirable it may be from the point of view of the taxpayer. We are all taxpayers, and are, therefore, all personally interested in the proposals, and may be depended upon to secure the greatest possible equity consistent with reasonable economy in. administration. In connexion with the further development' of rural industries the bill will, it is considered, very definitely encourage persons to undertake the improvement of unoccupied land. The encouragement will take the form of exemption from income tax of ' expenditure incurred during the income year on the objects previously mentioned. Under the present law it is not possible to allow any deduction in respect of expenditure incurred in clearing virgin forest lands aud making them ready for cultivation or grazing, or for draining swamps to make them productive for agricultural or pastoral purposes, because such expenditure is of a capital nature incurred to improve the lands. On the other hand, it is to be observed that the primary producer's capital is fundamentally the potentialities of the land, and that these are made aArailable to the community only by the expenditure of considerable sums of money. The whole of the income of a farmer is yielded by the potentialities of the land <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> land. In this respect rural land is distinctly different from city and town land. The latter land <inline font-style="italic">qua</inline> land yields nothing to the community, but as sites for buildings or factories, or other similar incomeproducing assets, the land is an opportunity to the owners of the assets to create and use those assets for purposes of gaining income from them. In the case of the city lands, it is the constructions which have been added to the land, that yield? the income, whilst in the case of rural lands it is the land which yields the income only after its potentialities have been made available by the expenditure of money in clearing timber or removing other obstacles to effective use of the constituents of the soil. It is admitted by all thinking persons in Australia that the pressing necessity of the Commonwealth is the development of rural industries and the wider and more effective development of rural lands, so as to increase the production of the 7iatural wealth of the Commonwealth. Anything which would tend to encourage persons to undertake primary production or to extend existing industry in that direction is worthy of the most earnest consideration and support. The Government believes that its proposals in this respect are fully justified from the point of view of necessary national developer. <inline font-style="italic">Earle Page.</inline> ment. The effect of the proposals upon an assessment will be to so increase the deductions in the relevant case as, possibly, to cause the aggregate of the allowable deductions of a year to exceed the total assessable income df that year. The excess of deductions over income will thus represent a " loss " for the purpose of ascertaining the averaging income when assessing any actual taxable income of a succeeding year, and for the purpose of deduction of losses from profits of the next succeeding four years. </para>
                <para>In regard to the liberalization of the provisions for obsolescence of plant, machinery, &amp;c, it may be stated that by the amendment of the law in 1924 it became possible for persons using plant, machinery, &amp;c, for purposes of any business to write off the whole of the cost of the asset during its estimated life by securing a deduction in each year's assessment of a fixed" proportion of the cost. The previous provisions of the law only permitted the deduction for depreciation to be calculated on the basis of a fixed percentage of a diminishing value, and the right to the deduction ceased with the sale or other disposal of the asset. If a loss was then sustained by the sale or disposal the loss could not be deducted in the assessment. A number of businesses availed themselves of the alternative scheme of writing off a fixed proportion of the cost each year, but there are a great many businesses which find it impossible to make this change, and are, therefore, deprived of the benefit of writing off any loss sustained by them upon the sale or other disposal of an item of plant and machinery. The bill has rearranged the provisions of the existing law so as to extend to this latter class of case the corresponding right to a deduction of any loss sustained by the sale or other disposal of an item of plant and machinery. Associated with this extension of benefit to manufacturers, the bill contains provisions for an analogous benefit to be extended to farmers and pastoralists in respect of what is certainly regarded by them as items of plant which depreciate in value each year, namely, fences, dams, and other improvements on land owned and used by the farmer or pastoralist for purposes of those pursuits. Hitherto fences, dams, &amp;c, have been re- garded as part of the land, and, therefore, not subject to deduction . for depreciation; and furthermore, it has been considered that the increment in the value of the land would offset any loss sustained through the decay of fences, &amp;c. Experience in the working of farming and pastoral properties does not, however, support this view. The value of the land is really determined by the world's market prices for the products of agricultural and pastoral businesses, and sales of land have not always reflected an increase in value of land sufficient to counteract the loss of capital through the depreciation of the improvements mentioned. It is considered that the new provision represents delayed justice to the primary producer in this respect. </para>
                <para>The bill also seeks to remove the difficulties which have confronted the administration in the past in dealing with sales of sheep in the wool, more especially in the case of a purchaser who, in connexion with his returns of income and live stock may have elected to bring his sheep to account at cost. In such a case the purchaser of sheep in  the wool has been obliged under the present form of the law to bring his sheep to account at their original cost if they are on hand at the end of his accounting periods, notwithstanding the fact that he must also bring to account as income the wool which he may have shorn from the sheep. He is thus obliged to bring the wool to account as income twice, once as shorn wool and again as constituting part of the original cost of the sheep purchased in the wool. The net result is that the purchaser does not obtain a deduction of the full price he actually paid for the wool on the * sheep's back. The difficulty in these cases has arisen particularly in those sales and purchases where no separate sale and purchase price has been fixed for the wool as distinct from the sheep, but one inclusive price for the sheep and the wool has been employed. The proposed amendment provides that in such cases the market value as at the date of the sale for similar sheep off shears shall be ascertained and deducted from the total sale price of the sheep in the wool in order to ascertain the notional sale price of the wool on the sheep's back. Thus the taxpayer will be entitled to bring his sheep to account as at the end of his accounting period at the off shears market price ascertained as stated. He will thus not have to bring to account any value for the wool which might then be on the sheep's back, as the sale value of that wool when shorn will be brought to account as income after the next shearing. The amendment will also provide that wool on the backs of breeding sheep which may be sold in a walk-in walk-out sale or in a clearance sale of live stock to put an end to the taxpayer's business, shall be valued for taxation purposes so that tax shall be paid on the value so ascertained. </para>
                <para>The next important concession to taxpayers provided for in the bill relates to gifts exceeding £5 each to public charitable institutions, public universities and colleges affiliated therewith, &amp;c. As regards gifts to public charitable institutions, the term " charitable institution " is being defined in order to remove any possible difficulty which might arise in litigation through what is apparently regarded' by the court as a somewhat obscure provision. " Public charitable institution " is defined as meaning a public hospital and a public benevolent institution, and as including a public fund established and maintained for the purpose of providing money for such institutions and for the relief of persons in necessitous circumstances. The deduction for gifts is being extended beyond cash gifts exceeding £5 each out of assessable income so as to include gifts in kind purchased out of assessable income, and the deduction is being granted in respect of gifts exceeding £5 each made to such public funds as the fund of the lord Mayor of Melbourne and the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, which have been established and maintained for the purpose of providing money for public charitable institutions or for the relief of persons in necessitous circumstances. </para>

It has also been considered appropriate and desirable to allow a deduction of similar gifts to a public fund established and maintained for providing money for the construction or maintenance by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, a State or territory of the Commonwealth of a public memorial relating to the great war. This amendment will apply to the movement in Victoria for the erection of the " Shrine of Remembrance " in Melbourne. In connexion with that movement, the committee of the National War Memorial is appealing to the citizens of Victoria for gifts to the nation in remembrance of the sacrifices made by the men and women of Victoria during the war, so as to enable the committee to complete the work. The amendment will also exempt similar contributions, if made . towards the erection of the Commonwealth War Memorial at the foot of Mount Ainslie at Canberra. It will not, however, extend to any territory outside the physical boundaries of the Commonwealth, which does not form an integral part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>The deduction will in future be permissible in regard to gifts exceeding £5 each to such public funds as a Lord Mayor's Bush Fire or Flood Relief Fund, or a similar public fund, established in a district which has suffered from such disasters. </para>
                <para>The bill contains two amendments, which, although small in the extent of their expression, are very wide in their application, namely, the abolition of the special tax on companies in respect of interest paid to absentee debentureholders and depositors of money used in Australia by the company in the production of income, and the abolition of liability on a company to pay the income tax payable by an absentee shareholder in the company in cases in which the operation of law prevents the company recovering the tax from the absentee shareholder. The object of these amendments is to attract capital into Australia by way of investment in shares of companies carrying on business in Australia, or in debentures of such a company or by way of deposit with the company for use in Australia. There is general agreement throughout the Commonwealth in the view that the Commonwealth needs additional capital for its effective and speedy development and also for the extension of existing industries of all kinds. The additional capital usually provided by the surplus of the national income derived by means of existing capital assets used by the nation has not been sufficient for this purpose. Recently, however, it has become evident that persons residing outside Australia, who may have money available for investment, have been discouraged from investing it in Australia because of the provisions of the existing laws which require deduction of income tax to be paid in Australia by the users of the money from any dividends or interest which may be payable to the lender or ex-Australian investor. The special taxes payable by the companies have operated in the following manner : - </para>
                <para>In the case of interest on debentures or deposits the companies paying the interest are entitled to deduct the interest paid when ascertaining their taxable income, so that in the ordinary assessment of the company the company does not pay tax on the interest. The absentee debenture-holder or depositor is legally liable to be ' assessed on the interest and to pay tax at the rate appropriate thereto, but as he is outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth as regards recovery of any tax so assessed, the Commonwealth does not go to the trouble of making an assessment of tax which cannot be sued for. It has merely provided in the Income Tax Assessment Act that the company paying the interest shall, in addition to its ordinary income tax on its net profits, pay income tax or. a flat rate of ls. in the £1 on the interest so paid to absentees, and that the company should be entitled to recoup itself for that payment by deducting the payment from the interest. It has been found, however, from judgments of the English Courts that where the contract for the lending of the money is made outside Australia and the principal and interest are payable outside Australia, the company must pay the interest in full to the debenture-holder or depositor. The company, therefore, finds itself in the position of having to pay income tax on interest paid to absentees in addition to paying its proper tax on its bona fide profits. This is a penalty on the company for having introduced outside capital into Australia for the purpose of deriving income from Australian sources on which it pays ordinary income tax. </para>
                <para>In the case of the dividend to the absentee shareholder, there are three classes of case to consider, namely: - </para>
                <list type="decimal">
                    <item label="(1)">
                        <para>A company established and registered and controlled outside Australia, and deriving income from Australian sources, but taking the income outside Australia and there declaring dividends. </para>

                    </item>
                    <item label="(3)">
                        <para>A company established, registered and controlled in Australia - but having absentee shareholders - deriving income from Australian sources and declaring its dividends in Australia. </para>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <para class="block">In the first class mentioned^ the company is by the terms of the Income Tax Assessment Act liable to pay the company tax of ls. in the £1 on the income derived by it from Australian sources. The absentee shareholder is in a technical sense liable to be assessed on his dividend because it is paid to him out of income derived from sources within Australia. But the shareholder is personally outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth for the purpose of recovery of that tax. The Commonwealth cannot cause the company to pay the shareholder's tax out of his dividend, because the company does not hold any money in Australia on account of the absentee, all its money has been taken outside the Commonwealth. Therefore, the absentee shareholder, escapes tax. If an Australian resident holds shares in such a company the Commonwealth can and does tax him individually on the part of his .dividend, which is paid out of the company's Australian profits. The absentee shareholder does not escape all taxation, because he pays the appropriate tax levied in the country of his domicile. In the case of residents of the United Kingdom, this tax is usually much heavier than the Commonwealth tax would be on the dividends. </para>
                <para>In the second class mentioned, the absentee shareholder may have his shares registered on an Australian register  of the shares, in which case the Commonwealth could recover the shareholder's tax from the company, and the company could recover it from the shareholder out of his dividend. But such registrations of shares are so rare as to be negligible. On the other hand, if the shares are on the ex-Australian register of the company, a recent decision by an English court shows that if the Commonwealth forced the company to pay the shareholder's tax, the company could not recover it from the shareholder, and the company would, therefore, finally bear the burden of the absentee shareholder's tax. The bill proposes that the company shall be relieved of this burden, for two reasons; first, that it is not right that one entity should have to bear the burden of the income tax payable by some one else when the person called upon to make the payment cannot recover the amount from the person on whose behalf the payment is made; and, secondly, because the Government considers that as industrial expansion is of the utmost importance to the Commonwealth, that expansion will be assisted in some measure if encouragement in the manner proposed is extended to absentees to invest their capital in business ventures operating for the good of the Commonwealth by increasing production. </para>
                <para>In the third class mentioned, an absentee shareholder, although personally outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, is subject to tax through the company by deduction of his personal tax from his dividend before it is paid to him by the company. While the company does not, therefore, bear the absentee's tax out of its own funds, the Government considers that, as the absentee is generally fairly heavily taxed in his own country in respect of his full dividend, and as there are very few absentees who are shareholders in purely Australian companies, it is a good policy to exempt the absentee shareholder from the Australian tax. Here again the course proposed will encourage the absentee to invest his capital in Australian industry. The Government desires to see extensions of, and increases in, the numbers of Australian-owned and registered companies, and believes that the proposals just outlined will assist in this direction. </para>

                <para>The bill deals in a special way, so as to limit it to bona fide cases with the deduction permitted under section 23 (1) (m) of the principal act, of the sinking fund required to amortize expenditure by lessees on improvements on building leases where they have no tenant right in the improvements. This provision of the law was intended . as relief to a bona fide lessee from taxation on so much of the income derived by him from his lease as may be necessary to be set aside each year as a sinking fund to recoup any capital outlay incurred by him in the construction of improvements on the leased land, when he had no -tenant rights in the improvements. In all these cases the lessee is obliged to surrender the improvements to the lessor upon the termination of his lease. If, therefore, he uses his capital in the erection of improvements on the land, he must recoup his capital outlay from the income from the leased property. It is, therefore, reasonable to allow the lessee a deduction of the annual sinking fund required to recoup his capital outlay, otherwise the Commonwealth would be charging him tax each year on a part of his capital. But the relief intended for bona fide lessees is now being extensively abused by freeholders forming themselves into private companies in order that the company may take a lease of the land, and so secure a deduction in the assessment of its income of the sinking fund required to recoup the cost of the improvements made by the company on the land. The amount of this annual deduction is ascertained by dividing the expenditure by the number of years in the lease. Therefore the deduction varies according to the ' period of the lease. A long lease yields a small annual deduction, whilst a short lease yields a large annual deduction. In this manner the freeholder of the land obtains, indirectly, a very great advantage by way of reduction in taxation on account of the recoupment of his own ^ capital, which is generally supplied in such cases for the use of the company. It is proposed, therefore, to deny the amortization deduction to lessees in cases where there is a lease of land to a company from any individual who directly or indirectly controls the voting power of &lt; the company, or in any other case in which the commissioner is of the opinion that, in consequence of the terms and conditions of the lease or of any circumstances associated with the lease, the lessor is in substantial control of the operations of the lessee. The decision of the commissioner in such cases will be subject to review by the Income Tax Board of Review. </para>
                <para>The bill also deals with partnerships entered into between husband and wife for the purpose of relieving either the husband or wife, of both of them, from any liability to tax which would have accrued if the partnership had not been formed. Under the ordinary provisions of the law relating to partnerships, the partnership is not taxed; but the net assessable income of the partnership is  deemed to have been derived by the respective partner, <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> to their interests in the partnership. The possibility of reducing the burden of taxation by the formation of a partnership between husbands and wives has apparently been brought prominently under the notice of a number of taxpayers by some taxation agents in various States, with the result that it is becoming extremely common for  deputy  commissioners to receive claims from taxpayers that income which, prima facie, is the income of the husband should be divided for assessment purposes between the husband and wife. In this way some taxpayers escape taxation and others secure a great reduction. In many cases partnership deeds have been submitted to the department to show that a partnership exists; but examination of the parties in some instances discloses that the husband has supplied all the capital and does all the work, while the wife remains at home attending to domestic duties. In other cases the wife has provided the whole of the capital, and while the husband performs all the work the wife remains at home engaged in domestic duties. In rare cases the capital is* subscribed by both parties who unitedly assist in working the business. In such instances the department has no difficulty in deciding that a bona fide partnership exists and division of the partnership income between the partners is accepted for purposes of assessment. Where the husband supplies the whole of the capital and does the work while the wife remains at home, it is' reasonable to infer that the partnership arrangement is a device to evade taxation wholly or in part. Where the wife supplies the capital, but does not engage in the work, the position is not in any way different from that which would exist if the husband borrowed the working capital from a bank. In such cases it is reasonable to grant a deduction in the husband's assessment of interest on the wife's capital. But the claims submitted are generally for an equal division of the profits between husband and wife, with consequent serious reduction in the tax which otherwise would have been payable. </para>
                <para>The amendment in the bill has been framed to meet what might be called the fictitious cases indicated above. It will require the partnership income to be assessed to the partnership as if it were a single individual, and without regard to any other income in which the partners might be separately and severally interested. The tax would then be paid on the total partnership income with the one deduction for the general exemption applicable to the amount of the income. </para>
                <para>The next important amendment deals with an unexpected position which was recently created by judgments of the Supreme Court of Victoria, followed on appeal by a confirmng judgment of the High Court, in the case of Weatherly v. Commissioner of Taxation. The judgments mentioned declared that an exemption from tax on the proceeds of the sale of live stock which, in the opinion of the Commissioner were ordinarily used for breeding purposes by a person who sold his business on a walk-in walk-out basis or by means of several clearing sales, also applied to a live stockowner who might sell such breeding stock in the ordinary course of a continuing business. This result is so contrary to the intention of Parliament and has such* far-reaching effects upon the revenue that the earliest opportunity has been taken to re-express the original intention of Parliament so as to limit the exemption to the sales made for the purpose of putting an end to the business of the vendor. The amendments for this purpose are being included in section 16 of the principal act which deals with what is assessable income, and are being made to operate retrospectively from the date of commencement of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1924, which contains the original provision on the subject. The other provisions of the bill are : - </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to congratulate the Treasurer upon having the honour of submitting the first budget to this Parliament in the Federal Territory, and I hope that, "with the invigorating atmosphere which prevails in this place, his forecasts will in future be more in keeping with the actual results than they have been in the past. The Treasurer, when bringing down this budget, referred to the financial agreement with the States. I do not at present intend to deal with the merits of the agreement, because that matter will come up later for consideration by this House. I want to say, however, that I entirely approve of the agreement arrived at regarding the Loan Council and the establishment of a sinking fund. I believe it is in the best interests of' Australia that we should have one borrowing authority. The Treasurer forgot to tell us that the Government's attitude on this matter constituted a complete change of front. We remember that a short time ago the Government came down with a proposal to take away the 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment from the States. It was made clear that in lieu of that payment the States would be given the exclusive right to certain forms of direct taxation, namely, the land tax, a big percentage of the income tax, the entertainments tax, and also the probate tax. That proposal engendered so much opposition in every State Parliament, among the public generally^ and from the press, that the Government found itself in a very difficult position. Notwithstanding this criticism the Treasurer on several occasions made speeches in which he said that the States would have to accept the proposals, and that the system of two collecting authorities would have to be abolished. The principle, he said, was unsound, and an alteration would have to be made. Strange to say, in a very short while afterwards, the Government entirely changed its attitude. Though this principle of double taxation was declared by the Treasurer to be unsound, the Government as soon as it felt the public pulse, and discovered that popular opinion was against it, was glad to come to terms with the State Treasurers. </para>

                <para>I wish to deal this evening with the financial position of the Commonwealth, and to make a comparison extending over the years during which the Treasurer has been in office. My analysis of the figures will show conclusively that this budget is not the financial masterpiece that the Treasurer would have us believe. Before going any further I shall quote the opinion of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Agc</inline> on this subject. In a leading article on the 29th September, 1927, the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> referring to the budget, said - </para>

                <para class="block">I shall deal first with the revenue of the Commonwealth over a period of five years, avoiding details as much as I can, and confining myself to the totals. In connexion with revenue, not including interest on loans raised for the States, but including (a) services other than Business Undertakings, <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> Business Undertakings, and (c) Territories of the Commonwealth, I find that, in 1922-23, the total revenue of the Commonwealth was £63,834,385. In 1923-24 it rose to £65,078,895; in 1924-25 it was further increased to £67,697,124. In 1925-26 the revenue was increased to £70,203,572, and in 1926-27 it rose to £75,541,761, while now the Treasurer's estimate for 1927-28 shows a further increase to £75,860,190. The revenue rose, therefore, from £63,834,385 in 1922-23, to £75,541,761 in -1926-27, an increase of £11,707,37 6. In four years the Treasurer collected £23,183,812 more than he would have had if the revenue had remained the same as in 1922-23. There has been a very large increase in revenue during the regime of the present Government, and this increase, indicates how buoyant have been the finances of the country and how fortunate the Government has been. This large increase is due almost entirely to excessive importations, which are responsible for the present depression in local industries and the creation of serious unemployment. </para>

The revenue from 1923-24 to 1926-27, inclusive, the four years after the Treasurer took office, was £111,255,500, an increase over the previous four years of £46,885,500. During -those four years the tariff was amended twice, and we thought it would have the effect of fostering our industries and preventing a large quantity of imports from coming into the country. It has not had that effect.

                <para class="block">It will be noticed that, during his first year of office, the Treasurer succeeded in reducing taxation by 2d. a head. There was a reduction of no less than 7s. lid. per head in direct taxation, but indirect taxation was increased by 7s. 9d. per head. In the next year he increased the total taxation by 3s. a head, and the following year by another ls. 7d. a head. Last year the enormous increase of lis. 7d. a head was shown. Those figures are official, and they are startling. Surely the Treasurer will not now continue telling the people what he has accomplished with regard to taxation reduction. Those figures conclusively show that the taxation has been considerably increased during the regime of this Government.

That shows plainly that this Government, with its overflowing Treasury, , if- not utilizing revenue for the carrying out essential worts, but is relying on loan money instead for the purpose. It will be seen from the table just quoted that loan expenditure on works increased by £1,667,179 in 1926-27, as compared with 1922-23. Only £216,000 was spent on new works from revenue in 1926- 27 although £2,57:1.794 was taken from » revenue for this purpose in 1921-22.

As the Treasurer took office in February, 1923, it is only fair to compare the figures from 1923-24, which embrace his first full year of office. In addition, £34,000,000 has to be raised i or migration purposes, of which amount only £2,590,500 had been raised up to 30th June, 1927, so that £31,409,500 has yet to be obtained. Quite recently this House decided to raise another £20,000,000 in order to finance the Government's housing scheme, which amount must be added to the figure I have already quoted. Notwithstanding this, the Treasurer in his budget speech told the House and incidentally the country that the Government should receive credit for its "systematic extinction of debt," and the man-, ner in which payments were being made to the sinking fund. Although the fund has been in operation for a number of years, our net natonal debt has increased by almost £6,000,000. Of what value is the Treasurer's " systematic debt extinction," to which he has referred?

                <para class="block">Although the whole of this money, in addition to an extra £700,128 which was in the loan sinking fund before the Treasurer took office, has been used in debt redemption, the gross national debt has increased by £45,467,643, and the net national' debt by £5,855,141. If this is what is meant by the Government's " systematic extinction of debt," it is difficult to forecast how disastrous the result will be in another twenty years. </para>
                <para>In view of our heavy commitments, the time has arrived when serious attention should be given to public borrowing, particularly in view of the danger of severe droughts, which would interfere with the exports of wool and wheat - products that are1 largely responsible for the present buoyant financial position.

                    <para>Does it not savour something of the humbug to make a bombastic parade about the partial extinguishment of one sort of debt when another sort of debt has simultaneously been tremendously and most recklessly augmented ? </para>

                <para class="block">I agree with that statement that it is useless to speak of extinguishing one debt if in doing so we are building up a greater one. As the war has now been over some years, and we are living in normal conditions, we should reduce rather than increase our indebtedness. Prior to the war our national debt was a mere bagatelle ; but it was largely increased in consequence of our war obligations. We naturally expected that, after trading conditions became normal, our financial position would improve rather than grow worse. Instead of extinguishing our debt in the "systematic" manner to which the Treasurer has referred, Ave shall at the end of 50 years have a new debt which will probably be twice as great as our existing debt. Let us now consider the interest bill. The figures from 1922-23 to 1926-27 are as follow:- </para>

                <para class="block">Having regard to the fact that a long period has elapsed since the termination of hostilities, it is staggering to realize that our interest bill is rapidly increasing every year, which means that higher taxation must be imposed. In 1926-27 our interest bill increased by £917,952, as compared with 1922-23, and it is expected that next year it will be further increased by another £790,207. Whilst the interest on our war debt has not increased, the interest on debt other than war debts rose from £1,431,183 in 1922-23 to £2,986,804 in 1926-27, or an increase of £1,555,621. The estimated amount of increase for 1927-28 is £3,716,720, which represents a further increase of £729,916.' The interest on our ordinary debt is growing every year, and it cannot be said that it is in consequence of our war expenditure. As there was very little public borrowing prior to the war to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth, it seems that there is room for inquiry into our whole financial position. According to figures given by the Treasurer on the 6th October, 1927, the interest paid on Commonwealth debts overseas was as follows: - 1922-23, £6,735,000; 1923-24, £6.861,000; 1924-25, £7,194,000; 1925-26, £7.851,000; and 1926-27, £8,413,000. These figures show a steady increase in the amount of interest paid on Commonwealth debts overseas. If these amounts had been paid to persons in Australia, the whole community would have benefited, as the money would have been circulated here. The figures I have just quoted disclose that- </para>

                <para class="block">It is startling to realize that in 1926-27 we paid no less than £1,678,000 more than we did in 1922-23, and that during the last four years we have paid £3,379,000 more interest overseas than we would have paid had the interest bill remained as it. was in 1922-23. It is, therefore, time that we took stock of our position to see if something cannot be done to place the financial position of the Commonwealth on a more satisfactory basis. If this money had been spent in our own country it would have been circulated and have been available for investment in industry, and perhaps have resulted in lower rates of taxation being imposed. </para>
                <para>I wish to deal now with the present conversion loan in connexion with which £29,783,840 issued at 4$ per cent, and £9,546,090 issued at 5 per cent, are redeemable on the loth December, 1927. The Treasurer, now proposes to float a £36,000,000 conversion loan at 98^ at 5J per cent. The remaining £3,000,000 is to be taken from the sinking fund for the redemption of the debt. What extra interest does this involve? The Secretary to the Treasury, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Heathershaw,</inline> issued a statement a few days ago to the effect that the bonus and interest actually means £5 lis. lOd. per cent, for a five-year period; £5 8s. lid. per cent, for a ten-year period, and £5 8s. per cent, for a sixteen-year period. Let us consider the extra interest involved if the whole of the loan is taken up for a fifteen-year period. We will assume that the £3,000,000 from the sinking fund would redeem that amount of the 4$ per cent, loan, so that in round figures £27,000,000 at 4£ per cent, interest will bear interest at £5 8s. per cent., a difference of 18s. per cent., and £9,000,000 at 5 per cent, will bear interest at £5 8s. per cent., or a difference of 8s. per cent. This means that the £27,000,000 involves an extra interest bill of £243,000 per annum, or £3,645,000 in fifteen years, and that the £9,000,000 involves an extra interest bill of £36,000 per annum, or £540,000 in fifteen years. In other words the conversion loan will mean an added interest burden over the fifteen years, of £4,185,000 - which is made up of £3,645,000 and £540,000- or £279,000 per annum. These are astounding figures, and show how necessary it is to reduce our debt and the interest burden which is being borne by the people. Every time we renew a loan we pay more for it. In this case 30s. in every hundred is paid to the investor. Of course, the interest is subject to Pederal taxation, but the figures I have quoted indicate the direction in which we are travelling, and show how necessary it is to curtail borrowing as far as it possible. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be seen that in 1924-25 we recovered, and had a balance of £4,886,863 in our favour. The year 1926 27 was, with one exception, worst than any of its predecessors. The imports for that year totalled £164,744,927, and the exports £144,775,541, an excess of imports of no less a sum than £19,969,386. Those are staggering figures. Such a state of affairs cannot continue without causing immense injury to Australia's credit. The figures relating to the three-monthly period from the beginning of July to the end of September last are even more startling. In that period the imports amounted to £41,821,762, and the exports to £28,336,453, the excess of imports over -exports being £13,485,309. Action must be taken immediately to rectify the position in which we find ourselves. The Commonwealth cannot continue to be drained in this way. From the year 1922-23 to the end of September last the excess of imports over exports amounted to £66,662,600. Could there be a more alarming set of figures? </para>

The disastrous position in which we are placed is thus apparent. A halt will have to be called. If the Commonwealth should experience a severe drought, where will we be? I should feel sorry for any Government which had to function in such circumstances. It must be remembered that certain of our exports can always find a market overseas, because they are needed by other people. I refer to wool, wheat, and bullion. Last year they were responsible for no less than £93,000,000 worth of our exports. But for them we should be in a much worse position. Fortunately we have just escaped a severe drought. </para>

Every one recognizes that the obligations are severe, that the war has been fought and won, but has not yet been paid for. That is a reason why expenditure in other directions should be severely restricted. The dealing in millions for war expenditure has had the opposite effect. lt lias made treasurers and parliaments careless about the expenditure of more millions. </para>

                    <para class="block">The final sentence is a wise one. We have become so accustomed to borrowing millions that, we regard three or four millions as an ordinary commitment. In the days before the war we approached with extreme caution the borrowing of even one million pounds. As a matter of fact, very little was borrowed prior to the war. The position which is disclosed by our trade balances indicates that our industries are suffering considerably, and that our efforts' to adjust the tariff have failed miserably. </para>
                    <para>To-day thousands of able-bodied men who are willing to work are unable to obtain it. If our trade balance was adjusted evenly a greater amount of employment would be provided by our industries. In South Australia 2,000 railway men were dismissed from their employment recently, and fur-ther dismissals are pending. That is an indication of lack of employment in industry. </para>

                            <para>- It is not. Making allowance for our comparatively small population, we are in a worse position in regard to unemployment than is any other country except England. The New South Wales Railway Department is discharging men at the moment. The Steel Works at Newcastle dismissed 300 men last week, and there were already 2,000 unemployed in that district.  A mine at Cessnock has closed, and 80 men who were employed at another mine were paid off yesterday. It is rumoured that other mines are to close, including mines at Broken Hill. Prom the point of view of the working man the outlook is appalling. Other states are experiencing similar conditions. There is a general tendency towards unemployment. That condition has, to a large extent, been created by this Parliament having failed to see that Australia's trade balances were adjusted properly, and in having allowed, the importation of such a large volume of goods, to the detriment of our own industries. Every honorable member desires that those who are willing to work should be enabled to do so, in the interest of not only themselves and their families, but also the development of this country. Every man who is idle represents a loss to Australia. A man is of value to his country only when he is producing something. Every man who is idle is a drain on it. Consequently every well organized country should see that work is provided for its people. </para>

                    <para>I wish now to make a brief reference to the note issue and the Commonwealth Bank, both of which were brought into being by the Labour party, and have contributed to the bountiful surpluses enjoyed by the Treasurer. I refer first of all to the note issue. The total profits of the note issue to the 30th June, 1927, were £15,511,9S9. Of this amount £7,780,524 was used for the redemption of Commonwealth inscribed stock and Treasury bills to the 14th December, 1920 ; £7,171,368 was paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund from the 14th December, 1920, to the 30th June, 1927, and £560,097 was paid to the Rural Credits Department during 1926 and 1927. The note issue has thus been responsible for the redemption of over £7,000,000 of debt, and the payment of over -£7,000,000 towards the production of surpluses. When Labour introduced the bill providing for the issue of Australian notes we were condemned by our opponents, and the notes themselves, as the honorable member for Werriwa has often reminded us, were contemptuously referred to as "flimsiest." No better testimony can be paid to the work of the Labour party than the fact that the Australian note issue not only stood to this country during its hour of need, but has also resulted in a profit of over £15,000,000, which has been .utilized in the manner I have described. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Bank was another creation of the Labour party. Up to the 30th June, 1927, its net profits were £6,031,513. This amount does not include the profit of £26,000 made by the Rural Credits Department. Up to the 30th June, 1923, half of the profits made by the bank were transferred to reserve fund, and half to redemption fund. Prom the 30th June, 1923, to 30th June, 1927, half of the net profits were transferred to reserve fund, and half to the national debt sinking fund. Here again profits earned by an institution founded by Labour have helped to finance the affairs of the Commonwealth. I hope that the recent amendments made by the Government will not interfere with the success of the bank in the future or be the means of reducing its profits. Time alone will show if that is likely to be the result, but I am afraid that what the Government recently has done to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act will reduce the profits of the bank. </para>
                    <para>In regard to defence, the position is very unsatisfactory.- The recent warwhich was to end war, terminated in 1918, peace was signed at Versailles, and a League of Nations was created, and has functioned on, I think, seven occasions. Yet we are no nearer disarmament to-day than we were prior to the war. As a matter of fact, I think that to-day the position is much worse than it was in 1914. Every nation is arming. Armaments are greater than ever before. "We nre spending much more on armaments to-day than we spent in 1914. </para>

                    <para>If we must have defence, as the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> suggests, our best line of defence is our AirPorce. Experts have proved that aeroplanes can go hundreds of miles out to sea and drop bombs accurately on enemy ships. Surely honorable members will see that that is the best means of defending Australia, with its long coastline. I do not say that we should not have other means of defence; but I claim that the Air Porce must play a very important part if it should ever become necessary for us to defend our shores.

It must be borne in mind that the building up of au air force necessitates a considerable outlay in hangars, workshops, aerodromes, and buildings for the accommodation of personnel, &amp;c, as well as in the training of pilots and mechanics. Up to the present the bulk of the money allotted for air defence has been expended on these services, and the Force has relied chiefly for its aircraft on the gift equipment supplied to Australia by the Imperial Government at the conclusion of the war. These machines are, however, suitable for training purposes, and while they were available, the Government would not have been justified in scrapping them in favour of more modern aircraft The supply of gift equipment is now becoming exhausted, and a commencement is being made this year to re-equip the service units and portions of the flying training school with more modern types. </para>

He declared that, although we condemned as " unspeakable barbarity " the bombing of towns twelve years ago, we were to-day deliberately preparing and practising to do the same thing. Our War Office was storing up mustard gas. Were we sure we were not also contemplating submarine warfare on merchantmen, which practice we so vigorously condemned so recently? War must end. Vague aspirations for peace were useless. A new generation was growing up with the view that war was natural and inevitable.

                    <para>Time will not permit me to go very extensively into the subject of migration, but the present position is very unsatisfactory, and some change of policy is necessary. There can be no justification for bringing thousands of migrants r,o Australia when many of our own people are unemployed. "When the Government proposed to appoint the Migration and Development Commission, honorable members on this side of the House urged that until the commission had commenced schemes that would afford additional labour, the influx of new population should be prevented-  Our advice was unheeded. Migration has continued as if the commission had made abundant openings for new arrivals; but although we have been informed that schemes representing an outlay of £5,000,000 have been approved by the commission, no work has been started that will absorb one migrant. Repeatedly we have warned the House against the danger of creating new departments, boards and commissions. We have pointed out how each creation of this kind gathers about it an ever-increasing staff, and expenditure mounts at an alarming rate. That has beeu the history of the Development and Migration Commission. I do not say that such a commission may not do good work if it sets about its job systematically, but the rate at which it has piled up expenditure in the short period of its existence is shown in the following paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> of 10th November, 1927 :- </para>

                <para>Canberra, Wednesday. - Amazing figures showing the cost of the Development and Migration Commission from its inception in August, 1926, to August last, have been tabled in the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glasgow,</inline> in answer to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden.</inline></para>
                <para>The return shows that the total cost of the commission for the year is £109,652. The commission's staff consists of 81 men in Australia, and 99 in London. The salaries of the commissioners amount to £10,949; and the salaries of the staff, £6,129; administrative expenses, £0,935; and the cost of investigation, £11,795 - a total of £35,809. Under the heading Immigration - Australian Organization, is the sum of £30,358, shown as having been spent during the year, and the London organization cost £29,242, the total cost of immigration being £73,842. </para>
                <para>Under the heading Experts and Advisers Attached to Commissioner are to be found the following particulars: - Engineer making inquiries into pumping operations in Murray Valley in connexion with dried fruits industry, 15 guineas a day; geologist engaged in making geological survey of Kalgoorlie areas, £800 a year; agricultural expert, £100 a month; officer investigating Tasmania's economic position, 5 guineas a day; forester investigating forestry in Tasmania, £600 a year; and an officer lent by Customs Department, £732 a year. </para>
                <para>Contributions to farm training schools amount to £14,240. </para>
                <para class="block">The commission is supposed to he evolving and developing schemes to absorb migrants sent to Australia under the agreement between 'he British Government, Commonwealth, and State Governments, but since .it oas been in existence the cost of bringing migrants to this country has increased from £9 7s. lOd. per head to £12 3s. 3d. per head - an increase of £2 los. od. per head. In 1926-27 Parliament voted for the commission £90,650, and the actual expenditure during the year was £99,483, but on the estimates this'' year the amount has increased to £143,000. Where will this expenditure stop? Money is being literally poured out, and so far the commission has not started one scheme that will provide employment for additional population. The new comers are supposed to settle on the hind, but no suitable land is available for them, and it is questionable whether many of them are suitable for rural employment; in fact, it is generally admitted that most of them drift back to the cities to swell the ranks of the unemployed.

                <para>A rather serious position is revealed by the Inspector-General of the Insane <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Jones)</inline> concerning the existence of insanity amongst migrants to Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jones</inline> said yesterday he intended calling for a report showing the number of aliens and other migrants in mental hospitals. This report would reveal an unduly high percentage of cases. It would also probably show that the proportion was greater than amongst native Australians. It had been shown that the mere fact of immigration, with its consequent change of life and surroundings, produced a strain on the migrant. If there had been any previous tendency to insanity, migration was likeiy to bring it out. He had pointed out in a report to Parliament in 1910 that an unduly high proportion of people of short residence in Australia were going into mental asylums. Australia had a reciprocal agreement with Scandinavia to return migrants who developed mental trouble within a short period of their coming here. There was' no such agreement with other countries. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jones</inline> considers that an international law should exist providing for the return to their native countries of migrants who become insane within two years after their settling in another country. </para>

                <para>Big Increases in Southern European Migration to Australia are shown in the latest figures issued by the Commonwealth Statistician <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. H. Wickens).</inline></para>
                <para>For the quarter ended 30th September, the excess of arrivals over departures of Southern Europeans has grown from 031 in 1925, to 1,007 in 1926, and to 2,239 this year. </para>
                <para>For the first nine months of each year the figures are 4,997 (1925), 2,309 (1926), and 0,702 (1927). The immigration of otlier European races has also increased. </para>
                <para>The figures for British whites for the first nine months of each year are: - 18,640 (1925), 24,44.7 (1926), and 24,742 (1927). the pro-, portion of Britishers to Europeans for the three years has been 70, 87, and 73 per cent, respectively. </para>
                <para>Already this year Australia has gained 33,347 persons by immigration. </para>
                <para class="block">I quote these figures so that we may know where we stand. Every one of us desires that our country should be developed. The Labour party is not opposed to immigration, but we contend that the Government should have some well-devised scheme for the employment of those who are already in Australia. Surely the position of our own people should be our first consideration.  If thousands of honest men are out of employment, are we justified in bringing other people here in large numbers? This policy can have only one result. It must interfere with Australian industrial conditions which have taken years to build up and bring about a general measure of poverty. It cannot be beneficial to any one. </para>

                    <para>I turn now to the income tax proposals of the Government. The Treasurer proposes to make certain exemptions, and to reduce income taxation by 10 per cent. This, he states, will decrease the tax to be collected during 1927-28 by £1,326,278. The present reduction represents the original rates, plus 8 per cent. The peak year for this tax was 1921-22, when it "realized £16,790,682. The estimate for 1927-28 is £9,800,000, while the estimated interest on our war debt for 1927-28 is £17,822,600. The war debt on 7th June, 1927, was £296,905,370. The position is alarming. Honorable members will -recall that the tax was imposed for the purpose of providing interest on our war debts.. Now we find that while taxation generally has been increasing considerably upon the great mass of the people, including those who took. part in the war, those who should bear the burden are being asked this year to find only .£9,800,000 towards an interest bill of over £17,000,000. It is difficult to understand the reason for the Government's attitude. Why should the Ministry constantly be making reductions in income taxation whilst the interest on our Avar debt remains at its present high figure? The Government's attitude substantiates the prediction made by honorable members on this side of the House that the cost of the war would, finally, rest on the shoulders of the poorer sections of the people. </para>
                    <para>I have examined closely the finances of the Commonwealth and have endeavoured to place before honorable members the exact position. The figures which I have quoted are absolutely reliable. Those that are not extracted from the Treasurer's budgets, have been provided by the Commonwealth Statistician, so that their accuracy is unchallengeable. They show that, under the present regime, expenditure has increased considerably, that taxation, direct and indirect combined, has been increased, and the flood of imports has become heavier, that the national debt continues to mount, and that the interest bill is becoming heavier every year. In closing, I quote the  opinion of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sunday News,</inline> of the 2nd October -  from Arst to last the budget bears all the marks of bad financing. . . .". . It is not too much to predict that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Page</inline> will ultimately destroy the Government. </para>
                    <para>I move - </para>

                        <para>.- It is desirable that, in the discussion of the budget, honorable members should detach themselves from party considerations. If they have fault to find with the financial proposals, it is their duty to submit definite remedies for the amelioration of the position. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has exercised his prerogative in critically examining the Treasurer's proposals. I take this opportunity to remind him that his party, by its advocacy and support of indirect taxation, must accept its full share of responsibility for the growth of the cost of living, the national debt and the adverse balance of trade. On a previous occasion in this House I examined the financial position of the Commonwealth, and elsewhere I have contributed my share to the creation of a public conscience concerning the unsoundness or our financial and economic position. I regret that the Leader of the Opposition failed to submit one definite remedial proposal. </para>

                            <para>- That is a natural and understandable proposition as coming from the honorable gentleman who leads the Opposition forces in this chamber. I wish to give credit where credit is due, and to criticize if criticism be necessary. At the outset I give the Government credit for the marked improvement in the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. The latest proposal was a distinct advance on the scheme outlined in this chamber last session, to which I was strongly opposed. I regard the modified agreement as a generous arrangement on the part of the Commonwealth to share with the States in the liquidation of their accumulated debts. The provision of a sinking fund means that the Commonwealth will contribute substantially to the extinction of the public debts of the States, and it will also govern the policy of all future borrowings. I am not, however, very much enamoured of public borrowing. In this respect I go much further than the majority of honorable members. I believe the time has come when, instead of merely pointing to the difficulties of our financial position, we should seek to apply the remedy. This Parliament should give a lead to the people, and by its prudence in financial transactions endeavour to correct the present unsound financial and economic position of the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, we have adopted false standards. The Commonwealth cannot afford to continue along its present course. The arrangements made for our war needs may be regarded as the starting point of our present system of unsound finance. There was then an almost complete abandonment of the ordinary business safeguards in finance and purchases for war purposes, with the result that we found ourselves saddled with a gigantic public borrowing and spending department which entirely ignored those economic and financial doctrines that should govern the expenditure of all public moneys. </para>

                            <para>- The cost of production naturally is high because the cost of living is high. We cannot sell the majority of our products in the markets of the wo/ld, not even in our own markets, except under the shelter of a high and ever-increasing tariff. The only  primary products of Australia that can hold their own in the markets of the world to-day are wool and wheat. The growers of other primary products have to go cap in hand to the Commonwealth Government, and also to the British Government, for bounties to enable them to market their products overseas. It is an unsound position, and the people have to face it. This chamber should give them a lead. I am sorry that the Government this financial year has not given that lead. The estimates for both loan expenditure and expenditure from revenue are in excess of the expenditure for last year. We cannot attempt to right our financial and economic position until we, as a national parliament, are prepared to give the lead to a campaign of economy. It is" no use minciug matters. "We have to launch a campaign to reduce public expenditure and to effect public economies, so that we may ask the people to effect private economies. We have to import less goods in order to even up the balance of trade. At present the six State Governments and the Commonwealth Government, seven sinners in all, borrow largely from overseas, and this means the vast importation of goods. Borrowing from overseas has become Australia's most lucrative industry, and the chief source of Customs revenue to the Treasury. Without it the Commonwealth could not in the present state of Federal finances pay its way. The soundest test of Australia's financial position is the position of the States, as they are the controllers of this nation!s chief assets. They control laud and land production, water and water schemes', public buildings, works, and the means of internal transportation. Every State is in financial difficulties. The Commonwealth Government's financial surplus is absolutely fictitious, because it represents a proportion of our borrowed money as collected through the Customs. We borrow a million pounds, and, taking it that our ad valorem duty is in the region of 30 per cent, we receive £700,000 worth of imported goods, and £300,000 through the Customs, and we call that revenue! We are living on borrowed money. We are, in effect, subsidizing our national efforts by money borrowed from overseas. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is but a subsidy to the national output, and we call it national prosperity. We set up standards based upon the amount of revenue we get from these sources. I should be the last person in the world to advocate that those who have won better conditions for themselves should be the first to suffer. I do not ask for . an alteration in that way. I look for a decrease in the cost of living, aud a subsequent decrease in the cost of production. The cost of living is eating into the very vitals of our race. Young men and women will not face their racial obligations to the nation. They refuse to carry on the race in the proportion in which it should be carried on because of the ever-increasing cost of living, which prevents them from establishing homes and rearing families. The need to reduce the cost of living is knocking at every door. </para>

                            <para>- We must have increased production. Until we have increased production, increased population, a reduction in the cost of living first, and a reduction in the cost of production which will follow, Australia will be unable to solve its financial problem. Western Australia launched a campaign of development. Of course, seasonal conditions have helped that State, but to its credit this year it has the promise of a yield of 35,000,000 bushels of wheat, which will be nearly equal to the yields of South Australia and Victoria put together. I wish to see the necessity forced upon this Government of living within its means, and not to live unduly, through the Customs and otherwise, upon the people and borrowed money. I again credit the Government for a reduction in land and income taxation. If there has been any increase in indirect taxation it has been with the unanimous consent of the Opposition. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the Government to shed its extra-departmental boards and commissions as far as possible. To-day they have grown up and surround ministerial control to such an extent that they have become responsible for departmental estimates and revenue. Probably no department to-day has so grown out of direct ministerial responsibility as has that controlled by the Minister for Markets and Migration, which is one of the most interesting of the Commonwealth. The Minister is surrounded by so many boards, including export control boards and the Development and Migration Commission, that his position has become a mere sinecure. It is bad governmental policy. </para>

It is purely a political stunt, for he represents a body of men who ship nothing, many of whom hold up shipping, and who, for one period&gt; held up the perishable products of this country while there was a prospect of millions of pounds worth of goods perishing on the wharves. He ought to be the last man in the world to throw gibes. I am glad that the Government has plugged up one leak. That loss of over £500,000 a year can no longer be laid at its door. ' It is to the credit of the Government that though its action is unpopular with certain sections, it did grasp that thistle and proposes to put an end to further loss of revenue from that cause. There is plenty of tonnage in the world to-day to take Australia's, exports. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the Treasurer for the present year has overestimated the revenue from Customs duties. The diminution in production will result in a lessening of importations, which, in turn, will lead to a reduction in the revenue derived from the Customs. I believe that a period of economy will be forced on the Government, and that revenue from all sources will' be below the estimate. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the honorable member for Dalley would like some of his old Queensland remedies. He is notorious for remedies, some of which were so good in Queensland that he quitted and got out of the State. When things got too hot the honorable member left. He is not the man to talk about remedies.  His  remedy is to quit, and many other leaders from the honorable member's State have done likewise. The remedies proposed by honorable members opposite at a time like this when we have lost the balance of trade, include such proposals as reducing the national effort by four hours a week, a child endowment scheme, and a national insurance scheme. </para>

                            <para>- May I say in answer to all these unruly interjections that the £20,000,000 proposed to be made available for housing will provide the nation with an asset and individuals with homes, while the liability will every year become less as the homes are paid off. That scheme is not in the same category as most of those to which I have objected. It is not a public-undertaking the value of which it will be necessary to write down 30 or 40 per cent, when completed. It means the creation of a great national asset in respect of which every year there will be a repayment of the capital cost together with interest. Such public expenditure goes right down to the roots of the social life of the people. </para>

                            <para>- The Government must go slow in federal finance, and curtail its expenditure, or the money will not be obtainable from revenue. I trust that even money borrowed for the legitimate purpose of building homes will be spent carefully. Authority was given under the bill to borrow only so much as was necessary to make up the amount required. I do not think that this huge sum can be spent for the capacity to build additional homes is limited. It was found on a previous occasion, when when a big programme of house-building was put on foot, that it was not possible to create an organization capable of maintaining that programme, and I believe that for the present scheme there will not now be that expenditure of loan money which the Treasurer anticipates. I hope that the result of discussions from both sides of the House will be to show that governments cannot subsist on the policy of oversea borrowing. They must use the funds required inside Australia over and above the amount required for the carrying on of our industries. The public debt, for the Commonwealth and States, as at 1st June, 1927, was £1,016,623,000. If interest is calculated on that amount at the current rate of 5^ per cent., it totals £52,000,000, which exactly absorbs the Australian wool clip. Our pension bill to-day is £17,769,000, which exactly takes up the estimated exportable, surplus of this year's wheat harvest of 100,500,000 bushels, from which home requirements of 30,000,000 bushels may be taken, leaving 70,500,000 bushels for export. Those two primary industries are the sheet anchor of Australian finance. What has this nation to justify its present public programme of financial expenditure ? The figures are so alarming that party politics should not enter into the question, nor, when figures are given, should there be a chorus from the Opposition merely to create a diversion. The position is so serious that it demands the best attention of every honorable member in this chamber. We are faced with responsibilities which we have to discharge. We shall be compelled to live within our means, as the present rate of borrowing cannot continue. We must live within our production, and accommodate the whole of our economics to the amount of surplus available. </para>

The honorable member for Wannon stated that the position, due to the financial drift which is occurring under the present Government, was grave, and that drastic remedies were needed. He stated that the people had to face the' situation, and that this chamber must give them a lead. When the honorable member himself was asked to specify remedies. However, he merely indulged in further generalizations. Beginning with the air of a schoolmaster, of one who had the knowledge and could impart it to the committee, the honorable member, when finally driven to the point of declaring his remedy, could only say that borrowing would have to cease. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the terms mentioned by the Treasurer If the honorable member justifies borrowing large sums like that for a housing . scheme, I take it that every State Government could justify its borrowing operations for the schemes on which it spends loan money. The programmes of the various States cover railway construction, roads construction, harbour improvements, financing local authorities for water supply, town improvement, street-making and drainage. That is all developmental work backed by definite fianancial assistance, as is the case in connexion with the Government's housing scheme. </para>

                            <para>- There is a good deal of loose thinking on the question of the loan policies of the State Governments. I do not wish to indulge in generalizations; but I recognize that except for war expenditure - which may have been inevitable, and which I do not criticise - the loan indebtedness of Australia is supported by assets infinitely greater than our public indebtedness. We must not overlook that fact. To denounce loan expenditure in a general way, as did the honorable membnr for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> is really to indulge in an alarmist policy calculated to damage the credit 'of the Commonwealth both at home and abroad. We should not keep alluding tq the money Australia has spent on public developmental works of different kinds as wasteful expenditure. That is a foolish attitude to adopt and one calculated to create alarm in the mind of the public creditor. We need to be careful. If the Commonwealth is justified in borrowing £20,000,000 to carry out its housing scheme, the States are justified in raising 90 per cent, of the money they require for carrying out works under their control. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. When commercial concerns find that their business is rapidly growing they are faced with two alternatives. They have either to raise more capital in order to expand their businesses, or to expand them in a more restricted way out of surplus earnings. Most progressive concerns will raise new capital, and that is what Australia and other nations have been doing. I admit there is a limit which should not be exceeded in matters of this sort. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly. No sane person would advocate complete cessation of public borrowing in Australia. If an attempt were made to give effect to such a policy it would be ruinous to the States. I should like to have heard what the honorable member for Wannon had to offer by way of a remedy for the serious position "which he believes to be confronting us. The only remedy I heard the honorable member offer was one embracing a cessation of public borrowing, which would be ruinous, and concerning which I heard a chorus of " hear hears." The honorable member referred to the high cost of living which every one will admit is due to several factors. It is possibly due to some of those to which the honorable member referred, such as the high protective policy which applies in Australia, and the shorter hours of labour that rule here as compared with most other countries. But surely the honorable member does not condemn the idea of a 44-hour week. </para>

                            <para>- This country is gloriously rich in natural resources. It is peopled by a race more competent than most of those living in the countries with which it has to compete. We are regarded as a people possessing greater human capacity than those of other countries, and can therefore achieve a higher standard of living and a better social order than prevails in other countries. A higher social order includes a shorter working week, and that the Prime Minister himself does not oppose. In his policy speech in 1925, he, by implication, said that he would set up an inquiry with a view to establishing a uniform 44-hour week-for Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Queensland is not in any difficulty such as the honorable member suggests. No one in the Queensland Parliament would find the least justification for making such a charge against the position of Queensland's finances as the honorable member has made against the soundness of the Commonwealth finances. The honorable member made the charge against the' Treasurer that he was fast heading for disaster, that ruin awaited us round the corner; that there was a whirl of extravagance, an absence of economy, and that the whole of our economic position was unsound. If there is a scintilla of justification for these assertions he should endeavour to solve these problems rather than be concerned with the position of the States' finances. </para>

                    <para class="block">Last Friday, in the course of a personal explanation, I referred to certain cablegrams, the text of which was included in correspondence that had passed between the Government and the Commonwealth Shipping Board. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> interjected that a further cablegram had been sent to London on behalf of the Prime Minister, to the effect that he was of the opinion that if Cabinet accepted an offer for the Bale of the Line there would be no difficulty in obtaining the ratification of Parliament to the sale. I replied that 1 had been unable to find any record of the despatch of such a cablegram, but that if one were discovered later I should inform the honorable gentleman of the fact. A cablegram in those terms cannot be found on any Government file, but in a communication from the Commonwealth Shipping Board the Government has been advised that the following cablegram was sent by Admiral Clarkson to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Larkin,</inline> who, at that time, was in London - </para>
                    <para>Secret and confidential. Referring to my telegram of to-day, for your private information, in my opinion you may definitely rely if Cabinet accepts there will be no .difficulty obtaining ratification Commonwealth Parliament. </para>
