        <para>On the 24th March, 1927, the Senate and the House of Representatives, sitting in Melbourne, resolved that the next meeting of the Parliament should be at Canberra on the 9th May, 1927. Parliament reassembled for the despatch of business on that day, when His Royal Highness the Duke of York opened Parliament House, Canberra, and delivered to the Parliament a message from His Majesty the King. </para>

        <para>At 10.40 a.m. their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York arrived at Parliament House, Canberra. </para>

            (Flinders- Prime Minister), addressing  His  Royal Highness, said -
        </para>
        <para>Your Royal Highness, </para>
        <para>It is my privilege to invite you to open the door of this building, the future home of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>We recognize that this occasion marks the beginning of a new era in the history of Australia.We look back on a story of accomplishment that fills us with pride. We look forward with confidence that we shall prove worthy of the great destiny that lies before us. </para>
        <para>In this, an hour of national heart searching, we rejoice at your presence with us.  His  Majesty the King is the visible symbol of our unity. He is the centre of all our loyalties. That be should associate himself with his Australian subjects in this historic ceremony by commissioning Your Royal Highness to represent him is a source of deep gratification to us all. We ask you to convey to  His  Majesty our devoted homage, and an assurance of our loyalty and affection to his Throne and Person. </para>
        <para>Twenty-six years have passed since the King was pleased to inaugurate the first Parliament of the Commonwealth. In those days our national aspirations were vague and almost undefined. Full of high hope and brave endeavour we were launching on an uncharted sea. We have emerged with a definite national consciousness. We have evolved great policies, which are so embedded in the soul of the nation that they not only govern our lives to-day, but point the course which we, and future generations, must inevitably follow. </para>
        <para>We have played our part in war, and proved ourselves worthy to endure. The sacrifices, sufferings, and untold trials of those who went, and those who waited, have bound us inseparably together. Within this period of little more than a quarter of a century a nation has been born. </para>
        <para>With humility in our hearts we render thanks to Divine Providence for all that we have done and are. We remember with gratitude the fostering care of the Mother Country and the protection we have enjoyed under the British flag. </para>
        <para>To-day it is our solemn duty to reaffirm our faith in our country, and our devotion to the Crown and Empire. </para>
        <para>Great though our progress has been, Australia is but on the threshold of achievement. In the future, millions of the British race will people thu continent. In numbers surpassing the Mother Land, standing resolutely for those principles of freedom and justice upon which the Empire is based, who can foretell how great may be the part our nation will play in the years to come. </para>
        <para>To-day we look back and renew our faith by remembering what has been achieved. Thus we shall strengthen ourselves for the greater accomplishment that lies before us. </para>
        <para>Within these portals will be framed those laws which will mould the destiny of a people. May those who enter this open door govern with justice, reason, and equal favour to all. .May they do so in humility and without self-interest. May they think and act nationally. May they speak with the voice of those who sent them here- the voice of the people. </para>
        <para>Inspired by those who have gone before us, let us dedicate ourselves to service, and march forward to our destiny with firm purpose and high resolve. </para>
        <para>Having opened the doors with a key presented by the Prime Minister, and returned the key to him, to be preserved as a memento of the occasion, </para>
        <para>HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS said- </para>
        <para>We are gathered here this morning to open the first meeting of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia in a new Capital City, and I should like, if I may, to try and give expression to some of the thoughts 'that come to me at this historic moment. It is impossible not to be moved by the significance of to-day's events as a great landmark in the history of Australia. I say this not only because this day sees the opening of a new Parliament House, and -marks the inauguration of a new Capital City, but more because one feels the stirring of a new birth, of quickened national activity, of a fuller consciousness of your destiny as one of the great self-governing units of the British Empire </para>
        <para>It seems particularly fitting that the inauguration of your new Capital should come so soon after the Imperial Conference, with its recognition of the growth to full nationhood of the members of the British Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>To-day marks the end of an epoch and the beginning of another, and one's thoughts turn instinctively to what the future may have in store. One's own life would hardly be worth living without its dream of better things, and the life of a nation without such dreams of a better and a larger future would be poor indeed. </para>
        <para>Standing on this spot, and looking out over the beautiful site that has been chosen for the Federal Capital, I think of those great men who worked for a Federated Australia, and whose aim was realized when my father opened the first Federal Parliament in 1901. We are now building on the foundations which they laid. </para>
        <para>I think we should have in our hearts one other virion. On Anzac Day we commemorated those gallant men and women who laid down their lives in the war. Though they have passed into the Great Beyond, they are still speaking to those who choose to listen, and if Australia listens to the voices of the noble army of the dead, and if the great army of those living, and those yet unborn, is determined to march in step with them towards the ideals for which they died, then the glorious destiny of this country will be assured for all time. </para>
        <para>The PRIME MINISTER thereupon presented to  His  Royal Highness a gold key and casket, and gave the keys of Parliament House to the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. </para>

                    <para>.- I am pleased to have the honour and privilege of supporting the motion. The words which have fallen from the lips of the right honorable the Prime Minister respecting TheirRoyal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York are appropriate to this historic occasion. It was proper that we should have a member of the Royal Family to open the new house of Parliament in this new capital city. Their presence here today indicated that the King is keenly interested in the affairs of this great dominion.  His  Majesty himself visited Australia very early in our federal history and opened the first Commonwealth Parliament, and  His  Royal Highness the Prince of Wales laid the foundation stone of this Parliament House at Canberra. We are glad that the Royal Family shows this continued interest in Australia. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The ceremony performed to-day was of the greatest importance. Effect has now been given to that provision of the Constitution which required the establishment of the Seat of Government in a truly Federal Capital. Henceforth the legislation and administration of the Commonwealth will radiate from this historic spot. Let us hope that the legislation to be passed in this building will be such as will ensure a continuance of our present peaceful international relations, and bring in a new era of peace, contentment, and prosperity for the people of Australia. Now that this Parliament has been removed from parochial influences we shall be able to make still greater endeavours to develop our country on truly national lines. Small and local mutters should be left to other legislative bodies. </para>
                <para>In this hour of satisfaction at the transfer of the national Parliament to Canberra, I trust that we shall not forget the work towards the consummation of the federation of the Australian States done by many who have now passed away. The noble efforts of those pioneers have been recorded in the pages of our history, but it is fitting that we should call them to mind on this great day. As representative men we should strive to develop this country on sane and safe lines, but at a faster pace than hitherto, so that we may not only maintain our </para>
                <para class="block">White Australia, but largely increase the white population within our shores. If we do this we shall do a great work. </para>
                <para>I believe that the motion which the Prime Minister has moved will have the enthusiastic support of every member of this Chamber, and also of every person within hearing of my voice. I am sure also that the whole of the Australian people will endorse our approval of it.

                    <para>. - I, too, desire information as to the probable date of re-assembling, and I ask the Prime Minister when replying to indicate the nature of the measures we shall then be asked to consider. Parliament has now taken up its abode in its new home, but if its recent unhappy practice of meeting for a few days and then adjourning for several months is to be persisted in we might just as well be anywhere else. Considering the favorable auspices under which Parliament has met to-day, I can see no reason why we should not at once begin the good work of which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has so eloquently spoken. It was not by closing Parliament that the work of building up this young nation was done. The foundation stones of our national life have been well and truly laid, but there is much work still to be done. While I shall not pretend for one moment that I am so passionately addicted to work as to unduly oppose the motion for adjournment for a period of unknown length, I most certainly should like the Prime </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Minister to tell us that he does not intend the adjournment to be unduly prolonged. About sixteen months of the term of this Parliament has expired; during that period, it has been in session for about four months. If in the next twenty months our sittings are only in the same proportion, we. shall have some difficulty in giving to our constituents a satisfactory account of our stewardship. I suggest to the right honorable gentleman 'that he should consider this matter from the stand-point of Parliament. This country would be better governed, and our legislation would be more calculated to promote the prosperity of the country, if we sat more regularly, and if, on being called together at infrequent intervals, we were not obliged to work at high pressure, the Government forcing through legislation almost at the point of the bayonet. That method is not characteristic of a deliberative assembly, as I understand.it. </para>

                    (Flinders- Prime Minister [5.32]. - Before this House adjourned from Melbourne to Canberra, the Leader of the Opposition, speaking on the Supply Bill, dealt exhaustively with the date of re-assembling after this formal meeting to-day. The Government then indicated that it proposed to call Parliament together as soon as possible after the necessary departments could be transferred to Canberra to enable Parliament to function here. Our conduct in this matter is governed, firstly, by the fact that Supply was granted by Parliament for only a limited period ; and, secondly, by the desire of the Government to proceed with the programme of legislation which it put before the people at the time of the general election. Upon a more appropriate occasion, I shall be able to deal convincingly with the points raised by the right honorable member for North Sydney in regard to the period for which this Parliament has been in session since I have been the Leader of the Government. As to the programme of legislation to be dealt with when Parliament does re-assemble, the Government will continue to give effect to the policy submitted to the country, and trusts that it will have the support of the House in so doing.

                        <para>. - The newspapers in the various capital cities have published inspired statements that the Government proposes to sell the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, in accordance with the recommendations alleged to be contained in the report of the Public AccountsCommittee. That sort of propaganda by the shipping combine should be resisted. I have the greatest respect for the members of the Public Accounts Committee, and I do not suggest that any one of them furnished that information to the press. I understand that the Prime Minister is inquiring into leakages of information from another committee. The proceedings of the Accounts Committee are equally important, and . I hope that steps will be taken to prevent inopportune and irregular disclosures of confidential information in future. </para>

I suggest that the peg should be preserved in either the Parliamentary Library or the National Museum, and that steps should be taken to mark the spot from which it was taken. </para>

                        <para>.- Having been at one time chairman of the Accounts Committee, I know that it has power to allow press representatives to be present during the taking of evidence ; but I understand that, in connexion with the inquiry into the Commonwealth Shipping Line, the evidence was taken <inline font-style="italic">in camera,</inline> because it was considered injudicious to give any publicity to the proceedings before the report was formally presented to Parliament. The Prime Minister should, on behalf of the House, take steps to ensure that confidential information in the possession of any committee is not improperly disclosed. An inquiry should be instituted at once to ascertain who was responsible for divulging information obtained by the Public Accounts Committee <inline font-style="italic">in camera.</inline> Any member of a committee who discloses information confidentially obtained acts unfairly to the committee and to the House. Parliament should be able to deliberate upon the reports of its committees free of any atmosphere or influence created. by the press. </para>

                    <para>As to what bos been said regarding the contents of committee reports being published before they have been made available in proper form, I agree that such disclosures are a serious matter, and I shall take every -step possible to ascertain how some of the leakages of confidential information which have recently occurred took place. It is incumbent upon me, however, to say, in fairness to our public servants, that the inquiries which have already been made into some of these cases, show that our officers are particularly loyal and act with very great discretion. The result of these investigations so far has established that there has been no leakage due to the disloyalty or indiscretion of members of the Public Service. </para>
