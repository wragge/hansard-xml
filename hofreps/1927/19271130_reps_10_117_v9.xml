          <para>.- In view of the fact that the debate on the tariff proposals is to be resumed this week, I should like to know from the Minister when the many voluminous reports by the Tariff Board will be available to honorable members. It is unfair to ask us to give consideration to the various items in the tariff schedule unless we are in possession of the board's reports and recommendations. I understand that many of the reports are already printed, but not circulated. I have previously complained of the inordinate delays that occur between the presentation of reports and their distribution to honorable members. </para>

          <para>.- No doubt the reports are available to those honorable members who ask for them; at any rate, I have secured copies of those in which I am specially interested. The convenience of honorable members, however, would be met if the reports were automatically circulated as soon as the order for their printing was given by the House. Will the Minister outline the procedure that will be followed in connexion with the forthcoming discussion on the tariff schedule? Will only a few speeches be heard before the discussion is closured, or will ample opportunity be given to all honorable members to set forth their views? The matter is of vital importance, and a full, and even protracted, debate may prove advantageous to the Minister and the subject generally. </para>

Honorable members will require to consider it in conjunction with the departmental reports and dissections, and as they cover certain confidential information, I cannot disclose them without the consent of the parties interested. I am trying, however, to obtain that consent, and as soon as possible I shall make the whole of the information available to honorable members.

          <para>. - The purpose of this clause is to amend section 16 of the principal act, in order to remove a flaw that was revealed by the judgment given this year by the High Court in the Weatherly case. Section 17 relates to what are known as walk-in and walk-out sales, and provides that a profit made by the sale of trading stock or live stock in a walk-in, walk-out transaction shall be taken into account for income tax purposes, as is quite proper. Breeding stock, however, were regarded as capital assets, and the proceeds of the sale of them were not to be included for income tax purposes. The section was intended to cover only walk-in walk-out sales, but the High Court held that it had a general application. Sub-section 1 of section 17 upon which the High Court delivered its judgment, reads :  - </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">It was intended by Parliament that the words in parenthesis should impose a limitation, but the High Court held that they were not words of limitation, and that the section meant that the proceeds derived from any sale of live stock or trading stock should be assessable income, and that the exemption in favour of breeding stock should be allowed in connexion with every sale. In the Weatherly case portion of the land on which a pastoral business was carried on had been sold, and the proceeds of the sale of breeding stock were held to be exempt from income taxation. That was not the intention of Parliament, and the purpose of this clause is to make the intention clear. Perhaps it is desirable that I should state what are the proposed amendments. Clause 9 proposes to repeal section 16, which defines assessable income, and to substitute provisions which honorable members will find on page 4 of the bill. It is now proposed to add the following paragraph :  - "and (h) in the case of any person who sells or otherwise disposes of to another person (otherwise and by way of testamentary disposition ) - </para>

It states that there shall be included in the assessable income of the person owning the sheep, the amount which, under the pro-  visions of the next succeeding section, is found or determined as the price or value of the wool as distinct fr.om the sheep. Clause 10, which seeks to amend the next succeeding section, provides for the division of the sale of sheep in the wool into two transactions - a sale of sheep and a sale of wool. Since that provision was drafted, representations have been made on behalf of persons interested, and I propose, later, to move an amendment in that clause, the object being to substitute a new provision to make the division of a sale of sheep in the wool into two transactions optional at the desire of the purchaser. It will not affect the vendor. If the purchaser does not wish to have the transaction divided in the manner suggested, he can come under the present system. It is obvious that it would be exceedingly difficult to divide the transaction in every instance, because of the difficulty in assessing the value of two or three months' wool on a sheep. To meet the views of those who have made representations to the government it is proposed to make the division of the sale optional so far as the purchaser is concerned. </para><interjection>

They deal with the method of distributing the purchase price between the wool and the sheep. This particular amendment is merely a drafting and verbal matter. The substantial question refers to breeding stock, and clause 9 provides for the exemption of the proceeds of the sale of breeding stock from inclusion in income in the case of walk-in walk-out sales. It also provides that when the livestock sold includes sheep in the wool, even when they are breeding stock, money received for the wool shall be included for the purposes of income tax. </para>

            <para>- No, breeding ewes and rams. Wool is income, and not capital. Breeding stock may be regarded as a machine that produces income in the form of wool. The words after " except " produce this result. While the machine that provides the income is exempted from taxation in respect of any accretion in value, the wool which the machine produces should pay income tax in the ordinary way. The proposed legislation provides that where sheep are sold in the wool the value of the wool is to be ascertained in the manner provided in sub-clauses 2 and <inline font-style="italic">3</inline> of clause 10. That method is, substantially, that the sale price of the sheep is to be worked out according to any contract specifying the value of the sheep, otherwise on the market value, or in other cases according to the determination of the commissioner. </para>

            <para>- I am not posing before the committee as an expert on the pastoral industry, and what I say is subject to correction. We can all understand and identify the sale of the whole of the stock on a station, but it would be very difficult to apply the principle to sales of a portion of the stock on  a  station, in view of the culling that takes place every year from breeding sheep. There is no reason why there should be an exemption on the sale of culls, or why there should be an exemption' on ordinary commercial sales of breeding stock. Frequently breeding stock is sold by pastoralists and there appears to be no reason why there should be 'an exemption in such a case, which is trading in the ordinary course of business, as distinct from walk-in walk-out, or compulsory acquisition. To a large extent it is  a  matter of practical business. If the exemption were extended, it is difficult to see where it would end. </para>

          <para>.- One is confronted with a difficulty when dealing with clauses 9 and 10. I take it that, on the amendment of the Attorney-General, we are confined to  a  debate on the sale of breeding stock on a walk-in walk-out basis, or on a compulsory acquisition. It is impossible to discuss the sale of breeding stock on  a  walk-in walk-out or compulsory acquisition basis, which involves the separation of the wool from the sheep, without trespassing on the provisions of clause 10. </para>

            <para>- There is something in the contention of the Prime Minister. There is also involved the task of computing the value of the wool on the back of the breeding sheep. At the present time, without the innovation of the new system of separating the wool from the sheep, the purchaser is able to protect himself as to price, and so forth, because the wool on the sheep that he purchases passes with the sheep into his year of accounting, and he thus makes his assessment of the value of the sheep, knowing that he will have to account for the wool, which may be quarter, half, or say three-quarter wool. The vendor is asked to account, in some instances, for the wool in the taxable period, -plus portion of the new clip that passes on to a second person, where the vendor has incurred some of the costs of production in the second period. He may be landed, in his income, with the whole of the cost of the production of the previous clip, plus a proportion of the cost of the new clip.  </para>

            <para>- That is why I contend that it is difficult to discuss and arrive at a decision on this matter without a consideration of the next clause. While I am certain that the taxation commissioner and the Government desire to render relief under clause 10 and to separate the two commodities as far as possible, at the date of sale, it will be found, in practice, that the operation of this machinery would be most involved and difficult. I do not think it will be workable. I know of no practical system of appraisement that can be adopted, and, as there are at least 848 different types of wool in Australia, the scheme will be almost impracticable. </para>

            <para>- It may be easy enough in theory, but, in my opinion, it will be difficult in practice. At first, 1 was inclined to favour the proposal, believing that it was an attempt to help taxpayers; but, on further examination, I have come to the conclusion that it will not work. Let us suppose that a taxpayer whose year ends on 30th June, shears in October, and that on the 30th April of the following year he sells out. He will be taxed in the year of sale on his 12 months' wOOl clip, shorn in October, and also on that part of the purchase money represented by the six months' wool on the back of his breeders, whereas his expenses will only cover the period from the 30th June to 30th April. I submit that in practice it would be un-'. wise to separate the wool from the sheep. </para>

            <para>- Yes ; and unmatched half clip. I think that the Attorney-General will find that in practice his proposal will not work out as on paper it would appear to do. It would be better to leave the sheep with the wool until the next shearing time comes round, and to let the man who reaps the harvest declare the whole of his expenses. He should be able to bring his clip and his expenses into account. Surely the trading community is the best judge of how to buy sheep ! This " rule of thumb " system will only confuse the stock and trading community. The honorable the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson)</inline> shakes his head; but I remind him that the vendor must take into account his transactions over a period of eighteen months. To a great extent that is an interference with the free process of negotiation between vendor and purchaser in respect of one of our greatest national assets - our live stock. </para>

          <para>.- Like the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> I do not claim to have had much experience as a pastoralist; but I am beginning to understand the position of the pastoralist from a  taxation point of view. I take it that the general principle embodied in clause 10 - and this matter can scarcely be discussed without referring to that clause - is to relieve the taxpayer who has purchased sheep in the wool. If he purchases sheep in the wool, the price he pays for them must necessarily include the value of the wool on their backs. Later, when he shears the sheep and sells the clip, he pays income tax upon the proceeds. Surely, in that case, he is entitled to some deduction for what he paid for the wool. That is the whole point. If a person buys stock from a wholesale merchant, and sells it, he must take it into account at the price paid for it. If he pays for the wool on the sheep's backs, and later, shears the sheep and sells the clip, he should be entitled to deduct the price paid for the wool before his income can be ascertained. </para>

            <para>- How do we distinguish between ewes and wethers for taxation purposes? Wethers are kept chiefly for their wool. Surely the wethers are as much an asset as the ewes. A wether cannot be treated as capital, because it is not beeding stock. In the case of a clearing sale, only breeding stock is regarded as capital. I could understand this exception being made in respect of stud stock, but not in the case of ordinary ewes which are kept largely for their wool. Ewes are kept both for breeding purposes and for their wool. The wether is as much an asset as is the ewe, but because of the fine distinction made, revenue is lost. I do not strongly object to that. The honorable member for Wannon, however, goes further, and says, that if a flock of ewes is sold at the winding up of a business, no account should be taken of the wool on their backs. I point out that if the sale was not effected those ewes would be shorn, probably the next month, and on the clip obtained from them the owner would have to pay income tax. The honorable member cannot have it both ways. We cannot allow a purchaser of stock to deduct the price he pays for the wool on the backs of the sheep, and also, when he sells those sheep later at a clearing sale, to get an exemption from taxation for the wool on the backs of breeding stock. </para>

            <para>- Let us assume that a pastoralist was selling out. If, at the beginning of an accounting period, he took his sheep into account at a certain value, the wool which they had grown while in his possession, would add to their value no matter to what extent it had grown. If the sheep are in the wool in each case, there will be no income tax payable on the increased value of the sheep. But if a man buys sheep soon after they have been shorn and keeps them he should pay tax on the value of the wool obtained from them. The purchaser is protected; but a man who buys sheep at a fairly low price because there is no wool on them, and after a period of six months sells them in the wool, and receives an entire exemption from taxation because they are breeding stock, is obtaining a benefit. If he retains them a little longer, and shears them, he will have to pay income tax on the price received for the wool. The principle underlying the department's suggestion that the purchaser shall be allowed to deduct from the price obtained for the sheep, the value of the wool on their backs insists that in the case of a clearing sale the two things must be separated. </para>

          <para>. -  Special provision for walk-in walk-out sales is necessary, because it is arguable whether in the absence of similar provision the proceeds of such sales are income at all. In the case of other sales, the ordinary provision as to sales applies; the clip from the whole flock, including the breeding stock, is taken into account. Unless there was a special provision dealing with walk-in-walk-out sales, the court might hold that taxation should not be imposed upon any moneys resulting from the sale of a business as distinct from the carrying on of a business. Income is earned in the carrying on of a business. If a man sells his business, then, prima facie, it is not an income-producing operation; it is a realization of assets. At least, it includes the sale of capital assets. It was held in the High Court that in a walk-in and walk-out sale no income tax was payable in respect of the year in which the sale occurred, although, of course, what was sold included the annual produce. Therefore, it is provided that after a walk-in-walk-out sale the proceeds from ordinary trading stock or live-stock shall be taxed; but a distinction is drawn between capital assets and other assets. The sale of capital assets is not an income-producing operation. If it is a  profitable sale, it may make the seller wealthier than he was before; but only by a fortunate sale of capital assets. It is thought proper that, when trading stock of any description, whether sheep or the stock-in-trade of an ironmonger or any other trader is sold for the purpose of putting an end to a business, the proceeds should be regarded as income; but an endeavour is made in this clause to distinguish between sales of capital assets, such as breeding stock, and other sales, and to provide that any profit on the sale of capital assets shall not be regarded as income. This clause is based upon the view that the proceeds of the sale of wool growing on breeding stock is in the nature of income. </para>

          <para>.- It seems to me that, in a walk-in and walkout sale, not only the sheep but also the wool on the sheep's back is part of a pastoralists capital assets. I cannot conceive of separating the wool from the sheep, because, on the average, the wool on the sheep would represent 40 per cent, of the value of the animal, if it were in full wool. Purchasing a sheep is like buying a store and paying, say, £1,000 for the building, and £500 for the stock that is in it. It would be necessary for the seller to - debit his wool account 40 per cent., and credit his sheep account by that amount, in order to keep his accounts in perfect order and see that he was taxed in an equitable manner. If in a walk-in and walk-out sale, a man sells his sheep in full wool, he disposes of part of his capital assets. If he realizes on the wool, he gets a return for it while he is in business; but when he sells his sheep he sells the sheep and wool. Therefore, I say unhesitatingly that he sells part of his capital assets. </para>

          <para>. - I have with interest heard the learned discussion on this matter, and I cannot help wondering what the ordinary breeder of sheep would have made of it if he had been listening. A number of honorable members know something about sheep, and I do not think that even they are too sure of the effect of the provisions under consideration. It .seems to me that the provision at the end of clause 9 is proposed to be inserted in the act merely with the object of seeing that, in the case of a walk-in-walk-out sale, the seller shall not escape paying a certain amount of income tax, which may easily be a negligible sum. That principle is carried into the next clause, which makes a distinction in detail as between wool and sheep. I should like the Attorney-General to make it clear whether this distinction is the result of definite recommendations to the Government by any authorized and reliable body of pastoralists, graziers, or sheep-breeders. If it is not, I am opposed to it. If there is reputable authority for considering that the provisions are workable, and that any authorized body of sheep breeders supports them, I shall be prepared to consider them. But, otherwise, it seems to me, after listening to what has been said, and after reading the clause myself, that they are highly legal provisions, which are simply the despair of the man on the land. Goodness knows, he has to make enough returns already. He has to declare the- number of fruit trees growing on his property, and I am not sure that he has not to estimate the number of eggs that his fowls will probably lay .in the next year! Men at sales in the country know little of legal details. Their business is simply to buy or sell stock. It seems most unwise to pass any law the effect of which we are not quite certain, and which may embarrass them. I must say that, on the whole, I think that the amendment suggested by the Attorney-General is an improvement on the bill as originally drafted. Clause 10 provides for the repeal of section 17 of the principal act and the insertion of a new section. Subsection 1, as. proposed to be amended, will read - </para>

        <para class="block">We all know that, in walk-in-walk-out out sales, it is customary for different values to be placed upon . the land with, of course, the buildings, and also separately upon the stock. I remember  that some fifteen years ago it was held - I think in a Queensland case - that, unless it was agreed at the time of the sale that the various goods should be separated, the separation for taxation purposes was not valid. In other words, if a lump sum was offered for the whole lot, the purchaser had to pay tax, or at any rate stamp duty, on the whole amount - on the value of the stock, as well as on the value of the land and the buildings erected thereon. The point is that the agreement had to be made at the time. But, under this provision, the unfortunate man on the land who sits down perhaps months afterwards to fill in his return, will need to calculate what percentage of wool was on the sheep six months previously. My remarks are not intended to embarrass the Government in any way. I am sure that the clause was drafted in order to avoid double taxation, and was intended to be of assistance to the man on the land. But I put it to the Government that the existing provision is good enough. It is better to leave the law as it stands than bring about some difficult legal position, which is not understood even by honorable members. </para>

          <para>. -  This is a most important matter. In the first place %ve must appreciate the distinction between breeding stock and the wool upon their backs. Following up the argument of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> as to whether breeding stock should be regarded as a capital asset, I point out that it has been the practice for some time to adopt that view, and exempt the proceeds of their sale from income taxation. Breeding stock has been taken as part of the capital assets of the pastoralist, in the same way as machinery is regarded as among the capital assets of the manufacturer. But the position in regard to the wool is a very different one. 'In the event of a walk-in-walk-out sale, the value of the wool is taken into account, and it is treated as part of the ordinary trading profits of the pastoralist, income tax being charged upon the profit from its sale. At the time of a walk-in-walk-out sale, there is, possibly, ten months' wool on the sheep, and the wool would have been shorn very soon afterwards and brought to account. Obviously it is not part of the capital assets. I have had considerable discussion on this matter with the representatives of the pastoralists, who, I can assure honorable members, have taken all the points that could be raised to show that the capital assets consist of the sheep plus the wool. One of the points they make is that the wool is not physically detached from the animal that produces it, and that, therefore it still remains part of the capital asset. The Government cannot accept that view. We come then to the consideration of the position in regard to the wool. It may be said that it does not matter so long as somebody pays tax upon it, and that the Government should not worry about it at all. ' The sale consists in the disposal of the capital asset plus part of the ordinary trading asset, namely, the wool on the sheep, and this is sold to somebody else. If the way the pastoralists had to treat the wool was to bring it in as income at the purchase value on the one side of their account, and bring into account the asset in the sheep on the other side, using the principle of the purchase price to determine the value on both sides, the revenue would receive that to which it was entitled with regard to that particular wool. Pastoralists are now allowed the option of bringing the sheep in when they are purchased in the wool on the one side, or of bringing the wool in at the sale price on the other side. They can separate the two. But if the suggestion now made were' adopted in the case of a walk-in-walk-out sale, the seller or somebody else would not have to account for the wool, with the result that the revenue would lose the whole of the income tax due on the profits from the sale of the wool which is clearly a trading asset the moment it is separated from the sheep. It is obvious that nobody would suggest that it is drawing. on the capital asset to separate the sheep from the wool. We have had to accept the idea of separating the sheep and the wool in the case of a walk-in-walk-out sale. In that case it only applies to the vendor. The position of an ordinary purchaser in a walk-in-walk-out sale presents no difficulty, for he can keep the sheep and the wool intact if he pleases until the end of the term or he can separate the two. The Government has had a full discussion of this matter with the pastoralists' representatives. The honorable member for Boothby has asked whether representations have been made for the wool to be taken into account separately from the sheep in the case of the vendors. The reverse is the position. The pastoralists' representatives have naturally said: "No; certainly this should not be done," and they have tried to maintain that the sheep, plus the wool on it, is part of the capital asset. The vendor, or anybody else who is likely at any time to be interested in a walk in walkout sale, would naturally maintain that the sheep plus the wool is part of the capital asset, and try to draw it in as such capital asset. I venture to say that it is only possible to substantiate the case that the sheep itself and not the sheep plus the wool, is part of the capital asset. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has asked how far we can allow breeding stock to be taken into account as the part of the capital asset, or, in other words, as part of the machinery of manufacture of the pastoralists. We have accepted the principle that breeding stock shall be so regarded; but we cannot .accept the suggestion that the sheep plus the wool in the case of sales on a walk-in-walk-out basis shall be taken as part of the capital asset. </para>

          <para>.- I feel that the two great principles involved in this issue have not been clearly followed by the committee. The first point is that income tax is levied on the total amount of the income in a given period, less only part of the cost incurred in the same period in making it. The case I cited was clearly put. I instanced the case of a clip and a half, or a clip covering a period, of one year and ten months, passing into the accounting period in respect of which the costs of only one year had been taken into consideration. In such a case the vendor would be treated inequitably if he were allowed to deduct only the costs in respect of the twelve months period. The basic principle on which income tax has always been imposed in this country is the calling into account of all income for a fixed period of twelve months and the deduction of the cost of raising the income over the full accounting period, without any overlapping. If this proposal is agreed to, a departure will have been made from that established principle. </para>

            <para>- I am afraid that it would not do so. If the income from the sale of wool or station property were as fixed as the salary of honorable members it might be possible to apply this machinery to it with some equity; but under existing conditions that cannot be done. The great pastoral industry of Australia, as every one knows, is subject to many vicissitudes of climate and circumstance. There are periods of depression in which the value of stock falls seriously, and these are often followed °y good times in which prices rise suddenly. In the first case the seller may lose heavily under enforced sale while in the second eventuality the purchaser would benefit materially by a sudden rise without having been debited with a material proportion of cost.. Immediately we depart from the fixed period of income and expenditure we step on to dangerous ground. If the principle of altering the period is right in respect of growing wool, it surely is right in respect of growing crops; hut would any honorable member suggest that in the case of a sale of land the value of a growing crop on it should be taken into account, for income tax purposes, by the vendor up to the day of sale? We are dealing now with what I may call the two breasts of the nation, her agricultural and pastoral industries. We have deliberately said that the principle upon which the collection of our income taxation shall be based in respect of them is that there shall be a fixed term in which both income and expense shall be placed side by side. If we depart from this principle, as it is now proposed that we shall do in the case of walk-in walkout sales, we shall place ourselves in a most difficult situation. For instance, it may involve the orchardist who disposes of his property while his fruit is forming. </para>

            <para>- That is so. If we begin over-reaching and overlapping in our accounting periods, we shall never know where we are. I suggest that if our taxing master, for the purposes of simplifying his accounting methods, is able to obliterate from our income tax legislation the great principle of the fixed period, he will place us in an extremely difficult position. I cannot see any reason why the taxing master should fear that the country will lose revenue by the continuation of its present practice. The Attorney-General, and to a lesser extent the Prime Minister, in discussing this subject, expressed fears that losses of revenue would be sustained if this alteration were not made ; but I cannot see why that should be so. It is certain that a provision of this kind will seriously complicate the operations of our stock and station owners, and the great houses which control our stock and station business; and I hope the committee will hesitate before approving of it. I submit that if we continue our fixed accounting period, the position will right itself. We have had no experience which in any sense justifies us in making this great departure from settled practice. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Wannon is, in my opinion, quite wrong when he says that we shall not lose revenue by persisting in our present practice. He mentioned the case of a growing crop. If we were to amend the act to provide that a man might deduct the extra price he pays for land because it has a growing crop upon it from the price he receives from the crop when he harvests it, we should certainly lose revenue. The honorable member must have it in either one way or the other. If the proposal in clause 9 is not proceeded with, the concession given by clause 10 must be withdrawn, thus leaving the law as it stands at the present time. We cannot give the concession on the one hand and refuse to allow the deduction on the other. </para>

            <para>- No ; but the honorable member wishes to escape from what is a natural corollary of the provision in the succeeding clause; to work from one standpoint on clause 9 and from another standpoint on clause 10. He desires the concession to be given to the purchaser and at the same time not to. be taken away from the vendor. He cannot have it both ways. To me, the merits of the question are very clear. By clauses 9 and 10, we propose to give two concessions. One is that breeding stock may be sold on a walk-in walk-out basis, and be treated as an asset, and not be taxable. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> has stated that breeding stock is always treated as a capital asset. It is not so treated when it is sold in the ordinary way. </para>

            <para>- I am not contesting that question for the moment. We grant that the breeding stock, when sold at a winding-up sale, shall be regarded as an asset free from taxation. We also permit the pastoralist who purchases that stock to deduct from the sale price of his wool the value of that which was on the backs of the sheep at the time that he purchased them. If that principle is fair and sound - and I submit that it is - you must say to the pastoralist who sells on a walk-in walk-out basis " You cannot claim an exemption from taxation in respect of the wool on the breeding stock." </para>

          <para>.- It is quite probable that the opportunity given under this clause will not be largely availed of. In days gone by, however, before the averaging of rates and other methods were adopted, the law inflicted a hardship, as I can show in the case of a client of mine. This man bought sheep heavy in lamb and in full wool at 38s. 3d each. It was just before the end of the year, and he brought his return to me. I naturally put the stock in at the cost price, which allowed him, on account of having other stock sales that year, to show a profit, and he was liable to income tax amounting to about £25. During the next year, after the return had gone in, the commissioner wrote to my client to the effect that he was liable to this tax; but, in order to give him an option to come under the lower provision, the commissioner pointed out that if my client liked to bring in the stock at the rate then fixed - 9s. or 12s. - instead of having to pay £25 he would have to pay nothing. I was away at the time, and my client, thinking that I had made a mistake, put his stock in at the lower price and paid no tax. During that year the sheep had lambed, and the natural increase was shown at 9s. in his next return. Tie sheep had also been shorn, and the wool showed a return of 12s. This made a return of 21s., but on account of the dry spell he sold the grown sheep for 15s., bringing his gross return or credit to 36s. That meant that he had made a loss of 2s. 3d. on each sheep. In furnishing his return for the second year he had to start with the sheep at 9s. - for which he had paid 38s. 3d. - and his return was 36s. as shown, this meant he made a paper profit of 27s.  His  tax on that amounted to £111. He came to me and complained, and on inquiry I discovered what had happened. That clearly shows the value of the provision in the bill. If that man had been able to separate his sheep and the wool, he would have put his wool in" at 12s. and sheep at 26s. when he bought, and the subsequent difficulty would not have arisen. I might say that on representations being made to the commissioner the tax was reduced. There will be little need for this clause, because of the provisions in the acts of 1924 and 1926. If a purchaser were forced to separate his wool and sheep there would be tremendous difficulty in accounting in some cases, especially if the sheep were bought a few months off shears; but there would be no difficulty when buying sheep in full wool. However, there is no compulsion, the buyer can do as he likes. The seller has nothing to do with it. The option allows the purchaser time to consider what to do. Under this provision if a man buys sheep in the wool he will be able to get a proper debit for both wool and stock, and a proper credit for the stock at the end of the taxation period. When a man buys up to the middle of the year, say six months after shearing, he will not gain much advantage, because he will enter the sheep at the average value, which will include the price of the wool. There is then not much difference between the first price at which he buys and the price at which the sheep will be valued on his return. </para>

          <para>.- I suppose there is no use in attempting to do anything more than register my protest against this provision, seeing that the Opposition and the Government are in agreement. I do so because it is a dangerous practice to bring into account a partially grown crop of any description. I can foresee a great deal of trouble and disappointment ahead of primary producers. </para>

        <para class="block">If this principle is admitted as proper in respect to a wool clip, it might, with equal justice, he applied to a growing crop of wheat or corn, to a maturing fruit crop, to the sugar fields in Queensland, to maize, to tobacco, or to any of the agricultural products of the country. Since this country, like every other, is invaded periodically by hordes of pests that attack the growing crops, it is not possible to pre-assess the value of a crop before it is actually harvested. To attempt to do so is to make trouble both for the contracting party and for the taxation department. Naturally, I expected opposition from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to any measure which would be for the good of the pastoralists of Australia. Never has anything affecting the pastoral industry been before this House when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has not taken the opportunity to assail the industry. Yet the pastoral industry might be said to-day to be the bright spot in the nation's finances. I think he has had some past experience of the ills endured by workmen under the old pastoral conditions; but he ought not to bring those forward at the present time. The pastoral industry is now providing some of the best conditions in Australia for the working man. To the extent which the principle is the same in this section of the bill as in the last, I am not going to blow hot and cold, and support the principle when it suits me, and to reject it when it does not. I do not think we should have stepped over the border of a new year and anticipated the return to be derived from a growing clip especially when we cannot bring into account the corresponding costs which the taxpayer would have to bear. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member should know that this provision was a special concession to the pastoral industry, and, when I support it, it cannot be said that I am assailing the industry. I throw the lie back in his teeth. I regard the pastoral industry, and all the other industries of this country, as interwoven one with another. I look upon wool-raising as one of the staple industries that will keep this country solvent. If the honorable gentleman was not obsessed with some strange illusion, he would not have given utterance to the stupid charge which he made this afternoon. This is a concession to the pastoralists to save them from being doubly taxed on their wool clips. I have given it my warm support because it is just, but I would not support any attempt, whether by pastoralists, agriculturists, joint stock companies, or private individuals, to avoid paying their just share of taxation. When taxation is evaded it always means that somebody else has to pay more. </para>

I pointed out to the honorable member that this clause is a concession that had to be balanced by the conditions in the previous clause. Whatever he might say about my attitude in regard to these clauses, it is absurd to say that this one will inflict any injury on the pastoralists, when, as a matter of fact, it is specially designed to save them from being doubly taxed. It gives him the right to choose under which system he is to be assessed. It is evident from his remarks that the honorable member does not understand the clause. </para>

The amendment will rectify anomalies brought under the notice of the department in regard to distributions among their members by co-operative societies. The definition of income in section 4 of the act lays it down that income does not include any rebate received by a member of a cooperative society or company, based on purchases made by that member from the society or company. Rebates are excluded from the income of a member because they are regarded, not as income, but as reimbursements of overpayments made for goods. Under the law, as it now stands, however, a company or a co-operative society is not at liberty to deduct the amount paid in rebates from its income. The object of this amendment is to allow that </para>

          <para>. -  Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and c.of clause 11 link up with the proposals that were contained in clause 23 of the bill which was very fully discussed last night. The debate was adjourned until we had an opportunity of taking this clause and considering the whole matter in the light of the wider issues raised under these two paragraphs. Before dealing with these particular paragraphs, however, I wish to make a personal explanation as to certain views I expressed with the greatest possible confidence last night, and which I now find do not represent the actual position : I refer to my exposition of the law of Great Britain with regard to the taxation of absentee shareholders. I can only plead in extenuation that I concluded my remarks on that occasion by saying that I " understood" that the position was as I had outlined, or I hope I did so. The position is not as I indicated last night. In Great Britain they do take very much more definite action in regard to the income of absentees than I gave the committee to understand. The need for inserting paragraphs 2 and 3 of this clause arose out of the process of expansion going on in regard to the dividends of companies owned and controlled outside Australia, those owned outside Australia, but controlled here, and those registered and controlled inside Australia. In the case of the external company, that is, the company with its capital owned abroad and controlled abroad, the position is that up to the present time we have not been getting taxation from absentee shareholders. In the second case, that of the company registered abroad, with a good deal of the capital owned abroad, but controlled in Australia, and declaring its dividends here, we have not in the past utilized one of the sections of the act so as to make it pay the tax of those shareholders who are resident abroad unless the dividends were declared in Australia. Recently an English judgment showed that the dividend had to be paid in full to the absentee shareholder and the company had to bear the tax instead.  It  is considered unfair to levy from the company for income tax payable by its shareholders money which  could not be recovered by it from them. Having come to the conclusion that exemptions should be allowed in those two cases, we are now faced with the case of a company registered and controlled in Australia, which has shareholders who are resident outside Australia. "We believe that if the other classes of absentee shareholders are to be exempt from taxation, the absentee shareholder in the Australian company should not be placed in a worse position than they. Having decided to exempt shareholders of this type, Ave had to consider the position of persons who lent money to a company on debentures or on deposit. After considerable thought, the Government decided that it was desirable to exempt also those lenders for the sake of encouraging the investment in Australia of capital which would assist in the general promotion of industry. We would not have gone to this length in regard to interest on debentures but for the unjustifiable anomalies that exist in regard to share interest. During this discussion many honorable members have indicated that their object is to take the maximum toll of people who are investing capital in this country. The Government, on the other hand, regards such investment as essential to the opening up of the country and the promotion of new industries. </para>

            <para>- Although at first sight it may appear that the exemption of certain capital from income taxation means a loss of revenue and a resultant heavier burden on the Australian taxpayer, that is not the ultimate effect, if a greater inflow of capital is stimulated. Such money will be utilized for the establishment of industries and the creation of employment, and will cause a general increase in prosperity. And as new industries are established, and employment is found for more people, the volume of revenue flowing into the  Treasury  will increase. In the long run the actual effect would be to relieve the local taxpayer. </para>

            <para>- Certainly; but if Australia is to develop at the rate which its national circumstances demand, its capital requirements cannot be provided from the annual excess of income over expenditure. We must get money from abroad to accelerate development and the influx of new population. I agree that all monies employed in industry and creating new avenues of employment will be of great advantage in reducing the burden of taxation upon the people as a whole. But there is another angle from which to view this problem. Very often the question is asked, "Why should foreign investors take toll of Australia in the form of interest and dividends on the capital they have invested ?" It is suggested that all the benefits that arise from such investments are reaped by the people outside Australia, and that we are entitled to recover from them as much as possible. Sight is lost of the fact that the great bulk of the money is employed in the creation of new industries or the extension of existing ones; these will increase the wages bill, and the money will circulate throughout the country to the benefit of all sections. Only a small percentage will be utilized for the payment of interest or dividends to the foreign shareholder. Money sent into Australia from abroad is of benefit to the country, and not detrimental, as some short-sighted people seem to believe. ' We all feel considerable resentment against foreigners who trade in Australia, and by the manipulation of subsidiary companies appear not to earn any profits and so escape taxation. These unscrupulous methods are applied nearly always in distributing businesses; it would be difficult to apply them in manufacturing and productive enterprises. If people do resort to these methods, it is clearly our responsibility to find means of defeating their machinations. Cases of this kind do not, however, affect the fundamental fact that the investment of new capital is of benefit , to the country. Recently I prepared an estimate of the capital requirements of Australia. The figures disclosed that, if we could afford to be content with the present growth of population by natural increase - and the excess of births over deaths in Australia compares favorably with the natural increase in any other country - and the corresponding expansion in trade, commerce, production, and industry, we should be able to provide out bf surplus wealth the whole of the capital  -we need. But, unfortunately, possessing an enormous continent and being faced with the necessity for populating it and accelerating its development, we cannot be content with what in an older country would be considered a very satisfactory rate of progress. Consequently, having regard to the inequalities that arise under the taxation law as between absentee shareholders in different classes of companies, the Government came to the conclusion that all should be placed on the same basis. It then decided to extend the concession to moneys lent by way of debentures or on deposit to companies. However, the discussion last night made clear a consensus of opinion in the committee against the action proposed by the Government in regard to shareholders. The committee apparently is not prepared to go so far as the Government proposes in the direction of bringing absentee shareholders into line irrespective of the type of company in which they are interested. The Government accepts that decision. It would be unwise, therefore, to take the further step contemplated in regard to debenture interest. I do not reflect upon the views expressed by honorable members, but I repeat that the basis of the Government's proposals was the necessity for attracting capital into the country. This legislation appeared to the Cabinet to be one justifiable method of accelerating the inflow of new capital to develop our industries and increase our capacity to absorb new people. I recognize that our attitude may be misrepresented; the suggestion may be made that the purpose of this legislation is to favour the big companies and the wealthier sections of the community. I hope that that course will not be adopted, and that this issue will not be clouded with prejudice, for, whilst the Government recognizes the will of the committee, it is convinced that at some future time this Parliament will adopt action of the nature suggested in the bill. If, in the meantime, the matter is surrounded with prejudice and political animosity, the task of any government not necessarily the present Government - that may attempt similar action to that proposed on this occasion will be made more difficult. The Government does not propose to press paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and c of clause  11,  nor will it, when clause  23  is reached, persist with its proposal. </para>

          <para>.- The Government displayed very much greater wisdom in withdrawing from an untenable position, than it did in inserting this provision in the bill. The withdrawal proves that the criticism of the Opposition last night was justified. I remind the committee that it required continual hammering from the Opposition before the Government " saw the light." I am glad that the Government has displayed greater wisdom at this stage than it did earlier in the debate; but we cannot allow the matter to remain where it is. The Prime Minister endeavours to make it appear that the provision is withdrawn merely because he has a majority against him, but that he is right and we are wrong. The Prime Minister spoke of the different angles from which he approaches the subject. I suggest that his argument was triangular. First of all the right honorable gentleman spoke of the difficulties of collecting the tax, and of ' the companies from whom it is impossible to collect it. He concluded by stating that the whole principle underlying the clause is the great need to attract capital to Australia, and he gave us a lecture on the desirability of encouraging imported capital to develop the country, urging that the money that comes from abroad is very beneficial. That is arguable. Some investments from abroad have certainly assisted to develop Australia, and to that extent are beneficial; but others have merely exploited the country and drained our resources. I suggest that we set aside all considerations as to whether imported capital is beneficial or otherwise. Surely the right honorable gentleman does not contend that Australian capital invested in this country is not as beneficial as that from overseas! Yet he proposed to tax profits on local investments and exempt those on investments from abroad. It is impossible to advance a sound argument in favour of exempting profits made on investments of foreign capital in Australia and at the same time taxing the profits on local capital invested in this  country. We have had to thresh this matter out since last </para>

        <para class="block">Monday, and no doubt we shall be told that the Opposition has held up the business of the country. I venture to say that this withdrawal would not have taken place had the guillotine been applied last night; absentee shareholders would then have been exempted from the tax. It is fortunate for Australia that the Opposition was able to "secure an exhaustive debate on the matter. We were able to place our views before the Government, and honorable members supporting the Government were also induced to ventilate their opinions. The Prime Minister said that he hopes that an attempt will be made to view the subject free from party influence. I ask the right honorable gentleman to analyze the records of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> feeling confident that ne will find that the case of the Opposition has been presented on a high plane, and has dealt merely with the merits of the proposal. It is futile to insinuate that the proposal was withdrawn for fear that pressure would be brought to bear. The Government was forced to abandon its position simply because of the strength of our arguments against an iniquitous proposal. </para>

          <para>.- The Opposition cannot claim all credit, if credit is due, for the withdrawal of this proposal. I am glad that the Prime Minister has indicated that the Government does not intend to press it. I believe that there are other ways in which capital may be attracted to Australia. At the same time, I am of the opinion that the Government was perfectly honorable in its intentions, and was actuated by the desire to encourage capital to come to Australia. No one, however, should be permitted to make profits in Australia and not contribute to the revenue of the country. I remind honorable members that, early in the session, I suggested that the Government would encourage the investment of capital in Australia, if it placed the rate of property taxation on a basis similar to that which , applies to personal exertion. I was glad to hear the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> advance a similar recommendation yesterday. The investment, of money from abroad in our industries must be retarded if people have . to pay nearly double rates on. profits made out of their investments in Australia. The higher property rate will also increase the interest rate and house rents in Australia, and will be of general disadvantage. If the Government takes from the individual only, it places an impost on the whole community. The country would be better off if there was freer investment in Australia, not only of local, but of outside capital. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>WEST  (East Sydney [3.10].  -  I offer my sympathy to the Government. It must be very galling to learn that the Opposition possesses infinitely greater wisdom than do the combined cabinet, and honorable members sitting behind it. One would gather from the remarks of the Prime Minister that those who wished to invest in or lend money to Australia were benevolent societies, merely seeking to benefit us. Theirs is merely a business interest, and they are anxious to make profits. Our present financial position is very serious, and we should endeavour to propound a satisfactory solution. From time to time I have advocated that, instead of raising new loans, we should have a conversion loan, and place the money in consols at the existing rate of interest. Had that been done recently, instead of raising a new loan of £36,000,000, the country would have been saved at least £325,000 a year for 33 years over the existing rate of interest. It is regrettable that 75 per cent, of the <inline font-style="italic">£10,000,000</inline> loan was left on the hands of the underwriters; it could have been raised in Australia. While we have gilt-edged securities available in Australia under the present conditions people are not likely to invest their money in industry. Two considerations that led me to come to Australia were the low price of land and the low rate of interest, and I have no doubt that other people would come here if the price of land and the rate of interest were as low as formerly. I am not the only person in the community who believes that the rate of interest payable on gilt-edged securities is a hindrance to our development. A gentleman who was formerly connected with the Treasury, but who, for some reason which I have never heard explained, lost his position, is also of that opinion. Speaking before the Adelaide </para>
        <para class="block">Chamber of Commerce some time ago he made it quite clear that the rate of interest on our war and other loans would have to be reduced before this country could make any substantial progress in its primary and secondary industries. We had a useful discussion in Melbourne some years ago on the taxation of absentees, and I would advise the Prime Minister <inline font-style="italic">\o</inline> instruct his officers to look it up. Many honorable members pointed out, on that occasion, that absentees received numerous benefits from this country, and therefore they should contribute something to the cost of government. I am glad that the Government has recognized the justice of the case made out by the Opposition and others for the taxation of absentees. </para>

          <para>.- I have sufficiently recovered from the lecture which I. received from the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition to join him in expressing appreciation of the action of the Government in agreeing to withdraw this proposal. It may be inexcusable for me to have the temerity to disagree with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, and if anything I have said has injured his personal feelings I regret it. I assure him that I am looking forward with great interest to his speech on the Land Tax Assessment Bill, and I shall judge him afresh after I have heard his remarks on that measure. I do not take the view of many honorable members opposite that this proposal of the * Government was made as a concession to capitalists. It was not intended as such. I am of the opinion that we ought to do all we can to encourage capital to come to this country, but I agree with the view of the Prime Minister that we are in some danger of certain foreign companies setting up great distributing organizations here with the object of participating in our prosperity without interesting themselves in the development of our country by paying reasonable taxation. It is for that reason I commend the Government for having withdrawn this proposal. Nevertheless, certain British interests have done a great deal throughout the years to develop pastoral Australia also North and Central Australia. They have used their money during many years without draw ing much interest, and often making losses. I hope that the Government will endeavour to find some way to give them greater encouragement than they have had in the past, for if their capital were withdrawn it would be detrimental to Australia. </para>

          <para>.- As I did not speak on the motion for the second reading of this bill, I had intended to address myself at some length to this question, but the Government having withdrawn its proposals, it is not necessary for me to do so. The members of this Cabinet will go down to history as the finest political quick-change artists that Australia has known. The abject way in which they abandon policies which they have put forward is, at times, bewildering to us. It is, however, a tribute to the effectiveness of the criticism of honorable members on this side of the chamber who regard their legislative duties a good deal more seriously than some honorable members opposite appear to do. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for 'Dalley, and other honorable gentlemen on this side of the committee may be specially complimented on having caused Government supporters to realize the iniquity of its proposal to discriminate in favour of foreign investors. Quite apart from the fact that the Labour party stands for equity and natural justice in regard to taxation, honorable members opposite * would have found it most difficult to justify this proposal to certain manufacturing and other interests which stand behind the Government. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister has suggested that it is necessary to cause additional capital to come to Australia, but if, in consequence of the Government's invitation to outside capital to come here, a big British manufacturing organization like I. and A. B. Morley and Company should come here and enter into competition with established Australian companies, and be relieved of taxation on its English capital invested here, honorable members opposite would be placed in a most embarrassing position. I am of the opinion that taxation proposals are placed before this Parliament in a very unsatisfactory manner. It is well known that expensive and protracted litigation follows almost every amendment that we make to our taxation laws, and our taxpayers and the Government are thereby involved in legal costs which amount to many thousands of pounds annually. The ambiguity of the amendments that are made to our taxation laws from time to time, shows the necessity for the appointment of a standing committee of the Parliament to examine taxation proposals before they are submitted to honorable members. The suggestion that such a committee should be appointed has been made on a number of occasions, and as the Government delegates far less important matters to standing committees for consideration, it should be prepared to appoint a standing committee to deal with this important subject, which affects the economic well-being of the whole community. If such a committee were appointed, it would be possible - and I say this in reply to the interjection of the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> - for us to examine taxation proposals in a non-party atmosphere. </para>

            <para>- In view of that statement I shall not discuss the matter further than to . say that the experiment,  which the Lang Government made in attempting to tax the profits made by these foreign companies, was justified. Doubtless, the measure will be the subject of litigation before the Privy Council. As to the practicability of imposing taxation upon these interests, honorable members are surely aware that there are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with cream. I suggest that the Government should introduce a federal company law in spite of declared constitutional difficulties, either with or without consultation with the States. Foreign companies, which make profits on business which they do in Australia, should undoubtedly contribute towards the cost of government here, and legislative control over companies is a means to that end. That seems to me to be the most effective method of taxing the profits of companies.

        </quote>
        <para class="block">I am sure that honorable members must have been impressed with the statement made by the Prime Minister to-day that there was great necessity to encourage capital "to come to Australia. We cannot have progress in a huge country like this unless we have capital to help us. I agree with the honorable member that everything possible ought to be clone to encourage the investment of capital within Australia. When our people become wealthy, and amass capital, they should, if. they invest that capital outside Australia, be subject to taxation by the Commonwealth; of course, with such limitations as might be necessary on account of taxation imposed elsewhere. Australia should obtain some benefit from incomes earned overseas by Australians resident here. Millions of pounds lave been invested in tin mines in the Malay Peninsula, and in the timber resources of Borneo and elsewhere, and from the profits made out of those investments not one penny is collected in income tax from shareholders in Australia. About twenty companies - of which the paid-up capital exceeds £100,000  -  are operating in this way, and , their dividends paid range from £542,200 down to £95,000. Millions of pounds are being paid to Australian shareholders by tin-mining companies alone, and yet the Commonwealth obtains nothing by way of income' taxation from those dividends. The Royal Commission on Taxation stated in its report - </para>

          <para>In preference to any general increase in income taxation in Australia, or the introduction of new forms of taxation, we recommend the taxing of incomes derived from abroad. </para>

        <para class="block">There is nothing new in that proposal. In Great Britain, any person residing in the United Kingdom must pay income tax in respect to his " profession, trade, employment or vocation, whether carried on within the Realm or not." Similar provisions operate in Canada and India. I agree that if taxation is imposed on incomes in the countries in which they are earned, it would be reasonable to make some reduction on account of that taxation, but I do not think that people who believe so little in their own country as to invest their money outside it should be entirely free from income tax simply because they derive their incomes from abroad. We need to bring capital into Australia. I come from a large State - one that requires an enormous amount of money for its development.

          <para>.- There seems to me to be one objection to this amendment, and that is that it embodies the principle of double taxation. If the honorable member for Swan could see his way clear to allow concessions to be made in respect of taxation paid abroad, his amendment would be less open to objection. I do not think we should discourage people from investing their money abroad, even if they do live in Australia. If people who invested their money abroad did not pay any income tax to the country where the money was invested, there would be no double taxation; but if "they do pay such taxation abroad, the amount of it should be deducted from that collected in Australia. I have no objection to the amendment if the honorable gentleman will agree to such an alteration. I am opposed to the system of double taxation. Ever since I can remember there has been an outcry against double taxation, as it operated between Great Britain and Australia. We have now adjusted that matter to some extent, and we do not want to introduce the principle elsewhere. I cannot agree that, because an Australian is drawing his income from another country, he should pay full income taxation in that country, and pay full taxation again in Australia. Such a provision as that would hinder the free flow of capital. Supposing a man drew income from India, and was taxed there on that income; it would not be fair that he should be assessed here at full income tax rates in respect of the same income. If he is paying no taxation in India, there would be no objection to his being taxed here. That is a fair proposition, and if the honorable member for Swan is prepared to admit it, I will support his amendment. </para>

          <para>- I am surprised that the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> should have proposed an amendment of this kind. We have, I think, always been opposed' to the principle of double taxation, and yet he is deliberately proposing to introduce it here. I cannot understand why any one in Australia who invests his money abroad - as he is perfectly entitled to do - should be compelled to pay taxation both in the foreign country and in Australia. The adoption of this proposal would amount to a most iniquitous grab on the part of Australia for money to which it was not entitled. We should be most inconsistent if we supported this amendment, and I hope the committee will turn it down. </para>

            <para>- Not necessarily. A man may live here and enjoy the privileges of citizenship, and not have one penny invested in Australia. I think we ought to devise a system such as that operating in Great Britain. Double taxation would then be prevented within the Empire; but if a man invested his money in a foreign country he would be subjected to double taxation, and rightly so. It seems an extraordinary thing to me that Australia should abstain from this system of taxation. We are practically the only advanced country in the world which does so. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has quoted instances in which this form of taxation has been adopted, and in practically all other parts of the Empire, and in most foreign countries, residents are taxed on incomes drawn from abroad. Our omission to do so is a blot on our taxation system and an injustice to Australians who invest their money in the  country, and endeavour to promote local industries and maintain Australian rates of pay and standards of living. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> has pointed out that millions of pounds of Australian capital is invested in tin dredging enterprises in coolie countries. Persons who thus invest their money and draw huge dividends from cheap labour enjoy all the privileges of living here without contributing anything towards the maintenance of government. I hope that the amendment will be seriously considered. </para>

          <para>. - I agree with the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> and the mover of the amendment. Although I am against double taxation as a general principle, particularly as I suffer so much from it, I do not think Australians should be encouraged to send their money abroad. My sisters, brothers and I have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in erecting mammoth buildings in Sydney. We pay Federal and State land taxes, municipal taxes, and State and Federal income taxes. Somebody living alongside us may be drawing huge dividends from the capital they have sent to foreign countries, and they pay not a penny towards the government of Australia. It is a sound principle that all profits a man receives shall be subject to taxation. Let us treat all citizens on an equal footing. If a man invests money in a foreign country he deserves to " get it in the neck " - to pay the foreign tax if one is imposed, and the Australian tax also. Let each of us pay something for the protection we enjoy under the flag and for the services we receive in the country in which we live. </para>

          <para>. - The amendment is of a far-reaching character, and, if carried, would have a tremendous effect upon the finances of the Commonwealth. The principle it embodies received very serious consideration from the Government when the draft of the bill was before Cabinet. Certain proposals in the measure were designed to attract capital to Australia, and obviously it is illogical to allow simultaneously native capital to flow out of the country. The two policies are irreconcilable. We were faced with the increasing exodus of capital from the Commonwealth, and had to consider whether steps should be taken to check it. The effect of this is illustrated by the manner in which government securities have been almost hawked in Australia, the Government being obliged to make the income from them tax-free as an extra inducement to the Australian people to lend their money to the Commonwealth. The Government realized, however, that a fundamental alteration of the system could not be proposed without very much greater investigation. The Commonwealth income tax law, when originally framed by a Labour Government, was based on the logical and just principle that taxation should be levied on income actually derived within the country. Abandonment of that principle would be a very radical change, especially at a time when the principles that govern income taxation are being exhaustively considered by all the nations of the world. The matter was dealt with at Geneva, and whilst finality has not been reached, the trend of opinion is towards recognition of the principle that taxation on investments should be levied only by the country in which the capital is controlled. There is another consideration that must be thoroughly investigated before we completely reverse our taxation policy in this regard. Australia is vitally concerned in increasing its import trade, of which all us would like the secondary industries to contribute a bigger proportion. To illustrate the probable effects of the proposed amendment, I remind the committee that H. V. McKay and Company have, by their enterprise and initiative, succeeded in establishing themselves in a paramount position in the South African market. The profits 'derived from that trade are not now subject to Australian income taxation, and we should hesitate before doing anything that . would be calculated to discourage them and other Australian manufacturers from building up a profitable market abroad. There are also grave questions involved in connexion with the export of wool and wheat. </para>

"We all are agreed as to the desirability of keeping as much of Australia's surplus wealth in the country for the development of its resources as is practicable; but I urge the committee not to make, by this simple amendment, a fundamental and far-reaching change in the taxation system.

          <para>.- The Prime Minister was right in saying that the amendment involved a change of a fundamental and far-reaching nature. I am sorry that the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> did not circulate it some days ago. The Prime Minister said that the amendment, if carried, would probably lead to an enormous increase in revenue from income taxation. That proves that the Commonwealth is losing a lot of revenue now. The only sound argument that can be urged against a government having too great a revenue is that it is taking from the pockets of the people an undue amount of money, which might be put to better use. That objection does not apply in this case, because, if we tax the profits of those who have invested their money abroad, we leave them less money with which to carry on that undesirable policy, and we do not lessen the amount invested in Australia. % </para>

            <para>- There is a very strong case in favour of the amendment. I certainly agree that if we did impose this class of taxation, which could be subjected to reciprocal arrangements similar to those now in force between Great Britain and Australia, it would be beneficial. The Prime Minister expounded an argument that was exploded when the subject was discussed before the royal commission on taxation, that the provision would penalize men who were making products locally, and sending them abroad .to Argentine, Africa, and other countries, to exploit their market, such as Hugh Victor McKay. The difficulty could be overcome by introducing a proviso to exempt such profits. The right honorable gentleman also mentioned wool exported for sale on the foreign market. We tax that wool producer on his full income. </para>

            <para>- That could be overcome by the operation of section 18 of the principal act. We should certainly tax the man who is resident in Australia and has his capital invested abroad, particularly the man who has his money invested in tin-mining and other ventures in cheap labour countries. The principle upon which we impose the rate of taxation is ability to pay. There are two main considerations governing the collection of taxation ; one the service that the country renders the individual as a member of the community. The Prime Minister refers to it as the " protection of the flag." The other and greater consideration is the protection that the country gives to the industry from which the individual makes his income. We have the right to impose a tax  on  the resident of Australia who earns his money in this country, and that also gives us a claim on the absentee who earns a portion of his income, in Australia. That justified, too, the stand taken by the Opposition in regard to the proposals that were to be applied to absentee shareholders. We haw an even greater claim on those individuals, who, while resident in Australia, are exploiting undeveloped countries, where government may not be solid. Great Britain has frequently taken responsibility for the safeguarding of persons engaged in such ventures. It is right that those people should contribute to the revenue of the country that protects them, and in which they reside. The royal commission on taxation was very guarded in its report. It made some recommendations, but hedged later. It indicated that it would prefer to see a tax imposed  on  profits earned abroad rather than increase the existing tax in Australia. I suggest that that was not considering the principle, but rather the expediency, of the matter. To-day, whilst  Ave  are reducing income tax and other direct taxation, our general taxation per head of population is increasing. It would be possible for us to relieve our people from indirect taxation to the extent of many millions of pounds </para>

On the whole, I find myself in agreement with the amendment. This committee can only affirm general principles, and a principle is affirmed in clear and definite language by the amendment. If the amendment is carried, the Governmentwill have to consult its advisers, and probably  in  another place, insert the proviso necessary to meet objections that may be raised on such points as the taxing of exports. It may be necessary to alter the verbiage to include capital expended abroad for trading purposes, as well as investments. When one considers that the flow of capital from Australia abroad is  groAving,  one realizes the need to impose a check. The honorable member for Swan instanced "  shadow "  companies that are exploiting Australia and evading taxation here. We have people who are shareholders  in  such companies, actually making profits here, but crediting those profits  in  another country. I instance the operations of an American film company, producing films in Australia. Those films are sold  in  Australia at such a price that the Australian section of the business makes no profit. But profits are made by the parent company, and the shareholders who are resident  in  Australia receive their proportion of those profits. Why should  Ave  encourage that sort of thing and penalize Australian taxpayers? If  Ave  imposed a tax on such activities,  it would  at least wake up Australian shareholders and make them fight for their end of the stick, probably resulting in the introduction of reciprocal taxation arrangements  between  Australia and the United States of America. I appreciate many of the points raised  by  the Prime Minister, but the right honorable gentleman is responsible, with his  Government,  to see that these provisions are extended  in  such a way that they  will  increase our revenue enormously. That will reduce the taxation that falls  so  heavily upon our own people, and will still allow us  to  put into effect protective duties which will encourage and stimulate our industries. </para>

          <para>. -  I direct the attention  of  the committee  to what is  involved  in  the amendment  in  relation  to  the drafting  of  the bill and the form  of  our present act. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> said that the amendment might properly be carried by the committee, and that it should then be left to the Government to produce other amendments to fit into the scheme of the act. I consider that the committee should appreciate the real significance of the amendment in that regard. Our act was deliberately drawn upon the basis of the taxation of incomes derived from sources within Australia. The definitions in the act are based upon that principle. The governing sections of the act are based upon that principle, as are the description of income, in section 16, and the deductions. To accept this amendment and to combine with the principle of taxation upon income derived in Australia, the principle of taxation upon income received in Australia from investments abroad would involve a re-casting of a very large portion of the act. For example, income from personal exertion is defined as certain moneys - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>Derived from sources in Australia, consisting of earnings, salaries, charges, commissions, fees, &amp;c. . . . Income from property means " all incomes derived from sources in Australia and not derived from personal exertion."  </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">And so on through the definition section. Section 13 is the governing section of the act, and it provides -  " Subject to the provisions of this act, income tax shall be levied and paid for each financial year upon taxable income derived directly or indirectly by every taxpayer from sources within Australia. . . ." </para>
        <para class="block">Section 16 provides that assessable income shall include certain specified matters. It occupies more than four pages of the statute. As an. example of the difficulty that arises, I mention the trouble there is in dealing with profits which have been distributed in Australia in the form of bonus shares. A complicated set of provisions has been worked out to deal with that subject, which depends in part for its administration upon the date on which certain profits were earned by the companies concerned. The provisions are being applied to Australia, but to apply them to foreign companies would be impracticable. It could not be done, except by sending inquiry officers abroad to ascertain whether and when and out of what moneys foreign companies distributed bonus shares. Provision is also made for the deduction of certain losses and outgoings'; but this likewise has been devised to meet Australian conditions, and could not be applied to ex-Australian income. Everything in the act has been put there with the object of collecting tax on income derived from all sources in Australia, and the measure would have to be entirely re-cast to make its provisions applicable to income earned outside Australia. It is, of course, open to the committee to adopt an entirely different system. I have not risen to speak on the merits of the amendment. I suggest that the wise course for the committee to pursue would be to allow the Government to continue its examination of the question, and not create difficulty, and perhaps chaos, by inserting in the act an isolated amendment of this character. </para>

This subject has been considered recently in Great Britain, the United States of America, and Canada. The Senate of the United States of America has been specially concerned about the practice of certain Southern Europeans who migrate to America of hoarding their savings until a time of depression occurs, and then taking them back to their native land. It has also given consideration to ways and means of meeting the financial problems which arise from the practice of wealthy Americans of taking large sums out of the country when they go abroad on holidays. Australia is not greatly concerned with that aspect of the matter, for we have numerous visitors from other countries who bring considerable wealth here. The discussions that have arisen in Great Britain have turned on a different aspect. On Monday last I asked the Prime Minister, upon notice - </para>

The question was raised at the Economic Conference at Geneva, but as that was a freetrade body it also evaded the issue. It appears to me that something along the lines of the proposal of the honorable member for Swan will have to be done sooner or later. At present a large amount of capital is being taken out of Australia annually, by persons resident abroad. It is well known that the members of the Tooth and Allen families draw very large incomes from their interests in Australia. They are not consumers, and do not assist in relieving the cost of government. This money should be taxed. "We shall eventually have to treat this question as one of major importance. </para>

This country is badly in need of capital, and we should do all that we can to see that Australian capital is kept here to develop our resources, establish our industries, and provide employment for our people. That the principle underlying the amendment is sound cannot be denied, for it is a principle upon which .British and Canadian taxation rests. I was not impressed by the statement of the Attorney-General, that from the machinery standpoint the amendment is impracticable. I have noticed frequently that while one man is busy saying that a thing cannot be done, another comes along and does it. I can see no reason why we should not provide machinery to impose taxation of this character. </para>

            <para>- It should be easy to do it. We could include another part in our act to deal' with it, and make it practically independent of the taxation of income earned in Australia. I was impressed with the statement of the Prime Minister that the proposal was equitable and would enlarge the field of taxation. In my opinion it would exploit a wide and legitimate field which we have a perfect right to exploit. I know of an Australian citizen who, shortly after the outbreak of the war, removed practically the whole of his capital from Australia, although he remained under the shelter of the Australian navy and army and the protection of the British flag. It is no part of our business to shelter individuals of that description from dual taxation. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan has much to commend it, but at the same time it would not be prudent at this stage to graft it upon our present act. That would be a somewhat precipitate and almost a clumsy method of dealing with this proposal, because it certainly requires more consideration than we can give it to-day. </para>

            <para>- Not at all. There are no insuperable machinery difficulties in respect to this amendment, but it would be unwise at this stage to graft it upon our taxation laws without giving it mature consideration. I have not the slightest doubt that the Commissioner of Taxation could soon frame new machinery to make the amendment workable, and I suggest that he should prepare a measure to give effect to it. With reference to duality of taxation upon Australian  manufacturers  who export, the Prime Minister has given one of very few instances in the whole of Australia, and that is the Hugh V. McKay Manufacturing Company. That case, of course, can be met by a special provision dealing with such export products. There is the possibility that, unless we carefully frame our legislation,, we may tax capital employed in our primary industries, and therefore legislative machinery must be specially drafted. But if the principle is right, the details are a minor consideration. The overwhelming sentiment of the Australian people is that we should exploit every legitimate field of taxation before we increase its incidence upon our already heavily burdened community. I am aware of another citizen holding vast properties that are to-day almost unproductive, and he is paying high land taxation, both Federal and State, and other imposts, including municipal rates.  His  holding cannot be further developed at present, and there it remains as his monumental investment in Australia. Could he use capital that has been put into his property, say, in America, he would be receiving nearly treble the return that he is getting from his Australian investment, but he is content to go through this difficult stage of Australia's finances until conditions improve. There is little profit to-day to the man who is controlling industry. Our economic conditions are bad, and we are passing through a difficult stage. This is the time when we should see that those who are controlling liquid funds do not take them out of Australia to be used in countries in which' there is a big reward for investment in industry. Our first obligation is to Australia, and we should do all we can to safeguard its interests and keep capital in this country so as to build un our resources, increase our population and protect our people from the increasing incidence of taxation, by first exploiting this legitimate field of income taxation that is now available to us. </para>

          <para>.  - I hope that the honorable member for Swan will persist in his amendment and that it will be carried by the committee. The Attorney-General raised some technical difficulties under the present act respecting the amendment, but I venture to say that they could be overcome by delaying the bill for 24 hours so that it might be redrafted. The operation of this amendment it has been estimated would bring in a revenue of £2,000,000 a year. It is a large sum, and well worth collecting, and not one argument has been advanced impugning the wisdom of imposing this form of taxation. It is remarkable that it has not been proposed before. Those who derive income in Australia from investments abroad have enjoyed the benefits of citizenship in Australia. They had the protection of our army and navy during the war, and yet have contributed little or nothing toward the revenue of this country. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">We have now the opportunity to make them bear their fair share of taxation. If it were possible, I should go further and make the taxation retrospective for a few' years. I certainly would not delay levying the tax for another year. These . people have not been good citizens. Rather than assist to develop Australia, they have invested their capital in other countries, and are receiving large profits from the employment of black labour. They care not who won the war, or who paid for it. Australia is to-day badly in need of revenue. There are thousands of returned soldier settlers in this country who, unless they receive immediate assistance, will be forced to leave their holdings. Here we have an opportunity to assist them. The Prime Minister said that there was a difficulty in levying this form of taxation, especially in respect of the firm of Hugh V. McKay. I have no wish to tax that firm in respect of its export trade, but, after all, its founder, when he died recently, left nearly £2,000,000. The difficulty mentioned, by the Prime Minister could easily be overcome; and as for the technical difficulties enumerated by the Attorney-General, they are not worth a moment's consideration. I commend the honorable member for Swan for bringing this proposal before the committee, and I sincerely hope it will be given effect. </para>

          <para>.- I do not know whether the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> intends to persevere with the amendment, but I trust that, in view&gt;of the support that he has received from both sides of the committee, there will be no backing down. Revenue is badly needed in this country, and we have to meet many liabilities. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> has shown that in the next five years we must redeem half of our national debt, close on £500,000,000. Therefore, we cannot afford to allow the opportunity to pass to obtain revenue from persons who can well afford to pay for it. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has indicated that this is a method by which we can relieve the great body of the people of a portion of taxation, and at the same time not affect the protective policy of this country. Duties have been imposed for revenue purposes only, and it is the mass of the people that bear them indirectly. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West)</inline> has intimated that this form of taxation has been receiving attention in other countries. I have with me an American record of various taxation systems. The Congress of the United States of America authorized an inquiry into the forms of taxation in operation in various countries, Including Great Britain, and no difficulty has been found in imposing a tax upon residents who invest their capital in other countries. Why should we not follow such an excellent example? It may be said that this tax will injure our manufacturing export trade, but that difficulty is easily overcome. I quite agree with the honorable member for Yarra that there should be no duality of taxation, particularly within the Empire. Great Britain has already made provision for that, because it has a reciprocal arrangement with the dominions. </para>

            <para>- There is at Newark a company that manufactures and exports dredging machinery. The firm of Thompson's, at Castlemaine, manufactures boilers, and other machinery. We have no wish to injure that trade, but rather to develop it. Vast sums of money have been invested overseas by wealthy Australians, and we should be recreant to our trust if we did not impose a tax upon them. The Government may say that there is no time to graft this amendment upon the bill, but I suggest that between the time the bill leaves this House and is received by the Senate, the proper machinery provisions could be drafted. The precedent for this tax has been established in other countries. Some of these moneys invested outside of Australia employ black labour on tin-fields in various countries and on mining fields in South Africa. When our own kith and kin receive large profits from overseas through the employment of black labour, it is time that we imposed a legitimate tax upon them. I hope that a vote will be taken upon the amendment, and that it will be carried. </para>

The question is not so simple as it appears. We do not possess that measure of control over our citizens and their investments outside Australia which some honorable members seem to think. This system of taxation might prove to be a two-edged sword. I believe that people with plenty of money, even if they are living privately, are of advantage to Australia, and they are taxed in other ways than through the income tax. If we impose such taxation as is here suggested, we might drive such people out of the country, and thus do more harm than good. However, I feel that much might be done along the lines suggested in the amendment. There are oil companies operating in Australia under conditions which would bear very close investigation. I think it will be possible to frame legislation so that we might tax those whom we wish to tax; and avoid taxing those whom we do not. By this means relief might be afforded to the heavily-taxed citizens of the country. </para>

          <para>. - We cannot treat this proposal for altering the whole basis for levying taxation in quite as casual a way as certain honorable members seem to suggest. We did not start out on a' system of income taxation in Australia without very exhaustive inquiries being made as to the best method on which to base taxation. I would point out to honorable members opposite that it is not quite fair to their predecessors that they should treat the existing system of taxation as one which is obviously defective. The system which appertains in Great Britain to-day and which it is suggested we should adopt, namely, that of taxing a resident on his income, no matter whence it is derived, was in existence when a Labour Government instituted our present system of taxation. I agree that the British system was probably examined, and that due consideration was given to other systems before the present one was adopted. After such consideration, the Labour Government came to the conclusion that the best system was to tax incomes derived in Australia. But circumstances have altered, and I have already indicated that the Government has given serious consideration to whether, without criticism of those who framed the present system, i': might not be extended to cover investments of Australian citizens abroad. Before this Parliament could commit itself to such a principle, however, we must have much more information as to the possible repercussions of such an alteration of the law. This idea of taxing incomes derived from abroad was not, I presume, brushed aside as unworthy of consideration when the original system was evolved, but it was not thought wise, at that time, to adopt it. We are now considering whether it is not necessary to make some alteration, and we are collecting facts as to the probable effects on revenue if such an alteration were made. When we are in possession of those facts, it may be possible to recast our whole system of taxation. I suggest that, until we have that information, it would be extremely unwise for this committee to pledge itself to a principle which might not produce the advantages that a great number of people believe now it would. The Government fully recognizes the necessity for considering this matter, and has already taken definite action. Therefore, I would suggest that the honorable gentleman withdraw his amendment which, I agree, is one of very great importance. </para>

It has been made clear that there exists a large field of taxation which remains untapped by the Commonwealth. J do not think we are justified in permitting this state of things to continue, in view of the fact that our taxation is very heavy, and may have to be increased in the near future. </para>

            <para>- Persons with money invested abroad enjoy all the benefits of Australian citizenship, but they avoid the taxation which the other citizens of Australia have to pay. It is hardly fair for the Prime Minister to remind us that the present system of taxation was framed by a Labour Government. It is quite true that the system was introduced in 1915 by a government of which the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was a member. It does not follow, however, that those responsible for a taxation system should be condemned because defects develop in it after its introduction, and it is seen that people are evading their just share of taxation. The committee should be given an assurance that the present system will not be allowed to continue unchanged. During the discussion yesterday the Treasurer stated that the removal of the tax on the incomes of absentee company shareholders would give an inducement to capital to come to Australia. The system by which incomes derived  from abroad are left free from taxation, gives, however, a direct inducement to capital to leave Australia. </para>

            <para>- If the committee is of opinion that this taxation should be collected, there is no insuperable obstacle to the making of the necessary legislative provision. If necessary a new bill could be drawn up and presented to Parliament within a few days. The Government would do well to meet the wishes of the committee, by either making an amendment now or promising that the necessary legislation will be introduced soon after Parliament reassembles in the new year. If the adoption of this principle leads to the collection of £200,000 or £300,000 from a source which is now neglected, the Government will have an opportunity to reduce other taxation. </para>

          <para>. - I am very pleased to have had such favorable expressions of opinion from all sides of the committee in regard to the amendment. If the carrying of it would lead to the withdrawal of the bill entirely I would be very pleased, for, whilst I have faith in the desire of the commissioner to do what is just and reasonable, the Income Tax Assessment Act is becoming every year more cumbersome and intricate. Probably I would have been better advised had I advocated this amendment at the second-reading stage. The matter could then have been fully discussed, and the Government could have been given an instruction to draft the necessary amendment. I have brought forward the amendment purely as a matter of principle. In a country whose need of capital is so apparent, it is absolutely wrong that such direct encouragement should be given to our own. people to invest their money abroad. Had the Government opposed the principle, and had not the  " . Prime Minister given an assurance of his belief in the need for careful consideration of the proposal, I would certainly have pressed it to a division. </para>

            <para>- The attitude of the Prime Minister is that any drastic alteration of the taxation law should be preceded by a careful investigation, in order to ascertain its probable repercussions. I am satisfied that this proposal will be beneficial. We know that Australians have invested large sums of money in rubber plantations and tin mines abroad, the profits from which are not subject to income taxation. The Prime Minister, after expressing approval of the principle for which I am contending, promised further investigation of the proposal, and with that I am content. </para>

          <para>. - When the original income tax legislation was proposed, the Government of the day was not confronted with this problem; at least not, so far as as I can recollect, in an acute form. The amount of Australian money then invested in Siam and Malay was inconsiderable, though the Tongkah Harbour and Tongkah Compound Tin Dredging Companies are of older date. Now that the subject has been raised, there can be only one opinion. As the principle underlying taxation is that a citizen shall pay according to his income, there can be no doubt about what should be done. We have a most excellent example to follow in the practice which obtains in Great Britain. The Prime Minister, I understand, says that he is prima facie, favorable to the suggested alteration, but has not fully investigated the matter, and is not fully informed of its probable effect on investment and general financial conditions in Australia. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> who moved the amendment, is satisfied with the assurance of the Prime Minister that the problem will be investigated forthwith, and desires to withdraw his amendment. I hope that he may be permitted to do so. In the meanwhile I shall make my own position clear. If the Prime Minister has promised to investigate the matter, and has acknowledged that he is, prima facie, in favour of the change, I think we should be very foolish not to allow him to make his investigations. It is extremely doubtful, in any case, that the amendment could be carried in the face of the opposition of the Government. The inquiry should not take very long, as it will be a simple one. But the potential taxpayer should not be allowed to escape the tax on his income for the current year, and, therefore, I would like the Prime Minister to tell us whether he intends that the investigation shall be made with such despatch as to enable Parliament to pass an amending bill early next year that will operate as if it were in force to-day. If not, one might very well object to any delay. In view of the attitude of the Prime Minister I shall not support the amendment, as I firmly believe that the judicious and expeditious course is to accept the assurance of the right honorable gentleman and await his action. </para>

          <para>. - We have to congratulate the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> for introducing' his amendment. This afternoon's discussion has done good by bringing into prominence a potential' source of income taxation which should assist in closing some of the existing gaps in our taxation system. Apparently the Prime Minister has been considerably impressed by the debate, and appreciates the justice of the amendment, but he puts forward the excuse that an alteration of the existing act would involve tremendous complications. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has advanced the suggestion that if the Prime Minister makes a definite promise that he will introduce an amending  bill  to cope with this leakage of taxation when Parliament meets next year it would be satisfactory to all. I believe that if the honorable member for Swan insisted upon placing his amendment before the committee it would be carried. It  is  our duty to see that every citizen pays  a  fair share of taxation. I urge the Prime Minister to consider favorably the suggestion that he should make a definite statement on the matter. </para>

            <para>- The difficulties confronting the innovation were pointed out at length by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, and it is unnecessary for me to emphasize them. The taxation which was imposed in England during the  Avar  and immediately  afterwards  created extraordinary difficulty and irritation in its administration. I consider that if the suggested alteration is effected the inevitable result will be to drive capital out of the country. That  would  perhaps not be displeasing to a party that does not desire capital to come in to Australia. There is probably a considerable number of Australian residents who have fairly big sums invested here and abroad. The inevitable result of the introduction of irritation tactics such as are suggested by the amendment would be to cause many of those people to transfer their investments and residence abroad. Capitalwould be driven away, instead of being attracted to Australia. The amendment of the honorable member for Swan was introduced without any notice, and we are expected to pronounce .a final decision within a few hours on a matter which, as the Prime Minister stated, involves a complete re-casting of our income tax legislation. I am opposed to the amendment. I am, of course, prepared to consider the facts in the future, and to examine the subject in fuller detail. I am ready, to, if necessary - but I do not think that will be the result - to vary my opinion. I hope that the Government, if necessary, will force the question to a division, and obtain the opinion of the committee. </para>

            <para>- The principal objection that the Government has offered to this proposal is that it would necessitate a considerable alteration of our taxation machinery; but surely if the principle i's equitable we should note hesitate to adapt our machinery to give effect to it. The honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> spent about ten minutes in telling us that the proposal was sound, and would open up a new and legitimate field of taxation ; then he surprised us by saying that he. would not vote for it. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> introduced the amendment, and later gave reasons why it should be withdrawn. One reason that the Prime Minister gave for not accepting it was that previous Labour governments had not seen fit to adopt it. </para>

            <para>- The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> told us that the principle was not adopted years ago because the amount of Australian capital invested abroad then was hardly worth considering. That is not now the position. Huge profits are being made by Australian residents from in vestments such as those referred to by the honorable member for Swan. The Prime Minister has said that full inquiry will be made into the matter. Does that mean that another royal commission will be appointed, and that the honorable member for Swan will be the  chairman  of it? It appears to be a favourite practice of this Government to evade the responsibility of making important decisions by appointing royal commissions. Possibly it intends to appoint another royal commission on taxation. If so, it will probably use the commission's recommendations as the basis of a declaration of Government policy just prior to the next election. </para>

            <para>- I am too familiar with the methods of this Government. The honorable member for Boothby argued that if we adopt this proposal we shall probably drive capital out of* the country. I cannot understand how he arrives at that conclusion. The Government a few hours ago withdrew a proposal not to tax absentee shareholders. It appears to me that persons abroad who derive wealth from investments in Australia, and persons in Australia who derive wealth from investments abroad should be taxed. The Royal Commission on Taxation dealt with the subject of taxation of the income of Australian residents derived outside Australia. Paragraph 35S of its report reads as follows - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>The Federal Commissioner of Taxation, in the course of his evidence on the subject of double. income tax, expressed the opinion that " With' the disappearance of the double income tax there is no reason why Australia should limit its tax to incomes arising from sources in Australia." (See also paragraphs 109 and 170 of  this  commission's first report.) The Commissioner considered that, upon the elimination of double taxation in respect of incomes taxed both in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, Australian residents should be taxed on their total incomes whereever derived on the basis of their ability to pay. He said - " It would mean that, instead of the Commonwealth losing income tax on large revenue derived by Australians - using the term in a general sense - from such countries as Japan, China, America, and South America, we should get the tax on it. There is no reason, to my mind, why that revenue should not contribute towards the cost of government in Australia." </para>

            <para>- I am anxious to see the principle adopted. It is probable that this Parliament will sit for only another three months before the election. Neither the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> nor can I be certain of reelection, and if we do not vote on the issue to-day we may not have another opportunity to do so. I can see no reason why the Government should not immediately undertake to ask the commissioner to devise machinery to collect taxation of this character. It has been said that we have no information as to the amount of money involved; but we know very well that it is considerable, and therefore we are justified in acting. This field of taxation has been left untouched for too long. I should be quite prepared to tax incomes of this character three times as heavily as incomes derived from sources within Australia. I trust that the honorable member for Swan will persist in his amendment, and that it will be carried by the committee. </para>

          <para>.- The discussion that has centred round the amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> has been very interesting. Many honorable members have expressed views favorable to the taxation of profits earned outside Australia. I much prefer to see Australian capital used for the development of Australia. Honorable members have at all times spoken of the wonderful potential resources of this country, and it is not pleasant to realize that large sums of money are being sent away for investment abroad. No blame can be attached to the honorable member for Swan for moving the amendment. Necessarily, he could not beforehand give honorable members notice of his intention to move it, but the discussion that has take place has induced the Prime Minister to promise that this taxation proposal will be investigated. I do not think for one moment that any member would like to see an important proposal like this hurriedly inserted in the bill, and later oh to discover that more harm than good had thereby been done. It is also unfair to ask the Prime Minister to give a definite promise respecting what may take place in the early part of next year. If this proposal to tax incomes from overseas investments is surrounded with many difficulties, as we have been told, it necessarily calls for a close examination. There is also another aspect. We have not been told what taxation is paid by Australian investors in other countries, and we may find that it is considerable. While I believe that we should get some return for the protection  that is afforded to Australian citizens, we have to realize that there must be some reason for persons investing their capital outside Australia, and I do not doubt that the heavy taxation imposed by both Federal and State Governments has had a good deal to do with it. I would hesitate about taking any action that would result in driving either individuals or money for investment away from Australia. It is also very important that this legislation should not be delayed pending the inquiries being made as the reductions in taxes apply to the operations of the present year. I think that the committee has made excellent progress in obtaining from the Prime Minister a promise that this taxation proposal will be investigated. The honorable member for Swan, having heard the opinion of honorable members has adopted the right course in proposing to withdraw his amendment, and I ask the committee to support him. </para>

          <para>. - This discussion has been very interesting; but the manner in which the amendment has been approached by many honorable members has certainly been a great surprise to me. Until I heard the discussion this afternoon, I had always imagined that honorable members, especially those of the Opposition, were of the opinion that Ave in Australia had evolved a better and more equitable system of income taxation than any other country in the world. At the time of its introduction, there were income tax laws operating in a great number of other countries. I was under the impression that those had been examined, and as a result Parliament had deliberately adopted the present basis of taxation upon incomes derived in this" country in preference to the systems of other countries. But to-day quite a different point of view has ' been taken. This question is nearly as controversial as the rival policies in this Parliament in the fiscal sphere of free trade and protection. A new light altogether has been thrown upon our taxation methods in Australia. Let me put this point to honorable members. Is not the outstanding feature of our federal income taxation its tremendous complexity, and yet that is almost entirely due to the desire that Ave have in the federal sphere to mete out justice to the taxpayers. Until to-day I thought that honorable members had insisted upon that complexity in order that absolute justice should be done to every taxpayer. No matter what system of taxation is adopted, there will be complaints about its complexity, and, perhaps, suggestions from those  who  complain,  which  would increase that complexity. This gradual leakage of capital from Australia has been occupying the mind of the Government for some time. To some extent Ave have approached the subject from the wrong angle. Honorable members must realize that, so soon as Ave tax incomes derived from overseas investments, Ave completely alter the fundamental basis of the income tax legislation of this country. If Ave changed the principles  which  Ave have hitherto followed, I believe that we could simplify many of the complexities of the present law and obviate many of the calculations that are necessary under our present taxation system. The leakage of capital is becoming so serious that the Government has been considering whether there is not sufficient justification to alter the principles of our income tax legislation. But it has not embodied any alteration in its financial proposals for the present year, because these, of course, operate only in regard to the income earned last year and do c~ not apply to income earned this .year. The Government intends to make further and fuller investigations before it comes to a decision on a far-reaching alteration of this character. If it decides upon an alteration, it Will not be possible to bring it down to honorable members until the next session of Parliament. I want honorable members to understand that any alteration would not apply during the present financial year. </para>

I am prepared to give honorable members the assurance that the Government will inform them of what it intends to do after it has fully investigated the position. If the Government decides against any alteration, Parliament will have have the remedy in its own hands. </para>

          <para>. -  I intend to move the amendment as it appears on the printed sheet providing for the omission of certain words, and the insertion of other words in their stead. Clause 12 amends section 23 of the principal act, which provides for deductions. It provides that there shall be deducted from income all losses and outgoings not being in the nature of losses or outgoings of capital, including commissions, travelling expenses, interest or expenses actually incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income. It is proposed to alter the order of the words so as to make it quite clear that the losses and outgoings which are included amongst the items which may be deducted from the assessable income must be actually incurred in gaining or producing it. This is rendered necessary by a decision of the High Court in 1921, which held that the section, as now worded, did not provide for this. Therefore  I  move - </para>

          <para>. - I have asked that this clause be recommitted so as to give the Minister an opportunity of explaining its import more clearly. It must be evident to honorable members that the power conferred on the Commissioner of Taxation under this clause is very wide indeed. I listened patiently to the statement made by the Treasurer when he introduced this measure, and if I remember rightly, he stated that even when a wife put money into her husband's business, there could not be established a partnership between them. The husband could only pay, and the wife claim, interest for the money so advanced. I submit that a man could have no better partner than his wife. If she possesses money of her own, and is entitled to invest it, there is no better way to do it than to put it into her husband's business. I am, therefore, anxious that Parliament should interpret its will in this regard, rather than that it should impose that power upon any person whatsoever. I recognize the need for the clause under our graduated system of taxation. There is a natural desire on the part of taxpayers to get together in order that they may divide their incomes, and so come under a lower income tax rate. It is necessary that the Government should protect the income tax. act against such bogus partnerships, but the Minister should more clearly define under what circumstances a husband and wife may conduct a genuine business partnership. If the position is as I understood the Treasurer to say, that a wife is not able to enter into a business partnership with her husband, I totally disagree. If a wife owns farming property, and her husband also owns land, there is nothing more proper than that they should enter into a legal partnership in respect of such land, and that they should have their legal rights as partners preserved to them. </para>

          <para>.- Section 29 of the act provides that a partnership shall be liable to furnish returns, but that the partnership, as such, shall not be liable to taxation, and that the partners shall be separately assessed. That is a proper provision in the case of a bona fide partnership. This new clause is designed to deal with a fruitful source of evasion. It must be remembered that if a husband and wife are carrying on a business partnership, and have no outside source of income, the tax payable on the income of the business as a partnership is frequently less than it would be if the business were carried on in the name of only one of the partners, because the division of income allows a deduction of £300 from the income of each of them. There are, I admit, many bona fide husband-and-wife partnerships, but there are quite a number which are not bona fide, but which it is extremely difficult to prove are other than they are represented to be. The department has informed the Government that these cases are becoming more numerous. Many cases have been observed in which a business has been carried on for some time by an individual as a sole trader. He then obtains advice from a taxing agent, and thereafter he carries on his business in the form of a partnership with his wife. The business may still trade under the same name, but for taxation purposes it is represented as a partnership. The claim for the existence of a partnership may be based on a specific agreement which is produced, and it is difficult to establish, in such a case, that the partnership is not a bona fide one. If it is necessary to prove in a law court in every case that there is a fraud, these evasions will continue to take place. The section will not affect any bona fide partnership between husband and wife. </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer was probably referring to another aspect of the matter. If the honorable gentleman will refer to the Partnership Acts, as passed by the different State Parliaments, he will find that the mere lending of money does not create a partnership. This clause would not apply in cases where money had been merely lent. It would apply only in cases in which it is contended that a partnership exists as defined in section 29 of the act, and in which it is found that the partnership has been formed to evade taxation liability. But where there is a contribution of real money to the capital of a firm there can be no doubt that a bona fide partnership in the business may be claimed. </para>

          <para>.- If some declaration of partnership were to be the determining fact I should not object, but there is nothing in the act to define for the guidance of the commissioner a partnership between husband and wife. It is quite common for a wife to hold land in her own name and to work it with her husband, but without any deed of partnership or annual balance-sheet, or distribution of profits. If this taxation is to be left entirely in the discretion of the commissioner a loose family partnership might lead to a charge by the commissioner of attempted evasion of taxation. Frequently it will be found that partnerships do not exist, and the commissioner's demand for evidence in the form of a deed, an annual balance-sheet, and a statement of profits distributed, might make the partners liable to the highest penalties under the act. The clause is too vague. </para>

We should require some substantial evidence of partnership - for instance, information as to the terms on which the land has been held previously, or, in the case of a business, the terms on- which the capital of the parties has been invested. </para>

          <para class="block">This is a bill fixing the rates of income tax, and reducing the prevailing rates by 10 per cent. in the case of taxation payable by individuals. No reduction is made in the rate payable by companies. The minimum amount of tax payable has been reduced from £1 to 10s. The bill also makes special provision for the rates to be paid by trustees. A difficulty has arisen in the case of a trustee receiving income from the estate of which he is a trustee, and retaining it. The trustee and not the beneficiary is assessed in respect of that income. It has been held in litigation, under the War Times Profits Tax Assessment Act, that a distinction exists between the case of an individual trustee and a company trustee. The rule is that a beneficiary in a trust estate pays income tax according to the ordinary provisions of the act in respect of the income which he receives, but sometimes the income is retained in the hands of the trustee. The act then provides that income tax is payable by the trustee upon the' income which is not going to a beneficiary. In a case which came before the court under the War Times Profits Tax Assessment Act, it was necessary to consider and apply legislation from the Income Tax Act, and the court held that where the trustee was a company, the company rate was to be paid, but that where the trustee was an individual, the individual rate should be paid. Obviously that is quite wrong. It brings about the result that, in two precisely similar estates, with identical amounts paid into the hands of trustees, one sum would bear taxation at the company flat rate of Is., and the other sum, because it was paid to an individual instead of a company trustee, would pay either more or less than Is., according to the amount involved. The bill proposes to make the position equitable by making the rate of tax payable by a trustee, as set out in the fourth schedule - </para>

            <para>. - I do not intend to discuss the second reading of the bill at length. I must concede that we had a very thorough discussion of the Income Tax Assessment Bill, which covers the whole range of this subject, including the rates to be imposed. That exhaustive debate proved that if we have a reasonable time to discuss a measure a useful result is achieved for the country. Our debate on the Income Tax Assessment Bill produced some good results, although I regret that our remarks in opposition to the -proposal to make a general reduction of 10 per cent., which is embodied in this bill, did not bear fruit. It is not a very popular thing to oppose a reduction of taxation, as is now being done by the Opposition. We take the stand that our financial position is not at all promising. The signs are all around lis that we shall probably have to face a financial stringency, and that we shall need all our available revenues if we are to cope with it successfully. We should be applying our surpluses to the reduction of our debt or to preventing an increase of it. It should be our endeavour to relieve the people where we can from the existing revenue imposts. I refer not to the protective, but to purely revenue duties by which so much indirect taxation is raised. That is the basis of our protest against this reduction, and it has already been discussed at considerable length. We have not met with much success, but the debate has not been altogether ' useless. We certainly saved the country at least £200,000 in connexion with, the Income Tax Assessment Act. We cannot move to increase the rate of taxation to the original standard, because that would be against the Standing Orders, and we cannot vote against the second-reading of this bill, because if we were successful, it would result in no income tax being collected. We can merely reiterate what we said on the Income Tax Assessment Act, so far as it applies to this bill. There is one thing which I urge the Minister in charge of the bill to consider, and that is the minimum tax charged. It may  seem  a very small matter, but the minimum of £1 operated harshly against many taxpayers. The reduction to 10s. will give a measure of relief, but I understand that some of the States collect a minimum of only 5s., and I suggest that we should reduce our minimum to a similar amount. A man may come into the taxable area with perhaps only £1 above the exemption. Legally speaking, under the terms of the scheduled rates, he should pay only a few pence, but 'the minimum compels him to pay 10s. I suggest that 5s. would be reasonable. </para>

            <para>.- For a considerable; time I have felt that this country would do well to impose the same rate of tax upon income from property as that which applies to income derived from personal exertion. No doubt when the differential rate was fixed it was felt that those people who earned their income by the investment of their capital - either by placing it out on loan, or by erecting buildings and collecting income in the form of rent - should pay a greater revenue than the man who works hard for his money. That may appear to be very reasonable, but when we examine it from an economic stand-point, we realize that it merely .causes trouble and places the nation at 'a disadvantage. An increased taxation on revenue derived from investments in this country means that the interest rate must go up, which is detrimental to the progress of the country. I also submit that under the present scheme the money invested in houses for letting purposes is unduly taxed, so that it is the working man who actually has to meet the higher rate of taxation. Instead of being an advantage to Australia, it is a disadvantage. Foreign investors in Australia are not similarly penalized. Yesterday we had an instance of the considerable cost which is incurred by the Taxation Department in having separately to reckon and compute the averaging system now operating in Australia. It confuses the existing system just about as much as would the system proposed by me, to which the Treasurer took exception. I have no ulterior, motive in urging my contention, but have in mind only the detrimental effect that the present system has upon Australia. I am merely asking for something that would be a great convenience to many taxpayers. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> usually directs attention to problems which very few people can properly grasp. I understand that his proposal to-night is that the rate of income tax should be the same irrespective of whether income is derived from personal exertion or from property. Income derived from personal exertion usually represents the wages of a worker in all fields of employment, while that from property frequently comes from a person's savings or investments or from an inheritance from deceased relatives. It could hardly be expected in these circumstances that the rate of taxation would be similar. It has never previously been suggested that it should be so, at least not to my knowledge. I regret that provision is made in the bill for the imposition of a minimum tax of 10s. The result will be that a person who is liable for the payment of a tax of only ls. or 6d. will have to pay 10s. That appears to me to be a heavy punishment to persons of limited means, and as it is not their fault that their income will not permit them to pay income tax I do not think that it  can be justified. If it were not so serious, it would be laughable. As I observed on a previous occasion, such provisions in our legislation bring our proceedings down to the level of comic opera. I trust that the Government will agree to the deletion of that paragraph from the clause. </para>

            <para>.- I should not address myself to this measure were it not for the fact that I consider the incidence of direct and indirect taxation of vital importance to our economic life. I should rejoice in the proposed reduction of direct taxation were it not for the fact that it is not a reduction in the totality of taxation, but merely a shifting of the amount involved from a direct to an indirect tax. The manner in which a country will submit to direct as against indirect taxation is, in my opinion, a test of its intelligence and economic. sense. A nation which prefers indirect to direct taxation is deficient in knowledge of economics. An axiom of taxation is that if a government has to raise £1,000 in taxation very much less economic hurt is done if it clips the amount off a single income of, say, £10,000, than if it takes 50 cuts of £20 each from the recipients of smaller incomes. Our indulgence in this orgy of indirect taxation is having a very bad effect upon our national expenditure. Had I known that to meet the expense of constructing certain works for which I have voted in this Parliament in the last year or so, the electors would have to sign specific cheques to meet direct taxation instead of knowing, as I did, that the necessary money or the interest to be paid on it would be available from revenue duties, I should certainly . not have voted for them. The expenditure of this country would have been at least £5,000,000 a year less than it has been if direct taxation had been as high as indirect taxation is, and indirect taxation had been down to the level of direct taxation. Had we leaned less heavily than we have done on indirect taxation, we should have been less extravagant, and I am convinced that we should not have approved of many of the schemes for expenditure which have been endorsed. It would be in the best interests of this country if in the future we were to depend more upon revenue from income, land and other direct taxes than upon revenue from indirect taxes. </para>

            <para>.- I protest against the provisions of this bill. Like the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> I objected during the budget debate to the manner in which our indirect taxation has increased ; and I wish now to emphasize my views. It appears to me that the Government has adopted the principle of ignoring criticism of its financial policy in this respect. The Treasurer did not refer to it in his budget speech beyond mentioning that the Government intended to reduce direct taxation. He did not examine the incidence of the taxation which is to-day falling so heavily upon the community in general; he did not attempt to explain the policy of the Government in this respect;, and I do not think that he in any way justified the proposed 10 per cent, reduction of income tax. It was pointed out during the budget debate that in the five years that have elapsed since this Government assumed office, indirect taxation has increased by approximately 91 per cent., while direct taxation has been reduced by approximately 33-J per cent. </para>

              <para>- That is what I said. The Attorney-General seems to be astonished. The figure is arrived at in this way. During 1921-22, which was the last complete financial year prior to the assumption of office by this Govern-' ment, the receipts " from the customs totalled £17,328,000, while this year the Government is budgeting for a customs revenue of £35,150,000, an increase of £17,822,000, or approximately 91 per cent. The Attorney-General may say that our customs revenue is not taxation. It may not be imposed as taxation, but the fact remains that the money flows into the Treasury, and the consumers have to pay it as an indirect tax. I feel justified, therefore, in saying that the Government policy has increased indirect taxation by 91 per cent, concurrently with having reduced direct taxation by 33-J per cent. Honorable members cannot ignore the unstable economic position of the Commonwealth in consequence of the enormous flow of imports into the country. "We shall soon be forced to give more consideration to this problem. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> will shortly invite lis to discuss the new tariff proposals that he has tabled, and to suggest a cure for the obvious ills from which the country is suffering. We shall have to take drastic measures effectively to protect Australian industries and prevent foreign goods from swamping the country, and such action will inevitably have the effect of reducing the flow of revenue into the Treasury. It will reduce, so long as our legislation is effective, the indirect .taxation, whether the Government desires it or not, and with that prospective reduction in indirect taxation it will be faced with the necessity of getting revenue from other sources. That is an additional argument for careful consideration before we reduce the direct taxation at this juncture. If the Government is contemplating a continuation of the present flow of money into the Customs House, if it regards the annual increment of customs receipts as a part of its settled policy, then I can understand it reducing direct- taxation or curtailing its revenue in other directions. But if its policy has been set with that in view, it is wrong, and the Government is travelling along the road to ruin, and the country will sooner or later suffer the consequences. </para>

              <para>- I was Treasurer in Queensland for many years, and I think that I budgeted, if not always for a surplus, at any rate in strict conformity to the principles of sound finance. I realize that this is not an occasion upon which an examination of Queensland finances in the immediate past would be justified, but I have no objection to discussing the subject with any honorable members who are labouring under delusions regarding the stability of Queensland's finances under my regime. Whatever honorable members may think of the situation in Queensland, the situation of the Commonwealth is unsatisfactory both from an economic and financial point of view - from an economic point of view because of the adverse trade balance, and from a financial point of view because the Government is levying too much indirect taxation, and thus placing a heavy burden on the people who are least able to carry it. At a time when that burden is heavy and inequitable as far as the family man is concerned, the Government is deliberately reducing the burden on the shoulders of those who are best able to carry taxation. The Govern ment has not shown that the present system of income taxation is bearing with undue severity upon the shoulders of those <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> are contributing it. If it were able to do so, there would be no better argument in favour of the bill and of a reduction in income taxation, but it hai not attempted to show that the income tax is to any extent oppressive. As a matter of fact those who have examined the in,cidence of ' Commonwealth income tax will, I think,, arrive at the conclusion that the existing rates are equitable and just. The tax is graduated, and its incidence is progressive. Those who contribute most are best able to do so, but this proposed reduction will give the greatest concession to the wealthy people, and no considerable section of the less wealthy members of the community will get any advantage. </para>

We shall have an opportunity of justifying that stand when the tariff proposals are before us. I have taken from the report of the Commissioner for Taxation the total taxable incomes on the basis of the 1925-26 figures, which are the last available. Let me here interpose that the report of the commissioner used, in the old days, to be a comprehensive and analytical document, containing a great deal of useful information for those interested in taxation; but recently, for some reason, possibly for reasons of economy, many of the tables and statistics and information that were included  in  the old report have been excluded from the present report, which is now a very skimpy document. </para>

              <para>- That is so. Although the old report may have been somewhat costly to compile and to maintain, it was well justified. I find, from an examination of the last report, that the total taxable incomes under the Commonwealth act amounted to £179,000,000 for one year. I do not know whether I have made an error in calculating my figures, but I estimate that the resident taxpayers have a taxable income of £116,000,000, absentees of £2,250,000, companies of £59,000,000, and casual taxpayers of £1,000,000. I do not know whether the amounts for companies and resident taxpayers include to some extent the same taxable incomes, but if they do not, then the total taxable income is £179,000,000 for the Commonwealth. The people who are enjoying these enormous annual revenues are to get the advantage of the reduction in taxation. The taxable income has been an increasing quantity. The taxpayers are exhibiting no distress and showing no signs of ruin or insolvency. Their aggregate incomes have been increasing, and if we measure the prosperity of the general taxpayer on any other system - the increased bank deposits for instance, or the increase in general trade or the bank clearings, or any other commercial test that may be applied - we shall find that generally the taxpayers contributing to the Commonwealth revenue by means of direct taxation have been enjoying increasing prosperity and have not been suffering that distress which would warrant any drastic reduction in taxation. The tax should continue, because those people can well afford to pay it, and are far better able to meet the financial burdens of the Commonwealth than are the unfortunate wage-earner and small primary producer who at present do not rank in the list of income tax contributors. Certain classes of Commonwealth taxpayers will get large concessions under this bill. Taxpayers with taxable incomes of £10,000 a year, and there are quite a number of them, will be given a gift of £191 a year. </para>

              <para>- Queensland represents about one-eighth of the population of the Commonwealth and, as there are a number of taxpayers in that State with a taxable income of £50,000 a year, there must be a much greater number in the Commonwealth. To examine thoroughly and to understand the incidence of taxation and its consequent effect, we should have more statistics thau are available at present. It will be within the recollection of honorable members that the. Commonwealth ordered an examination of the position of private wealth in Australia in 1916. That was a war measure known as the wealth census. A lot of valuable information was obtained. The census was probably costly, and could not be undertaken every year, but it could, I think, be undertaken during each quinquennial period. In that way useful information would be furnished to the Federal Parliament and to every one interested in taxation and the economic progress of the century. Data could be collected which would be a guide as to the consequent effect of the incidence of taxation, and in respect of a great many other matters bearing upon wealth production and the economic situation of Australia. </para>

              <para>- Such a census should be undertaken here. Possibly some people concerned in wealth production would be embarrassed by it, but for the sake of the knowledge that would be obtained, such a census would be justified. I do not wish to unduly delay the bill. If it were left to me I should prevent its passage. I do not want to be regarded as an obstructionist. The Government is determined to relieve the wealthy people of some portion of direct taxation while continuing the indirect taxation on the working classes. Nothing that I can say will prevent the Government from doing that. But I wish to call attention to what I regard as a significant development of the Nationalists' policy as expressed by the Commonwealth Government in its legislative acts and in its policy this session. It has shown a disposition to favour the rich, and a callous disregard for the hardships and distresses of the less wealthy section of the community. It has shown a disposition to bolster up capitalistic institutions. It has lessened the effectiveness of the Commonwealth Bank by a deliberate act of policy, thereby enormously strengthening the opportunity of the private banks to exploit the community; it has surrendered the control of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line and left the privately-owned shipping companies to exploit the producers and shippers of this country. By an attempt to exempt from ' taxation absentee shareholders drawing revenues from Australian companies it was trying to favour another class of wealthy people. In this measure it is making a further concession to the wealthy section of the community concurrently with a continuance of the burdens on those less able to pay the existing taxation. </para>

            <para>.- Had I not been deprived of an opportunity during the budget debate to discuss the Government's financial policy, I should not have spoken on this bill. That opportunity --not having been provided, I am  obliged to  deal more or less piece-meal with it  on  the motion for the second reading of this measure. I should have preferred to deal with the operations of the Government in relation to one another, and not as isolated items; but I cannot let this bill pass without saying something on the policy which the Government has adopted. For reasons 'which may differ materially from those of honorable members, on the other side of the chamber, I think the Government is doing wrong in reducing direct taxation whilst piling up an ever-increasing burden of indirect taxation. In his budget speech the Treasurer, with that joyful expression which reminds one of Little Jack Horner saying " What a good boy <inline font-style="italic">am</inline> I," declared that since 1921-22 the Government had reduced taxation by £8,000,000; but he forgot to men lion that lie had added almost double that amount to our indirect taxation. Therefore, the gift of a reduction in taxation was a very unsatisfactory one. It was really a Greek gift. But the position is really worse than the figures indicate. There is something about indirect taxation which makes its incidence much more severe than that of direct taxation. This applies especially to the iniquitous taxation- levied through, protective duties which send up, not only the price of things imported, but also the price of those things which are manufactured, here. We know that Australia is hi a very serious financial position to-day. It does not behove honorable members to give vent to- alarmist expressions of opinion, but- an honorable member, responsible to the electors of the country, who considers the situation, cannot but feel the deepest anxiety regarding the conditions in Australia to-day. </para>

              <para>- I am endeavouring to show why this reduction of direct taxation is not justified. To-day there is an insistent demand for a reduction in the cost of living, but the Government is doing practically nothing to bring it about. It claims to be- doing so by this income-tax reduction, but this reduction will have 110 more effect -on the 'general burden -of high 'costs than have previous reductions. There will still remain burdens of indirect taxation to weigh the people down. I cannot help feeling that the Government is showing almost a callous indifference to the troubles of the people when it .goes on piling up expenditure, and embarking on schemes which necessitate a large revenue and additional taxation. There is no indication anywhere of an intention to shorten sail. If the Government wishes to relieve the burden of taxation and reduce  the  cost of living, let it do so in the most effective way, and that is by reducing indirect taxation. "While I am not in favour of this bill, I recognize that it is useless to oppose it, because the Government has its majority and will put it through. We can, however, register our objections to the Government's proposals. </para>

              <para>- I am prepared to do so. If the records of this House are searched it will be found that I have voted in accordance with the way I have spoken more often, perhaps, than any other honorable member. I have never been afraid to back my opinion by my vote, even if, by doing so, I have been placed for the time being in an apparently anomalous position.. The Government should reduce the high customs duties. The burden imposed by customs taxation is not represented merely by the actual amount of revenue which is received by the Government. In the case of income taxation the burden on the people is represented roughly by the amount of revenue which the Government collects, but that is not so with the customs taxation. Tn addition to the amount of revenue derived from customs duties, there is a huge, and often little realized, indirect burden laid upon the people, which has been calculated by different authorities to be from four to seven times the amount of the revenue collected. When the Government collects £40,000,000 or £45,000,000 from the people in customs duties, it represents an actual burden upon the country of £150,000,000 or £160,000,000 a year. When a ' Government insists upon 6,000,000 people bearing so great a burden as that, it surely indicates a callous indifference omits part to the people's needs. Instead of reducing  income  taxation, the Government should dlt down the customs duties. For every £1,000,000 reduction in the customs duties, the people would be relieved, even upon the most conservative estimate, of a burden amounting to £4,000,000. I .recognize that as the Government has huge commitments - some of its own making - for which it needs a big  revnue,  we should be careful not. to reduce taxation too quickly. The process should be gradual. If the Government wishes to secure a minimum reduction of revenue, with a maximum amount of relief to the people, it can do so by reducing indirect taxation. An honorable member has asked what serious crisis is ahead of us, and why we should use the argument of stern necessity when advocating economy. In the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of this morning, there is a very striking testimony, one of a long list of such testimonies given  in  this country for some time past, "to the pernicious effect of the present system of taxation. It is because of the evils pointed out by this article that we are required to raise such a huge revenue. I shall read a paragraph from the speech of the  President  of the Bank of New South Wales, which . held its annual meeting of shareholders in Sydney yesterday. The  President  said - </para>

          <para class="block">That is the utterance of a responsible man at the head of one of our largest financial institutions. He does not stand alone. Similar warnings have been given again and again, yet the Government continues its reckless expenditure, making still further demands upon the people for funds with which to foster this or that enterprise of a socialistic or paternal character. One would think that in the face of these warnings the Government would realize that it was high time to shorten sail, hut, in yachting parlance, instead of taking a rest, it is still running with the wind, with ringtails and spinnakers set, as if indifferent to the rising wind and the leeshore looming ahead. </para>

              <para>- I should have been glad to go into this matter in detail if I had been allowed to speak on the budget, but the honorable member, having had his innings, was amongst those who refused me an opportunity to speak. The reduction of the income tax and the maintenance of an undue proportion of indirect, taxation is not in accordance with the best teaching of economists and business men. The Government in continuing this policy has accepted a very grave responsibility. There are many aspects of the matter with which I could deal, but I shall not further detain the committee. I know that for the time being my protest is useless, but it is every man's duty to speak as he thinks. I wash my hands of all responsibility for this shortsighted policy. That the Government has been aware of the approach of the present financial crisis is common knowledge. Three years ago the Prime Minister informed me that in his opinion we were galloping fast towards a serious financial crisis. What has he done to avert it? He is still expounding schemes for expenditure, still creating more revenues, still piling burdens on the people. I can do no more than enter my protest. It may be ineffective, but there is a growing rumble of discontent in the community; the people are becoming alarmed by the fears and dissatisfaction expressed by the press and responsible leaders of industry. It would be wrong for me to remain silent and disregard the true interests of this country. It is time we. retraced our steps. Over and over again the Prime Minister has said we cannot do that. That is a declaration of weakness. A strong man, finding that he has made a mistake, will retrace his steps, and will not be afraid to take the responsibility of advising the people as to the course he considers right and proper. The right honorable gentleman has in some States suggested that he agreed with the policy I have enunciated. He has indicated to the people of Western Australia on several occasions that he considers the present tariff policy is wrong, yet, by agreeing to a reduction of income tax he is shackling the high protective policy more firmly on the people. The idea that indirect taxation can be reduced by increasing customs duties is fallacious, and opposed to all experience. Each increase of tariff duty has been followed by a greater volume of importations and enhanced customs revenue. The piling up of duties, instead of reducing customs revenue, has the reverse effect. We have evidence that this iniquitous policy is beginning to cause financial trouble among those manufacturing industries it is supposed to foster and protect. Yet we have before us a proposal to still further extend a system that is already stifling the country, and the Government is consolidating the evil by reducing income taxation, thereby rendering higher tariff duties necessary in order to avoid a shortage of revenue. This policy is opposed to the teachings of experience and the advice of students; but, unfortunately, these matters are not decided after open debate and detailed consideration. During the last three days, we have had the rare experience of listening to a model debate, but on a lot of income tax details which, important though they be, are insignificant in comparison with great principles of taxation and general policy. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott),</inline> like the boy in a well-known soap advertisement " will not be happy till he gets it," I inform him that my attitude in this House is the same as it always was. Apparently he refers to the time when I temporarily sank my own convictions and drifted with the stream upon which today he is drifting, and evidently will continue to drift. I came into this House as a member of an independent party. Individually, I adopted the policy that I did not belong to either the Nationalist or the Labour party. That is still my attitude. The policy of this Government, particularly of recent years, has been such that I have been more often at variance than in agreement with .it. I have taken what I consider to be the honorable course, and have sat on the Opposition side of the House. If I attack the Government I at least do bo from the front and not from behind. Surely my position is clearly defined. </para>

Since certain of my honorable friends have interjected, I shall recapitulate the position of the Country party and of the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page).</inline> We have the extraordinary spectacle of the leader of a party pledged to a reduction of customs duty, one who in the past denounced his present colleagues and leader for extravagance, piling up an enormous revenue in the form of taxation from customs and excise duties. In 3 922 the Treasurer declared that the then Treasurer - the present Prime Minister - was actually budgeting to receive more from customs and excise revenue than had ever previously occurred. The amount that year was £27,000,000. Now we have the same honorable gentleman <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> budgeting for £44,800,000 from the same source! I reiterate, for the purpose of emphasizing it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that we have here a party pledged to the reduction of customs taxation budgeting for the highest customs taxation on record, and at the same time reducing income tax, land tax, amusement tax, and other forms of direct taxation. And that party allegedly regards customs taxation as one of the most pernicious forms of taxation extant. I invite any honorable member of the Country party to deny that he has pledged himself against increasing customs and excise taxation. </para>

              <para>- We shall see. Surely the honorable member does not  consider that the taxation proposals now before the committee were the outstanding issue at the last general elections. I did not intend to speak at such length; but my friends, by their interjections and hostility, have encouraged me, for which I thank them. I shall take an early opportunity to give them some more home truths upon the tariff issue and the taxation derived from that source. These enormous receipts from customs and excise satisfy neither the protectionist who wishes to prevent goods from coming into Australia, nor honorable members like myself, who object to such a form of taxation. For that reason I protest against the principle involved in the present reduction when it means a continual increase of customs and excise taxation, which is the most obnoxious of all forms of taxation to the primary producers. </para>

            <para>. -  The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> has given us another exposition of his friendly feelings towards his ex-colleagues on this side of the chamber. It is not my intention to emulate the example of honorable members who preceded me and to deal wholly and solely with the fiscal question. But, since honorable member for Wimmera has gone out of his way to make a direct charge against members of the Country party that they are deliberately and wilfully ignoring the pledge which they gave to the electors, I take the opportunity to assure the honorable member that no member of the Country party has given such a pledge. </para>

              <para>- It is not part of the constitution of the Country party to give pledges of any kind, and especially pledges on the fiscal issue. Although I and other honorable members of the Country party who think with me on the fiscal issue are very cordial in our relations with the honorable members for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> we disagree with them on this issue. Those honorable members and the honorable member for Wimmera have opinions that are well known to this committee.

              <para>- I desire to refer to some remarks made by the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett).</inline> I am very sorry that he is not in the chamber. He seems always to be about when some of his friends on both sides of the chamber have prepared a studied castigation of the Government or honorable members of the Country Party, but when any of us reply he is missing. The honorable member for Henty is a ball of mystery to all honorable, members in this chamber. A good many of us have endeavoured to fathom the depth of his financial knowledge. I am not now posing as a financial authority - there are quite sufficient of . such people on both sides of the chamber without adding to the number. Last week the honorable member posed as a heaven sent financial authority to act as guide, philosopher and friend to the Government. In the course of his frequent outbursts he has made the most serious accusation that has emanated from any section of this chamber, not excluding the honorable members of the Opposition. The honorable member stated that our present Treasurer is the most tragic Treasurer that this country has ever had. To-night we have had another instalment of the honorable gentleman's financial wisdom, but it consisted principally of a reiteration of sentiments which he has previously expressed. Boiled down the honorable member's speech comes to this : he is totally opposed to the reduction of direct taxation. I wish to pin him down to that, as I propose presently to pin other honorable members down to specific statements. It is time that they were stripped of the sham which has lately enveloped them. </para>

              <para>- He distinctly stated to-night that it was a mistake to reduce direct taxation, and that if there was to be any reduction it should be in indirect taxation. The honorable member for Dalley supported him in that statement. What remedy has the honorable member for Henty to offer for our troubles? He assured us that he had one the other night when he made his attack upon the Treasurer; but, unfortunately, it was lost up his sleeve or under his hat. At any rate he could not find it. He has produced it to-night, and it is "Direct taxation should not be reduced." We can only interpret the honorable member's statements to mean that direct taxation should be maintained, and, if possible, increased. He said to-night that it would be more desirable to raise our revenue from direct than from indirect taxation."' I ask whether the honorable member -is willing to stand before the electors and1 advocate an increase in direct taxation ?. If he is, I admire his courage, but I do not think that he would receive much support from such newspapers as the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Ag'e</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> which are continually flaunting before the public his financial wisdom. </para>

Only the other  day  the very newspapers which boost the honorable member for Henty, castigated the Treasurer for not reducing direct taxation still more than he proposes to do. Every newspaper of any consequence in the Commonwealth has, during the last two or three weeks, complimented the Government upon going as far as it has done in reducing direct taxation. I know that, for I read all the metropolitan newspapers regularly.- </para>

              <para>- That is so; but we must regard them as the indicators of public opinion, and, therefore, we must assume that the honorable member for Henty is out of touch with public opinion on this subject. The honorable member has stated that it is a tragedy for this Government to be deriving an ever increasing revenue from indirect taxation, and he was supported in that statement by the honorable member for Dalley, the honorable member for Perth, and the honorable member for . Wimmera. I have listened patiently to the speeches which those honorable gentlemen, and others who hold similar views, have made in this chamber in the last week or so, and they have not thrown a single ray of light into the stygian darkness. They have nothing to suggest to protect us from the disaster which they say must overtake us if the Government continues to pursue its present policy. The honorable member for Dalley said not long ago that we were not protecting our industries sufficiently, and that he would be prepared to prohibit imports to make the protection effective. </para>

              <para>- It is nothing of the kind. It would be impossible, however, for the honorable member for Dalley to consort with the honorable  member for Perth, and the honorable member for Wimmera, and emerge in the role of the high protectionist. After carefully considering the speeches which have been delivered by the honorable members whom I have mentioned, I  consider  that the best thing for the Government to do would be to appoint them a royal commission to inquire into and report upon our financial position. I suggest that the following should be members of the commission: - The honorable member for Wimmera, the honorable member for Dalley, the honorable member for Perth, the honorable member for Swan, the honorable member for Forrest, and, last but not least, the honorable member for Henty. « </para>

When 1 asked the honorable member for Perth whether he would vote against the bill he 'said that' he would vote in accordance with his principles. Those honorable members have not the courage to vote against the bill. They would not be prepared to stand before the electors and say that they resisted a reduction of 10 per cent, in income taxation. I challenge those honorable members to say whether they are definitely hostile to this Government because it has reduced direct taxation by 33-j per cent, in the last five years. </para>

              <para>- The Country party is not pledged to any reduction of duties. If any pledge has been given by the Western Australian members I venture to say that it has been no more than a verbal undertaking. The Country party has no written pledges whatever, and its members are at liberty to give any individual undertakings they like. Although the primary producers complain about their burdens, their real complaint concerns direct, and hot indirect, taxation. Of course, a section of the primary producers suffers severely under indirect taxation, but I claim to know as much about the sentiments of the farmers as does even the honorable member for Forrest or the honorable member for Wimmera. The farmers are more antagonistic to the direct taxation imposed by the State Governments than they are to the indirect taxation imposed by the Federal Government. All State Governments have increased income taxation, yet the Commonwealth Government has decreased it. The honorable member for Dalley knows well that direct taxation has increased enormously in Queensland during the last few years. It is to-day over £5 per head of population. </para>

              <para>- If honorable members are honest, I think they will admit that the sentiment throughout Australia is in favour of reducing direct taxation. If it is possible to reduce customs duties without affecting the general protectionist policy of Australia, do it by all means, but no honorable member can point out how this is to be done. The exponents of high protection in the Labour party are always shrieking from the house-tops for still higher protection. New we have the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> advocating decreased indirect taxation. How can he expect to obtain high protection, amounting to prohibition of imports, without increasing the customs duties. Honorable members know very well that during the last five or six years there have been many increases in the tariff. </para>

              <para>- Whenever there has been an increase in the tariff, there has been a substantial increase in the revenue derived by the Government from customs duties. How can honorable members expect that there will be less revenue when the customs duties are increased? Failing the remedy which the honorable member for Henty said he had, when, speaking the other night, why should the Government reduce indirect taxation ? All the newspapers throughout Australia have been shrieking for a reduction in direct taxation. Probably 90 per cent, of the small wage-earners of the country pay no direct taxation at the present time. A few years ago the payment of a few pounds' income tax by the small wage-earners was looked upon as a great hardship. That burden has now been removed by raising the statutory exemption. It cannot be said, therefore, as was claimed by the honorable member for Dalley, that the Government proposes to relieve the wealthy of taxation at the expense of those who are less well off. That is a most unfair statement to make in view of the record of the Government. </para>

              <para>- Many of the taxpayers referred to have their money invested in enterprises which are vital to the welfare of Australia. A reduction of income tax does not necessarily benefit only a few wealthy persons living on private means. It benefits principally small companies. The great majority of companies operating in Australia are not wealthy. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member can show how we can secure  effective protection, and at the same time reduce indirect taxation upon the wage-earner, I shall be pleased to support him. But although I have been a member of this House for five years, I have not yet heard a practical scheme suggested. The Government has acted wisely in reducing direct taxation at this stage. I disagree with the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> that a great catastrophe is threatening Australia. The honorable member did not indicate the nature of that catastrophe. When I asked him to do so, he said that I ought to know what it was, and that if I did not, I was not fit to be a member of this House. Statements like that of the honorable member are calculated to injure this country by creating a feeling of pessimism. I do not admit that Australia is in the parlous condition mentioned by the honorable member. But even if his statement were correct, it would still be better for the Government to reduce direct taxation than to wait until disaster overtook us. By reducing direct taxation the Government has lifted a tremendous weight off industry, particularly' in view of the fact that all the State governments have increased direct taxation. If the Commonwealth Government, instead of reducing direct taxation, had increased it, the result would almost have been civil war in this country. If the suggestion of the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> that new direct taxation should be imposed, were carried out- </para>

              <para>- If the Government decided to sacrifice £10,000,000 through not levying increased revenue duties, and, instead, increased laud and income taxation by that amount, the result would be a collapse of the internal credit of Australia. The majority of companies operating in Australia to-day do not pay more than 7 per cent, or S per cent. If their income tax was increased enormously, as has .been suggested, they would have to go into liquidation. A,t-i the present time one large manufacturing company contemplates going into voluntary liquidation, which would mean throwing 2,000 employees out of ' work. If there was a real danger of that occurring, this Parliament would be justified in taking almost any measures to keep those persons in employment. I regard employment as the greatest stabilising factor in any country. The duty of governments, both State and Federal, is at almost any cost to keep their people employed. There is no better way of doing that than by reducing taxation on incomes. Even if a few wealthy people benefit in consequence, what does that matter, so long as a great majority of the people do so? The worst thing that can happen to the workers of any country is that they be thrown out of employment. It does not matter to them then what in-, direct taxation they have to bear; they cannot keep themselves and have to accept charity. But give men employment at the high wages which rule in this country and under conditions approaching the ideal, and they have very little of which to complain. </para>

              <para>- I was pointing out that if direct taxation is not reduced, there will be unemployment, and that  the  worst thing that can happen to any country is for large numbers of its people to be out of work. When workers are receiving high wages, they are not so concerned about the burden of indirect taxation, but it is a different matter when they are out of work. The catastrophe that threatens this country is that of unemployment. If, by reducing taxation, the Government can reduce the risk of unemployment, it will do more to assist the country than any previous Government has done. </para>

The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> has succeeded admirably in saying very little in a long time.  He  has proved to demonstration what I have long suspected in connexion with this Income Tax Bill - I mention  the bill so that my remarks shall not be irrelevant: - namely, that the Country party is not pledged to high duties, to low duties or to middle class duties; to an alliance with the Nationalist party, to its separate entity, to its  conjunctivity  ; or, indeed, to anything on earth or in the heavens above. In that happy position I am prepared to leave him. The position of members .of the Country party is as understandable as it is deplorable. They are as uneasy as they deserve to be. It satisfies me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that they have the redeeming virtue - </para>

I understand that you, sir, with your usual perspicacity and keen observation of the essentials of debate, pointed out that the honorable member for New England had not up, to that point, which was considerably distant from the point of COmmence.ment, touched either the merits or demerits of the measure. The honorable member seems to be suffering from a fatal congestion of mental pabulum. In a moment of inexcusable weakness he admitted that in connexion with taxation bills and all other matters, he studiously reads all the newspapers. In that regard he reminds me painfully, of the chameleon which changes colour according to the colour placed in juxtaposition to it. If that colour is blue, it becomes blue; if the colour is red, it becomes red. Unfortunately somebody, testing it beyond its strength, placed a tartan alongside it and it burst. That has been the fate of the honorable member. I notice that the Prime Minister has entered the chamber, and I feel very uneasy, because I conclude that he intends either to make a speech or to stop one, and neither prospect is very pleasing to me. </para>

"When the budget was under discussion we made frequent requests, backed by strong arguments, for a declaration by the Government" of what it proposed to do to relieve an admittedly most unsatisfactory financial position. And the answer was, " Not yet." Since then, and, indeed, before then, the Government has taken certain definite courses of action which have been deliberately designed to pile up the burdens of the poor and lift the burdens from the rich. f </para>

              <para>- I certainly had no intention to be offensive to Ministers, and least of. all to my fellow unionist, the Attorney-General. Whatever may be the intention of the Government, it is a curious and almost sinister fact that ever since this Parliament has been sitting in Canberra, the course of legislation has been directed along the lines I have indicated. Now, in the first definite measure with which the House has been asked to deal since the budget was so summarily and ignominiously disposed of by a deliberate declaration, the burdens are being taken off the rich and retained on the poor. I have heard, as the honorable member  for New England Heard,, public demands voiced.' in? the- press- and. elsewhere for- a reduction-, of. taxation, and  ¥ have heard, in justification of: those- demamds;. references' to&gt; overflowing revenues.. I am one who would welcome a reduction of all- classes of taxation;, but,, after all, taxation of any kind is&gt; the penalty we have- to impose on. ourselves- for the privilege of. luring, as an ordered commanity. I would cheerfully see taxation- reduced ;. but those people who in the press and out of it clamour for a- reduction of taxation,, put the- cart before the horse.. What, we have- to do is; to&gt; create conditions which I will make it possible equitably to reduce taxation. We have to meet- our obligations. If a. man is. confronted, in. hit? personal and private relationships" with, a huge debt,, he has to meet it by labour and sacrifice. Similarly in. public affairs, if we earnestly desire to reduce the terrific burden that is. now saddled, on the 'Australian- people, we must do it by labour and. sacrifice1 - by rolling up our sleeves and perspiring over the jpb.. It cannot be done by the simple method of passing an act of Parliament which will redli'ce' a certain class- of taxation,, while, through the medium of borrowing on the credit of Australia,, we are piling up an ultimate burden which- the people of Australia, will have to bear. I said, on another occasion, and I. repeat it. now,, that Australia, is shirking its obligation' to meet its indebtedness. It piled up this burden upon itself during, the war. I was one of those who were against it. but as the majority were against me I am prepared to do my share with that majority in shouldering the burden. I do not wish to be associated with those who1 are - speaking in a- general and not a' personal sense - guilty of the craven policy of shirking the duty of meeting this debt?, by handing it d'own. to our children and our children's children. Posterity will not be responsible for it, and, Yoolcmg hack along the course of history will say; "'You built: up this debt in your folly and fury;, and' in your cowardice have left us to meet It." </para>

            <para>.- I had no- intention/ of speaking- on, this bill-  tOriiight,,.  bu4 the.- debate.- has been, oft such »r character that. I cannot refrain-, from making- my position: perfectly clear:. I had. intended- to- reserve my rev marks on the fiscal issue, until  the  tariff ' came- up for consideration^, and I assure  the:  committee,  that,  those! remarks, would have been wholly unq.ualified.. I do- not suppose that- an.y persona is displeased that direct taxation is to be: reduced, but here is a-, bill brought' forward to,- reduce taxation,, while- a couple of days ago the Minister for Trade and&gt; Customs- placed an increased) burden? upon, the primary producers; audi workers of Australia, through  the:  medium of additional tariff imposts. I am more- than astonished at the attitude adopted: by the Government.. The honr orable member' for New England (Mr:. Thompson) brought up. at very peculiars subject for debate, the policy- o£ the Country party in. matters' of this. sort. Might I remind! the Government and! honorable' members' that at the last election every member of the Senate, supporting; the. Government was elected on the. clear and; well! defined issue that' he would* oppose1 increases- in tariff... Anyone who has. visited1: Western- Australia and studied, its condition* must realize how impossible it is- to. carry on&gt; with the cost of production that, exists there,, as. the result of our heavy tariff. The policy of the Victorian, section of the party is also clearly opposed' to fur-' ther increases. At. the. last conference of the Australian Country party I tabled1 a resolution which, was discussed at that meeting,, making, it clear that, if. that resolution were agreed' to, the policy of the party would be tb favour a big, reduction of customs duties as they affect production in this country. </para>

            <para>. - I support this bill, because having regard  iO  the Federal 'Constitution, direct taxation should not be imposed except in cases of  grave national emergency.

            <para>.- Last week, in my absence, several honorable members, particularly the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott),</inline> and, by interjection, the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> made observations concerning myself, and, by way of personal explanation, I take this, the first opportunity I have had, to  refer  to them. I have no desire to indulge in personalities, as did the honorable member for Gwydir. Most of his remarks were beneath notice, but he asserted that I had made charges against the honorable member for Rivori-wa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen),</inline> *the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson),</inline> and other honorable members individually. The records of the House, which I am not permitted to quote, show clearly what I said, and I well remember my statement. It was that those honorable members had been returned ou the new State issue, and the tactics of their leader had been such that their efforts were barren of achievement. Later in my speech I said that I did not Maine honorable members in the Corner, because they had been unwillingly dragged along the path. The honorable member for -Gwydir inferred that I had made . personal attacks on the honorable member for New . England : and himself:-, but the records do not bear out that assertion. I understand that the 'honorable member for Richmond called me a:" rat." That is beneath my notice; but it is rather strange -that the remark . should have been allowed to pass -unchaillenged. If I bad heard an honorable member so descri'be-1 . in 'his absence, I should have protested against it. <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> onfly other -matter 'that I desire to mention is tfuut the honorable member for Gwydir -referred &gt;to -my " infrequent visits " to : this chamber, and inf erred that &gt;I was neglecting my constituency. I think that the records : of the House, and the -observation of honorable members 'on both sides, are sufficient to show that I have certainly not neglected the people whom I represent, and that I have displayed no lack of energy in carrying out my Parliamentary duties. </para>
