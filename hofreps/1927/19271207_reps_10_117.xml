              <para>- The statutory duty of the Tariff Board is to investigate and report to the Minister, and through him to the Government. The duty of the Government, before it places proposals before Parliament, is to analyse the recommendations of the Tariff Board and to view them from all angles, to come to a conclusion upon them, and to submit its policy to Parliament. That course has been pursued in the present instance and, as the Minister in charge, I am prepared to defend the policy of the Government when the items are being discussed. </para>

            <para>- As I indicated last night, the Government has given consideration to the representations for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the condition of the aborigines of Australia, and communicated on the subject with the State Governments, but the Premiers of nearly all the States have expressed unwillingness to be associated with us in the matter. As without the cooperation of the States a commission appointed by the Commonwealth would not have power to investigate the matter fully, we do not propose to appoint one. We have, however, asked the Government of Queensland to lend us the services of one of its senior officers so that the position of the aborigines in North Australia and Central Australia, for which the Commonwealth is directly responsible, may be investigated. </para>

            <para>- I too have received a communication from the Women&#39;s Nonparty Association of South Australia in which regret is expressed that a perusal of the <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> report of a recent debate in this House does not disclose the fact that section 11 of the principal ordinance of the Northern Territory, 191S, has been put into operation. That is the section which provides for the protection of aboriginal and half-caste women when construction work is in progress. The Minister is well aware of the danger to aboriginal women who come iu contact with these camps, and 1 should like .to know what instructions he has issued to put into effect the provisions, of the ordinance? </para>

              <para>- The Department of Home and Territories, the Government Resident of Central Australia, and the Works and Railways Department have been collaborating with reference to this important subject so that half-castes may be safeguarded not only against contact with railway construction camps, but also in other ways. If the Queensland Government .will lend the services of a senior officer, we hope that we can get him to begin his work in the Alice Springs district, so that the whole position may be investigated at the earliest possible moment. </para>

The board reports that it is unable to agree that circumstances require the closing of all Federal departments at Canberra during the days between Christmas and New Year. To grant leave on these days to Federal public servants at Canberra would not conform to the provisions of the Public Service Act and it would be unfair to employees in other localities who might, with equal justification, make similar plans. In the circumstances, the Government is unable to accede to the request. </para>

        <para class="block">I desire to recapitulate the various steps that have been taken in connexion with the subject matter of this bill. The bill is designed&#39; to grant an extra &#163;1 per. ton bounty on galvanized iron as from the 1st January ensuing, and to allow a proportionate bounty to be paid upon tractors made in Australia from 1st January, 1927, provided that they do not contain less than 75 per cent. of Australian work or material. A report upon galvanized iron was submitted by the Tariff Board as far back as the 2nd July, 1925, and it recommended that the foreign duty should be raised. As a result Parliament - I think it was in March, 1926 - confirmed the enactment of a foreign duty upon galvanized iron, raising it from 30s. to 60s. a ton. At the same time the existing bounty of &#163;2 12s. a ton was continued. The Tariff Board further investigated the industry and, towards the end of last year, submitted a recommendation that the bounty should be increased to &#163;4 10s. per ton, and also that a deferred duty of &#163;5 10s. should be provided in the British, and &#163;7 10s.in the foreign schedule. That recommendation was considered by the Government, and, for the reasons which I shall set out, the Government submits the present proposal to the House. When the Tariff Board made that recommendation it stated that it did so because the extended protection would enable the Australian manufacturers to capture more of the trade in New South Wales, Victoria, Southern Queensland and South Australia. The total output of the Australian mills will supply only a little more than half the requirements of the State of New South Wales. It is extremely unlikely that the manufacturers would reduce their profit on a part of their output by forwarding supplies to other States, on which they would have to pay a higher freight. In view of those circumstances, the Government considers that the proposal of the board is not entitled to receive favourable consideration, under the present circumstances I shall go further into the question of output, and quote the following figures :  - For the year 1925-26, the importations of galzanized iron into the Commonwealth were 89,466 tons, while in 1926-27 they were 103,696 tons. The percentage of the Australian consumption supplied by the New South Wales manufacturer in those two years was 171/2 per cent. and 20 per cent. respectively. The percentages that local production bore to New South Wales&#39; consumption only, for those years are 51 and 53 respectively. The capacity of the works is between 28,000 and 30,000 tons per annum, which is approximately 25 per cent. of Australian requirements, and a little more than half of the requirements of New South Wales. I shall not stress that aspect of the matter. Honorable members, from the statistics that I have quoted, will be able to see exactly what the position is with regard to the capacity of the New South Wales works in relation to the total consumption of the Commonwealth and of the State of New South Wales. The present assistance to the industry is given by tariff and bounty. Tariff item 145 provides a duty of 20s. British preferential, 55s. intermediate, and 60s. general, and the bounty is 52s. a ton. This bill proposes to increase the bounty by 20s. a ton. It is considered that further assistance is necessary in order to enable the industry to carry on profitably and to increase its output to the full capacity of its present plant. It is a condition of the bounty that the materials which are used in the manufacture of galvanized sheets shall be wholly of Australian production.. It cannot be gainsaid that this industry is of great importance to the Australian iron industry, which provides the steel bars that are used. I should explain that when straight out tariff protection is given, the manufacturer is at liberty to use either imported or local materials, whichever he finds are the more profitable; but in the manufacture of galvanized iron sheets under the bounty he must use Australian steel. I have already stated that the capacity of the local works is from 2S,000 to 30,000 tons per annum, and that about 450 hands are employed. I wish to sb.y also that a large amount of  capital  is invested in this industry, but that since its inception only a small return has been received&#39; from it. I should like to say now a word or two respecting the amendment that relates to tractors. </para>

            <para>- I - I shall furnish the honorable member with all the particulars when the bill is being considered in committee. From memory, I should say that Australian zinc is used. - The schedule to the principal act makes provision for the payment of a bounty on the manufacture of tractors, varying from &#163;40 to &#163;90 according to the horse-power. This bill does not propose to alter the rates. Generally speaking, the basic principle of bounty acts is that a bounty shall be paid only in respect of articles that are produced wholly from Australian material. The Iron and Steel Bounty Act certainly provides that a manufacturer may be permitted to use imported materials; but it is intended that those shall be used only in an emergency, when for some unforeseen reason Australian materials are either not obtainable at all, or cannot be obtained in sufficient quantities. The manufacturers of tractors have experienced a difficulty in obtaining a suitable internal combustion engine of Australian manufacture. Since the bounty has been in operation a further difficulty has arisen as a result of the Crown Law authorities having expressed the opinion that the term &#34; materials &#34; in the section which authorizes the Minister to permit the use of imported materials in exceptional cases cannot be interpreted to include finished parts such as an internal combustion engine or a magneto. Thus any manufacturer who finds himself in the position I have described is prevented from claiming any bounty, and consequently is obliged to manufacture tractors under conditions that I do not think Parliament intended should operate. The object of the bill is to afford relief in that direction. Under it the full amount of bounty will be payable on the manufacture of tractors that are wholly Australian ; &#39; but it will be reduced in proportion to the quantity of imported material used. Thus, if a tractor is 100 per cent. Australian, the full amount will be payable. If imported materials are used to the extent of 1 per cent of the cost of the completed tractor, the manufacturer will receive 99 per cent, of the full amount ; and the reduction will continue proportionately until the stage is leached at which imported materials are used to the .extent of 30 per cent. </para>

              <para>- The bill proposes to liberalize the conditions of manufacture, with a view to facilitating the operation of the industry. The importations of tractors have been very large, and there is a wide field for the development of the industry in Australia. A thorough investigation has. been carried out by the  department, in conjunction with the Crown Law authorities, with the object of overcoming the difficulty and enabling fair encouragement to be given to the Australian industry. So far as I know, there is no opposition to this proposal of the Government, which,  I  hope, will stimulate the industry.  It  will certainly define in a legal way the position  that  Parliament intended to create. </para>

            <para>.- This bill proposes to amend the Land Tax Assessment Act. I draw attention to the fact that the Government has abandoned the position which it took up when it forced through Parliament a bill to withdraw the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments from the States, because it then proposed to repeal the land tax and to remit other forms of direct taxation. The identical payments that it formerly made to the Statesunder the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> arrangement it now proposes to make in a different form. If anything proves the value of criticism in Parliament, this does; because there is no doubt that on the occasion to which I have ref erred the Treasurer was determined to withdraw the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, repeal the land tax, and reduce other forms of direct taxation. Now it is intended that the land tax shall be continued, though at a reduced rate. The bill is one mainly of concessions. In addition to the 10 per cent. cut in the rates which will be made under the provisions of another measure, very considerable reductions are proposed under certain clauses of this bill. One concession proposed is triennial valuation of land, and another the abolition of retrospective assessments. The, loss in revenue that will be occasioned by these amendments, in conjunction with the 10 per cent. reduction in the rates, is estimated to amount in the ensuing year to &#163;445,900. That loss will increase as the years go by. These are very generous concessions to. the large landholders of Australia. No owner, the unimproved value of whose land is below &#163;5,000, pays land tax; therefore, a struggling farmer or a small landowner is not affected,, The Government has no warrant for making such a generous gift to these people. It talks at random about the mandate it received at the. last election; but I challenge it to. show any mandate to proceed with this proposal. It carefully refrained from making any mention of it when it appealed for the suffrages of the people. A Labour Government in 19.10 passed the Land Tax Act with a two-fold object: to secure to the people a portion of the unearned increment that accrues to land, and to burst up large estates so as to facilitate closer settlement, and enable those who are born on the land to obtain for themselves blocks from which they may produce wealth and earn a livelihood. &#34;We have reached the stage at which there is no longer any need to argue that the aggregation of large estates is inimical to the interests of this country. There was a time &#39;when that was necessary. In the. early days it frequently happened that meetings of pastoralists passed resolutions and conservative newspapers published articles in support of the argument that large estates should not be broken up, but should be retained for the purposeof running sheep and supplying the markets of the world with wool. But that day has gone by. With few exceptions people believe to-day that closer settlement leads to increased production from the land, and that the bursting up of large estates is desirable in the national welfare. It is strange that one of the exceptions to the rule isthe Prime Minister. At any rate he does not subscribe wholeheartedly to this policy as I shall show later. Speaking in general terms, it is realized that the aggregation of large estates is an obstacle to development and progress. Our first Land Tax Assessment Act was passed in 1910. In 1914 provision was made for the taxation of Crown leaseholds and the rate of taxation was increased. A further increase of 20 per cent. was made in 1918 but it was removed in 1922 under the provisions of a bill introduced by the present Prime Minister. </para>

              <para>- O - Our war obligations still rest upon us and the increase should still remain. The present Treasurer has also been responsible for decreasing our land taxation. He introduced a bill which had the effect of entirely abolishing the taxation of Crown leaseholds and so exempting 968,000,000 acres, or almost half the area of the continent, from taxation. It is now proposed that a further reduction of 10 per cent, shall be made and that concessions shall be granted which will be in effect another 10 per cent, reduction. So that our land taxation, if this measure is agreed to, will be 20 per cent, below what it was in 1914. It is- estimated that in 1927-28 our war and defence expenditure will amount to &#163;34,000,000, yet we are told in justification of reduction of land taxation, that the war is over. The fact of the matter is that our war obligations are still increasing. But the Government is so tender-hearted towards large land-owners that it proposes to relieve them &#34;of this obligation. It is recognized generally that our financial position is serious and that our loan expenditure is increasing. There is a strong demand for land throughout Australia, and one of the objects of this taxation is to discourage the aggregation of land in large estates and to encourage its subdivision into areas which would permit of it being put to better use. Since this taxation was first imposed in 1910 many large estates have been subdivided. In the first three years of the operation of the measure &#163;30,000,000 worth of land was subdivided. According to the 10th report of the Commissioner of Taxation, since the inception of this legislation approximately &#163;100,000,000 worth of land has passed from taxpayers to non-taxpayers. In other words estates of a value of more than &#163;5,000 have been subdivided into estates of a less value than that. I am aware that some of the subdivisions may not have been genuine ; but it cannot <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> denied that this legislation has had the effect of accelerating closer settlement and of encouraging men of limited means to take up reasonably small areas of land for agricultural and pastoral pursuits. There are still many people in the com munity who would be glad to secure land under reasonable conditions. Whenever either leasehold or freehold land is made available to the people by the various State governments, the number of applications is at least ten times as great as the number of blocks available.

              <para>- I do not desire to have my speech punctuated by interjections, but I shall reply to the honorable member for Wannon. The monopolizing of our land by a comparatively few people who own large estates has had the effect of inflating values to such a degree that when the Crown is able to make a few blocks available they are sought after with all the eagerness that the people display to win a prize in Tattersalls. In Victoria, during the last three years, 2,057 applications have been received for the 444 blocks that have been made available in the Mallee; and for the nine blocks now available at Lake Tyrell there are 167 applicants. Most people agree that the aggregation of land in large estates is detrimental to Australia and hinders our prosperity. Only those who wish to see a few people enjoying the heritage of the nation would argue that it is desirable to allow large estates to be held by the few to the detriment of the many. Land that is suitable for subdivision should be subdivided. Some years ago I visited the western part of the Wimmera, which is well known to the honorable member for Wimmera, and discovered that very large areas were  being held  there for grazing purposes which were not being put to their best use. I was shown a property of 4,000 acres which was managed by four brothers. I do not desire to mention their name, but it is well known to the honorable member for Wannon. The adjoining estate consisted of 30,000 acres and was held by a big squatter. The four brothers were able to run nearly a sheep to the acre of their 4,000 acres, but the big squatter had only about one sheep to four acres on his estate. The explanation was that the brothers worked their land thoroughly. They systematically destroyed the dead wood, rubbish and vermin upon it and generally looked after it; but the squatter made no particular effort to increase the production of his estate. At one time, as is well known, the whole of the Wimmera was given over to grazing; but to-day, in consequence of its closer settlement, it is carrying many more sheep than it did when it was a purely grazing proposition, and in addition, it is producing a large quantity of the best wheat grown in the world. Cultivation does not mean that the sheep pass out, but that the land-owners use the land as it should be used. The Prime Minister is not favorable to the breaking up of large estates. When he was in Queensland last August he delivered a speech which is reported in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> of the 2nd of August, from which I take the following paragraph: - </para>

              <para>- Experience throughout Australia has discredited it. Wherever large estates have been subdivided and improved, the country has been able to carry more stock and to resist drought conditions more effectively. I do not say that the comparatively poor country in Western Queensland should be subdivided into small farms. No man with a practical knowledge of this subject would argue in that way; but I do say that even that country could, with ad vantage, be divided into smaller estates than at present. Iri consequence of the withholding from cultivation of good country in recognized rainfall areas and adjacent to railways and markets, many of our people have been driven right out into the bush to get land. In the speech of the Prime Minister from which I have already quoted, there appears a statement relating to one of the most interesting pieces of legislation which this Parliament has passed in recent years. The disclosure which the right honorable gentleman made is significant and amazing. He indicated that on one memorable occasion, during the debate on the bill to abolish the taxation of crown leaseholds and remit all arrears in such taxation for the preceding seven years, he disciplined his party and brought it to heel. He stated - </para>

            <para>If it were in his power, he would wipe out all those arrears. He had threatened to resign and it was only then that Parliament agreed to abolish the tax, but compelled him to collect arrears. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Honorable members who were in this Parliament in 1923, will recollect that the Labour party fought that measure tooth and nail and were able to obtain sufficient support from honorable members opposite to oblige the Government to abandon its proposal insofar as it related to the remission of arrears of taxation. There was a race between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, which the former won, to catch the Chairman&#39;s &#39; eye in order to move for the deletion of that clause. Now we know how the members, of the party behind him were whipped into line. We thought then that they had acted of their own volition, but now we know the truth. The Prime Minister whipped them into line so far as the abolition of the tax on Crown leaseholds was concerned, but he was unable to get them to agree to the remission of - arrears of land tax being retrospective for seven years. He got them to agree to wipe out this tax on half this continent only by threatening to resign as head of the Government. I have quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier.</inline> If the statements are not correct, I ask the right honorable gentleman to contradict them. We have here a striking piece of inside information. When honorable members on this side said that by a threat to resign the Prime Minister forced his followers to submit, honorable members behind the Government resented the statement, but here are the Prime Minister&#39;s own words to justify it. I recall these two statements of the Prime Minister in order to show that the Government is not sound upon the question of land taxation, and that it is more interested in the welfare of large squatters than in enabling smaller farmers to acquire farms on which to make a living for themselves and their families. Land monopoly and the curse of landlordism have been the struggle of the ages. In some of the older countries of the world they have forced men and women to emigrate to freer lands. The Labour party set its face against land monopoly in 1910. The Labour Government then in office brought in a system of land taxation. Since the present Government has been in office the provisions of that legislation have been whittled away. If the process is continued much longer the land tax will be worthless as an effective check against the aggregation of large estates. I shall say no more at this stage regarding the general principles of this question, but shall refer in general terms to some of the clauses of the bill before us. I propose to deal with them in greater detail in committee. One clause provides for the creation of a valuation board. Notwithstanding that I am of the opinion that far too many boards and commissions have been appointed by this Government, I think that the appointment of a valuation board, composed of experts with a knowledge of land values, would be justified if it were the final court of appeal against the valuation of the Commissioner of Taxes and his officers. If one thing more than- another has been demonstrated by our experience, it is the great need for some authority to give consistent interpretations of the law and to determine finally the value of land. Every honorable member knows the disputes that have arisen in connexion with land valuation. Should such a dispute arise, the case is eventually brought before the court and decided by a judge. I have the highest respect for our judiciary. I believe that its members are impartial and, in the main, able; but however learned in the law or impartial they may be, I submit with all due respect that judges are not the proper authorities to decide questions of land valuation. In the tenth report of the Commissioner of Taxation honorable members will find some very interesting reading. From it I propose to quote the following extracts : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The judgment of the court in the appeal of <inline font-style="italic">Jowett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Commissioner of Taxation,</inline> could not bc treated as being applicable to the facts of any other case...... </para>
            <para>The court did not lay down any rules of valuation which the department could usefully follow...... </para>
            <para>The department was surprised at the decision. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The decision of the judge in that case was not accepted by the department as a guide. Further cases have to be heard on appeals which will probably come before the same judge. I want to ensure that the Valuation Board, which I assume will be an impartial tribunal, representing various interests, will have the last say as to the valuation of land for taxation purposes. The appeal from the commissioner&#39;s valuation to the board should be the final appeal. I shall give my reasons for this view. The. case of <inline font-style="italic">Jowett</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Commissioner of Taxation</inline> furnishes a striking illustration of my contention that judges are not the proper authorities to deal with land valuation matters. The decision of the judge in that case not only was a different interpretation of the law from that of the Full High Court of Australia, but it also produced a mathematical jumble which, -to say the least and to use the mildest term, was weird. I shall not worry honorable members with the details of that judgment - they can read it for themselves - but I propose to take one illustration from it. For the leasehold of the Quambatook estate in Queensland, comprising 107,000 acres, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> paid a rental of &#163;544 per annum. Notwithstanding that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Jowett&#39;s  witnesses agreed that that rental was reasonable the judge valued the fee simple of that property at &#163;376. </para>

              <para>- I am dealing with a specific property whose owner, witnesses admitted that the rent charged was reasonable, and not with a supposititious case affecting land of no value. In dealing with this question we should do well to confine ourselves to actual casas. I believe that the annual rental for the .estate referred to was low; even the lessee admitted that it was reasonable. In the circumstances, the capital value of that property, as determined by the judge, was ridiculously lo w. Let us .examine the method adopted by the judge in arriving at his valuation. In doing so we should remember .th-j.i- the Quambatook estate had been purchased, so that  His  Honor had before him the purchase price. For the leasehold, &#163;13,604 was paid. Included in that amount was a sum of &#163;10,696 for improvements, leaving &#163;2,908 as the value of the lease which had 25 years to run. That is a plain admission by the owners  that they regarded the rent as low ; otherwise they would not have paid anything for the balance of the lease. The sale was on a walk-in walk-out basis, the total purchase price for land and improvements and stock being &#163;35,000. The figures I have, given are exclusive of stock; the amount was agreed to by both the buyer and the seller. The judge took the price paid for the unexpired term of the lease, namely, &#163;2908. By some process of valuation, he assessed the annual value of the lease at &#163;249. He then added the annual rental of &#163;544, and arrived at a total annual value of &#163;793. That amount he capitalized at 10 per cent, and obtained a capitalized value of &#163;7930. Yet, he said that the fee simple of the property was worth only &#163;376. </para>

I have shown how the judge arrived at the capital value of &#163;7930. To that amount he added improvements valued at &#163;10,696, making the total capital value of the land and improvements &#163;18,626. But the next move of the judge was the most extraordinary of all. Although he included the value of the improvements at. &#163;10,696 to procure a total capital value of &#163;18,626, in .arriving at the result of &#163;376 as the capital value of the property, he deducted &#163;18,250 as the value of those improvements. </para>

              <para>- The judge said that &#163;18,626 would be the value of the improvements in fee simple, whereas &#163;10,696 was their value with a 25-years- lease.  His  Honor, in endeavouring to ascertain the fee simple value of the whole property, should have taken into account the fee simple value of the improvements. If he had done that his decision would not have been the inaccurate mathematical jumble that it is. Honorable members need not concern themselves about that jumble. All that they need to know is that the judge capitalized the rental of &#163;544 per annum at 10 per cent, and arrived at a value of &#163;5440. Even if the rent was a fair one - and I contend that it was low - the property was worth at least &#163;5440. Yet the judge valued it at only &#163;376. What a valuation for an estate comprizing 107,000&#39; acres ! </para>

A victory, and on such a decision as I have mentioned! I raise this matter now, because I want to ensure that the proposed Valuation Board, if appointed will have the last word in the valuation of land and not leave the question of valuation to the judges. Questions of law, of course, and of law only, must go to the judges when there is an appeal. If that is not made definite and clear in the bill, I shall not support the appointment of a valuation board. </para>

              <para>- I thank the honorable member. I should like to refer to another aspect of this question, and this is a matter of equity. The proposal is to  allow an appeal by the taxpayer from the department to the board on valuations only. Of course, there are some other appeals that can go to the court; but from a number of arbitrary decisions by the Commissioner&#39; there is no appeal, either to the board or the court. With due respect to the Commissioner, who, I believe, is conscientious and earnest, I think that he, like every other man, is capable of making mistakes. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">It is a basic principle of law that when a man has arbitrary power to give certain - rulings, there shall be some tribunal to whom appeals against his decisions can be made. I am strengthened in that statement by the fact that right through the Income Tax Act such a right of appeal is recognized, because an appeal board is provided. It is true that in respect of this tax there will be appeals to the court in some cases; but in other cases no appeal is allowed. For instance, &#34;section 42a was purposely designed to protect the revenue from fraud, and I agree with the provision; but when the Commissioner gives his decision under section 42a, or section 37, or section 76, the taxpayer has no right of appeal against it. I suggest in the present case that, if he cannot appeal to the Valuation Board - and there may be an argument against that - he should have the right of appeal either to the court or the Appeal Board under the Income Tax Act. That is provided for in a minor degree under the present bill, where certain action can be taken by members of the Appeal Board under the Income Tax Assessment Act. Under that act the board can hear appeals against arbitrary decisions by the Commissioner. That is only reasonable and fair. Whilst I am strongly in favour of land taxation, and believe that the large land-owners both in town and country should contribute substantially to the revenue - the tax on big estates should be sufficiently high to penalize them for holding big areas - the application of such a law as this should be just. </para>

              <para>- That argument was out of date a quarter of a century ago. It might appropriately be applied to our income tax or to any tax that is based on the principle that the burden shall be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. Every tax imposed in that way can be called a class tax; but the class that objects to pay it always has the remedy in its own hands - it can break up the large estates, and make them available to the small holders who are land hungry. When the bill reaches the committee stage, I shall discuss this matter further. For the present I hope that the Treasurer will make a note of my remarks. There should be a right of appeal to a board or to the court against any decision, especially when it is farreaching and involves considerable sums of money ; but the right to appeal against valuations should be limited to appeals to the valuation board. If we grant the right of appeal from the decision of the Commissioner, it will bring the bill into line With the Income Tax Assessment Act. </para>

          <para>I draw attention to the clause proposing the abolition of retrospective assessment. These re-assessments are provided for under both the Land Tax Act and the Income Tax Act. The Commissioner cun go back three years under the Income Tax Act and re-assess the value. Under the Land Tax Act, as it stands at the present time, he can go back two years. The reason for that is obvious. It is not always possible to obtain a correct re-assessment. Mistakes can be made both by the taxpayer and the department, and a reasonable time must be allowed for the correction of  valuations.  The Treasurer said that, although that was necessary while the Land Tax Act was a new measure, it was not so necessary now. Would not that argument apply equally to the Income Tax Act? There is not the slightest doubt that we shall lose considerable revenue under the bill, and certain persons will evade taxation. Under this measure there can be re-assessments that reduce the tax, but not re-assessments that increase it if it is too low. </para>

              <para>- That is the responsibility of the purchaser. It is for him to see that there are no rates or taxes due or any encumbrance on the land when he buys it. When the department was first established, there was good reason for this provision, because it was impossible to make valuations of all taxable lands so as to include them in the original assessments. But every year lands are becoming taxable that were not previously assessed. When they are discovered, it will be impossible under this bill to go back even for the two years provided under the existing act. Therefore, I shall oppose the clause that provides for the abolition of retrospec tive re-assessments. The question of uncertainty is put forward as an  argument - that it. interferes with adjustments of sales and transfers; but that is a special argument. This system has operated for seventeen years. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member rendered an account, and found out that after it had been paid an amount had been omitted, he would include that amount in the next account and expect payment. The department has a similar right. The Statute of Limitations allows six years; but in the act it is asked that the time limit as it stands, of two years, be abolished. There is a further and worse blemish upon this bill. It removes the power from the Commissioner to -make annual valuations, and it limits the department to triennial valuations. It is true that, in practice, valuations may not be made frequently. Years may elapse before certain areas are re-valued; but the department watches land movements and notices whether the prices move upwards or downwards. It makes its valuations when the changes take place. In certain localities values alter rapidly, and sales disclose that the department has not always discovered the change in values. It should retain the right that it has under the act to-day to make a new valuation. This will be denied to it under the amendment, and for three years a valuation will stand before it can be altered. Reductions could be made; but the valuations could not be increased. Surely that is not fair. The Treasurer, when questioned as to what he estimated the loss would be, put it down at &#163;80,000 a year. This loss, through not assessing lands at their true values as they move upwards, will be all in the interests of the men whose land is increasing in value. It will be of no benefit to those whose lands are depreciating in value ; the latter will have the same rights as before.. That is an anomaly that should be removed. </para>

          <para>The total reductions under the bill, and the 10 per cent, reduction under the Rates Bill, will be &#163;-145,000 in. round figures, equal to approximately 20 per cent, off the existing tax; approximately &#163;400,000 will go to the owners of estates over &#163;25,000 in value. I have not been able to obtain the figures for the latest years, because, unfortunately, the Commissioner does not include, in his most recent reports, the details that he used to publish in previous reports.  His  9th and 10th reports do not contain the same full information that was found in the 8th and previous reports. I join with, the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> who made a similar complaint in regard to income taxation. I ask the Treasurer, to see that in future the reports of this department provide honorable members with the complete information formerly supplied. I am making an estimate which I think is nearly accurate, on the basis of the latest available figures, and, in my opinion, &#163;400,000 of the total reduction of &#163;445.000 will go into the pockets of the owners of estates worth not less than &#163;25,000 each. </para>

              <para>- Some would be individuals and others companies. The 10 per cent, reduction alone will mean that, to 75 taxpayers with estates of over &#163;100,000 in value there will be reductions of approximately &#163;1,000 each, 25 taxpayers with estates of over &#163;200,000 value will get reductions of approximately &#163;1,900 each, and five taxpayers with estates valued at over &#163;500,000 will each receive reductions amounting to about &#163;3,500. That cannot be justified. Many of. these landowners are sitting down on large areas of land that could well be cut up, and some of it is suitable for intense cultivation. By not utilizing their lands to the full they are driving the sturdy sons of farmers far back into the bush. I could take honorable members to portions of the State of Victoria with which I am  familar,  and 1 could show them the broad acres of the Western plains on which sheep are running, although the land could be well used for agriculture. Men born on the land, and anxious to establish homes there, have been forced to take up selections down at Otway and Beech forest. After 20 years or more of heart-breaking toil, most of them have had to abandon that country, with their hearts broken and their little bit of capital gone. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and if the Commonwealth Government came to their aid with bounties and assistance in other directions, they would still be deprived of the full benefit to which they are entitled. I would go to the full limit to assist these people to get the full reward for their labour and a return commensurate with that paid to others. But what would be the result? Land values would increase and the land monopolists who hold large areas would demand higher rents, or sell their land for sub-divisional purposes at greatly enhanced prices. Years ago beautiful rich land in the Western District of Victoria ar,d other rich districts was leased at small rentals, and was carrying perhaps one sheep to the acre and sometimes less. Later improvements came along. Butter factories and creameries were established in suitable places, refrigerator space was provided on overseas ships to carry their produce across the seas to the markets of the world, and instead of having gluts during good seasons with butter being sold here at 3d. to 6d. a lb., we had a steady market all the year round, and the butter industry was successfully established. But who is reaping most of the benefit of the improvements that have been effected? </para>

              <para>- I would apply it wherever advantage was being taken of the assistance given. I would say Cb the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> that if the party to which I belong were in power and we had the constitutional authority, there would not be&#39; a duty given to a secondary industry without the right to check their profits and see that they did not take fair toll of it. I would not make any distinction between primary and secondary industries. I would not show enmity or favoritism towards either. I wish to see our manufacturing, agricultural, and pastoral industries marching successfully along side by side, and their prosperity being shared by those engaged in such industries. They should receive full reward for their labour, whatever they may be, and not be allowed to take advantage of the beneficience of the Government or of the activities of the people. That is why I am advocating the retention of the land tax. Apart from the fact that the tax gives to the community a portion of the value that the community has given to the land, it has also an economic value. It will assist to burst up large estates and give an opportunity to the men of this country to produce wealth from the land on which they were born instead of being driven to the cities to eke out an existence.

            <para>.- I welcome the bill in so far as it affords some relief to land taxpayers; but there are many directions in which I hope it will be improved when the committee, stage is reached. With that reservation I welcome it as an instalment of. longdeferred justice to an important section of the Australian people. Of course, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> is, to use a colloquialism, at his top on the question of land taxation, and it was the memory of some of his, may I say, flamboyant speeches made in this House and in the country that impelled me to direct a few remarks to him during the debate on the Income Tax Assessment Bill, particularly in regard to the incidence of income and land taxation upon the land-holder. Prior to the last election the honorable member marched up and down the country telling the people of the wrongdoings of the land-holders and particularly of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmund.</inline> Jowett. Their actions, which he regarded with suspicion, became a political weapon in the hands of the honorable member, and he must have been somewhat dumbfounded when the court declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmund</inline> Jowett was right and the honorable member was wrong. The subject had, however, served his political purpose. In regard to the principle of land settlement and land holding, strange as it may seem, I agree with the Leader of the Opposition - although we arrive at the same conclusion from different angles - when he says that if we are to have progressive development it is a sound principle that as our populaiton increases the needs of rural Australia in the matter of land  settlement must be met. The greatest safeguard of a nation is the settlement of a great band of prosperous yeomanry upon the soil. I have always said that we should be determined to make rural occupation - land settlement - the blue riband life of the nation. It is gradually becoming subordinated to the extreme and excessive demands of city dwellers of Australia, and our potential wealth and secondary industries upon the landholding is daily becoming more precarious and less remunerative. I agree with the honorable member when he says that the making available of land suitable for intensive production and agriculture, and even for closer pastoral settlement by the application of scientific methods such as top dressing for pasture and other improvements, will be the means of settling a larger rural population than we have to-day. Therefore, I am not championing the cause of those who desire to hold exclusively large areas suitable for subdivision, whether for agricultural or other purposes. But there are other considerations which must not be overlooked. There are, however, vast areas of land, mostly in the back country, which, owing to climatic conditions and precarious seasonal vicissitudes, are quite unsuitable for subdivision, and which can be held profitably only in large areas by those who have sufficient resources at their command to withstand the dire happenings of a succession of bad seasons. It is impossible for a person with limited capital to take up large areas of unsuitable land and brave the known conditions which prevail in those areas. I do not share the views of the honorable member on that point. It is an easy matter to tax a man off the land, but it is not easy to put him on. From the time when the principal act was first introduced I have always felt that it was not born in an atmosphere of justice. As the Commonwealth Parliament had not the power to deal with land and land settlement, it was intended from the outset to be a penal tax. At the inception of federation the control of land and land settlement, as well as all activities associated with the land, was deliberately left to the State Parliaments. The Commonwealth had no power to determine land settlement policies or the conditions governing the holding of land. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has apparently never thought of an alternative to penal taxation for forcing land settlement. When the need arises, there is an alternative which rests with the States in the form of legislation providing for compulsory acquisition, which is at present in operation in some of the States. Reference has been made by -the honorable member to a nation hungry for land, and to only one in every 1,000 applicants for certain blocks of Crown land offered by ballot or Land Board, being successful. If the honorable member will refer to pastoralists&#39; associations and land agents in all the States, he will be informed that he can obtain as much alienated good land as he wants at reasonable rates. At present, land can be obtained at reasonable rates because many land-holders who have &#34;given their labour and that of their families have not received a return comparable with that received by those engaged in secondary industries. This is not a land-locked country. There may be certain districts in which large areas are held by wealthy land-holders. </para>

              <para>- The honorable gentleman stated that Australia was a country in which people were unable to obtain access to the land for settlement, and that there was, in consequence, retardation of national progress, production and development. There is, however, in every State an abundance of land available for purchase, and most of it may be had on easy terms. These holdings consist, for the most part, of -improved lands and ready-made farms, of which young men may take possession without a great expenditure of time or money upon development, and begin straight away to carry on the chosen occupation. Confirmation of this may be obtained by any one who cares to make investigation in any township or centre in any State in the Commonwealth. Land values have received a check, and land is available at reasonable prices on reasonable terms. I repeat, however, that if the nation is to progress and population increase, land must be made available as required to meet the growing needs of this country. It is, after all, to the great lauded interests to which we have to look for the funds with which to develop the secondary industries of our country. I am one who endeavours to put first things first, and I place it as an unassailable truth that the success of Australian economic life to-day depends primarily on the success of the rural industries. This is much more sa in Australia than ... in the . older countries which have become the world&#39;s workshops and have a great distributing trade in which industrialism plays a large part in providing the world&#39;s commodities. But Australia, for generations to come, must depend for its development on primary industries. Anything which tends to weaken the primary industries 4 is reflected very quickly in our secondary industries, as we find in this year of short production, when already unemployment is increasing in all the States, and a condition of financial disorder has been brought about. One would assume from the remarks of the honorable gentleman that Australia had not faced this great question of land settlement in a bold and comprehensive manner, but actually the reverse is the position. If one takes the trouble to go into the historical records of Australia one will see that there were various phases of laud settlement, starting in the old days of what might be called  &#34;squattages,&#34;  which represent a rather romantic, though passing, phase in the rural life of Australia. They represented, for the most part, the handling by adventurous and daring men of small flocks of imported stock, for which, at the time, no preparation had been made, no large estates built  up,  and no water or pastures provided. There was practically no&#39; market for any of the products other than wool, and the price for that was very low. The practice was to boil down the carcasses for the bit of tallow which might be obtained. But we march on from those days of  squattages  when the foundations of the States were laid. &#39; There was a feeling on the part of . our increasing population that they were not able to get sufficient land for homes, and a great forward movement was taken by the statesmen of the day. They gave to the then rising generation the power to go out and select from the squat.tages which then were the Crown lands of the country their holdings in their own chosen localities, there to put . in their pegs, and found their future homes. They gave the most liberal terms, requiring no deposits in many cases, or, at any rate, not &#39;more than the payment of the survey fees. Those were difficult times; many of the selectors, after leaving the mark of their labour on their holdings, were &#39; finally forced to abandon them. Those were hard times. Some, however, struggled through by means of the unpaid toil of their families, and their capacity to work and wait, until finally they became the foundation of Australia&#39;s yeomanry of to-day. Now we have reached a further stage, and scattered throughout every State there is a magnificent array of rural homes owned by those who have fought adversity, who have won out, and established the primary industries of the Commonwealth. They have sought out the lands most suitable for their purposes, and it has taken no act of Parliament, no act of compulsory acquisition, to secure the settlement of these areas. The judgment of the men themselves, and the pressure of economic conditions,- forced the settlement. The honorable gentleman will know that, in the districts with which he is most familiar, the Tower Hill district of Victoria, no act of Parliament was necessary to procure settlement. That land is now worth over &#163;100 an acre, but the force of economic circumstances was sufficient to clear it of forest, and to make it rich and fruitful. In no age can there be a perfect system. Australia is not the home of landlordism; it is the home of people who came mostly from other countries to avoid the curse of landlordism. In the main, we are a great body of freeholders who believe in the right of a man to have some spot on earth that is his very own; a spot upon which he may set up his citadel, and upon which no one can set foot to desecrate his home. That is th&#38; fundamental belief of our people. Now I come to the question that perplexes the honorable gentleman, the question of land values. He says that he would mark as with a javelin the ruling prices of land to-day, and would not allow them to advance beyond their present point. That is a human impossibility. </para>

              <para>- Tes, by fixing a mark beyond which it would not be allowed to go. The ideal valuer has not yet arrived upon earth. The man who thinks he can fix a stable price for land is a dreamer of dreams. Take this very act which seeks to tax the unimproved value of land, and contrast it with similar acts in the States. In Victoria, for example, the Parliament did not agree on the same formula as our federal act for the taxation of unimproved land values. If there is such a thing as a definite basis for determining the unimproved value of land, we ought to be able to fix  upon  a formula defining it. </para>

              <para>- I have had a good deal of experience of land selling and land financing, and I know that it is the most difficult thing in the world to fix the value of land. Some say let us fix upon its productive value, but what is the productive value of land? One man will grow wool, and another will grow corn or some other commodity. Therefore, there is no such thing as fixing a value that is not subject to change. Then, again, we may have a serious depression in the value of products. Probably never before in Australia were there such wonderful seasons and high prices for primary, products as during the period of the war and immediately following. At the beginning of the war there was a drought, but for ten or twelve years after that there was a period of unprecedented rural prosperity, with prices for rural products at a level never previously dreamt of. The effect of this was that there was a wave of prosperity throughout Australia. Values of land rose in sympathy with that wonderful fund created by the prosperous conditions prevailing. Many people bought land, sold it again, and bought more, and, in many cases, the price they paid was not the true value of the land, but the mark of their capacity to purchase. Their capacity to purchase often dominated them when they desired to acquire land on which to settle their families. In considering the value of land, we must remember that there is something in human nature which makes men dearly love to build some reserve, and there is ho class of investment so favoured for this purpose as investment in &#39;land. The only  form of investment which approaches it for popularity in this connexion is investment in the country&#39;s consols. We cannot, therefore, lay down any hard and fast rule that will determine values, because they fluctuate; according to the season, the output, prices of produce, and the demand for land. </para>

          <para>I have never been attracted by the federal land tax. Judging it by any test that may be applied to it, it, it cannot be regarded as just taxation. It is not based on any spirit of fairness. First of all, it is the only form in which wealth is taxed in Australia, and even the Labour party has abandoned all its ideas of imposing a wealth tax. Then, why should a portion of the land of Australia be subjected to land taxation and not the rest of it? If it be an equitable system of raising revenue to impose a land tax, it should be levied without exemption, but when the Commonwealth Labour party introduced its land tax it, so to speak, gilded the pill by exempting from the payment of the tax any person owning land whose unimproved value was less than &#163;5,000. By that exemption owners of suburban cottages and all small land-holders, in the aggregate representing a great voting and political fighting power, were exempted, leaving the rest of the landholders of Australia, numbering fewer than 20,000 persons, to provide the whole of the revenue which the Commonwealth was to derive from its land tax. </para>

              <para>- At any rate, there is a land tax in Victoria, and, furthermore, the land legislation of that State provides for the compulsory acquisition of land for closer settlement purposes. Hundreds of thousands of acres have been acquired under an act that contains a provision for compulsory purchase for soldier land settlement. It was not the intention of the Commonwealth Constitution that the land. tax should be imposed, for the purpose of breaking up large estates. The tax itself is not only a tax on the wealth of the man who owns the land; it is also a tax on the borrowed money invested in the land, without being, a tax on the mortgagee who lends it. Speaking broadly, it may be said that the amount of money advanced on land in Australia is 50 per cent, of its value. We have, therefore, a wealth tax in the form of an emasculated land tax, specially designed to fit the case of 20,000- people, and leave free the  mortgagees,  who may have lent up to 50 per cent, of the value of the holdings of these people. It is not only a tax on the capital value of the people who own the land, but it is also a tax on the borrowed money invested in lands, with the exception of the exemption of &#163;5,000. </para>

              <para>- What I am claiming is that the Commonwealth land tax is really a tax on wealth that exempts the rich mine-owner who draws wealth from the bowels of the earth; the shipowner whose ships sail on the coast of * Australia and are given protection against overseas competition; the manufacturer, with the exception of his factory; the bond-holder, and to some extent,, the rich money lender. If it is a right principle to impose a tax on wealth, it is inequitable to pick out 20,000 people topay it, unless it has been conceived in the spirit of a penal tax to carry out the purpose referred to by the honorable member for Yarra. In my opinion, judging it by any test we may apply to it, that legislation is unworthy of an Australian Parliament. I regret that the Government&#39;s instalment of relief is so small. It is not my desire that large landholders should be exempt from taxation. They ought to pay taxation for the privileges &#39; they enjoy. But so should every one else: those who lend money on mortgage, the bond-holders who hold their bonds in banks, the manufacturers whose goods are on the shelve? awaiting distribution, the rich importing firms and the .ship-owners. If the principle of taxation of wealth is sound, why have we this one form of taxation which taxes, not only the equity which a man has in his land, but also the very money he has borrowed to enable him to hold it? The principle of the Commonwealth land tax tested in every way is unsound, and its perpetuation is a reflection on the intelligence of the people of Australia; likewise on their courage, as they are apparently not willing to get rid of it. We should ascertain who are benefiting by the expenditure of the people&#39;s money, and then levy taxation on them for the prosperity they enjoy by income tax according to their incomes. The honorable member for Yarra referred with a sneer of contempt to the legislation recently enacted which exempted from land taxation our western lessees. After all, those lessees were not holders of valuable Crown lands; they were merely lessees of doubtful areas. Had they not put their improvements on that country it would have been infested with rabbits, noxious weeds, and wild dogs, and the Crown lands would have been not only useless, but also a menace and curse to the country. These lessees have done a great service to the nation in tackling those far back lands, which for the main part are the least dependable in Australia. They are mostly in drought areas, and the living conditions on them are most unfavorable. As the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline> has interjected, they have ruined many pioneers. </para>

              <para>- That is not the spirit in which we ought to impose our taxation. We do not propose to ruin a man first and then let him go free from the payment of taxation. We want to give men every encouragement to go on the land and not pick them out specially for taxation while exempting from such taxation their richer brothers who live in the cities in greater comfort and enjoy the privileges conferred by the public money spent upon the development of Australia. We have heard a great deal about the high social standard of Australia, but in the. main it is not enjoyed by the great majority of those who take on land settlement. The great majority of those who have settled in the western area of New South Wales, in Central Australia, and in the northern portions of this continent, are far removed from pleasant social conditions&#39;. The only things they enjoy are the happiness of their family life and any feeling of satisfaction they may have in knowing that they are playing an important part in the development of our great public asset. I have looked at this legislation from every aspect. It is not the Commonwealth&#39;s task to break up large estates. The States have ample power to undertake that task. In every sense the people of the States are those who ought to control land settlement. They know their own requirements better than we do, and most of them are endeavouring to grapple with the problem. The honorable member for Yarra has drawn attention to a few landboard ballots for isolated lots which have been made available. From time to time the Crown combs over its lands, seeking areas suitable for settlement, and when a lot is found it is offered at a reward price to any man . who is willing to settle on it. As unoccupied land, it has been bringing in very little return, and consequently the upset price placed upon it is generally sufficiently small to draw a lot of applicants. The man who gets the block is just like the man who wins a lottery. He is lucky because immediately he becomes possessed of a good equity. It is a wonder there are not more applicants in such cases. In some of the States there is no longer a great deal of Crown land available, and consequently we have to fall back on the alienated lands. With the honorable member for Yarra, I say that when suit1 able land, alienated or otherwise, is not available, it must be made available to the people. But it is for the States to make it available. State members are elected for the purpose. They present their case on the hustings. They tell the people how they propose to deal with land settlement problems, and the people entrust them with the task of doing it. I am afraid that in our energy we have overreached ourselves. We are trying to do the work of the States. Land settlement is certainly a responsibility that should be left to the States. The founders of our Constitution intended that, because they entrusted the matter to the States. </para>

          <para>I am pleased to&#39; see that under this bill a board has been appointed to deal with land values. When the value placed upon land by the commissioner is regarded as excessive, a board is to be appointed to deal with it, and I hope that that board&#39;s decision will be final. I do not believe that a judge who has been (trained in law, and whose position has  been  one of isolation and non-contact with the land or with rural industries, should determine land values. I hope that the ; board will consist of sound practical men, who know something of land holding and the use of land. If there should &#34;be a period in which land values have suddenly gone up, I hope that they will not go round the country taking the sales as a basis of valuation. If a man determines to get a Mock for his son in a locality adjoining his own holding, and is willing to pay through the nose for it, I hope that the board will not be a party to a system whereby the taxation commissioner will follow such auction sale and fix the value of the land according to the price paid for it. That should not be done. There should be a good margin between the taxable value and the market value of unimproved &#34;land. There is no force in existence that can keep values up at a time when the money market is depressed. </para>

              <para>- One of the most fruitful sources of depression in land values is the existence of periods of financial depression. When credit is withdrawn the weak holder is unable to hang on. He has to sell, and sacrifice, and it takes very few enforced sales in a locality to affect land values. Land valuers should not take cognizance of either those periods .or boom periods. </para>

              <para>- It is advisable to leave that matter until we get to the committee stage. This country, when it settled its returned soldiers, gave forced or artificial settlement a trial. The Victorian Soldier Land Settlement Board did splendid work in purchasing land mostly at reasonable values, in subdividing it, and in nursing the soldiers in the early years when they were placed on the land. In the main, it bought well, and had an overwhelming regard for the welfare of the soldiers as against the vendors. The results of that artificial settlement have proved that it was impracticable and it has been, in the main, unsuccessful. When a man is settled on land of which he owes 100 per cent, of the value, and when similar conditions apply to his stock and implements, it is practically impossible for him to make a success. Those conditions were not faced by the earlier settlers or upon those who were in the . business with their families prior to launching out on their own. Such men begin by gaining knowledge from association with practical farmers; then proceed steadily with the assistance of their families, and, with the credit granted by pastoral companies, auctioneering firms, machinery business merchants and the like, usually make good. They are in quite a different category from the unfortunate returned soldier settlers. Frequently the returned soldier did not know his work, he was just married, and had probably cashed his gratuity bond which, with his other money, had been absorbed by the purchase &#39;of furniture and establishment costs. The task of settling on the land in Australia is not a rosy one. The seasons impose a considerable burden which, coupled with economic conditions, make the undertaking exceedingly precarious. It is certainly not as attractive as many other undertakingswhich escape the wealth tax which this measure imposes. Undoubtedly, land settlement is a  difficult  problem. It involves the balancing of bad years with good, and it needs a ,very high courage. I hope that the spirit which prompted the land tax will not be persisted in, and that something of a more equitable nature than this bill will be introduced. I shall reserve the remainder of my remarks until the committee stage. </para>

              <para>- It was calculated to cause people to think that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had no justification for the attitude which he adopted some years ago in reference to Crown leaseholds. It will be remembered that at that time a very large sum of money was owing to Australia by leaseholders, and an endeavour was afoot to relieve them of their obligations. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been able, for the first time in this Parliament, to indicate that the Prime Minister was favorably inclined at that time towards making the then contemplated legislation retrospective. The right honorable gentleman had made a statement to that  effect  in Queensland, and he probably thought that it would not appear in the southern press. Hitherto the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has always been credited with the desire to make that legislation retrospective. We now find that the Prime Minister .threatened to tender his resignation if his views were not adopted, plainly indicating that he was endeavouring to assist a body of individuals who had consistently omitted to pay taxes which were due to the Crown. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member has a perfect right to place his own construction on the matter. The honorable member for Wannon  claimed  that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition went round the country making capital out of the incident. At that time il was stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> owed the Common wealth Treasury &#163;77,000, and that a large sum was owing by a number of other Australian taxpayers. Those figures are authentic, having been taken from the official report of the Commissioner of Taxation. Surely, in the circumstances, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition was justified in using them. That is what we are here for, and no charge, can be justifiably laid against the honorable member of having been unfair to those people. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> appealed in June of 1926, That was after the incident of which the honorable member for Wannon complains occurred. Judge Rich decided1 that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> was not entitled to pay the amount of tax charged against him. He valued the property at &#163;376, although the rent, was &#163;544 per annum. The Taxation Department will not accept that as a guide for all other taxation. </para>

The honorable member for Wannon admitted that settlement is necessary, and that we should make land available as freely as possible. But the honorable member stated that climatic conditions in certain sections of Australia necessitated the granting of very large holdings. Surely the honorable member will not deny that, adjacent to many of our railway lines, land is not being put to its fullest use, notwithstanding favorable climatic conditions. Those who oppose the breaking up of such estates do so without justification. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member clearly raised the constitutional issue. He went on to urge that land should be made available at reasonable prices. Very few will claim that land can now be purchased at a reasonable price. Ever since the war the price of land has increased, until to-day it is inflated to an extraordinary degree. The result is that, when a man takes up such land, he is so burdened with the capital cost that he is almost sure to fail. Every week people are failing in their land settlement undertakings. The Commonwealth and State Governments have spent millions of pounds in settling soldiers on the land, but this Government has had to write off huge amounts in consequence of the failure of many of. the schemes. Will it be suggested that the projects have failed because the men were incompetent? Many of them were thoroughly experienced. The whole trouble is that the land was too expensive. </para>

              <para>- It may not have been so in a few cases; but, generally speaking, it was so. When the price of land is too high, it is impossible for people to make a decent living on it. We shall have to face this position shortly, for something more will have to be done to assist our soldiers who are settled on the land in various parts of the Commonwealth. Until the price of land is reduced to normal, new settlements in our rural areas must fail. The honorable member also had a good deal to say about Crown lands. Every time the Crown invites applications for land there are too many applicants for it, by thousands. The honorable member himself admitted that to try to secure a block of this land was like trying to win a prize in a Tattersalls&#39; sweep. The great majority of the people who apply for this land are genuine land-seekers. Some of them have been trying to obtain blocks for many years, but have been unsuccessful. It is not fair to expect our people to go into the Never-Never, where there are neither railways nor roads, when thousands of acres of good land adjacent to railway lines are kept out of production. It is of no use for us to expect the country to develop under these conditions. The spending of &#163;34,000,000 in bringing migrants here will not help the situation. Our fundamental necessity is land at reasonable prices. I suppose that the honorable member for Wannon will agree with me that primary and secondary industries should go hand in hand. </para>

              <para>- They must work together. With the exception of wool and wheat, there is very little market for our primary products overseas. What we need is a sufficiently large population here to create a good local market, but that can only be secured by making land available in reasonable quantities and at reasonable prices. Australia has a larger area of undeveloped land than any other country in the world, with one or two exceptions, but it appears to me that we should be better off with a smaller territory more densely settled than with a large territory sparsely settled, for the cost of government would then be considerably less. The honorable member for Wannon had a good deal to say about the relative merits of the freehold and leasehold systems. It has been proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that leasehold is, to all intents and purposes, as good as freehold. In fact, many persons prefer it, for it has proved to be a better speculation for companies, banks, and individuals. The honorable member knows very well that in many districts the holders of large freehold estates lease their land out to tenants at exorbitant rates. In the Hunter River valley, in my division, that practice has been followed for very many years. </para>

              <para>- The principle is bad. The tenant farmers in my division have been trying for years to obtain tenant right in improvements, but have not been successful. Consequently, many of them on the expiration of their tenancy are obliged to walk out and leave all their improvements behind them. That is unfair.

I submit that as we have the constitutional power to impose this taxation, and are responsible for the development, populating and defence of this country, we should impose it. Estates of a less value than &#163;5,000 are exempt so that the small man shall not be injured by a heavy tax.

              <para>- Victoria imposes a tax of only a halfpenny in the pound. The amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> has the whole-hearted support of every honorable member on this side of the chamber. Our financial position, aseverybody knows, is unsatisfactory, and while we have such heavy obligations resting upon us, we should not think of reducing our revenue from this source, for it can only have the effect of placing heavier indirect taxes upon the community. During the last five years our public debt has increased by &#163;5,855,000. We expected that within a few years of the termination of the war, normal conditions would return, but they have not done so. We are borrowing as heavily as ever. The mania for public borrowing is a legacy of the war. To-day we talk in millions where formerly we talked in hundreds. Some honorable members appear to look upon &#163;2,000,000 or &#163;3,000,000 to-day as they would have looked upon a &#163;5 note a few years ago. There are signs of troublous times ahead, and we should take notice of them. The loan which is being floated in England is not being rushed as were previous- loans, and the banks in Australia are restricting advances. We have heard a good deal in the last few weeks about our adverse trade balance. The increase of imports over exports from 1922-23 until the end of October this year was &#163;65,732,000, which is alarming. </para>

Can we justify the reduction of direct&#39; taxation, and at the same time keep on increasing indirect taxation, which bears most heavily upon the poorer section of the community? We have to meet our national obligations. Our loan expenditure last year on works was &#163;7,051,128, and it is estimated that in the current year it will amount to &#163;8,100,000, an increase of over &#163;1,000,000. Going abroad for such huge sums is a foolish policy, because wereceive goods instead of the money bor- rowed.

              <para>- If the valuations have increased considerably, that does not justify us in reducing direct taxation, and placing greater burdens upon those least able to bear them by increasing indirect taxation. It is proposed, under the bill, to reduce the income from the land tax by &#163;450,000, which is another reduction of1s. 6d. per head in direct taxation. According to the honorable member for Yarra, it will bring about even a greater reduction than that. The estimated loss of revenue as a result of the income tax reduction, is &#163;1,300,000, or 4s.4d. per head, making a total reduction of about 15s.8&#189;d. per head in the last few years. How can we justify such heavy reductions in direct taxation at the expense of the general community, which must pay more in indirect taxation? </para>

              <para>- If the Government that the honorable member forWarringah. supports were true to its principles, it would impose an effective tariff, and that would prevent excessive indirect taxation. That would compel the wealthy class, which he represents, and which returned him to this House, to meet its share of the cost of government. Who provided the honorable member with the funds necessary to secure his election and that of others of his party ? We have evidence that he obtained large sums from the Pastoralists and other associations. The Labour party wishes to foster Australian industries, and its only regret is that the tariff is not effective. If it were, there would be less indirect taxation. From what source, then, should we obtain the revenue that the Commonwealth needs? </para>

              <para>- Yes; and I hope that the honorable member for Wakefield will support me in that direction. Nothing will do more to foster industries, and provide them with opportunities for supplying the goods that Australia needs, than an effective tariff. Then there would be increased employment, and a larger number of taxpayers. The men who cannot be absorbed in employment are a hindrance to the Commonwealth. Hundreds of thousands of men who are willing to work cannot get it; but, if they could be placed in profitable avenues of employment, if we increased our population by a million or so in two or three years, by opening up and developing the country on sound lines, we could proportionately reduce taxation. While we have such heavy responsibilities to meet as are represented by our war and other debts, we are not justified in passing measures to reduce taxation, particularly in view of the reductions made during recent years. We must deal out evenhanded justice to the people generally. Those who benefited most as the result of the late war, and those who, generally speaking, pay the direct taxes, are the wealthy section, and they should not begrudge the payment. Did not our men go overseas in order to defend their property? </para>

              <para>- Yes, and they did their work well ; but seven or eight years have elapsed since the war, and our financial responsibilities are now even greater than they were when the war ended. We should not endeavour to remove this burden from the shoulders of those who had the most to protect, relieving them of their proper share of taxation, and put it upon the backs of the unfortunate men who fought for them. To-day many of these are unable to work on account of disabilities due to war service. Many of them have contracted diseases at. the front such as phthisis, and surely it is not fair that they should bear a greater load of taxation than is carried by the wealthy class. </para>

I urge that the time has arrived when we are not justified in further reducing the direct taxation that falls) on the privileged few. If I owned land of the unimproved value of &#163;25,000, I should consider myself to be in a more comfortable position that the ordinary citizen, and I should recognize that I was entitled to contribute, in proportion to my wealth, to the cost of Government.

            <para>.- I oppose the amendment, and I may incidentally mention that I am not particularly enamoured of the bill. 1 am inclined to agree almost entirely with the remarks of the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers).</inline> If the Federal Government should meddle in land taxation, the object being, according to the Leader and  Deputy  Leader of the Oppo sition, to break up large estates, the tax should be imposed on unimproved land. That would tend to bring about a subdivision of large unimproved holdings. That would be a machinery bill, and not really a taxing measure. The greatest crime, commercially and financially, is to further load the people on the land who are raising the wealth necessary to maintain the credit of this country. To-day the land-owner is taxed in three main ways, directly, and he is taxed indirectly in many other ways. He escapes none of the taxes. He, above all, bears perhaps 97 per cent. of the taxation levied through the customs, particularly if he is an exporter, because he isthe only person who cannot pass any of it on. He has to pay high railway freights, because the railway employees under our arbitration system, must be paid high wages. Heis required to pay income tax like everybody else; but he pays a little more than the others because his income is irregular. In some years, such as the present season, he may have no income at all; but under our graduated system of taxation, he may have to paymore direct income tax than the ordinary individual. Then he has to pay a land tax that is not imposed on any other section of the community.  His  land is capital, and therefore this is a capital tax in this way. He is taxed upon the machinery by which he earns his income, although his income is taxed in the same wayas the income of other people. I am referring to particularly valuable land that has perhaps been held by wealthy persons for generations. We should look by and large at theman on the land, and compare his percentage of increase of taxation with that of those engaged in other industries and professions. The agriculturist to-day is manifestly oppressed, otherwise the wheat industry would be advancing instead of declining. Isthat a case for fur ther taxation?Of course the Treasurer is ostensibly reducing the; land tax by 10percent., but this House must not imagine, that, the man on theland is to get that reduction. The department has men all over Australia reassessing, the unimproved value of land As has already been pointed out, the present high value of landhas been brought about by the increased prices of wool and wheat since the war. At a time when the farmer is getting little encouragement, the Taxation Department assesses his property at a value that is not inherent in it. I have with me a report supplied by the Taxation Department and signed by the  Deputy  Commissioner of Federal Taxation in Western Australia, and in it is a schedule showing the old and new values in various districts. The acreage in Bruce Rock is 816,350. The old unimproved value was &#163;279,020, and the new unimproved value is &#163;S18,433. In the face of those figures the Treasurer says that he  is giving the farmers a 10 per cent, reduction ! There is a little bit of the Hebrew in that. The acreage in Broomehill is 279,122. The old unimproved value was &#163;180,658, and the new unimproved value is &#163;247,428. In Quairading the acreage is 462,456. The old unimproved value was &#163;301,265, and the new unimproved value is &#163;471,486. That increased value is entirely due to the inflated prices of wool and wheat, and not to any legislation passed by this Parliament or the State Parliaments. The present high prices are not likely to last. Those holding land may consider themselves to be in possession of a greater asset than before, but the land is not producing any more, and its enhanced value is nothing more nor. less than the means of placing on additional tax upon them. The farmers are taxed in every way. They have to bear, in addition to the direct taxes levied upon most people, the shire tax which helps to make the roads, and that is a very heavy impost upon them, the wheel tax and the vermin tax. Rural life is becoming uninteresting to the country people and they are flocking to the cities. The Treasurer declines to help them to develop their land in order that  they may profit from their labour. Extraordinary statements are made in this House by those honorable members who do not own land, and do not know what it really means to go out to settle in the outback country. About sixteen or seventeen years ago my brother and I had the experience of taking up land which was considered to be unsafe because of the light rainfall. When I went there to inspect the land before selection, had I not been trained as a  bushman,  I should have been lost, and I suppose that the majority of honorable members, under similar circumstances, would have been lost iri the scrub and afraid to go near the place again. Western Australia at that time was, and is to-day, offering people every inducement to settle on the land. All the capital that could be raked up was put into the land to clear, fence, and fertilize it in order to produce wealth, to improve the credit of this country, arid to provide work for the railways and other means of transport. We want people to settle on the land, but this is not possible when our legislation provides for continual revaluations of land that are taking the last ounce of strength from our farmers. Not only is the farmer loaded with the protectionist policy of &#39; Australia, but the Taxation Department is trying to grab all his profits from his operations on the land. The Government of Western Australia seems to have been more reasonable . to the farmer in order to help him to develop his holding. If his income tax amounts to more than his land tax, he pays the income tax only and vice versa. The Federal Government is collecting both taxes and making no differentiation. The Taxation Department is not sympathetic even in its interpretation of the act. It has been said that it would pay the Government to give the land to the people in order that it may be developed; but we have paid for the land and developed it. I had this experience two years ago. I wanted a piece of Crown land adjoining my property to square up my fencing. That land was so useless in its natural state that its. freehold was sold to me at 5s. an acre. Last year the Taxation Department assessed the unimproved value of that land at 17s. 6d., for the simple reason that the valuer did not see the accumulation of stones and rubbish that had been taken off it at great expense, nor did he take account of other unseen improvement made also at great expense. The man on the land is not credited in his land tax assessment with his contributions to the upkeep of roads. He, and not the man in the city, has to pay for them. The honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> does not pay for the roads, at any rate, in my district. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Because these roads are made and the land improved by the farmer, the Taxation Department takes the last penny from the man on the land, and that is calculated to discourage land settlement in this country. The Treasurer has said that we -are to have a valuation every three years. </para>

              <para>- That remark typifies the consideration that is given by honorable members opposite to the man outback. The Leader of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chariton)</inline> has said that primary and secondary industries should go hand in hand, and I agree with him; but that is not the position to-day. The man on the land is groaning under the burden of secondary industries. If industries were going hand in hand, there would not be the adverse trade balance that exists to-day. If the Treasurer pursues his present policy and extracts the last penny from the farmer, our adverse balance will soon be three or four times what it is to-day, and we shall then begin to realize that we have indeed killed the goose that laid the golden eggs in this country. The Leader of theOpposition also said that land was different from other assets, because its existence was not due to the owner. One buys property of anykind as an investment, a means of earning a livelihood, and the most difficult livelihood to get is that which comes from Mother Earth. If the Treasurer will consult the Commissioner of Taxation I am sure that be will be told that the bulk of the direct taxation is paid, not by the wheat farmer, but by the manufacturers and  city merchants, which shows that the farmer is working for little if any profit. Although 90 per cent, of  the wealth that maintains the community is produced by the man on the land, he is just permitted a bread and water existence so that he may continue his industry and keep the country solvent. I ask the Treasurer to consider seriously the insertion of an amendment to provide that land used for the production of wealth shall be exempt from land taxation. That should accord with, the views of honorable members opposite. Under the present law we definitely impose upon the man on the land two taxes that are not borne by anybody else in the- community. </para>

          <para>I propose to show how unreasonable are some of the assessments of unimproved values. What is known as &#34; the Captain Cook value &#34; of land is practically nil. Who really is responsible for the enhanced value that is given to certain land? The land I selected in Western Australia had no real value until I expended my money upon it. Until that time it would not carry three kangaroos or two sheep over the whole area. The railway was already built, so it cannot he said that the value of the land was enhanced by Government expenditure. The Crown owned the land, and I bought it. We put the whole of our capital into it, and when we proved that it could be put to profitable use others desiring to follow our example set up an inquiry for land in the neighbourhood. In consequenece the land became more valuable than it was when I acquired it. By so enhancing the value of that land I helped other citizens and the State, not myself. What benefit do I gain from the increment of values? If I continue to utilize it for wheat-growing that increased value will not help me at all, so why put a burden of taxation upon me in respect of a value created in accordance with public policy and the desire of the Government and the. people? </para>
          <para>The definition clause of the Land Tax Assessment Act defines &#34; unimproved value &#34; in relation to land as - the capital sum which the fee simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller would require, assuming that the improvements (if any) thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in . title had not been made. </para>
          <para>Several interpretations of that definition have been given. The High Court has held- </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the unimproved value of land may be ascertained by comparison&#39; with&#39; the prices ob tained for similar land in the neighbourhood in a state of nature. </para>

          <para class="block">The mere sale price of land inadistrict is no index to its value unless one takes into consideration the reasons that governed the payment of that price. The price might have been excessively high not because of the merits of the land, but because a father wanted to buy an adjacent block for his son, or a land holder desired to acquire an adjoining property. Special consideration should he given to those facts when valuing property for land tax purposes. The High Court also held- </para>
          <quote>
            <para>TJ i at tlie word &#34; improvements &#34; in tlie definition of the term &#34;unimproved value&#34; includes such operations of man upon the land since it has ceased to be Crown land, the benefit of such continues at the date of valuation, and operations of nature which ave only effectual by reason of what man has done, as have contributed to bring about the present enhancement of tlie value of tlie land. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That phase is not sufficiently taken into account when valuations are being made. The valuer visits a property that is fully improved, and asks the owner the cost of the fencing, clearing, dam sinking, &#38;c. Upon this information he tries to estimate the value of the actual improvements done on the property. Then he arrives at the unimproved value by taking the improvements from local sales. The department does not- allow, however, for the fees that have been paid to roads boards or the cost of root picking for a number of years after the first clearing of the -land, or  the  cost of destroying noxious weeds and poison plants, and the interest paid on the capital expenditure. These outgoings should be taken into consideration  when  endeavouring to arrive at the unimproved value of a property. </para>
          <para>There is another injustice that affects the people of Western Australia particularly. When the goldfields commenced to decline, not because the gold was exhausted, but because high costs made the winning of it no longer profitable, many people previously interested in mining turned their attention to the land. Some who occupied city positions selected land, as they were entitled to do, and entered into a form of partnership with brothers or other relatives.  One man worked the property, and the other provided from his earnings the capital with which to carry out improvements. That was a most economical arrangement. The two brothers thus associated raised more taxable income, developed the land more rapidly, were able to buy more efficient machinery, and produced more per unit. But for purposes of taxation the department treats the two brothers as one unit, and allows only one deduction. The Treasurer and the Crown Law Department should be able to frame an amendment which -would give relief in such bona fide cases. I recognize that certain partnerships are formed for the purpose of evading taxation, but there should be provision for honest, genuine partnerships of the kind I have mentioned. When each, partner has individual rights and a family to maintain, both should be taxed as individuals. Instead the department combines their holdings and brings them within the scope of the Commonwealth land tax. I ask the Treasurer to give the fullest consideration to the amendment I have suggested, which I am confident would encourage and help the development of the land. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable &#34;member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> has been arguing on false premises. He has painted a most doleful picture of the conditions of wheat-growers and agriculturists generally, because of the imposts of all kinds placed upon them, and particularly because of the oppressive manner in which this form of taxation is applied to them. He has spoken frequently of the man on the land. Surely the honorable member overlooked the fact that the Commonwealth . land tax does not in the main apply to such people. </para>

              <para>- That happens in particular cases to which attention should be paid by the Treasurer. But the main burden of the honorable member&#39;s argument was that the man on the land was singled out for double, treble, and quadruple taxation, and he said that this land tax is particularly unjust because of its effect upon agriculture. If the honorable member believes this taxation to have that effect, he should be more specific. I do not believe that one in a hundred wheat-growers who work their own farms is subject to Commonwealth land tax. Including all wheat-growers, whether working their own farms or&#62; employing others to do it, not 1 per cent, would be subject to the tax. The tax applies generally to large land-holders. It is true that it applies to the pastoralist; but even in respect of him the honorable member&#39;s argument ignores the underlying principle of legislation of this character. </para>

              <para>- I distinguish between the men who work their own farms and those who merely own farms which &#39; others work for them I do not call myself an agriculturist or a farmer, because I own a farm and employ somebody else to work it. There are plenty of cheque-book farmers; presumably the honorable member for Forrest was not pleading for farmers who live in the cities and employ others to work their properties. When he spoke of the struggling man on the land he must be assumed to have been referring to the man Who really is Struggling on the land, the man who is working his farm, and is a producer in the real sense of the term. In those cases there is not 1 per cent., or a fraction of 1 per cent, subject to the Commonwealth land tax. The class of which the honorable member for Wannon spoke - the large land-owners - ought not to receive special concessions from o the Commonwealth Government. I know there are pastoralists who have done useful pioneering work for the community. For that they are&#34; entitled to the respectof the community and of this Parliament ; but when he speaks of the pastoralists to whom this legislation applies in its general effect, I say that among them are many who are not, and never were, pioneers. There are pioneers still in the pastoral industry, and all honour to them, but 99 of every 100 in the pastoral industry in Australia at the present time are not pioneers in the sense in which the honorable member spoke. A great deal of our pastoral land at the present time is held by pastoral and land companies, many of them with absentee shareholders. Ninety-nine out of every 100 of the large pastoralist lessees - at any rate, in New South Wales and Queensland - are men who not only have never done any pioneering work, but have done no work of any kind themselves on the land; they have been investors and capitalists. I do not say that they are not entitled to a just return from their investments; that is another matter altogether. But the argument offered against the Land Tax Act by the honorable member for Wannon was that land taxation ought not to be imposed on these men because of their pioneering efforts. He drew a most moving picture of the struggles of the pioneers in pastoral districts, and put forward the argument that many of these areas would be waste land to-day but for the work &#34; of the pioneers. That may be true in some cases ; but does he claim that the woolgrowing districts of western New South Wales and Queensland&#39; would be deserts but for the work of the present pastoral lessees ? </para>

              <para>- I believe we have in Queensland a great many absentee owners of land. I do not believe that one in 100 of the people who originally took up the land are in possession of it now. Companies have been formed to take over the pastoral areas which were formerly owned by individuals. Whether leaseholder or freeholder, you will find that the present taxpayer is not the man who did the pioneering work. I am not saying that the present occupiers are not doing useful work. They may have invested their capital, and it may be necessary to retain that capital to continue the industry. But the argument that this legislation should not apply, because of the pioneering efforts of the men on the land, carries no weight. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that anybody should be doubly taxed, but then I do not think that the Land Tax Act places double taxation on any one. The land tax is justified on the grounds so succinctly stated by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> It was intended in the first place to prevent the growth of land monopoly in Australia. It was intended to make it unprofitable to hold large areas of land idle, or to hold it out of its most effectiveuse, and it was intended to secure to the community a portion of the community-created value of the land, the increment which increases year by year, Further, it was intended to be a revenue measure. It was intended first to prevent monopolies, then to force large areas into closer settlement, and to get for the community a portion of the community-created values. That is the justification for the tax. The longer it is in operation, provided it is not meddled with, the less hardship it will impose on the holders of land. As land continues to be held, the burden of the tax will apply to those who ought to bear it. It does not operate harshly against anyone against whom it ought not to apply. If it has the effect of steadying land values - and it has had that effect - if it keeps down the value of agricultural land, it is justified. It has done more than anything else to keep land values down. It enables those who acquire land to get it for less than they would otherwise have to pay. There is no sound reason why those persons who acquire land for farming or grazing purposes, and who have been enabled to do so at cheaper prices because of- the operation of this tax, should complain subsequently that the tax applies to their land. They will have derived benefit from it. The land tax, if it is wisely applied. benefits the farmer much more than it injures him. It makes land available at cheaper prices than would otherwise be possible. The honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> said that there was no necessity for legislation of this kind, because if the prime reason of the tax was to force land on to the market to bring about closer settlement, that object could be accomplished by means of compulsory acquisition by the Government. Every State has attempted the wholesale acquisition of land, and the payment of compensation by means of resumption acts. But their experience has been, without exception, that they have had to acquire the land at a price many times greater than what it was really worth for agricultural or any other purpose. </para>

              <para>- Almost without exception, the soldier settlement areas throughout Australia were acquired at too high a price, and in almost every case they have had to be revalued to relieve the present holders of the land, showing that too much was paid in the first place. That is the inevitable outcome of government acquisition.When a government commences to purchase land, it always has to pay too much. There are influences at work which force up the prices of land, so that the charge -on the incoming settler is beyond his capacity to pay. </para>

              <para>- Not necessarily, perhaps, but that is the rule. In Queensland and in New South Wales, where land has been compulsorily acquired, the prices paid were too high. If the putting, into operation of taxation legislation of this kind has the effect of preventing the accumulation of areas of land and the growth of land monopoly,- it is a good thing. If it has the further effect of forcing the subdivision of land, it is a good tiling; and if it steadies the price of land which the sons of farmers have to acquire, it is doing still more good, and is completely justified. The honorable member cannot ignore what has been happening under this legislation. Estates have been subdivided. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> mentioned the area of land that has been forced out of the taxable class almost solely because of the operation of the land tax. From 1910, the first year in which this tax became operative, to 1925, the last year covered by the commissioner&#39;s report, land of an unimproved value of &#163;117,000,000 has been removed from the taxable field by subdivision. </para>

              <para>- Of course, it is a  good thing. That is the justification for the law. A good many of the estates which come within the aggregate value mentioned might, in the ordinary course of events, have been subdivided, but a large proportion would not have been subdivided if it had not been subjected to the land-tax law. The tax has been the prime reason for subdivision, and that is why this land has been made available for closer settlement and is now more productive than it ever was before. In the older countries of Europe, and in America, too, agrarian problems, due largely to land monopoly, and absenteeism, have agitated the public mind. Right through the centuries this has been a fruitful cause of trouble, insurrection, agitation, and the disruption of nations. Because land monopoly has been allowed, landlordism has grown to dimensions beyond anything known in Australia, and the lesson to be learned from the history of those countries ought not to be ignored by us. We should &#39; take steps to prevent land monopoly in this country. </para>

              <para>- The fact that Victoria has more people to the square mile than the other States does not vitiate my argument. In proportion to the population, land monopoly exists to a greater extent in Victoria than in the other States. It also exists in Queensland and New South Wales. It exists anywhere that large areas of land are held by companies or individuals when it could support more people if broken up into smaller holdings. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member was not here when I referred to his argument, which was, in my opinion, based upon wrong principles. The honorable member stated that this tax applies to the pastoralist pioneers of Australia. By inference, the honorable member led the House to believe that the great pastoralists of this country, freeholders as well as lessees, are the men who pioneered western New South Wales and Queensland. It is true that some of them did, and that some obtained due reward while others did not; but the honorable member cannot class the big pastoral  companies which, will pay this tax among the pioneers of our country. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member spoke of the taxation which is borne by our present pioneers. I point out that the freeholders, as well as the lessees are in the main wealthy individual pastoralists and pastoral companies and absentees who have come into the industry since the pioneering days. It is the rare exception to find the big pastoralists living on the land. They live in Sydney, Melbourne, or on the other side of the, world. It is useless for the honorable member to endeavour to work sentimentality into this matter by pleading the case of some allegedly struggling, hard-bitten pioneer, who has patriotically expended his energy and substance, and whose only reward is to have onerous taxation inflicted on him. The honorable member must realize that that picture does not apply in this case. </para>

              <para>- This tax is intended to prevent the growth of land monopoly, and to secure to the community a portion of the unearned increment in the value of land. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> apparently disagrees with those who hold the same opinion as myself about community created values. He spoke of his own experience, of how he went out-back and took up land which appeared to be valueless. The honorable member explained how he expended his energies and money in the endeavour to develop that land, which is now of a certain value and, presumably, subject to this tax. The honorable member claimed that, surely, he had created that value by his energy and&#39; by the expenditure of his capital. </para>

What value would that, or any other land have, if it depended entirely upon the efforts of its owner, and upon no one else in the community? Supposing there were no railways, no ports, no markets - would the land be of any value? Land values are .created by the combined activities of the community. </para>

              <para>- I do not mind the interjections of the honorable member. I think that the dialogue. is enlightening him. There are many factors which&#34; make for the enhancement of land value, and they should be thoroughly understood, if the justification for a land tax is to be appreciated. The development of the State leads to an increased increment in land values; the same result follows from the expansion  of industry, and the expansion of home markets. Land, values are enhanced not merely by the efforts of the landowners, but by the efforts of the whole community. The building of towns, roads, railways, harbours, the establishment of factories, and the creation of markets, all contribute towards the gradual enhancement of the value of land, and it must be attributable to collective community action It is to secure the return of a portion of that value from the community that land tax is justified. Assume that a given area of land had an unimproved value of &#163;10,000,000 at the beginning of a decade and that at the end of the decade, because of the expansion of the aif  nl  rs of the nation, its value was enhanced by 25 per cent., that enhancement would not be due to the efforts of the land-owners, except in the ratio of their efforts to those of the community. The community merely asks a small return for what has been given by its united achievements. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member misrepresents my argument. Statistics show that land values are improving in the aggregate by millions every year in our cities, towns, and  in  our rural districts.  In  ten years city property in Sydney has appreciated by &#163;80,000,000 sterling, on the municipal and local authority valuation. The enormous enhancement in value was not due to the efforts of persons who owned the freehold, but to the efforts of the entire population, and the return to the community of a portion of the increase of value is no more than common justice. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I have mentioned three or four factors which justify the imposition of a land tax, one being to secure to the community a proportion of the unearned increment. It also prevents the growth of land monopoly, and is a means of supplementing the public revenue. This last matter was very effectively dealt with by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> Our war burdens are still with us, and our war obligations still have to be met every year. This tax brings in only a small contribution of a couple of millions a year from people who own land of an assessable unimproved value of &#163;256,000.000 sterling. They actually pay only &#163;2,600,000 towards the revenue of the Commonwealth ! The whole burden of the speech of the honorable member for Forrest was that the man on the land suffers; and that this taxation is one of the grievous burdens which he has to carry. If the honorable member believes that the man on the land is the person who suffers, he should be in favour of the abolition of land tax.  His  argument and the argument of the honorable member for Wannon were not really arguments against this amendment, but against land taxation entirely. Their speeches were directed against this party specifically. I remind those honorable members, and others who are following this debate, that whether there is justification or a lack of justification for a land tax, the present land tax has been in operation continuously for fifteen years, during the last ten years the Labour party has been in opposition, and not in office. If there is anything in the contention of those honorable members opposite, that this is a fatal sort of imposition operating adversely against a class of the community - and the honorable member for Riverina calls it class taxation - -they must blame their own party. There certainly is no justification for the reduction proposed by the Treasurer. The honorable member for Forrest is entirely mistaken if he thinks that it is a reduction that will benefit, even in the slightest degree, the class for which he pleaded this afternoon. Did not the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, in an unanswerable argument, clearly show that the people who will be relieved under this taxation will not be the farmers at all. The entire value of the concession which will be given by this bill amounts to &#163;445,000 per annum, and &#163;400,000 of that relief will be enjoyed by people who own estates to the value of &#163;25,000 and upwards. </para>

              <para>- But they are not farmers. I mentioned that I am of opinion that not one working farmer in a hundred will benefit by this 10 per cent, reduction. Honorable members opposite must agree that the man who owns an estate to the value of &#163;25,000 may be a land-owner, but he is not a working farmer. The number of farm holdings in Australia is about 200,000, and&#39; less than one in a thousand of those is likely to benefit by these reductions and concessions. </para>

              <para>- This is a matter that, can be determined by reference to , the statistics in the <inline font-style="italic">Tear-Booh.</inline> My argument is this : There are 200,000 farm holdings in Australia. The reduction and concessions in tax under this measure, which amount to &#163;445,000 annually, will to the extent of more than &#163;400,000 benefit persons whose estates are valued at more than &#163;25,000. Consequently, only &#163;45,000 of the total will be distributed over persons holding estates of a less value than &#163;25,000. The major portion of the relief will be enjoyed by wealthy land-owners. </para>

An overwhelming proportion of the relief that will be afforded to land-owners by this concession will be enjoyed by wealthy men who are in a position to continue to pay their taxation without hardship. In view of our economic and financial position and our war obligation, there is no justification for the granting of this relief. </para>

              <para>- I endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition respecting outstanding land taxation. The report of the Commissioner for Taxation states that more than &#163;1,000,000 of arrears in land taxation is outstanding, and has been so for more than five years. Of this amount, &#163;836,000 has not been called. Possibly it is affected by litigation, but apparently there is no intention to make a demand for it. </para>

              <para>- An amount of &#163;162,000 of the total outstanding has been called for, and I suppose assessment notices have been issued in respect of it. Some of it has been owing since 1914-15. The amount outstanding on freehold land is &#163;210,000. There is no  justifiation  for allowing these amounts to remain uncollected, especially in respect to the earlier years. It is unjust that while many pastoral lessees paid their taxes promptly on receiving their assessments, others who refused to pay are, apparently, being allowed to escape it. Such discrimination should not be permitted. </para>

              <para>- I trust that the Treasurer will take immediate steps to collect this money. I realize that this is not the time to discuss the exemption from taxation of pastoral leases, but I must say that, in my opinion, there was every justification for the continuation of that taxation. The case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jowett</inline> has been mentioned. I can see no reason why he should be permitted to evade this taxation. He holds enormous tracts of country under leasehold. Some years ago he had 54 separate holdings in Queensland, which aggregated 9,000,000 acres, on which he paid a rental that did not represent its economic value, but only the value reserved to the Crown. The difference between them was the basis of the assessment by the Commissioner. </para>

              <para>- I bow to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> ; but this is a most important subject. I support the suggestion of the honorable member for Yarra that a board of review or some other authority should be constituted to which appeals may be made against the arbitrary decisions of the Commissioner  of Taxation. I do not reflect in the remotest degree upon the Commissioner. I think that he always gives due consideration to the matters placed before him, and acts in strict conformity with what he believes to be the justice of the case; but any man who is called upon to make numerous decisions, involving matters of vast importance to the persons concerned, must, in the vast number of cases he is called on&#39; to de (ermine, sooner or later commit errors of judgment. The State does not suffer from these, but the individual does. Even if a man were as wise as Solon there should be an appeal from his decisions. Such decisions should not be absolutely final. The Treasurer would be wise to agree to an extension of the functions of the proposed valuation board to allow it to hear appeals on this matter. If that proposal is not practicable, perhaps it would be possible to allow the Board of Review in income tax matters to be a special board of review in certain approved cases under this law. There should be a tribunal of some kind to winch aggrieved taxpayers may appeal from the decisions of the commissioner in certain cases. I support the amendment. </para>

            <para>.- I disapprove of the imposition of taxation on lands that are being used for productive purposes, no matter whether imposed by State of Federal authority. Land held for speculative . purposes should be taxed. In some cases land which is held for speculative purposes is worked sufficiently to recoup its owner for his current expenses, although it is really being held for sale later at a big profit. &#39; I call that speculation, just as I would call it speculation to hold land without working it. Land which is used for production in either primary or secondary industries should not be taxed. This tax was introduced by the Labour party with two objects. As the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> pointed out, it was designed to burst up large estates. It has not achieved that object. The second reason for introducing it was to augment the revenue. It has become a revenue tax pure and simple, and it will remain so as long as it is on the statutebook. I submit that it is not a federal function to tax land. The Commonwealth is debarred constitutionally from discriminating between the States ; but honorable members know very well that,  owing to the wide variety of land in the Commonwealth, this tax operates more unfavorable on some States than on others. The honorable member for &#34;Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has described the quality of some lands in Victoria, and honorable members who represent South Australian constituencies have referred to certain areas in their State about which I am entirely ignorant. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> has dealt with Queensland conditions, with which, of course, I am well .acquainted. It is impossible, however, for the federal authorities to discriminate. A large area of land in Queensland would be regarded as an enormous tract of country in a State like Victoria. &#34;When I was  recently in that State I heard persons talking about squatters and their land, and the areas that they had in mind would be regarded in Queensland as no more than night horse-paddocks. In travelling through New South Wales one sees large unoccupied areas along the railway lines; but, because, of that, it is worse than useless &#39; to levy a tax upon the value of that land in order to burst up those estates, if it will injure somebody in Queensland who happens to be doing .a national work. There may be urgent necessity for cutting up some estates. The State Governments know these; let them act when necessary. On my first trip to- Melbourne, six years ago, I saw sheep being grazed within about 12 or 14 miles of the city. Possibly that was the best purpose to which that particular land could be put at the time ; but I dare say the owners of it were merely grazing sheep on it for the purpose of paying the rates and taxes on land which afterwards they would cut up for suburban settlement. Conditions vary greatly in each State, and in different parts of each State. Queensland is a huge tract of country. Conditions in the south are entirely different from those in the north, and those along the coastal belt vary tremendously from those in the western areas; 20 miles east of Toowoomba, the value of the land and the purposes for which it is used, are different from those 20 miles westward. The States are the proper authorities to exercise discrimination legally and for revenue, political and every other State purpose. The States have so discriminated in the past. Queensland and New South Wales, for instance, have done so. I have before me a copy of an act passed by the Now South Wales Parliament on the motion of the Labour Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang.</inline> It is an amending taxation act dealing with large estates. Even that Government saw the necessity for discrimination. It exempts land within the western division of New South Wales, which, like the land in western and north-western Queensland, has been badly hit in clays gone by by the tax on leaseholds. The Labour Government under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> which will not be accused of having been a Tory administration, exempted from taxation leasehold and freehold lands in the western division of New South Wales. The measure also exempts irrigation areas, or lands owned by a person to whom the advisory, board has issued a certificate that they are being used mainly for the purpose of breeding stud stock. Although even that Labour Government saw the necessity for discriminating between certain classes of land, the federal authorities cannot discriminate. We have been told that the object of the tax is to burst up large estates and take a portion of the increment in value. We are informed, also, that it is a rich man&#39;s tax - a big man&#39;s tax. It may be a big man&#39;s tax: but a big man is not necessarily a rich man. If he is rich, and is using his land, he is to be blamed no more, in fact, considerably less, than persons who own a considerable amount of property of other kinds that cannot be taxed. The only way in which the latter can be reached is through the income tax. If they happen to be speculators in stocks and shares and sundry other things,, mcn who never circulate their money throughout the country, who never produce anything - some of them are to be found in the ranks of the Opposition - they are permitted to escape from taxation; but the men who own land and cannot get away from it, who produce something, and add to the wealth of this country, are selected to be hounded down and penalized. Even supposing this were a justifiable tax and a rich man&#39;s tax, which I deny, what would it matter if the Government retired from this field of taxation? These men could not escape. There are four State Labour governments, including one in Queensland, which has no upper house to block land taxation. The State Labour governments would seize such a favorable opportunity to enter the field of taxation vacated by the Commonwealth. It would be a chance to obtain increased revenue. Goodness knows, the States, with their wild expenditure, need it. The rich man in Queensland would be unable to escape in any f.ase. All the talk about the rich man and the poor man is indulged in merely to renew an old cry, and set class against class, so that, when honorable members opposite go before the electors, they can say to them, &#34; Look what we have done to place taxes upon the wealthy c&#93; ass. thereby relieving the poorer section.&#34; That argument will not be accepted in Queensland, because the rich man can be taxed there. He was taxed in days gone by. But when the honorable member for Dalley, as Premier of Queensland, went , abroad to interview the money-lenders, they whispered something in his ear, and he climbed down. He had to account for his notions to his own party, and it is said that that was one of the matters that led to his loss of the premiership. </para>

              <para>- I am tired of the talk that I hear, that honorable members on this side are the friends of the rich while honorable members opposite are the friends of the poor. Probably, if an investigation were made, it would be found that I and the greater number on this side of the House are considerably poorer than the majority of the honorable members who sit opposite. One thing that must be impressedupon the people is the fact that there are two taxing authorities in Australia; but, listening to the speeches delivered by honorable members in Canberra in the last few months, one would imagine that the people should be encouraged to believe that the only taxing authority is the Commonwealth. The people know to their cost that there are two taxing authorities - the States and the Commonwealth. Queenslanders know it only too well, and so do the taxpayers in every other State ruled by Labour governments. When one of those authorities vacates a particular field of taxation, it is left open to the other authority, which may immediately enter it. Therefore, there is little opportunity for any class of taxpayer to escape when two authorities operate. We have heard about the Federal Government receding from direct taxation. Everybody knows that it did  not   enter that field until 1910. We are informed that it was done for the purpose of bursting up large estates. Now that we have entered that field, however, we depend upon it for our ordinary revenue. It is true that direct taxation was imposed for war purposes ; but the repayment of debts incurred to meet war expenditure is spread over a period of years and cannot be made at once without hardship and ruination to industry. No business man will hold that the taxpayers should have to pay in one year the whole&#39; of the cost of the works authorized in any particular year. The people of today are paying something for posterity, but posterity should bear its &#34;share of the cost. The only way to apportion the burden of debt fairly is by sinking funds and other such means. We have been assured many times that those fund? are too large. Reports have appeared in the press of attacks upon the Federal </para>

          </continue>
          <para class="block">Treasurer for establishing too large a sinking fund. We are told now that there should be no sinking fund at all. It is said by the Opposition that every penny of tax placed upon industry should be kept there, and used to pay off the national debt. Direct taxes are the only taxes that the Federal Parliament can reduce. Our indirect taxes are really not taxes at all. They are spread evenly over the whole community. For the most part they are collected upon luxuries that the average man, woman and child does not enjoy. Only from about &#163;1 18s. to &#163;2 per head of indirect taxation can be said to.be properly distributed throughout, the community. No road user objects to the moneys raised for roads; other sums have been raised for other purposes. The total moneys received from both direct and so-called indirect taxation have increased in the last four years from &#163;9 Os. 3d. to &#163;9 13s. Id. per head, an increase of 12s. 9d. ; but the direct taxation has decreased from &#163;4 Os. Id. to &#163;2 10s. 7d. Let us examine the taxation figures in; Queensland or any other State that has been ruled by Labour. This party calls itself the Australian Labour party, and claims to be <inline font-style="italic">Semper idem,</inline> the same in every State and in the country. If we look at its achievements elsewhere, we naturally conclude that it will show a similar record in the federal sphere. The increase in State taxation has amounted to pounds per head of the population in every State that has been ruled, or misruled, by Labour; but the increase in total federal taxation from all sources, even including so-called indirect taxation has been infinitesimal. This year the increase will be only 7s. 7d. more than in 1922, and 5s. 2d. less than this year. What have we done? Everybody knows that 6s. per head of that has gone for the roads, and 12s. or 13s. per head for invalid and old-age pensions. If we add the two together, we have about 18s. By eliminating that expenditure, we could bring about a fairly considerably reduction in taxation. But is &#39;any honorable member prepared to cut out that expenditure? We find in the States a constant, increase not only in direct taxation, but also in indirect taxation, including increased railway freights, which hit the people in the country and particularly the people of Queensland. In the States direct taxation has constantly increased without our having a single benefit to show for it. Certainly wild-cat shows bankrupt State enterprises, and depleted railway returns, coupled with worse services, are nothing to brag about. It may be asked, what have we to show in the federal sphere? I ask honorable members opposite to go to the country, where they will find an efficient telephonic system in operation. The sum of &#163;20,000,000 has been voted for the improvement and extension of telephones and other facilities of communication by the department of the Postmaster-General. Ask the country people if they object to that expenditure and if they want these services curtailed. Ask them also what they think of the roads grant. </para>

              <para>- I. wish to compare the taxation policy of this Government with that of the State governments. Honorable members opposite would lead us to believe that the Federal Government is the only taxing master, whereas the Federal Government has reduced taxation and the State Governments have not. It is the duty of the Federal Government, or of any government, when it has too much revenue, to return some of it to the people. This Federal Government is reducing taxation, but I have never heard of a Labour government doing that. This Government, through its economical administration, has been able to reduce taxation, and thereby give a fillip to industry. A man is a fool who says that money is better in the hands of the Government than it is in the hands of private enterprise. The Opposition says that we have immense war responsibilities to meet, and therefore this is not the time to reduce taxation. It says also that we have bad times ahead ; but, if that is so, who will suffer? It will be the people on the land, and this Government is&#39; giving them some relief, so that they may be better able to withstand drought periods. The policy of the Opposition, when bad  times are ahead, is to tax the people as much as possible, and especially those who are engaged in industry. It would be wrong for the Federal Government to remain forever in the field of land taxation ; because that should be the sphere of the States. It is a penal tax, pure and simple, and can be imposed by the States if they wish. Reference has been made to the reduction in taxation on Grown leaseholds. This Government has done that deliberately, and does not apologize for its action. Queensland &#39;has more leasehold country than any other State. We know what the taxation of leaseholds means. There are few large areas of freehold country in Queensland, so probably the ordinary land tax has not affected Queensland so much as it has the other States. Queensland has huge undeveloped areas, and its population is small compared with those of New South Wales and Victoria. Most of the settlers in the far west have large holdings. Much has been said about the conditions in Queensland, and in that respect I shall quote from a report of the Land Settlement Advisory Board which was &#39; appointed by the Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCormack.</inline> It is frequently said that the industries of that State are progressing, and that many of the settlers are rolling in wealth. Let me quote the Queensland figures relating to sheep, spread over a period of 34 years. In 1891 the total number of sheep in that State was 20,289,000; in 1910, 20,331,000; and in 192S, 20,663,000. That represents an increase in sheep carried of 1.84 per cent. </para>

              <para>- Only in 1914. At present there are probably from 14,000,000 to 15,000,000 sheep in Queensland. Take the cattle industry. In 1891 the total number of cattle in Queensland was 6,192,000; in 1910, 5,131,000; and in 1925, 6,436,000. The sheep and cattle are pastured mostly in wide spaces in the outback country. Since 1891 the mileage of railways has increased almost threefold, and the total number of grazing selections has increased from 5,600 to 9,692. But there was a great increase in something typical of Labour Govern ment revenue. The total land revenue ir. 1891 was &#163;489,000; in 1910, &#163;757,000; and in 1925, nearly &#163;1,500,000. Although there has been an enormous increase in revenue and railways, the grazing industry has made little advance. The conditions of Queensland are different from those of other States, and this is shown in the report of the Advisory Committee. Expressing the carrying capacity of New South Wales and Queensland in terms of sheep, over a period of five years - 1921 to 1925 - New South Wales carried 222 sheep and Queensland only 137 sheep to the square mile. In New South Wales the average weight of fleece increased by 1.33 lb., and in Queensland by only 0.38 lb., so that New South Wales is 1 lb. to the good in the increase of wool per sheep. I am quoting these figures to show that, in view of the different conditions in Queensland, we cannot apply the federal land tax with equity throughout the length and breadth of Australia. We have heard much about the producers making money. . The Advisory Board found that the approximate annual income of all graziers from the sheep industry is &#163;4,000,000, the value of property and stock being &#163;50,000,000. This represents a net return of only 8 per cent., without taking into consideration the various troubles of the settlers, such as dogs and droughts. The committee found, also, that the production costs had considerably increased since 1911. Taking a flock of from 13,000 to 16,000 sheep, we find that the costs increased from &#163;2,765 to &#163;7,400. The cost per pound of wool increased from 5.39d. to 12.43d., and the average price per pound from 8.71d. to 15.26d., leaving a net return per pound to the graziers in these far-back places, whose leaseholds the Labour party taxed, and whom they propose to tax again, of 3.32d. in 1911,- and 2.83d. in 1925. </para>

              <para>- I have heard to-day that the Opposition, when it obtains office, intends to levy a tax on leaseholds, and that I shall, at the next election, drive thoroughly into the minds of the people of Queensland. Then I come to the taxation per head of sheep. In .1911, an income of &#163;4,000, representing approximately 16,000 sheep, returning 5s. per head, paid in State income tax &#163;133, or approximately 2d. per sheep. In 1927 the State and Federal tax amounted to &#163;960, or ls. 2-}d. per sheep. Yet we are told that no taxation should he taken off these people. These conditions apply to leaseholders, but would press considerably harder on freeholders, because they invest considerable capital in their properties and the interest on that would be a charge against them.  Most of the graziers in Queensland are leaseholders. Honorable members opposite want to know where the money goes. Take, for instance, a station with a run sufficient for from 10,000 to 40,000 sheep. During the last six years the net income of the owner was &#163;4,479 per annum. In this instance, for every 90s. of gross profit, the owner received 20s., the Government 18s.. the workers and other associated with the industry 52s. Yet honorable members opposite would like to tax that settler, so as to reduce his return of 20s. In the case of this grazier, for every &#163;1 that he received he spent &#163;2 12s. in providing work, particularly t reproductive and national work. He sold his products overseas, and the proceeds were sent to Australia, yet the Opposition says that these men are privileged because they own land. </para>

              <para>- That is so. We are . told that this tax should be kept on, because it would assist our trade balance. But by allowing these graziers a remission of taxation, more money will he put into the industry, and more wealth will be produced, with a consequent less adverse trade balance. The board examined the conditions of the industry, and made certain recommendations. It has advised a. review of the rents that have recently been fixed by the department. It also advises inquiries into the promotion of production and land settlement, so that the value of our exports may exceed our imports and that the Govern ment should take action so that investment in the wool industry might be attractive. That board was appointed by a Labour Government. W&#171; have been told that men should be taxed on their leaseholds; but surely that is a matter for the State to decide, because it fixes rentals, not only for revenue purposes, but also for purposes of development. The quality and fitness of land for grazing purposes is not the same throughout Australia, nor even in Queensland. In the report is a long table setting out the conditions that assessors must take into account when fixing rentals. The board recommends low rentals^ and now an additional tax is advocated by the Opposition. Rental values are created and maintained by land development and by the development of other lands in the neighbourhood. The enterprise of Crown tenants in investing their capital has proved the resources of their country, and make it possible for the State to derive extensive revenue from rents and  taxation  which otherwise would not have been available, and spend by far the greater proportion of their gross revenue in wages. This country is not developed by the man in the city, by the man in the office, or by the man who sits in Parliament. It is developed by the man who settles in the outback country, and by those who follow him. Private enterprise alone, by investing its capital in the land, can develop the resources of this country. It is the selectors who develop this country, and that was what was in the mind of the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> when he made the speech that has been referred to by the Opposition. I was with him in Queensland, and I know what he said. He referred to our large areas of land, and the enormous amount of capital necessary to develop them. He said that these areas would be developed only by big men with capital, and subsequently that after they had been developed they should be subdivided into selections for the next settlers. The big man pioneers the country, and after he has developed it and made it productive and railways have been constructed, the smaller man can come in and&#39; get the benefit by selection at the resumption periods. That is what the Prime Minister meant. Nobody in this chamber believes that he said that he was against the bursting up of huge estates that are not being used. Honorable members opposite say that because reduced rents are being charged by the States for certain lands, the Commonwealth should step in and impose increased taxation. They would ignore the national work that the settlers have done for the development of this country and in providing for export, and they say that no taxation should be reduced for them. There are in Queensland and other States vast areas which are wholly undeveloped, and the Land Settlement Advisory Board has recommended that there should be discrimination not only between lands adjacent to and distant from railways, but between lands partially developed and those that are undeveloped. It has suggested that the rents in respect of the latter should be so low that the people settled there will be encouraged to remain and develop the land for the benefit of themselves and the nation, and thus help towards adjusting the present adverse trade balance. The report of the board shows that it appreciated the necessity for conserving any interests that create national wealth, particularly the interests in the outback country. It matters not whether the land is occupied by sheep or cattle. The Queensland Labour Government appreciates that fact, and that is why I said that if some honorable members opposite pitched in Queensland the tale that they have been pitching in this chamber, even members of their own party would laugh at them. The State Arbitration Court discriminated between cattle country and sheep country. Although a sheep property may be divided from a cattle run by only a wire fence, the man who works on the cattle run is paid &#163;2 10s. a week and the employee on the sheep station &#163;3 10s. The Queensland Labour Government also introduced a law, which will expire this year, to allow of special rents being charged to cattlemen.. The board has recommended the extension of that act for another six years, in order to enable the cattlemen to get on their feet. It is admitted that those men should not be required to pay in rent the full economic value of the land. But because they have received a concession on account of bad seasons, and the vicissitudes  of the meat industry, members of the Labour party in this chamber say that the Federal Government should collect the amount that the State Go- ^ eminent has been generous enough to forego. I intend to let the people throughout the length and breadth of Queensland know that the Labour party is in favour of re-imposing the land tax on leasehold, which this Government repealed a couple of years ago, and is against any reduction in direct taxation which would benefit the man outback who is doing a great national work in providing development, exports and work for workmen. I commend the Federal Government for reducing taxation in the past, and for the further reduction they now propose. I know the whole of the people of my State will appreciate it. </para>

            <para>.- I cannot understand some of the speeches delivered upon the bill and the amendments of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. Ministerialists have endeavoured to cloud the issue by introducing many matters that are irrelevant to the bill. I am aware that in debating a bill of this character, much latitude is allowed, and that may account to some extent for some of the extraordinary statements that have been made. The speech of the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> was so doleful that it would be of benefit to the country if it could be deleted from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and totally excluded from the columns of the press. Some friends of mine who recently returned from a visit to Europe told me that if honorable members could see the Australian news that is published in the English newspapers, they would be more careful of the public statements they make. If the speech of the honorable member for Forrest is cabled to the other side of the world it will do infinite harm to this country. I have been surprised to hear the enthusiastic championship of land agents and land monopolists ; they are the curled darlings of the community, because they extract more wealth from the country than any other section. The amendment moved by the honorable member for Yarra is a protest against the removal of land taxation from this wealthy section, which is well able to bear it. As one who has endeavoured to study the problems of public finance, I consider the Treasurer&#39;s proposal most unjust. While he is losing revenue by the remission of taxation, he is trying to balance the ledger by using loan funds for expenditure that should be met from revenue. Instead of producing a budget that would be a credit to Australia, he has produced one which does not meet with the approval of any business man. The proposed remission of land tax will mean an extension of the rotten principle of paying from loan account money that should be paid from revenue. A private company that did not live within its income would soon find itself in the bankruptcy court. The principle of balancing expenditure against income  is  equally sound in the management of the nation&#39;s finances. It is strange that some honorable members cannot speak on any question without blackguarding  the  people who live in the cities. They say. that the city dwellers are supported by the man on the land. That is nonsense. If there were no consumers, the goods produced by the man on the land would be worthless, and even land would have little value if the population were small. The land-holders get more benefits from the public treasury than the rest of the community. Railways are built for their assistance, and although the land-owner gets the benefit of the resultant increment of values, city residents have to help to pay the interest on the capital cost of the lines. </para>

              <para>- The people of New South Wales pay annually &#163;2,250,000 in interest in respect of railways that do not pay. There is a good deal of misconception about taxation. The honorable member for Forrest included in the burden of taxation municipal and road board rates. Those rates are not taxation; they are a charge for services rendered. The roads are paid for out of the petrol tax, which is mainly contributed by the people in the cities. I was a member of this Parliament when the Commonwealth land tax was originally imposed. At that time large areas of land were not being put to productive use, and many of the people who were deriving large incomes from land only partially used were paying little or no taxation. They were actually free from taxation other than that collected through thecustoms and excise duties. I am in the happy position of knowing that the forecast made at that time, that the tax would break up the large holdings, has been verified. Another injustice in regard to the land is that , the governments of the various States have disposed of it at prices far below what it should have brought. In New South Wales there are large areas on the Richmond and Clarence Rivers, and up to the Queensland border, which were sold by the Government for &#163;1 an acre. In the old days, when the Treasurer of the New South Wales Government was short of income, he could always balance his expenditure with his revenue by selling somany acres of land at &#163;1 an acre, and anybody could buy it. The whole of the land in the north-eastern portion of the State was sold in this way. .This land along the Clarence and other rivers and on the north coast is selling now at from .&#163;100 to &#163;110 an acre, although originally it was sold by the Government for &#163;1 an acre. I did not follow all the things that were said on this subject; there are some honorable members who say so many silly things. A man of intellect gets tired of listening to them. Honorable members of the  corner  party are out to preserve the interests of the men who own the land, and they think that the rest of the community have no rights whatever - hardly even the right to exist. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition dealt with this matter in a statesmanlike way in the course of hia address in support of the amendment. That amendment states, &#34;In view of the grave and expanding obligations of &#39;the Commonwealth manifested by the adverse trade balance and the increasing loan expenditure,&#34; and there is no dispute about those things. We are to-day floating a redemption loan. Our practice is to pay &#163;5,000,000 or &#163;6,000,000 off our debt, and then to borrow another &#163;12,000,000. The amount credited each year to the loan account is much greater than that set aside for debt redemption. </para>

          <para class="block">I believe that there is a day coming when we shall no longer be able to finance the country on these lines. The Government would be very wise, even at this late hour, to alter its decision in connexion with the/ proposed reduction of the tax. The country cannot be governed without taxation, and we can get the taxes only from those in a position to pay. Honorable members will notice, if they study the press, that those persons whose estates pay the largest amount in probate duty are those who held property in land. The professional or commercial man in the city never leaves a very large estate, unless he, too, has done some dabbling in land. Most of the big business men in Sydney are also large land-owners. Personally, I shall not pay much probate when I go my way, because I do not own any land at all except a little block 6 feet by 3 feet, for which I paid quite enough ; and the place on which my home is situated. &#171; When I first went to live there the land was valued at &#163;10 a foot, but now, for some reason, the valuation has been increased to &#163;50 a foot. I do not know why this should be: I did not ask them to put up the value. When I made inquiries at the Town Hall about it they told me that so much was for the town clock, so much for the. bridge, so much for the gulley at the back, and so much for other different items. I do not know why the&#39; people do not take more interest in what is going on. Since this Government has been in power it has granted numerous concessions to the people on the land. There is what amounts . to a bounty of 3d. a lb. on butter, for instance. When a drought comes, the people on the land apply for all sorts of assistance from the Government, and ask, among other things, that their cattle shall be carried free on the railways. I never heard of better socialists than some of these people. They have the land, and if Providence favours them with bounteous rains so that they have good crops, they take a&#39;ll the profit, while the community gets nothing; but if they meet with adversity they want the whole community to help them to bear it. They obtain all the benefits of high prices, and yet are nothing better than tax dodgers. They are the most miser able section of the community as far as contributing to the development of Australia is concerned, and they are the greediest section also. </para>

              <para>- I have great sympathy with the struggling farmer. When the Government resumes land, it pays such a high price for it that the settlers or farmers are unable to make anything out of it. In Victoria alone, the Commonwealth is losing &#163;10,000,000 by reason of the falling off in the value of land upon which it has advanced money. In New South Wales all our political scandals of any magnitude have had to do with land matters. </para>

              <para>- The land-holders do not want to be taxed even to make the roads. If it were not for the workers in the city who purchase their commodities, the landholders would find themselves in Queerstreet. I am sorry that the question of country versus city was ever brought into the committee; there was no justification for it. The land-holders wish to be relieved of taxation, and to obtain all the benefits of high prices and a prosperous industry, while allowing the country to be financed by those who pay indirect taxation.  If  there was ever a section of the community that ought to be taxed for the purpose of helping us bear the burdens of the war, it is those connected with the land. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> McCaughey made a fortune, but he left, it to the university. The Russells - other benefactors of the Sydney University - were engineers, but they made nothing out of their engineering; they made their wealth out of the land they held. After they had held it for some time it was worth ten times its original value. It is a pity that we have the present Government in power. It represents vested interests, and the interests of those connected with the land. It is serving  its friends loyally. I only wish the industrial section of the community would learn a lesson from the experience of the last few years. We should then have a different result at the next election. I hope that the committee will pay some attention to this amendment. I recognize, however, that the Government has its majority, and that it is only talking to the wind to oppose its proposal. It has the numbers, and it is able to inflict this punishment on a section of the community. It has no soul, or it would think twice before it laid such burden on the mass of the people. </para>

            <para>.- I, for one,, am opposed to land taxation by the Commonwealth. I believe that the State can administer that business very much better than the Federal Government can. So far as this tax is concerned, the city provides about 55 per cent, of it. In the city the major portion is paid by the consumer. I am connected with business concerns, and I know how warehouses and other businesses pass the load on to the consumer. The rural industry is in quite a different position. It has to compete with cheap overseas markets, and has not the opportunities to pass on expenses which are enjoyed by the secondary industries. That cannot be emphasized too clearly. Fifty-five per cent, of this tax is paid in the cities by the consumer. At present a harbour bridge is being constructed in Sydney, and the major portion of its cost will be passed on to the consumers. When the Arbitration Court compels the employer to pay additional wages he passes the increase, with a little addition, on to the community, which must bear the burden. </para>

          <para>It would be difficult to get two men to value land at the same, price. I have been associated with land valuing for many years, and while I feel that I am competent to value the land with which I am familiar - and in connexion with which I know the rainfall, accessibility, carrying capacity, &#38;c. - I would not dream of going 100- miles away from my own centre, and posing there, as a competent valuer. Values depend chiefly on the man who values, and it is impossible for him to have a comprehensive knowledge of many  different localities.  One primary producer may make good on land which is valued at &#163;20, while another man may fail on similar land valued at &#163;10. Our experience, with soldier land settlement provides an excellent example of that. There is land in Victoria, arid in other parts of the Commonwealth, which varies in valuation from &#163;1 to &#163;3 an acre from adjoining land, from which it is divided by a fence or a road. That is manifestly unfair. We should have some co-ordination in our valuing. A valuer may be instructed to value a certain estate, which may not have been valued for some time.- Changed circumstances may warrant the valuation that he places upon it, but the adjoining lands are not revalued, and remain at the old value. We have State and Federal values of the land which differ, and even our Federal values of similar land differ considerably. I have argued constantly that land should be zoned when it is valued for Federal taxation purposes, and that the valuation should apply for three or six years, the land in each zone to be r.e-valued simultaneously. That would set right many existing anomalies. I am very pleased that the old system of assessing land values is to be abolished, as it was unfair. I do not agree with the Leader of the- Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> and the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> in their remarks on the value placed on estates, and as to the difficulty experienced in obtaining farms. I have been through large portions of Western Australia, South Australia, and other States of Australia, and I believe, that the opportunities to go on the land are as good today as they ever were during my lifetime. It is useless to give a man 1,000 acres of land when he has no money with which to develop it. He must possess capital to pay for fencing, implements, stock, and for the erecton  of his house. It must be realized that there is a multiplicity of financial obligations following the actual acquisition of the land. Referring to the alleged .exorbitant values placed on large estates, I saw five estates sold in a western district at from &#163;95 to &#163;110 per acre, for 20-acre blocks. Large estates, when cut up for subdivisional purposes, may be purchased at a much lower figure. In Victoria there are estates which have been on the market for some time, and which may be purchased reasonably. Associated with the subdivision of estates is the cost of subdividing, road construction, cleaning, and so on, and the profits made by the owners are not nearly as great as some honorable members would have us believe. Those who have, the most to say on such matters appear to know the least about them. A lifelong experience of land matters teaches me that the person who goes on the land is confronted with many adversities of which the average person has not the slightest conception. At the same time I believe that there has been too much pessimistic preaching. I realize that the amount of first-class land available in Australia is limited. It is our last and practically only asset. It is the source of all wealth. Our secondary industries would be nothing without primary  producton,  and we should encourage to the fullest extent the linking up of - the two industries. </para>
          <para>I am confident that the Government have played the game in regard to soldier settlement. I have had a practical knowledge; of the scheme from its inception in Victoria. The Federal Government has come to the assistance of our returned soldier settlers with a straight-out gift of &#163;10,000,000, and by the time finalization is arrived at between the States and the Commonwealth, this Government will be compelled to foot the bill even to a greater extent. That indicates that, when you place a man on the land, the matter does not .end there. It may be argued that soldier settlements have failed because the land was bought at exorbitant prices, but in most districts it would have brought on the open market a price at least equal to that which the Government paid for it. Our soldier settlers have had heavy burdens to meet in the way of rents, rates, instalments on stock and implements, and payments for sub-divisional fences, and as many of them had practically no capital, it was only to be expected that they would fail. I do not desire to have anything to do with land settlement which is carried on in this fashion. If we attempt to settle migrants here under similar conditions we shall invite disaster. I expect that in the future Commonwealth land in North and Central Australia will become valuable, as also will the unoccupied parts of Northern Queensland, and the Kimberly district in .Western Australia, but before that day comes heavy expenditure will have to be incurred in constructing roads and railways. These are essential to settlement, and until they are provided the areas I have mentioned must remain of little value. I agree with the proposal of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> that a board should be appointed to hear appeals from the decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation. I favour submitting these matters to laymen of wide experience in land valuation and dealing, rather than to judges in a court, for I think that justice is more likely to be done if practical men determine the issue than if such matters are left to lawyers. I disagree with the view of several honorable members opposite that the relief granted by this measure, which is approximately &#163;445,000, will be enjoyed principally by moneyed men. In my opinion the concessions will benefit a large&#39; number of people. They will even be advantageous to the worker, for they will make available for productive purposes money which would otherwise be spent in taxation. While it is true that many people are forsaking the pastoral industry, quite a number of our young men are taking it up. Only last week two young fellows of my acquaintance left for Western Australia to settle on a big undeveloped grazing property many miles from the railhead. They will be pioneers in every sense of the word. It is interesting to note that&#187; while this Government is proposing to grant a reduction of 10 per cent, in land taxation the Labour Premier of Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hogan)</inline> is increasing the tax by a similar percentage. This shows that the people will appreciate all the relief that we can grant them. I appreciate fully the decision of the Government to abolish the unfair system of dating increased values back over two or three years. The Labour party&#39;s reason for opposing the 10 per cent, reduction is on the ground that State governments cannot impose- land taxation because the upper houses in the State Parliaments will not agree to it ; but I am of the opinion that whenever a good case can be made out the State upper houses may be relied upon to do the fair thing in the interests of their States. I approve of the concessions which have been granted by this measure. It is not a fair thing that persons who object to the decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation should be compelled to fight the matter out in &#39;court. </para>
          <para class="block">Many taxpayers have made complaints to me, but when I have advised them to take the matter into court they have said that they would not do so, for it might cost them two or three times the amount involved, to obtain a decision. The provisions of this bill will bring more equity into our taxation methods. </para>

            <para>.- I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this bill, but I regret that it is not altogether evacuating this field of taxation. The sooner it does so the better, in my opinion. The policy of taxing land is unsound. An axiom of taxation is that a person shall contribute to the expenses of government according to his ability to do so. Land tax is levied on the value of the land, regardless of the return that is obtained from it, which is unfair. Income taxation is a much fairer method of obtaining revenue from the country. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> the  Deputy  Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> and the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> all gave reasons why the Government should continue to impose land taxation. The honorable member for Dalley mentioned four specific objects which the Labour party had in view when it introduced the first Land Tax Assessment Bill into this Parliament. They were: first, to prevent land monopoly ; secondly, to break up large estates; thirdly, to secure to the Government a, certain part of the unearned increment in the value of the land in consequence of the expenditure of public money in constructing roads and railways and other developmental works; and, fourthly, to obtain revenue. I do not desire to discuss the constitutional aspect of the subject at length, but I submit that it was never intended that the Commonwealth Government should enter this field of taxation. In a time of emergency, such as of war, it is justifiable for a government to obtain revenue by any means which are fair to all concerned. The State Governments could impose a land tax which could be just as effective in preventing land monopoly as any such tax which the Commonwealth might impose. One serious complaint that I- have against land taxation is that it gives no consideration whatever to the man who is putting his land to the best. use. He is charged on the capital value of the land, and not upon its earning power. What has this Parliament done to improve the land values of Australia? We legislate for the welfare of the people :&#39;.3 a whole. Certain powers were delegated to us by the States, but land development was not one of them. </para>

              <para>- That is so, and also with respect to the Northern Territory. We should be well advised to leave the power to control land settlement and development in the hands of the States. I hope that this measure is only the forerunner of the good things to come from this Government, and that the 10 per cent, reduction now forecast will soon be followed by an entire vacation of the field of land taxation. </para>

Upon the basis of that undertaking the judge thenmade an interim award for three months which provides that the time and places of picking. up shall be those prevailing in the different ports on the 10th January, 1927, which was the date on which the court commenced the hearing of the men&#39;s plaint. This award has been made without prejudice to the rights of either party. No date has been fixed for the hearing of the plaint, but I understand that it will be heard within a few days. I received other information from both Melbourne and Sydney, which appears to indicate quite definitely that the trouble will be over to-day, and that work will be resumed to-morrow morning. I am sure that to all honorable members this information will be of the most gratifying character. Last week, we had a discussion in this House upon the trouble which had arisen, and while in the heat of debate some members may have expressed strong views, I think that the desire of all of us was to see that we did not in any way prejudice the situation. We were merely trying to carry out what we thought was an obligation of this Parliament. The present indications are that it will be unnecessary for any action to be taken to safeguard the interests of the people, that wise counsels have prevailed, and that happily the whole trouble will disappear and that Australia will be able to resume the normal course of its industrial activities. </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">.- (By leave).</inline>- The information which the Prime Minister has conveyed to the House is very satisfactory. Nobody could be more pleased than I am to hear of the possible early termination of the dispute that has been in progress during the last two or three weeks. The settlement shows that, after all, instead of rushing into industrial trouble, it is better to call the parties together, so that a conference can be held or some conciliatory action taken whereby their dif ferences can be adjusted. I think that the debate in the House has not done harm, but rather some good, since it focussed public attention upon the matter and upon the desirability of reaching a settlement. It was also of indirect assistance to the parties who have since met and as a result of negotiations extending over two or three days, have settled their differences. Although we are not in possession of full particulars regarding what occurred at the conference, or the names of those who took part in it, I think that credit is due, not only to the court, but also to the disputes committee in Victoria, which took up this matter. This committee, although it was not a party to the dispute, and is one which is often much abused, got into communication with the contending parties and also with the court, and did its best to bring about a satisfactory result. It is most pleasing to know that its efforts were successful. </para>

            <para>. - It seems extraordinary that a motion which deplores our- adverse balance of trade should have been moved to prevent the Government from giving effect to a reduction of direct taxation, because the most satisfactory method of improving the balance of trade is to increase the total production of Australia, and the best means of doing that is to lighten the burden of taxation upon it. The great exports of Australia - wool and wheat - which tend to make our balance of trade satisfactory, are essentially products of the land, and wool particularly, and wheat to a minor degree, bear practically the whole burden of this tax - so far as it affects the country. In view of that, one wonders at the Opposition bringing forward a motion, which, if given effect, would prevent these industries from receiving a certain measure of relief. I feel sure that when the vote is taken, honorable members will, in no uncertain fashion, favour remedying the balance of trade as far as possible by giving reliefto  country industries and industry generally by a reduction of direct taxation. This afternoon the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hunter)</inline> quoted from a report which has recently been made to the Queensland Government by the Land Settlement Advisory Board. That board is admitted to have made probably one of the most comprehensive and satisfactory examinations which have been made of the pastoral position in Queensland, and its conclusions, incidentally, are applicable to the rest of Australia. In its report, special stress is laid on the fact that if these industries which provide so much of &#39;the export wealth of Australia, are unduly handicapped by vexatious taxation or exorbitant rents, the immediate effect will be to paralyze and strangle them. The report shows conclusively that in the outback country instead of small areas being economical from the point of view of development and output, they are the reverse, and that .to induce men with insufficient capital to settle on the land reduces the total output per sheep, lessens the rentals, and decreases the total production of the industry. The board made a strong plea for reductions of taxation in the outback portions of the country. That applies  especially to that taxation which this Parliament some four years ago removed from Crown leaseholds. Certain honorable members today have referred to that action, and the Leader of the Opposition has taken some exception to certain remarks of the Prime Minister regarding Crown leaseholds. At that time the attitude of the Government was consistent. It said that it desired to repeal the taxation of Crown leaseholds for two reasons ; first, that that tax interfered with State policy - and this report bears that out beyond dispute - and secondly, that the industry itself could not carry this crushing load and that it was practically impossible to administer the tax. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> asked what portions of the tax had been collected. At that time there was in hand something like &#163;690,000 of receipts on account of Crown leaseholds, and the proposal of the Government was to repeal that tax, retrospectively to 1917. It was then recognized that even if we did not repeal the tax we would collect very little more than we had already received. Parliament decided that the tax should be continued until 1923, and the Government made every effort to collect it. </para>

              <para>- I wish to reply to a statement made by the honorable member for Yarra in connexion with the judgment of the court, and with that object. I am making these preliminary observations. Up to June, 1924, we had been able to collect some &#163;909,000. We have continued to collect that tax, but now find that we are in possession of &#163;901,000, which is less, by &#163;8,000, than the amount we had three years ago. That is due to the fact that a royal commission, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Duffy,&#39;</inline> the secretary of the Labour Council of Victoria, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Warren</inline> Kerr were members, laid down certain lines of action. There have been up to the present, out of a total of 2,578 Crown leases, some 1,875 cases re-valued, and a consequent reduction in tax of &#163;887,000. </para>

            <para>- Order ! When the honorable member for Dalley was speaking this afternoon he charged the Treasurer with neglecting to collect arrears of taxation. He continued at some length, and I asked him not to discuss the details of that subject. I consider it only fair that the Treasurer should he allowed to reply to the honorable member for Dalley, but I ask him not to discuss details, because the collection of arrears of taxation on leaseholders has no relation to the principle of the bill. </para>

              <para>- After we have been put to considerable trouble and inconvenience, and fought many actions in the court, the moneys in hand are less than they were in 1924. That is a position which I, as Treasurer, very much deplore, because with more money in the Treasury, we would have been able to  make greater  reductions in taxation. First of all, the tax on departmental valuations amounted to over &#163;2,000,000. There has been a revision of those valuations on the basis of the Royal Commission&#39;s report, with a consequent reduction in taxation of some &#163;887,000. We have had those valuations tested before the court, and it gave a verdict against us on the facts. The honorable member for Yarra this afternoon suggested that the arithmetic of the judge- was at fault, but we obtained legal opinion to the effect that the judge had decided on the facts, and there was not the slightest chance of a successful appeal. We have found it necessary to establish the general principle of taxation and to proceed with other actions to ensure some basis that will bring to an end the complicated question of taxation of Crown leaseholds. I make that statement for the information of the honorable member for Yarra, and for honorable members generally. </para>

The honorable member for Yarra said that there were two specific reasons for the tax, first, to break down large estates; and, secondly, to ensure that the unearned increment would return, in some degree, to the people of this country. The Government does not hold that view in regard to Federal Land Tax. We look upon it more as a means of obtaining revenue, and . although, incidentally, it may have brought about .a certain amount of subdivision, the Government considers that, as a means of subdivision, it is probably the crudest instrument ever devised in the history of mankind. The tax has to be paid out of income, so that it becomes a tax on income measured by relation to land value. From that point of view I wish to examine it, because I do not think it can be successfully contended that the land tax was originally imposed for the purpose of raising revenue. In .1911-12, the year in which it was first brought into operation there was a surplus in the Commonwealth Treasury of &#163;1,890,000. </para>
          <para class="block">The land tax returned &#163;1,390,000, so that the actual surplus over and above the land tax was &#163;500,000, compared with which our recent surpluses - considered in relation to total expenditure - shrink into insignificance. As a. revenue raising medium the Labour party has never regarded the land tax seriously. It has been regarded as an instrument of subdivision, and as such this Government considers it most clumsy, inefficient, inequitable, and almost useless. An analysis of the land tax returns shows that the bulk of the money is derived from the cities and towns. For instance, in 1911-12, &#163;525,455 was obtained from the towns and &#163;919,805, or 64 per cent., from the country. In 1912-13, &#163;575,871, or 39 per cent., was collected in the towns, and &#163;S84,092, or 61 per cent., in the country ; in 1913-14, &#163;605,933, or 40 per cent., in the towns and &#163;899,S70, or 60 per cent., in the country. In the next few years the figures were disturbed because of the interposition of tax on Grown leaseholds, which brought the receipts from the country back to the earlier proportions, but by 1920-21, notwithstanding that the leasehold tax was still included in the total returns, the towns, were returning 42 per cent, and the country 58 pei1 cent, of the total tax. In 1921-22, the towns returned 45 per cent, and the country 55 per cent., in 1922-23 the towns 46 per cent, and the country 54 per cent. In 1923-24, when the tax upon leaseholds was remitted, the towns yielded 51 per cent., or &#163;1,042,000, as against 49 per cent., or &#163;999,272, from the country. In 1924-25, the latest year for which I have been able to have the returns analyzed, not less than 55 per cent, of the total tax came from the towns and only 45 per cent, from the country. So that more than half of the revenue yielded by this tax, which was imposed largely for the purposes of sub-division, is derived from town and city lands. Whatever else may be said of the tax it is obvious that it will not bring about any further sub-division. Everybody will admit that it operates to the detriment of industry. If a factory occupies a piece of land worth &#163;10,000 and because of the need for doubling the size of the works the company finds it necessary to buy another piece of land along- side at a cost of &#163;10,000, because of&#34; the graduation and cumulative effect, of the tax, the company will pay in respect of the first block of land double theprevious tax. The tax on the second, piece of land also will be doubled, so that the enterprise will have to pay four timesas much tax as it did before the necessity for extending its operations arose. That, instance &#34; indicates very clearly that this tax really penalizes city industries. That is something we donot desire. .We are all anxious to see these industries expand, because asour total production from primary and  secondary industries is increased our chance of correcting the adversetrade balance will be greatly improved. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the manner in  which the  tax operates. Section 99 of the Constitution provides - </para>

          <para class="block">It is constitutionally impossible for a Commonwealth tax to discriminate bet./een city and country lands. In any one State certain areas, by reason of quality of soil, situation, proximity to railways and ports, rainfall, &#38;c, are much better suited for closer settlement than are others. But the federal land tax is an instrument which operates against the just and the unjust alike. It is impossible to discriminate between lands for any of those reasons; but the tax tends to break up the huge areas outback which are held in the only way in which they can return satisfactory rents to the Crown and produce income taxation. At the same time, it penalizes the highly developed areas close to the coast. The various State parliaments have recognized the necessity for discriminating between different areas; In New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Loughlin,</inline> a member of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang&#39;s</inline> Cabinet, introduced to Parliament a measure, the declared object of which was &#34; to impose a tax for the purpose of promoting agricultural settlement and the subdivision of large estates.&#34; He said definitely that, in his opinion, the land tax was essentially the prerogative of the States, because they could use it not only for taxation purposes, but also for policy purposes in a way not possible to the Federal Parliament. The </para>
          <para class="block">New South Wales bill prescribed a minimum taxable value of &#163;10,000. All estates above that amount were to be taxed, but exemption was granted to lands within the western division, lands within the irrigation area - honorable members know how rapidly they acquire value and how few acres are necessary to bring a property under the operation of the federal land tax - Crown lands held for mining purposes, city lands, and land held for agricultural and dairying purposes to a reasonable extent, and lands suitable for grazing only. In addition, deductions of tax were allowed. If in any year a taxpayer put under cultivation a certain specified area he would obtain a deduction of the whole of his tax for the following year. If he put a smaller area under cultivation, the deduction would be proportionately reduced. If in any year a taxpayer sold or leased on share-farming conditions a certain specified percentage of. the land held by him he would obtain a deduction of the whole tax levied in the&#39; following year. The deduction was also extended to a taxpayer who satisfied an advisory board that he had made a bona fide attempt to sell or lease the specified area. Although it would be competent for a State to make such a law, it is quite beyond the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, and, therefore, a federal land tax can be regarded as a very clumsy subdivisional implement. I do not deny that it has accelerated to some extent&#34; the rate of subdivision, but we must not forget that other factors were, and are, operating in the same direction - increasing local taxation, the greater economic use to which lands can be put if subdivided and used for other purposes, and the death of the original holders. A thousand different causes operated to bring about subdivision before the federal land tax was imposed, and will continue to operate for thousands of years after this law has been relegated to oblivion. The Government, therefore, can only regard the land tax as one of the sources of direct revenue, and believes that great harm must result if it is not reduced <inline font-style="italic">pari passu</inline> with other forms of direct taxation. At the same time we must try to remove anomalies, as this bill proposes to do, and to make its incidence as equitable as possible. In doing so we should have regard to the danger of compelling an undue subdivision of country lands. The Queensland Land Settlement Advisory Board brought out - that fact very clearly - </para>

            <para>. -  The wording of this section is practically identical with that in the Income Tax Act, which deals with a similar matter. The powers of the assistant commissioner, although considerably widened by this section, would not enable him to give decisions conflicting with those of the commissioner. The commissioner will have power to review any action, decision, or determination of the second commissioner, just as he may review any action, decision, or determination made by himself. By that means the position is safeguarded. I think the honorable member will see that the system will work quite well in practice. </para>

          </quote>
          <para>There is no reason why we should not define the position specifically. Adverse decisions have been given against the Commissioner of Taxation with regard to the value of land that is suitable for subdivision. The commissioner has assessed the value of land for taxation purposes on its value if subdivided, less the cost of subdividing the land, it being in his opinion suitable for subdivision. Such lands were in city areas. Honorable, members know that there is a vast difference between the value of a large estate in the city when it is bought in one piece and when it is purchased after subdivision. I am of the opinion that the commissioner was quite right in declaring that the value of the unimproved value of the land is the value that it would bring if subdivided, less the cost of subdivision, but the court held the reverse opinion. In another case, where it was a matter of purchasing land upon which to build soldiers&#39; homes under the War Service Homes Abt, and in which the Commonwealth desired to resume at the value of the whole block, the court ruled that the land must be paid for on the value which it would bring if subdivided, less the cost of subdivision. There are two conflicting decisions, both against the Government. If the Treasurer would insert the paragraphs which I have suggested at the end of the clause with which we are dealing it would clarify the position. </para>

I  consider that the right place in which to define unimproved land would be under section 3 of the principal act, which setsout the definitions. Unimproved value is there defined as meaning -   the capital sum which the fee-simple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller would require, assuming that the improvements (if any), thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title had not been made. </para>

          <para class="block">A similar definition exists in practically all the State acts. If we adopted a fresh definition we should immediately put ourselves out of line with the States. Our policy is to try to have our definitions uniform with State and municipal definitions, to reduce the cost of valuation. Our practice with regard to the City of Sydney has been to accept the municipal valuation as the- official federal valuation. Section 7 of the principal act is being amended by the clause which we are considering, and it seeks to bring the act into line with the accepted practice of the department. It was only when the commission on Crown leaseholds was examining the act that it was discovered that the actual wording of the act was not in consonance with the practice of the department. We are now endeavouring to rectify the anomaly. I urge the honorable member for Yarra to make his suggestion when we reach the end of the bill. </para>

          <para class="block">Treasurer a matter affecting both improved and unimproved value, and one which has not, so far, had the cognizance pf the commissioner or his department. Recently, Australian pastoralists have sought the aid of scientific investigation for the betterment of their land. So far that betterment has been in the  direction  of improving the pastures, by top dressing with superphosphates, and by the development of new pasture plants. In some cases that treatment has doubled the carrying capacity of the land. Under the present machinery of the act the pastoralist or grazier who undertakes such work, is unable to deduct the betterment from the improved price of the land brought about by his enterprise, apart from the annual deduction of the cost of the labour employed to effect the improvements. Thus the progressive man creates a higher valuation of his land for taxation purposes, merely for the benefit of the taxing master. I know of some holdings, particularly along the border of South Australia where &#34;light&#34; country capable of carrying half a sheep to the acre has, by concentrated, up-to-dato methods, been so improved that it will now carry two sheep to the acre. I know that it is not possible for the Treasurer to give an undertaking immediately to rectify the anomaly, but I trust that he and the Government will carefully consider the position, and allow the progressive pastoralist, grazier, or dairy farmer a fair and reasonable allowance on the betterment effected by his enterprise. </para>

              <para>- That is so. As the act stands, the only allowance that can be made is in respect of the value of the improvements which, of course, include those out of sight, which are often very difficult to value. The lifting of timber out of the soil of Australia has been a herculean task for which our landholders rarely receive sufficient allowance. Graziers, pastoralists and farmers should be given every consideration&#39; in respect of the expenditure of money to improve their properties. The New Zealand dairy farmers and the small  fatteners  have been considered in this connexion,: but we are be-* hind the sister domini&#39;on in these matters. I know that in some cases in New Zealand land is fertilized twice annually to improve it. I trust that the Minister will assure the committee that he will introduce an amendment to give effect to  my suggstion,  or that he will at least inquire whether the existing provisions are sufficiently elastic to allow of this deduction being made. </para>

            <para>. - I should like to see a new paragraph added to section 13 of th.e. principal act, which this clause amends, to provide for the exemption from taxation of all lands used for agricultural purposes. The speeches delivered on this measure to-day lead me to believe that such an amendment would meet with general approval. The &#34;Treasurer informed us .that the object of this legislation was to break up large estates, and not to obtain revenue. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> stated that, in his opinion, land tax was being paid on less than 1 per cent of our farm holdings. Consequently, the loss of revenue, through the insertion of an amendment such as I have, suggested would not be great.

              <para>- I have no idea.; but nothing like &#163;101,000 was paid for it. Melbourne has expanded beyond these links in the last few years, and they have become very valuable. A number of similar properties in Melbourne and other cities of the Commonwealth will be exempt from taxation if this clause is agreed to. It is well, therefore, that we should consider how far we are prepared to go in this direction. Persons who can afford to occupy a property valued at &#163;101,000 for the purpose of playing golf upon it could surely well afford to pay taxation upon it. The municipal authorities would suffer a heavy loss of revenue if they were to cease rating properties such as these. Probably, as the Treasurer pointed out, these areas serve as lungs for our cities, but at the same time they keep much valuable land but of use for residential purposes. I&#34; have an inquiry to make, also respecting the interpretation of the latter part of the proposed new paragraph. I take it that the words, &#34;not used for the pecuniary profits of the members of the club or body,&#34; would prevent any land which&#39;, is being used for the conduct of sport&#39; for profit coming within exemption. &#39; </para>

In many small country towns fairly large areas of land are used perhaps twice a year for .the conduct of picnic race meetings, the pro- fits of which are usually devoted to charity.

              <para>- Let me remind the Minister that this chamber has control of all taxation. The other branch of the legislature is a class chamber as at present constituted, and it would take any action that it could to remove taxation from the section of the people. that  it represents. It was never intended that legislation should be initiated in that chamber. The very fact that each State has equal representation in it shows that it was intended under the Constitution to be a house of review. I should like the Treasurer to reply to this criticism, because I am speaking in the interests of the taxpayers of Australia. We should abide by the terms of the Constitution. We are constantly told that we enjoy constitutional government; but action such as that suggested by the Treasurer indicates a desire to depart from it. I have always fought for the retention of all the privileges of honorable members of the popular chamber. If we allowed such an amendment to pass without raising an objection to it, we should fail in  our  responsibilities as direct representatives of the people in the House that has control of all taxation. </para>

            <para>, - I amplify the remarks by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> He mentioned a golf club that has land for sale. I know another near Melbourne. In several cases large areas are held by these clubs, which have purchased twice as much land in more outlying parts of the metropolitan area. They have bought the additional land at a cheap rate, and one club is now about to sell the land that it holds in the Sandringham district. This is practically at the seaside, and it is very valuable land. &#34; I doubt whether it could be purchased for &#163;104,000. I also wish to know whether the royal agricultural societies in the capital cities are affected by land tax proposals of the Government. They all have properties worth considerable sums of money, and, in some cases, they have purchased the land on which the Royal Shows are held. For instance, the Royal Society in Melbourne recently increased its show area, having bought laud at considerable expense from private owners, even to the extent of buying out an hotel. Without wishing to single out a particular sport  - I recognize that golf is a capital exerciseI remind the committee that wealthy syndicates and clubs hold large area&#39;s of land, and if they are not now required to pay land tax under this bill they ought to be, because the land is owned by wealthy people. </para>

          <para>Those are the existing exemptions and  it is desired to extend them, for the reason that I gave in my second-reading speech, to tennis, cricket, bowling and golfclubs and certain other sports clubs. The words &#34; other than horse racing &#34; are inserted to qualify &#34; athletic sports or exercises.&#34; The amount involved is only a few hundred pounds. A tax of &#163;100 is a fairly  severe one for a club whose grounds are used purely for recreation purposes. It is felt that in the suburban areas around our big cities it would be a pity to enforce the premature subdivision of those large grounds. It is recognized that ultimately they will be purchased and either presented to the public by philanthropic citizens or will be bought up and used for building purposes, but nobody can help regretting that the same care was not exercised in the lay-out of some of our suburban areas as was the case in Melbourne and Adelaide. Therefore, there is little risk of a big loss of revenue. Although it is possible that certain areas are very valuable, I suggest that the committee might accept the clause. </para>

            <para>.- This clause repeals sections 20 and 21 of the principal act. It provides for triennial assessments, and takes from the commissioner the power to value annually, and to make re-assessments retrospective I spoke on this subject on the secondreading, and do not desire to traverse the whole of the ground again. As I have already pointed out, if we take from the commissioner the power to make an annual valuation of land, we shall, on the admission of the Treasurer, lose &#163;S0,000 a year in revenue, but I estimate that the loss will be considerably more than that. The estimate of loss for the first year is &#163;80,000, for the second &#163;160,000; and for the third year, nil. But in the next three years the relativeincrease in values will be greater. Whyshould we lose that revenue? There areareas of land in Australia that will remain at one valuation, perhaps for a number of years, but other areas; such large areas as golf links adjacent to cities, although of low value to-day, will, as the cities spread, rapidly increase in value. </para>

              <para>- That is so. Many of those areas are held undoubtedly for speculative purposes, because they are being put to no use to-day. The owners are waiting for the extension of railways and tramways so that the land can be subdivided into suburban blocks. In the meantime they should pay taxes on the real value of the land as ascertained from time to time by the department. Under this clause we shall deliberately take from the commissioner the power to value that land except once in three years. </para>

              <para>- Usually large estates are completely subdivided. Two arguments in favour of the clause have been advanced, first, that . assessments at present are not made every year, and may not be made for five or six years, and secondly, that there are not sufficient valuers in the department to travel every year through Australia making reassessments. I admit that there are difficulties. </para>

              <para>- There, is no need for an annual valuation, but why take that power from the Commissioner? I suggest that this is being done for no good and sound reason. The Treasurer argued that these re-valuations were costly and difficult,, and brought forth numerous protests. I suggest that there would be less protest if values were increased annually rather than every three years, when the accumulated increases in value would be taken into account. The Labour party favoured the retention of the present land tax rate, but this House has decided against that. &#39; It has affirmed the principle that there should be a general reduction in land tax. Let us accept that decision for the. time being. Surely we should not be prepared to lose &#163;80,000 a year by placing a low valuation on some land, and the correct valuation on other land. One principle of taxation is that it should be equitable in its incidence. I. submit that this loss of &#163;80,000 a year cannot be justified. What has been wrong with the practice in the past ? Not one word has been said by the Treasurer to indicate that the powers possessed by the Commissioner have been abused or have caused difficulty. For seventeen years this power has remained in the hands of the Commissioner, and now it is proposed to take it from him. Land assessments are to be made every three years, despite the fact that large areas of land in and around the cities are likely to increase enormously in value within a short period because of the extension of railways and tramways. The clause also provides for the abolition of the power of the Commissioner to make re-assessments retrospective for two years. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is entitled to his opinion, and I am also entitled to mine. The Commissioner is charged by the law to collect the taxes justly, and there is nothing good in the proposal to deprive him of the power to make re-assessments, although obvious mistakes may have been made by the taxpayers or the taxation assessors. Every business man would claim the right to send to a customer an amended account if a mistake had been made in the original. Two years is not a long period within which to re-assess land tax. The Income Tax Assessment Bill allowed the Commissioner three years in which to reassess, and not one word of protest came from the honorable member for Wannon when the amending bill was before the committee. </para>

Land may have been omitted from a return because the owner did not think that his holding was taxable. I am leaving out of consideration attempted evasion..

              <para>- I - In theory, what the honorable member says was correct; one can find out a lot if he applies to the right place at the right time; but those who have&#34; studied the administration of the Land Tax Department know that, despite the records of the Titles Office and other documentary evidence, the department again and again has found reassessments absolutely necessary. It is quite a common practice to make reassessments retrospective for two years; as a matter of fact, even that limitation has been responsible for the loss of a lot of revenue. The royal commission that inquired into the taxation of Crown leaseholds heard evidence from responsible men about the difficulties created by the limitation of two years. Now the Treasurer proposes to abolish this retrospective power, although experience has demonstrated the need for it. The pro- posal is unwarranted, and will mean a loss of revenue. If the relief were equally distributed over all taxpayers, it might be included with the general reductions which are part of the Government&#39;s policy, but I am certain the Government will not say that it favours a reduction of taxation in respect of one section and not in respect of another. For the reasons I have mentioned, I shall vote against the clause. </para>

            <para>.- I strongly object to the proposed curtailment of the Commissioner&#39;s powers, which hitherto have been exercised most satisfactorily. I have in mind two land transactions that indicate the need for the power of re-assessment. The erection of the North Shore bridge in Sydney has led to a considerable increase in the values of adjacent land, and one family sold out its holding at a price four times as great as it would have received two or three years ago. The Commissioner should have power to collect taxation in respect of that unearned increment. Another family sold some houses and land at Darlinghurst, and one of the partners in the auctioneering firm of Hardy and Gorman said to me, &#34; If you had told me three months ago that this land would be sold for &#163;103 a foot I would have laughed at you.&#34; It was a Saturday afternoon sale. </para>

              <para>- The family owned land other than that which was sold. The proceeds of the sale amounted to &#163;14,000, but I believe that if the value of the unsold land were added, the tax payable by the family would have been 6d. in the &#163;1. It would be unwise to deprive the Commissioner of power to collect extra taxation in respect of land, the value of which has risen suddenly and considerably. The Treasurer would do well to heed the objection raised by the honorable member for Yarra. </para>

              <para>- -For three years ahead. It is strange that, at this time in the country&#39;s history, when we can ill afford to lose revenue, the Government should be proposing an amendment that will mean the surrender of &#163;80,000 a year. Hitherto the annual valuation has proved quite satisfactory, but for some reason undisclosed that power has been taken from the commissioner. In both income and land tax returns mistakes occur which are not discovered for some considerable time. Having regard to the fact that values of land increase so rapidly the commissioner should have the power of annual valuation. During the last three or four years the value of some lands in Newcastle has doubled. If the triennial valuation is adopted, the owners may sell next year for twice the amount upon which they have been paying taxation. Why should not the Treasury get some benefit from the unearned increment on that land? They did not increase the value. It was increased because of the creation of &#39; public utilities, because of the new works established in the neighbourhood, aud because of the growth of population. Now we propose to allow the speculators to reap the benefit of those increases. There are speculators operating in all areas. The wealthiest people in Australia, have made their money by speculating in land, and they can afford to pay the tax. I cannot understand what justification there is for relieving them of taxation to the extent of &#163;S0,000 a year. But this Government throws thousands and millions about, as if they were nothing. It is necessary, however, that we should face the economic position as it exists to-day. Things are looking bad, and there isgreat stringency in the money market. It is very difficult to obtain money to carry out any developmental work to day, and while the country is face to face with so serious a position, and we may look forward to a big reduction of revenue for the next year or two, the Government proposes to throw away &#163;80,000 a year by making these revaluations only every three years. What objection could a man have to paying just taxation on his land? If the land increases in value why should he not pay taxation on that value? If he subdivides and sells, he  recives  the whole of the increased value of the land. I am surprised at this amendment, and I do not like to say what is in my mind concerning it. It would appear that the Government is looking about to see how it can amend legislation so as to give some benefit to the already wealthy people. We do not do the same thing for the poorer people of the community. It is impossible .to point .to any legislation passed in this Parliament during the last three years that has benefited the poor people. Parliament is constantly giving back something to the rich, relieving them of direct taxation, and at the same time placing additional  burdens  on the poorer people. The present system is fair, but the system of triennial valuation is not. If land doubles in value in three years, and a man sells it just prior to the time for revaluation, he obtains the benefit of the whole of- the increased value. It is surely a fair thing that the commissioner should have power to deal retrospectively with land valuations. I venture to say that, if we were in the position to get full information, we should find that there are hundreds of cases in which some mistake has been made in valuation. I do not say that they have been wilful mistakes, but mistakes can be made by men sending in their returns, and in this way wrong valuations have been made. Why should not the commissioner have power to deal retrospectively with these cases? </para>

              <para>- But suppose it has been included, and there has been some mistake in regard to the value, perhaps a big mistake. It may <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> be discovered at the time, but comes to light later. Why should the commissioner not have the power, as he has under the Income Tax Act, to go back over a period of three years and rectify the error ? Departments like this cannot be run properly unless extensive powers are given to the commissioner. No system of valuation can be completely satisfactory. Mistakes will inevitably occur even under the most capable officers. If it were possible to get the exact figures, we should probably learn that as much as &#163;1,000,000 has been recovered by the department through the Commissioner being able to go back and make re-valuations. We should base measures of this kind upon what is a fair thing between the taxpayer and the State. We should not make any concession to any one. It is possible that there may be deliberate wrong-doing on the part of individuals, and w.e. should not allow them to escape their obligations. A person may wilfully mislead the Commissioner, and thus have his property undervalued. Under this proposal there would be no way of dealing with the position. </para>

              <para>- I - I think the Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment as placed before the committee by the honorable member for Yarra, and allow the commissioner to investigate these matters from time to time. In connexion with taxation matters, it- is absolutely necessary that the Commissioner should have power at any time to rectify mistakes that might have been made. That provision has been in operation for a long time, and why should we now make an amendment which will cost the Treasury &#163;80,000? There is no justification, so far as I can see, for the Government&#39;s proposal. </para>

            <para>.- I support the clause. I think that it is high time that some limit was placed upon the period during which the Commissioner of Taxation can review returns. The department has limited the period in which the taxpayer may lodge an appeal, and the time of the Commissioner should be limited also. A sense of justice should always be shown by the Government towards its citizens. The time given here is ample for the department to examine the returns properly. It is a serious thing for. citizens to feel in an unsettled condition due to the power of the Commissioner to review their valuation at any time whatsoever. I hope the Government will safeguard the rights of the citizens in that matter to the same degree that it has cared for the rights of the department. I know of a cas.e in point, under the State taxation system in Western Australia, in which a judge of the court gave an interpretation of the Taxation Act&#34;. One of the members of the State Parliament deducted expenditure in connexion with wire netting, which he had bought for vermin-proofing paddocks. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction. It was taken to the Chief Justice of Western Australia for an interpretation of the act, and he upheld the contention of the taxpayer. Now the Commissioner refuses to allow taxpayers any review of their returns, and he absolutely refuses the man who appealed to  the  court any reassessment of his returns beyond the year in which the decision was given. But the act was not altered ; the judge merely interpreted it. That is the &#34;kind of thing that creates a feeling of insecurity and injustice in the minds of citizens. Citizens are apt to say that if the department  is going to play these tricks upon them they will see. what tricks they can play on the department. In the case to which I have referred the taxpayer has again carried the matter to the court, and he has been granted the right to cue the department to &#39;secure justice. I think that this amendment is along the right lines. The citizen wants to know where he stands. The department will not go back for more than three, years in connexion with the taxpayer&#39;s appeal, no matter how just the claim may be. Some sort of reciprocity should exist between the taxpayer and the department. </para>

            <para>.- I support the Leader of the Opposition and the  Deputy  Leader in what they have said regarding the ro- valuation of land on the three-yearly basis. This proposal seems to me to be an underhand method of tax remission. It is a well-known fact - and 1 can give illustrations of it - that where a new railway line is constructed, or a public utility is created, land values immediately rise. Everybody knows that land values increase where a new line is built, sometimes us soon as the line is authorized. Under this proposal, however, the department will not be allowed to re-value the land for taxation purposes even after a great increase in value has taken place, due to the expenditure of public money. What huge values, for instance, are going to be put on to property adjacent to the great Murray Waters Scheme. In that area there has been great expenditure by three States and the Commonwealth combined. Millions of pounds have been, spent, and the value of the land has been increased by nearly &#163;500,000. The electricity scheme, another public utility which has very extensive ramifications, has also added to the value of land. We are providing that the commissioner is to authorize only triennial valuations. Except in very exceptional circumstances he is debarred from making any other revaluation. </para>

              <para>- The position is not analogous, as Canberra is a self-contained area. The one thing that reconciles me to Canberra is the perpetual leasehold _ system which obtains here. I should not  be surprised if this Government, which is steeped in political iniquity, altered that system to freehold. This clause merely provides another method for the remission of taxation. </para>

              <para>- That is a concession purely for the benefit of the rich; the rank and file still have to bear the burden. When the rich man comes along and makes a request to this Government his request is granted. Honorable mem bers opposite are at the beck and call of the rich land-owners of Australia. As stated by the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> this afternoon, if honorable members opposite evince a desire not to support the Ministry, their Leader threatens that he will relinquish his portfolio. The whole party opposite would be &#34; in the soup &#34; if he did, as they have not another leader in sight. This Government should husband every penny of its resources with a view to reducing our huge debt. Instead of that it is throwing away thousands of pounds in all directions. But, unfortunately, were I to spend my last ounce of strength and my last word in opposing this concession, I should create no more impression on the Government than I would on a desk. Honorable members opposite never dare to vote against the Government. They are dumb, driven cattle and always answer to the whip when it is cracked over their heads. The Treasurer stated that this concession will cost &#163;80,000 a year. </para>

              <para>- It is not all right when the Government loses &#163;80,000 a year. We shall give away a very large sum over a number of years, and we are not in a position to afford it. This Government is liberal at the expense of the rank and file. It is continually handing out concessions to the wealthiest people of the land. This is merely one more gift in the long string of gifts given by this Government to the wealthy. If we had the time we could make up a very considerable list of gifts that have been made to the wealthy people of Australia at a time when Australia is distressfully situated. I am not a pessimist, but I object to the distribution of largesse to the wealthy when the burden of it has to be passed on to the already over-burdened rank and file. </para>

        <para class="block">The object of the amendment is to exempt from the appeal to the court all questions which relate to the value of the land. I am agreeable to the appointment  of  a real valuation board; but I shall vote against the proposal  if  the taxpayer is to be given the right to go over its head to the court to obtain a review of his valuation. The Treasurer pointed out in his second-reading speech on the bill that the Government, proposed  to give special  representation to the taxpayers on the board. For example, if the question at issue related to the value of pastoral lands, a person thoroughly experienced in the pastoral industry would represent them; but if it involved the valuation of suburban lands, a person competent to express an opinion on that subject would be appointed. A board so constituted would be valuable; but it would be ridiculous for us to set it up and permit a taxpayer to go over its head to a court to have his valuation reviewed. Judges are trained in law and probably they are impartial in their outlook; but they have  given some wretched decisions in matters of valuation. What amazes me is that the Treasurer is disinclined to accept the amendment. If he will not accept it, I shall vote against the whole clause. I do not see why we should go to the expense of establishing the board unless we make it do the work for which it was appointed. If it could be shown that the judges of the High Court or <inline font-style="italic">the.</inline> Supreme Courts have knowledge of land valuation superior to that of the members of the board, I could understand the objection taken to the amendment. Appeals are made from a lower court to a higher court, because the judges in the court of appeal are supposed to be more highly trained than those presiding over the lower tribunal: but nobody would argue that a judge Could give a better decision than a board of experts on a matter of valuation. We  should be throwing money away if, having appointed a Valuation Board, we did not allow it to act as a final board of appeal. </para>

          <para>. - I hope that the committee will reject the amendment, because it would seriously limit the rights of the taxpayer. At the present time he has an option. He may have his objection dealt with either by the board or by the court. The amendment seeks to limit him, on all questions of valuation, to appeals to the board, and I do not think that it would be proper to do that. The matter of election should be in the hands of the taxpayer up to the time when he actually elects. When he has once made his election, he is committed to the board as the final arbiter on all matters, except on points of law; but it would be wrong to set up a new board to which he might go, and, at the same time, to take from bini his right to go to the court. </para>

          <para>.- In substance I agree with the contention of the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> This is a valuation board against the Commissioner&#39;s valuations. Both the taxpayer and the Commissioner will be bound by the decision of the board if the amendment is carried, and then we shall have finality in taxation instead of lengthy litigation before the courts on matters of valuation that can best be dealt with by well-informed men such as those who ought to be appointed to the board. Judges, whose training has meant years of isolation in public schools and universities, and, finally, at the bar and at the courts, are not the best fitted by experience for the essentially practical work of land valuation. </para>

            <para>- The board should be so constituted that its decisions would be quite as acceptable to the taxpayers as are those of the High Court. Speaking as a land owner, I should prefer the decision of such a hoard. I suggest that we should wipe out  the Valuation Board altogether unless its decisions are to be final and definite so far as land valuation is concerned. I cannot conceive of any High Court or the Supreme Court having  more knowledge of land valuation than this board will have. If a question of law were involved, I should agree with the Treasurer; but on questions affecting the valuation of land I prefer that appeals should be made only to the Valuation Board, and that it should decide the issue once and for all. </para>

          <para>. - The composition of the Valuation Board is at present unknown, but we hope that capable men with a knowledge of laud valuation will be appointed to it, so that little or no objection can be taken to it by the taxpayers. We have sufficient faith in the Government to believe that suitable appointments will be made. It seems to me that if appeals are to be made to the board only, we shall be doing an injustice to the taxpayer. He should certainly be permitted to take his case to either the Valuation Board or the court. While I approved of the admirable speech of the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> this afternoon, I trust that on reflection he will decide that the taxpayer shall have the right of appeal either to the board or the court. </para>

          <para>.- If the taxpayer is to have the right of appeal to the court, what is the use of appointing the Valuation Board to hear appeals? Why leave the door open for appeals to the High Court? The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cameron)</inline> suggested that the taxpayers&#39; rights would be interfered with if they were not permitted to appeal to the court, but I suggest to him that there is in every section of the community a few persons who out of pure cussedness would never be satisfied with the decision of a tribunal such as the Land Valuation Board, and would always appeal from it to the court This board would be composed of a representative of the taxpayers, a representative of the department, and an independent  chairman.  What better board could he established ? Surely it would b  more capable than the court in coming to a sound decision on the values of land. Years ago I gave evidence in a case in which the appellant expended &#163;17,000 in fighting the decision of a tribunal. Appeals to the courts are usually costly, but they are necessary at times on questions of law. The valuation of land is a different thing altogether. I place it in the same category as industrial arbitration. There should be no appeals to the court from the decision of the board. </para>

            <para>- If an incompetent board is appointed, who will be responsible? The land-holders will have the right to recommend certain persons whom they think qualified, and of them the Government will choose one. The Government&#39;s nominee also will be a qualified man. Surely a board of this character will be best able to hold the scales of justice evenly between the two parties. I cannot understand why these openings are provided to enable disgruntled people, who are either wealthy enough to experiment with the law or who have a passion for litigation, to go to the High Court. We should give to the taxpayer every opportunity to get justice, and that opportunity will be afforded  by  the appointment of a competent  board.  The Treasurer has said that if this provision is not agreed to this Parliament will have to answer many complaints. Fromwhom will they come? Is there  any section of the community so anxious about this matter that if the provision proposed by the Treasurer is not agreed to complaints will be made? </para>

          <para>.- The appointment of this board is long overdue, but the Leader of the Opposition has not grasped the reasons that have actuated the Treasurer in proposing it. For many years the taxpayers have laboured under a great disadvantage in that they have no right of appeal from the decisions of the commissioner except to the High Court. A large number of taxpayers interviewed the Treasurer and asked that some tribunal should be provided to adjust any differences that might arise between taxpayers and the commissioner. In asking for the appointment of a board of valuation they did not contemplate that they would be deprived of the right to go to the High Court if they preferred. This matter affects farmers primarily, and unlike some other sections of the community, they are men of reason and sense. An eminent lawyer once said to me, &#34;Don&#39;t go to law, if you can avoid it.&#34; That is the farmer&#39;s view. Litigation, they know, is expensive, and they will not go to law if they can get justice otherwise. I am entirely opposed to the federal land tax. I do not think it should be within the power of this Parliament to legislate on this matter ordinarily. I am aware that a section in the Constitution enables us to impose direct taxation in times of national emergency. The . great war was such an emergency. Rut I hope that before long the Commonwealth Parliament will see fit to evacuate this field of taxation. This board will have duties to perform which, I maintain, will be much better performed by a board containing at least one practical member than is usually the case in High Court proceedings. It will have to thresh out matters which have not been thoroughly threshed out in the past. Complaints are made by farmers that when their assessments are reviewed by the commissioner, and when their cases go to the High Court, none of those who consider the matter have a proper conception of what unimproved value means. . That is not surprising. I have heard some most extraordinary statements made by honorable members on the other side when dealing with the question of unimproved values of land in the outback. One sees that after returned soldiers and others have gone on to virgin Mallee land with an upset value of 5s. an acre, and have - turned it into fruitful farming land by rolling the scrub and burning it off, stump picking, putting up fences, cultivating the ground and putting fertilizers into it, the valuer is apt to assess the value of the land, not what it was, but according to what it is. It is because I believe that this board will save, the deserving taxpayer from unjust taxation, and because I believe that it will, in the long run, save the Commissioner of Taxation himself many headaches, that I support the Government&#39;s proposal, which provides for the establishment of a board of experts, and, at the same time, preserves the inherent rights of the taxpayer to appeal to the highest court in the land . </para>

          <para>.- In order to simplify the work of the board, I think it would be a good thing if this Parliament were to define more clearly what the unimproved value of land really is. The definition set down in the act is -  &#34;&#39;Unimproved value,&#34; in &#39; relation to land, momis  the  capital sum which the feesimple of the land might be expected to realize if offered for sale on such reasonable terms and conditions as a bona fide seller would  require.  assuming that the improvements (if any) thereon or appertaining thereto and made or acquired by the owner or his predecessor in title had not been made. </para>

        <para>If you are selling an hotel or a shop, you :get a certain goodwill value for it. I contend that the man who goes back and develops virgin land, and brings it into a state of productivity, is entitled to some goodwill respecting it. He has helped to create the increased value, and the public is not entitled to take it all. A ;going concern is worth more than one that is closed up. It would be a fair thing if a large percentage were deducted from a valuation for a man&#39;s own right, as having developed the land and increased its value. It is he who, in part at any rate, has created the increased value of the land. The people in the city have done nothing towards it. It is knowledge of this fact that creates a great deal of heartburning, and that leads to many appeals to the court. I would not be satisfied to leave the determination of great issues such as these in the hands of si couple of officials. </para>

          <para>.- In reference to the point of view put forward by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> and backed up by the Leader of the Opposition himself <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> it seems to me that proposed new section 44 k is really for the protection of the taxpayer. 1 do not think we need worry very much about the protection of the Government in this matter, because the Government is very well able to look after itself. Speaking as a practising solicitor, I can say that a taxpayer hesitates a long while before fighting the Government, and it is only on an important principle that he will think of going to the High Court. If the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the assessment he has two choices : he can ask for it to be referred either to the Valuation Board or to the High Court. He need not go to the High Court unless he pleases ; he can have his appeal heard by the Valuation Board, and the decision of that board is final, subject only to an appeal to the High- Court on a question of law. If he desires to go before the board, the procedure is provided for in section 44 l. Section 44 l (7) provides that the commissioner or the taxpayer may appeal from the board&#39;s decision to the High Court if the matter involves a question of law, and then only. </para>

          <para>. - I am surprised that the Government does not accept this amendment. I understood that the bill was introduced to simplify the making of appeals, and that taxpayers, instead of having to go to the law courts might have matters settled by experts on a board created for that special purpose. Now, however, we find that instead of setting up a board with final powers, the lawyers want to give the right of going to the High Court, and, I suppose, of going from there to the Privy Council. There must be some finality-. But it is in keeping with the policy of the Government to create an-, other board. It has not created one so far this week, and I suppose it is time that something was done in that direction. Ministers appear to consider that it is time that another board was created. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has put forward a commonsense proposition, which has my support. We contend that the board appointed for this work should be the final court of appeal. </para>

          <para>. -  I was rather surprised te hear the objection of the Leader of the Opposition to the clause as it stands. It seems to be sufficiently probable that a judge would follow the decision of the Valuation Board unless there were very good reason for doing otherwise. The evidence would have been before the Valuation Board, and the judge would naturally start off with a prejudice in favour of what the board had decided. I disagree with the honorable member&#39;s statement that no judge has any knowledge of land values. I know personally that there are some judges who have a very shrewd knowledge of land values. Had the matter merely been one in which it was possible to clearly separate questions of fact from questions of law, it would have been simple, but there are questions of mixed fact and law. Some years ago, in the High Court, following on a decision by the Supreme Court, it was held that the sale value of a property was not neces sarily the value of the land, but that the sale value could be very greatly increased by the terms that were granted in the conditions of sale. In other words, if land is sold for &#163;10 an acre it may be worth only &#163;8, but the conditions of sale which are granted may add to its capital value. I ask honorable members was that decision of the High Court on a question of law, or on a question of fact? Personally, I incline to the view that it was common sense applied to fact. It is obviously desirable that a court like that should decide the point, whether the sale value is the real value, or whether by altering the conditions of sale it may be made an unreal value. I suggest that the matter is not simple. I have no doubt that there are other cases in which law and fact are almost inextricably involved, and it seems to me to be sound that this matter should rest with an ultimate appeal to the High Court. After all, the taxpayer can form a reasonable opinion as to whether it would be wise for him to go on fighting the case. </para>

            <para>- A man under the suggested amendment of the honorable member for Yarra cannot have his objection treated as an appeal on the question of valuation. I can see no flaw in my argument. If T am wrong, I hope that I shall be corrected by some honorable member. I suggest that these things are not easy to separate, and it is well that there should be a reference to the High Court just as there is to the other board. </para>

          <para>.- The point covered by the amendment seems to me to be perfectly clear. I feel quite sure that the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes)</inline> is mistaken as to the intention of the amendment. It will not prevent an appeal to the High Court on questions other than valuations, but reserves questions involving valuations for the board that is set  up,&#39;  which seems rational. The argument ofthe honorable member for Yarra is that any court of legal jurisdiction is not necessarily the best authority to settle questions of valuation, and may often be the least desirable to go into such matters. Valuation must be left to experts.No doubt the Valuation Board would be selected because of the special knowledge of its members. Possibly the personnel would be a movable one. If the board were considering the valuation of country lands or city lands its personnel could be adjusted accordingly. As provision is made in. the new clause for the making of valuations on those terms, the honorable member for Yarra proposes that in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of this sub-clause, where the taxpayer is satisfied, he may request the Commissioner to treat his appeal as an appeal to the High Court, but only on matters other than those relating to valuation. That appears to be reasonable, and will inflict no hardship on the taxpayer. </para>

        <para>Mr.RODGERS (Wannon)  &#91;10.59&#93;.-  It appears to me that the Government has altogether overlooked the fact that it remodelled the whole provisions of the previous bill, and substituted section  44,  which contains the procedure for appeal. It has clothed and furnished the valuation board with ample authority, provided deliberately for its constitution, and has gone to no end of trouble to perfect the new system - and then it deliberately . gives the taxpayer the right to avoid that board altogether. The giving of this choice will mean thatwe shall get nowhere. I submit that ample machinery is provided to protect the legal rights of both the Commissioner and the land-holder, for either party would be able to appeal to the High Court or the Supreme Court on any question excepting that of valuation. I should be the last to take from a citizen the right of appeal on a question of law to the highest tribunal in the land; but it would be folly for us to set up this . expert valuation board and then permit a taxpayer or the Commissioner to go over its head to a court. The honorable member for Boothby said that the court would probably accept the valuation of the board ; but I point out that the case would go to the court without being submitted to the board. Seeing that the board will have as its  chairman  a gentleman who would give his whole time to the work, and as its other members would be thoroughly competent valuers, we should not permit either party to disregard it. It should be the final authority on all questions of valuation. </para>
