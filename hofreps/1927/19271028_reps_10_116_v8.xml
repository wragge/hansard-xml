                        <para>- On the 8th May, 1924,I asked the Prime Minister whether it was a fact that Australian Insurance Companies were charging excessive premiums by basing the expectation of life in Australia on English tables, and whether the Commonwealth Government would introduce an insurance law to compel life insurance companies to adapt their premiums to the actual mortality statistics of Australia. To this the Prime Minister replied that when the Royal Commission on National Insurance had completed its inquiries, the Government would consider its policy on the whole matter of insurance. As the National Insurance Commission has now completed its inquiry, and in view of the complexities of legislation of this character, and the many allegations of roguery and malpractice in relation to the formation of " wild-cat " insurance companies, will the Government cause legislative action to be expedited by the appointment of a select committee to conduct exhaustive investigations into the whole subject of ordinary insurance? Is it not a fact that the Constitution vests in the Commonwealth Parliament complete power to legislate on this subject? </para>

                        <para>- The subject of life insurance is being investigated by the Attorney-General's Department, with a view to the preparation of suitable legislation. The Government does not consider it necessary that a select committee should be appointed to inquire into the matter. The Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate with respect to insurance generally, including life insurance. </para>

In view of the high and disquieting mortality in the Commonwealth Air Force during the last six years, twelve valuable lives having been lost, will the Minister consider the advisability of altering the methods of instruction and training at Point Cook, and also cause an inquiry to be made concerning the suitability of the types of machines used when these crashes have occurred? </para>

                        <para>- I regret to announce that, as the result of an accident which occurred while carrying out air investigation exercises at Healesville, Victoria, at about 9 a.m. on Thursday 27 th October, Pilot Cadet Clarence Charles Seach was killed. After striking the ground the machine of which he was in charge became ignited and was burnt. The cause of the accident is not, as yet, known. A court of inquiry has been convened by the Air Board to investigate the occurrence, and the members of the court left Melbourne yesterday morning to visit the scene of the accident. The Air Accident Investigation Committee is also conducting an inquiry into the fatality. Cadet Seach was a pupil undergoing instruction at No. 1 Flying Training School, Royal Australian Air Force, Point Cook, and had completed 86 hours flying, 42 hours of which were dual, and 44 hours solo. He had flown 22 hours in a machine of the type in which the accident occurred. He was 24 years of age, was educated at the Sydney High School, and commenced his flying instruction at Point Cook on 2nd May last. I shall be glad if the honorable member will place the second portion of his question on the notice paper, so that the desired information may be obtained. </para>

                        <para>On the 20th October, the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> referred to a telegram he had received stating that sleeper getters connected with the railway construction work in North Australia were employing a large number of aboriginals in getting sleepers. The honorable member asked whether immediate action would be taken with a view to preventing the exploitation of aboriginal labour on Government contracts in the Northern Territory. From inquiries I have made 'it appears that in connexion with the railway construction work in North Australia contracts have been let for the supply of sleepers, and that the contractors are employing a certain number ofaboriginals to assist in securing the sleepers. The employment of aboriginals is controlled by the Aboriginals Ordinance which provides that no person shall employ an aboriginal unless he has been granted a licence to do so by the Protector of Aboriginals of the district in which he is residing. The aboriginal is a free agent who may leave his employment if dissatisfied. The railway construction camp is under the supervision of a Protector of Aboriginals whose duty it is to see that the aborigines are not exploited. With regard to the general question of employing aborigines in connexion with the work of supplying sleepers, it is considered desirable that they should be given remunerative employment so long as they are not defrauded or exploited. In view of the conditions under which aborigines may be employed in North Australia and of the fact that the railway construction camp is under the supervision of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> Protector of Aboriginals, I cannot see how the aborigines employed on the work of getting sleepers can be exploited. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is unfortunate that the Minister has been wrongly advised. In my question I appealed to him to stop the exploitation of aboriginal labour, while white Australians were being compelled to accept relief work, from the administration. Judge Beeby, at great expense to the taxpayers of Australia - and a justifiable expense, I may remark - recently visited the Northern Territory with a view to determining the base rate for different classes of labour in various industries there. After personal experience of the local conditions, and after hearing the evidence submitted, including evidence by the representative of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, he came to the conclusion that the base rate for Darwin should be 2s. 6d. an hour, and, in the locality to which my question referred, 2s.  8½d.  an hour. It is well-known that for many centuries the north of Australia was populated by a dense crowd of aborigines, and that there are still many there. Notwithstanding that fact, no attempt has been made by the aborigines themselves to develop that huge tract of country. Consequently we' took the land over from them, no doubt proceeding on the assumption, not that the people were intended for the land, but that the land was intended for the people, and that, as the natives had not used it, we had a right to do so. </para>

                            <para>- That is true; but their exploitation is not justified, even under present conditions. It is claimed that the Government is serious in its endeavour to establish a white population in the far flung spaces of Northern Australia. What encouragement is the Government giving to settlers to open up that country, when it asks them to compete with what may be accurately described as slave labour? As my argument is developed I shall prove that slave labour exists, and that the Minister has been ill advised. He admitted the existence of the condition of affairs of which I complained in my question. I shall again quote from his reply - </para>

In other words, he is banished. Yet the Minister stated in his reply to my question that the native was a free agent. I say that the native is bound hand and foot. The Minister's definite statement that the natives are not exploited condones the present system, which I shall show is one of wholesale exploitation of native labour. It is regrettable that the Minister or his advisers did not make themselves conversant with the actual conditions. From the regulations under this ordinance I have given a fairly concise idea of the alleged freedom of the natives.

                            <para>- A royal commission which inquired into the administration of the Northern Territory investigated, among other things, the trust fund of the aborigines. Evidence was produced and embodied in the commission's ' findings, showing that in more than one case the Protector of Aborigines had sold tq the natives bicycles at from £10 to £12 each that were not worth £1. The Protector of Aborigines would make a statement to the officer in charge of the trust fund that he had sold a bicycle to a native, who probably had never seen it, and would then, in acknowledgment of the sale, make the native's sign or "x," which would be witnessed by the officer, and the sum of £10 or £12 would be withdrawn from the fund, the native concerned knowing nothing at all about the transaction. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the Government acted on that report, otherwise the natives would have been given some form of protection. In many cases the native is employed at some distance from the centre at which the trust fund is administered, and when he leaves his employment and goes "bush," the money in the trust fund in his name is returned to his employer. The Minister has alleged that the natives are free labourers. Let me draw his attention to Form 5 of the regulations, which reads : - </para>

                        <para>- There is no comparison between them. The native is bound hand and foot under this agreement to carry out certain conditions of labour. If he leaves his employment the money paid into the trust fund in his name is refunded to the employer. How a native can be bound by an agreement and yet be perfectly free is beyond my comprehension. I suggest that a royal commission should be appointed to investigate the conditions of employment of the natives and the methods of exploiting them. Under cover of an ordinance the natives arc in a condition of slavery while white men are deprived of work. Under the cloak of democracy the hand of the black birder is making itself felt. The aboriginal has no protection and is being wilfully exploited to the detriment of the white worker. I submit not that the aboriginal has no right to work, but that he should receive the full award of his labour. No one can suggest that 3s. a week is sufficient remuneration for a man using an axe. Would the Minister be prepared to allow natives to  work  in his electorate at 3s. a week when the award rate is £5 a week? We talk of  upholding the dignity of the Arbitration Court, and yet we are trying to destroy its awards by the exploitation of natives in the Northern Territory. Not only exploitation but slavery is rife there, and the sooner the Minister takes action to prevent it the better it will be for the whole community. If the awards of the Arbitration Court are permitted to be abrogated, there will be open revolution in the territory, and when that occurs I shall go there to give the revolutionists a hand. It is dastardly to place the white community of the territory in such a position. </para>

                            <para>- Standing Order 119, which is applicable to this debate, limits the time for the discussion of the motion to two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House. The Standing Order limiting the time of the speeches of members has been approved by the House, and is so framed as to prevent any individual member from unduly taking up the time of the House. If an extension is required the procedure which has been recently followed is to move for the suspension of the Standing Orders, and that motion can be carried only by an absolute majority of the whole of the members of the House. </para>

                        <para>.- The charge made by the honorable member for Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> is that the natives have been exploited. I have listened carefully for evidence supporting the statement, but have not heard any. The .honorable member has said, not once, but on several occasions, that he represents the natives of the Northern Territory, and intends to safeguard their interests. I resent his imputation that I am Minister for a black Australia, and throw the insult back in his teeth. I am as much concerned as he is in safeguarding the interests of both our aboriginal and our white population. I have heard the honorable member say that he believes that- our black population should receive the treatment to which it is entitled, and I agree with him that the Australian aboriginal should receive the benefits to which he has a right. The honorable member has said that it is impossible to develop Northern Australia without the help of the black man. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member denies any statement that I have attributed to him, I accept his denial. If I have misrepresented anything that he or any one else on the other side of the House, has said, I am prepared to withdraw the statement. I have said that the North of Australia can only be developed, with the assistance of our  Australian natives, and members know in their own hearts that that is the only way in which it can be done. The underlying reason for this motion is not a desire to prevent the exploitation of the aborigines. These charges of exploitation are made by the very people in the north who have been exploiting the Northern Territory for years. The development of the north has been retarded because of the action of men who have endeavoured to run the  country in their own, interests, and to keep everything in their own grasp. If a ship goes to the Northern Territory it cannot he unloaded unless these gentlemen give their consent. </para>

I have heard the honorable member say that somebody in the north is trying to break the awards of the Arbitration Court; but these men of whom I speak have refused to obey those awards. . All that we require of these gentlemen in the north is that they shall obey the law. Let us, on both sides, stick to the law, and obey the awards of the court. The honorable member read the ordinance which lays down the terms under which natives may be employed, but he did not cite the rates of wages to be paid to sleeper-getters. He cited the rates for  rouseabouts  on the stations, and for menial workers. </para>

Those who are objecting to the present procedure have themselves the opportunity to cut sleepers. The Government has had the greatest difficulty in obtaining sleepers, and if the gentlemen whom the honorable member represents are prepared to supply sleepers, we will buy them and use them on the railways. Those who make the charge of exploitation have never done anything to help the natives in the North; but they would prevent, as they have often done in the past, the natives from getting a job of any kind. Certain portions of the native labour agreement have been read. It is provided in that agreement that no person shall employ an aboriginal or half-caste unless he has obtained a licence on the prescribed form. Before granting such a licence, the Protector of Aborigines must be satisfied that the applicant is a fit and proper person to employ aborigines. If the honorable member for the Northern Territory can give me one case in which the Protector of Aborigines in any part of the North has not carried out the provisions of the act, I undertake to see that that officer is removed from his position. The rate of pay which the honorable member mentioned is that provided for natives working on stations and farm lands. I do not say that any particular government was responsible for fixing that rate. It has prevailed under several governments. The honorable gentleman has admitted that these natives make excellent horsemen, and that the North can only be developed by their help. </para>

                        <para>.- I listened very carefully to the remarks of both the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> and the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr).</inline> The latter failed utterly to answer any of the charges which were made. He simulated intense indignation, and stressed the desirability of  uplifting the Australian aborignal.  I have not been to the Northern Territory, but I have had an opportunity to read the telegram that has been received by the honorable member who represents that particular portion of our continent. It contains the specific charge that on the Katherine to Daly Waters railway, the aborigines are being extensively exploited. This is how the wire reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">That charge is clear and definite; but it has not been answered by the Minister. From my reading of the ordinance I should say that a contractor is allowed to pay as low as 5s. a week, from which he may deduct 2s. a week which has to be paid into a trust fund. The Minister has not supplied us with information which would indicate that any other wages are paid. We talk about the necessity to develop the Northern Territory; yet by the action of the Government the whites are being driven out of employment there. There is no desire on our part to deny to the blacks the right to live in the Territory or any other part of Australia; but we shall not civilize them by paying them 5s. a week, and supplying them with a little tobacco. Can it be wondered at that the white residents are dissatisfied, when the Ministry winks its eye at the wilful breaking of Arbitration Court awards ? </para>

                            <para>- It says distinctly that the employment of aborigines at a wage of 5s. a week by contractors for government railway work has received the sanction of the Protector of Aborigines. If the Minister had a satisfactory answer he should have cleared up the matter long ago. He has inferred that the aborigines go into the forests, cut sleepers, and sell them to the government contractors. That is not so. Their relations are embodied in the agreement, under which the contractor pays them 5s. a week for the work which they do. </para>

                            <para>- In accordance with the practice of the Government., the Minister has skilfully evaded the issue by a simulation of anger and indignation. He has carefully drawn a red herring across the trail. This is a most serious matter. A similar problem at one time confronted us in Queensland. The argument was used then that it was necessary to civilize the kanaka and make him a better individual. Boiled down, it was found to be a case of enabling certain individuals to make huge profits. The nation then determined that the kanaka would be better off in his own country. </para>

The policy has been to encourage white people to develop that territory; but when the bone and sinew of the southern states have accepted the invitation to go there, they have found themselves replaced in their employment by the unfortunate blacks, who are paid a wage of os. a week, from which 2s. is deducted.- </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> has endorsed the statement that frequently the 2s. a. week is returned to the employer. There is not the slightest doubt, also, that that assertion was proved to be correct by the royal commission which investigated the matter. The contractor who is unscrupulous enough to employ black labour in preference to white, will embrace every opportunity to compel the aboriginal to break his agreement, and thus swell his own banking account. I cannot understand the Ministry sanctioning it. It is not in the best interests of either the blacks or the unfortunate whites who have migrated to the Northern Territory. Only a plucky man, who has a big heart and a strong physique, will go to those wild places, and endeavour to wring from them a living for his wife and children. "Whatever honorable members opposite may decide to do, the charges that have been levelled at the Government by the honorable member for the Northern Territory will ring throughout Australia, and at no distant date the exploitation of the unfortunate aboriginal may cease, and a better day dawn for him. </para>

I wish that 1 could be clear in my mind that they intend to see that the black man shall be given a fair deal. This debate has furnished another reason for embarking upon the inquiry which I suggested a week or two ago. I congratulate the honorable member for the Northern Territory on the step that he has taken in having brought this matter before the House, because I am not convinced that there are not serious grounds for complaint. The time has arrived to have clearly defined the employment of white and black labour in the Northern Territory. The honorable member alleged that the aborigines had done nothing to develop the lands which they had occupied for so many years. We have been in possession of those lands for nearly 150 years, yet what have we in spite of our superior civilization done towards educating them along those lines? I assert that more has been done to "  syphilize"  than to civilize them. </para>

                            <para>- The Department of Home and Territories on one occasion demanded payment from the officials of the telegraph station for the renewal of the medicine chest, the contents of which were invariably given away to drovers and natives in the district. The honorable member for Ballarat has made certain charges against this Government. I ask him, what did the Fisher Government do  whel]  it took over the control of the Northern Territory? It was not until 1918 that an ordinance governing the conditions of labour was brought in. A great deal has been said with regard to unemployment. I cannot admit that that is the fault of this Government. Much of it has been brought about by the conditions that have  been  forced upon employers by committees representative of the white workers. There is no need to traverse the history of Vestey's Meat Works or to enlarge upon the outbursts of industrial disaffection that have been witnessed there from time to time. The only solution of the white labour problem in the north will be the construction of the north south line. I do not care whether it goes' straight through from Alice Springs to  Darwin  or across from Camooweal. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to be misunderstood. I believe in giving effect to that agreement. I want to see the line continued from Alice Springs. But I repeat what I have said previously, that one railway line is not sufficient to develop half a million square miles of territory. I strongly support the proposed extension of the line across the Barkly Tableland to link up with the Queensland railway system. I understand that the majority of honorable members of this House are in favour of that proposal. The construction of either or both of those lines would solve the problem of white labour in the Northern Territory. The honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> referred to .the wages paid to aborigines engaged in sleeper getting; but it must be remembered that native labour is not as efficient as white labour. The aborigines are provided with food and some clothing; but I admit that its cost is not great. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it is very scanty. As the aborigines in the Northern Territory as in other parts of Australia have a right to work, it is the duty of the Government to see that they are provided with suitable employment rather than that 'they should be allowed to wander about from place to place as they so often do. </para>

                            <para>- I thought I should be in order in referring to the suggested committee which I think would be able to submit valuable recommendations to the Government. The aborigines of the Northern Territory are of fine stature, but with the mind of an infant. It is our duty to educate them. They should also be provided with employment at wages commensurate with the services they render. Hundreds of natives along the overland telegraph line do no work, and are being fed by the Government. These men could be employed on road construction, afforestation and water conservation, which would be. of benefit to the natives and of advantage to the Commonwealth. The honorable member for the Northern Territory is justified in bringing the matter before the House, and in view of the information which has been given, a thorough inquiry should be made in order to ascertain definitely where the trouble lies. I am sure honorable members on this side of the Chamber will support the Opposition in doing a fair thing not only to the aborigines in the Northern Territory; but also to the white persons who are now settled there. </para>

I was impressed with the attitude of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr),</inline> who, in replying to the charges made by the honorable member for the Northern Territory, delivered one of the most vigorous speeches he has ever made in this Chamber. It appeared to me, however, that he was endeavouring to evade the main issue, and when his bluff was called by two very pertinent interjections, he wilted very badly. He did not attempt to reply to many of the charges made by the honorable member for the Northern Territory. The question we have to answer is whether the natives of the Northern Territory are being exploited in the manner suggested. It has been said that those engaged in sleeper getting are paid 5s- a week, 2s. of which is paid into a trust fund until a contract is completed. Even if the work is carried out to the satisfaction of the contractor I am convinced that the poor unfortunate aborigines are not paid the 2s. of their own money which has been retained. The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> said that the aborigines are supplied with food; but he will admit that the quantity is sufficient only to keep them alive, and the quality is inferior. I understand they are also supplied with a few rags to cover their nakedness. Is not the payment of 3s. a week exploitation? </para>

The position is infinitely worse when we realize that the sleepers are being used on government railway contracts. The honorable member for Bass referred to the construction of the North-South railway; but I should like to know if the Government expects that work to be done by aborigines who are to be paid only 3s. a week? The honorable member also referred to the natives as men of fine stature but with a child's mind. That is the material the exploiters are always seeking. </para>

                            <para>- I do not. I do not accuse the honorable member of favouring such a system. The Minister said that natives are engaged on menial work ; but I can conceive of no occupation in the Northern Territory or anywhere else that is not worth more than 3s. a week. The Minister also stated that the Northern Territory can be developed only with the assistance of native labour. That is a point that I am not prepared to affirm or dispute ; but if colored labour is essential to its development, the natives should be permitted to work under the conditions enjoyed by white men. </para>

Inefficient or slow workers are provided for in our Arbitration Court awards, .and the Government should see that these men are paid a reasonable rate even if their work is not up to standard of that of the white man.

                            <para>- That is another matter. This is a national work, as the security of Australia depends largely upon the extent to which the Northern Territory is settled. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to develop the Northern Territory, but it should not depend upon the assistance of aborigines who are paid only 3s. a week, The Minister referred to the industrial conditions at Darwin and to the demands made by the workers ' there. We have  heard a good deal of those who are doing the pioneering work; but to me that is all humbug. Those who have invested money in the Northern Territory, and who are employing labour, have done so with the sole intention of making profits, and not with the idea of developing the country. If the white workers there are sufficiently well organized to demand wages and conditions which the employers think unreasonable, the employers should get out of the Territory. Some pastoralists in the Northern Territory who are holding huge tracts of country say that they cannot carry on profitably because of the ruling labour conditions. That is a stupid argument, because they are not forced to remain. If they cannot pay their workmen decent wages, the country is better without them. </para>

                            <para>- I trust that one result of this debate will be that the people of Australia will indicate, in an unmistakable way, their desire to have these objectionable conditions remedied. Something has been said about the attitude of former Commonwealth Labour Governments on this matter, but I point out that . until the Northern Territory had direct representation in this Parliament, governments, as well as honorable members generally, had very little information about the conditions that existed there. Since the honorable member for the Northern Territory has been a member of this Parliament he has been able on many occasions to inform us of evils there that required remedies, and I trust that he will continue to bring under our notice direct information of conditions which should not be allowed to prevail. Honorable members should consider this matter in the spirit in which it has been introduced. I trust that we shall do all in our power to treat our aborigines generously as well as justly. We should do so, for the good name of our country. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister for Home and Territories altogether failed to make an effective reply to the charges of the honorable member for the Northern Territory. He started to speak at an express rate, and. I do not know for how long he would have maintained the speed if the honorable member for Macquarie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Manning)</inline> had not made an injudicious remark. A fact that emerges quite clearly from this discussion is that government by ordinance is quite unsatisfactory. The illustration of the bicycle transaction which the honorable member for the Northern Territory gave is proof positive on that point. The more closely settled our outback areas become the more clearly are we able to observe the failure of control by ordinance. I was in New Guinea recently, and. had brought home to me there how unsatisfactory some of our existing  administrative methods are.  I had the opportunity of perusing the report of a conference that was held there some time ago. Although I understood that the Minister for Home and Territories would table a copy of the report as soon as it was available, I took the precaution to make a few extracts from it. I propose to quote these, for they concern cases which may well be compared with those which the honorable member for the Northern Territory has mentioned to-day, though his deal with Australian aborigines, while mine concern the natives of </para>

The honorable member for the Northern Territory made extensive references to the wages and working conditions of our aborigines and said that the 2s. a week which was placed in a fund to be used for their benefit was often estreated. I can quite understand that unscrupulous employers would not hesitate to use every means in their power to regain possession of this money. They could easily make some trumpery charge against the aborigine concerned and so prevent him from receiving the money and I have no doubt, in such a case, where it would go. Something of the same kind of thing occurs in New Guinea as the following extract from the report from which I have already quoted will show : - </para>

                        <para>It is common property in Rabaul that when labourers are paid off, illegal means of recruiting are employed to induce them to resign. The boy is taken to a room without witnesses and the third degree is put upon him day after day to make new paper. Even after a boy has been at work many years these practices are more often than not successful. Other boys are paid off and deliberately induced to spend all their money before the departure of the boat conveying them home, with the object of forcing them to make new paper. Another method employed, particularly during the military and German administration, was to employ women as an incentive to recruiting. A man dying, his widow, is more often than not offered to a boy as an inducement to his recruiting; in fact. I personally know that women recruiters carry  unmarried  girls about with them when recruiting, "and the boys were offered a night with these girls in lieu of hand money. These unions with widows of deceased labourers resulted in those marriages of convenience which I now trust have been suppressed. In one case of such a marriage a woman on return to her village in Namatanai was stoned to death as she had committed tribal incest. </para>

In all the circumstances it is not creditable to the Minister for Home and  Terriories  that he should try to ride the high horse. The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> who has been in Central Australia several times, and knows very well the conditions under which the blacks there have to live, showed quite clearly that he thought there was ground for the charges which have been made this morning. He, unlike the Minister, does not regard the accusations as a mere exhibition of ill temper. The Minister told us that it is the custom for aborigines to go out sleeper-getting on their own account and afterwards sell the sleepers to the contractors; but it must be apparent to honorable members that sleeper-getting requires some equipment. The telegram upon which the honorable member for the . Northern Territory has based his charges came from sleeper-getters who employ aborigines. The Minister for Works and Railways shakes his head, but I am sure that there was some good reason for sending the telegram. When the Minister for Home and Territories replied to a question on this matter this morning he said: - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is quite right. Instead of telling us that his inquiries showed that contracts had been let and that the contractors are employing aborigines, the Minister should have given the details sought by the honorable member for the Northern Territory. He has told us that natives go out into the bush on their own to bring in the sleepers and sell them, and that some aborigines are being employed by sleeper-getters. I should like to know under what ordinance they are employed, the wages they receive and the hours they work. Under one ordinance the employers of aborigines must set aside a portion of ground as a housing area for them and provide shelters for them. I should like to know what arrangements are made by the sleeper contractors to house their aboriginal employees. </para>

                            <para>- What I meant to say was that it is possible that natives go out and collect sleepers to sell to some of the sleeper-getters. This morning I had not had sufficient intimation that this motion was to be moved, but I did my best to secure whatever material was available in the Home and Territories Department. The reply I furnished to the honorable member for the Northern Territory was put together from information obtained from North Australia, but from further information which has come to hand I am now in a position to state that there are no sleeper-getters in the Northern Territory, and that steel, and not wooden, sleepers are used in the construction of the new railway. </para>

                            <para>- Wooden sleepers are still being cut and used for replacements, and whether they are used on the new section or on the existing line does not matter. I defy the Minister for Home and Territories or Minister for Works and Railways to deny that there are no contracts in existence for the getting of sleepers for railway requirements in the Northern Territory. To say that wooden sleepers are not being used for new construction is mere camouflage. Already the Minister in his reply to me has admitted that contracts have been let for the supply of these sleepers and that natives are working for the contractors. Why cannot he  frankly  admit what he knows perfectly well, that, although wooden sleepers are, perhaps, not required for the building of the new section between Daly Waters and Katherine, they are still being used for maintenance purposes between Katherine and Darwin ? </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>Is it a fact, that owing to the failure of the central administration of the War Service Homes Commission to authorize the employment of additional staff, the employees of the New South Wales branch are being overworked? In addition to much overtime, are the employees compelled to take work home to enable them to overtake arrears, for which they receive no remuneration ? Has the Commonwealth Medical Officer for New South South Wales made a report to the Chief Medical Officer of the Commonwealth on these speeding-up methods, directing attention to several break-downs which are attributed to this cause? Will the Minister for Works and Railways ask the Public Service Board to conduct an inquiry into the working conditions of this department? </para>

                    <para class="block">I now have pleasure in furnishing the following replies to the questions: - </para>

                        <item label="1.">
                            <para>No. There was a very large increase of applications in May, June, July, August, and September, and requests from applicants for additional advances following the 1!&gt;27 amendment of the War Service Homes Act. This was only a temporary phase, and after inquiries, it was decided that extra staff was not necessary. The applications are being dealt with in the order of priority, and no officer is required to complete more than a fair day's work, the hours of duty being from 9 a.m. to 4.45 p.m., with one hour for lunch, and 9 a.m. until noon on Saturdays. </para>
                        </item>
                    <para>Having regard to the hours of duty in business houses and industries generally, it is not considered that those in the commission are unduly long. </para>
                        <item label="2.">
                            <para>During the year 49 officers worked an average of 44 hours overtime each - an average per officer of 44 hours per month. Officers receiving over £450 per annum are not entitled to overtime. No officer has been asked to take work home. It lias been found that several officers have acted in this way, the reason being that the matters so dealt with were somewhat difficult, and they preferred to handle them in the quietude of their homes. This has only happened in the case of several senior officers. </para>
                        </item>
                        <item label="3.">
                            <para>Not that I am aware of. I should also say that speeding-up methods have not been adopted in the New South Wales branch, and this may be gauged from the fact that the administrative costs of the New South Wales branch are greater in proportion than those of the Queensland branch. Five officers have been examined by the Commonwealth Medical Officer at the request of the commission. In one case the illness was neurasthenia, and before its onset the officer stated that he had not properly recovered from influenza and was excessively worried over certain private matters. In two cases the illness was debility; in another furunculosis, and in the other hyperpriesis and nerve fatigue. It is not considered that official duties were responsible for these illnesses. </para>
                        </item>
                        <item label="4.">
                            <para>No. The officers employed are granted eighteen days' recreation leave each year and only in- seven cases will 1927 leave not be taken this year. The leave in these latter instances should be disposed of early in 192S. </para>

The charges in respect to motor registration in the Federal Capital Territory are on a similar basis to those in force in New South Wales, but are  £1  per vehicle less. It is not considered that " area " affords a satisfactory basis of comparison. It is considered that motorists in the Federal Capital Territory enjoy facilities equal to those in the various States, and that they, therefore, suffer no hardship which would justify making any further reduction in fees, particularly as the number of motorists in the Territory is considerably less than in any State. The cost of providing services in the Federal Capital Territory is at least as great as in the States, and the 1 04ds more than favorably compare with those in many parts of Australia where motorists are required to pay higher fees. </para>

Eastlake is definitely a suburban shopping centre only, and arrangements made for banking in the past were of a temporary nature pending the opening of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Civic Centre. It is realized that the convenience of shopkeepers and residents at Eastlake should be met in this regard, and a conference of banking representatives was recently held with the object of meeting this demand by the establishment of a limited number of agencies which would serve all banks desiring these facilities at Eastlake. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to make a short statement by way of personal explanation. On Wednesday evening, smarting under' a rather severe criticism published in one of the Sydney newspapers, I had occasion to offer certain remarks by way of protest. These have been incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I have no wish to retract any of them. I still say that to the best of my knowledge and belief my statements were correct, and, therefore, I should have no hesitation in repeating them. Last evening, however, I received a letter, written on behalf of a number of the reporters in the press gallery, somewhat in the form of a challenge, inviting me to furnish the names of the persons who supplied me with the information on which my statements were based. I do not intend to accept that challenge, because I cannot see that any good purpose would be served by doing so. I have every respect for the occupants of the press gallery. My attack was directed to one particular quarter, and I have no desire to continue that attack. As far as I can learn, the Sydney newspapers up to r the present have been silent regarding the incident, and so far as I am concerned it may be considered closed. But it would be wrong on my part to divulge the names of the persons who gave me my information. I can only leave the matter to honorable members to say what they would have done in similar circumstances. I can vouch for the accuracy of the information, and I hope that the young man who wrote the article complained of will profit by my protest, which was designed to protect not only myself but other honorable members. It was not intended as a personal attack, and if he takes it in the right spirit it will do him good. </para>

                        <para>.- The subject-matter of this bill has already been considered by the House, and the measure should receive the approval of honorable members generally. In 1925 the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> and the then Premier of South Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gunn),</inline> caine to an agreement, afterwards termed the Bruce-Gunn agreement, which provided for the construction of a railway known as the north-south line, to connect Port Augusta and Alice Springs- It also provided for the project now before the House. The Railways  Acceptance Bill passed through this chamber with very little discussion. After the Minister for Works and Railways had made his second-reading speech, I followed him, and the matter was further debated by the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates),</inline> the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. Green),</inline> the honorable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parsons),</inline> and the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duncan-Hughes).</inline> The second reading was carried on the voices, and the bill went through the committee stage without discussion, the third reading being agreed to immediately. Thus the project received the unanimous support of the House. Since it accepted the agreement in the first instance, one can only assume that it is now prepared to carry it out. Therefore, the measure should receive a speedy passage. During the previous discussion at least one honorable member mentioned that it might be necessary to inquire into the third-rail project. No third-rail section of considerable length is to be found in any part of Australia. The agreement set out where the line was to start and end, and other matters relating to the productivity of the country to be served were agreed upon. It was then necessary to refer the proposal to the Public Works Committee, of which I have the honour to be a member. The committee pays careful attention to all matters placed before it; but because of the technical problems that arose in this particular case, special attention was given to it. When the committee was completing its report, I voted for an amendment submitted by the honorable member for Swan, who was then a member of the committeeThat amendment provided that the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge from Salisbury to Red Hill should be continued as far as Port Pirie, a break of gauge station established there and the 4 ft. 8^ in. gauge constructed from that point to Port Augusta. At that time I considered that it would be possible to do something to bring about the unification of the gauges. When this railway project was being investigated by the Public Works Committee, the branch lines from Hamley Bridge to Balaklava and thence to Port Wakefield, and from Brinkworth to Snowtown and thence to Wallaroo were of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. Those lines have now been converted to the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge. When the honorable member for Swan . framed his amendment his idea, no doubt, was to open negotiations with the South Australian Government with a view to converting the railway from Red Hill to Port Pirie and the two branch lines to the 4 ft. <inline font-style="italic">Si</inline> in. gauge. By that means the railways on the western side of South Australia would have been of uniform gauge. It is, however, too late to open up negotiations with a view to doing away with the third-rail project, because the South Australian railways which were of the 3 ft. 6^-in. gauge have  been  converted to the 5 ft. 3-in. gauge, and, if the 4 ft.  8½-in.  gauge went through from Salisbury to Red Hill alone it would mean a break of gauge at every junction on the Red Hill to Port Augusta line. That, of course, would not be in the interests of South Australia. I consider that the South Australian Government has not been fair to the Commonwealth Government so far as the conversion of gauges is concerned. In 1921 the Prime Minister and State Premiers conferred respecting the unification of our railway gauges. The following resolution was arrived at - </para>

                    <para class="block">That further conference* was held in Melbourne, but no decision was arrived at. South Australia, when considering the conversion of a section of its railways from 3 ft. 6 in. to 5 ft. 3 in., should have adopted the 4 ft. 8-J-in. gauge, and then there would have been no necessity for a third rail as is proposed under the bill. I voted for the amendment moved by the honorable member for Swan, not because I feared that there would be any element of danger in the adoption of the third rail principle. I do not think that any member of the Public Works Committee who took part in the inquiry considered the third rail to be unsafe. The evidence in favour of the third rail overweighed that in opposition to it. I shall refrain from quoting the evidence of Commonwealth officials, because it may be said that their opinions  would be biased. I shall quote first the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb,</inline> the Chief Railways Commissioner of South Australia. </para>

                        <para>With 80 lb. rails on this section we get an average speed of 26 miles an hour. This speed could be increased with larger locomotives. There would be no necessity to limit the speed on the third rail. There are 21 station yards, and in addition three passenger, stopping places between Adelaide and Red Hill. The third rail would offer no complications in station yards. When we first discussed the third-rail proposal between Red Hill and Adelaide, we thought it might be necessary, in order to avoid complications, to run around certain stations, but we are now in a position to say positively that there will be no additional risk and no mechanical difficulties by running through the stations. ... In Colorado we had a large mileage of two mixed gauges, and over a small mileage we worked even three gauges on one set of sleepers, namely, 2 ft., 3 ft., and 4 ft. <inline font-style="italic">Si</inline> in. lines. In some cases we had three gauges in station yards. They were all worked without additional risk, but necessarily they were more expensive to maintain. I regard the third rail as an expedient to meet such problems as we have in Australia, but every case should be considered on its merits. I should have no hesitation in recommending the third rail in certain circumstances, because I know from experience that it does not mean additional risk. </para>

                        <para>The additional cost of maintenance of a mixed gauge line would not be great. With the third rail in operation there would be no difficulty with the interlocking gear, or any additional risk of derailment. Whether a third rail is used or not, it is always easy to derail a train deliberately. There is nothing in connexion with the third rail which would tend to cause more derailments. There is no more danger of sand drift with a third rail than there is now where the guard rail' is used. We have many miles of guard rail in South Australia, and sometimes it is within two inches of main rail. We have experienced no special trouble from sand drifts because of the existence of the guard rail. It is all a matter maintenance. We have had two or three nasty smashes because of debris falling off trains and causing derailments. I have known of a bag of chaff causing a derailment. That risk would not be greater with a third rail. In my opinion the third rail would neither increase nor decrease the danger of derailment. At any time material falling from a truck constitutes a risk. I am satisfied that the risk is not increased by the third rail. </para>

                        <para>In the Argentine Republic I had actual experience from .1912 to 1918 of the operation &lt;:&gt;f a mixed-gauge system, over a section which handled very heavy freight and passenger traffic. I was the supervising engineer for the  Transandine  railway, which was constructed on the metre gauge. As each section was completed it was let to the Great Western Railways Company which operated it. The Great Western Company's main system was constructed on the 5 ft. 0 in. gauge. The mixed gauge section was about 4| miles in length, and had a ruling grade of 1 in 50: the lowest curve was of 9 chains radius, and the maximum speed whs about 35 miles an hour. During the time the third rail was under my observation no accident occurred, and no trouble was experienced in operating the system- The points for the 3 ft. 0" in. and the 5 ft. 0 in. lines were operated by one action. I can conceive that there would have been greater danger from obstacles lodging on the line if a 4 ft. <inline font-style="italic">Si</inline> in. gauge were built within the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge, but I would not be afraid to install such a device.

                            was interlocking engineer in the New South Wales Railway Department from 189.1 to 1913, and I held a similar position in South Australia from .1882 to the end of 1890. I have had experience of every railway in England, particularly the Great Western line, as well as experience on the continent of Europe, and in other parts of the world. For 37 years that is from 1852 in 1889, a third rail was in operation on the Great Western line, over which trains ran at a speed that will never be attained in this country, namely, from (iO to SO miles an hour. I suppose that the heaviest rail in the early days would be about 70 lb., although bitterly a heavier rail has been employed. The gauges that were mixed were 7 ft. 0* in. and 4 "ft.

                        had very definite ideas on the subject of railway points and crossings, and his evidence should be sufficient to answer anybody who might criticize the construction of this railway from the point of view of safety and efficiency. The evidence that has been given was sworn testimony, and some of the witnesses had no interest in the matter other than to do their best in the interests of the people of ' Australia. When this inquiry was taking place, some witnesses expressed themselves as being afraid that the proposed third rail system would prove dangerous. One witness, in the very early stages of our inquiry, said that it would not be possible to lay this track at all. Therefore, the peculiar position arose that we were inquiring into the construction of a railway that one engineer said it was not possible to construct. The argument used by him was that the space between the 4 ft.
                        <inline font-style="italic">8i</inline>
                        in. rail and the 5 ft. 3 in. rail 'would not be sufficient to allow of the dog spikes being driven in to fasten down the rail. Later, however, when we were taking evidence in Adelaide, we had a practical demonstration of the laying of such a line. New sleepers, new rails and new dogs were used for the construction of one length of line, and there was no difficulty at all in driving the dog spikes.. The whole objection was a. bogey placed before the committee with the idea of prejudicing them in their finding. It was also stated that if the railway was built to the suggested gauge, it would not be possible to place the bolts through the rails alternately - that is, one bolt from one direction and another bolt from the opposite direction. A man who is supposed to be a very eminent engineer gave that as one of his reasons why the line should not be constructed. Since that time I have taken notice of the methods of railway construction, and I have found that only now arid again are the bolts put through from opposite directions, as stated by this engineer. It is not by any means the practice. He said it was necessary to place the bolts through the rails in this way because otherwise the flange of the wheels might cut all the nuts off. and allow the rails to spread. The obvious remedy, of course, would be to place all the bolts through the other way, and then none of the nuts would be cut off. When the honorable the Minister was introducing this bill, he pointed out the very many advantages that would accrue from the building of this line, but as there seems to be some opposition to the proposal at the present time, I shall enumerate some of the benefits as pointed out to the commission -

Another reason given to the commission was that it would in crease the revenue of the trans-Australian railway by approximately £35,000, due to the stimulation of through traffic. World tourists, who have travelled over the trans-Australian railway, always speak  eulogistically  of the journey between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. Only recently I did the trip myself, and coming back, I met a much-travelled gentleman with whom I discussed the subject of railway facilities. I said that I considered the trans-Australian train was the best in the Commonwealth. He replied that it was not only the best in the Commonwealth, but was, in hisopinion, the best in the world. I should also like to mention something that happened on the same trip. We arrived at Port Augusta on Sunday morning. A bus runs from Port Augusta to Adelaide every morning, and, notwithstanding the fact that the passengers had through tickets from Perth to Adelaide, some of them got off at Port Augusta, and went by bus to Adelaide. </para>

                            <para>- It is no loss to the railway, because the passengers have bought tickets through to Adelaide, but it is a poor advertisement for our railways. While passengers are waiting at Port Augusta for transhipment, it would be possible, during those two and a half hours, to get right down past Red Hill. The construction of this line would " boost " the railway to such an extent that the revenue would increase greatly, because of the advertisement given to the system, and the increased facilities afforded to the public. Those who have advocated the construction of this line have never claimed that it would lead to the development of the country through which it would pass. They have based their advocacy on other grounds. But I maintain that it will have an effect upon the development of the country which it will traverse.

One cannot escape the conclusion that he has been misreported by the press.  His  sworn evidence is the best guide that we could have in coming to a decision on this matter.

                        <para>The distance from Red Hill to Wallaroo is 56 miles, and from Red Hill to Port Pirie it is 28 miles. The line would take the wheat from at least half the distance between Port Pirie and Wallaroo, to Port Pirie as the shipping port. Last year we reaped 23,000 bags at Lake' View. All this wheat would naturally go to Port Pirie. I believe that the higher price for wheat which would then be realized at Port Pirie would result in certain properties, which are now carrying sheep, being turned over for wheat production. Some of the land in my district is not being utilized to its fullest capacity, and I feel sure that country which carries only a sheep or a little more to the acre, and which is capable of producing up to 35 bushels to the acre, will eventually be put to better use. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is well known that the nearer you are to a. port the better is the price you obtain for your produce. In addition to that advantage, the extra facilities will- induce settlers to plant wheat instead of to graze sheep, and a greater number of people will be settled on the land. Giving evidence at Port Pirie a representative of shipping interests said that wheat was being carted to Port Pirie from Wandearah, a distance in some instances of 22 miles; but with the construction of the line the longest cartage for farmers there would be only about 12 miles, and the average about 7 miles, assuming that sidings were placed in the most convenient places. Honorable members can appreciate the fact that if farmers are faced with the necessity to cart wheat up to a distance of 22 miles, they will engage iri" grazing to a much greater extent. The Wandearah district, which is between Red Hill and Port Pirie, does not produce only a few bags of wheat; it is one of the best wheat-growing centres iu South Australia.

                            <para>- Yes. It is one of the best districts in South Australia. Some honorable members may ask what the production is likely to be this year. Unfortunately, it has suffered from drought conditions, but it is not alone in that respect. This will be only the second failure that has been experienced by the district. That takes us as far as Port Pirie, up to which the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge will be constructed. On the other side of Port Pirie, where the gauge will be 4 ft. 8$ in., the country for the first 26 to 30 miles consists of good wheat-growing land. The portion of the country to be served by the proposed railway is in the Hundred of Baroota. I am fully conversant with the country along the proposed route, as I live in the locality, and have been over it on many occasions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Hillam,  who lives 18 miles north of Port Germein, which is 18 miles by road from Port Pirie, and 26 miles by rail, in giving evidence before the Public "Works Committee said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the evidence of an experienced farmer who lives in the district, and which disproves the suggestion that the proposed route is through very poor country. The position is the reverse, as the line will serve country capable of heavy production. The construction of the railway will also expedite transport over the eastwest line, and will provide facilities which are badly needed in the immediate locality. It has been suggested recently that a technical difficulty is likely to prevent the construction of the line. If that is the case it is not due to the terms of the agreement entered into between the Premier of South Australia and the Prime Minister. The clause in the schedule of the Railway Agreement Act of 1926 relating to the construction of this line reads - <inline font-style="italic">{d)</inline> In approving and consenting to the said railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill the State may if it thinks fit provide that such approval and consent shall lapse and be of no effect if the construction of that railway is not commenced by the Commonwealth within a period to be specified by the Premier of the State not being less than three years from the date of such approval and consent. </para>
                    <para class="block">If construction is started within three years. South Australia can raise no objection. If there is any technical difficulty it is not due to the terms of the agreement to which 1 have referred, and which the South Australian Parliament ratified shortly after it had been adopted by this Parliament. The proposed route . is, in my opinion, not altogether the best that could be obtained. I have always been of the opinion that on approaching Port Pirie the railway should extend a little to  the westward, and thus avoid dividing many agricultural farms in the locality. I do not stress the point to the extent of holding up the bill now, but merely mention it, so that the Minister may give the matter consideration.

Under an agreement, which has since lapsed, that work should have been undertaken on the completion of the East- West railway. Nothing, however, has been done, and the passengers travelling from Perth to the East, and vice versa, incur considerable inconvenience owing to the break of gauge at Kalgoorlie.

                            <para>- Yes; but such accommodation is not provided between Adelaide and Melbourne. There should not be any hostility between the Commonwealth and State railway authorities in this matter. The conditions throughout such a long journey should be uniform. I trust the Minister for Works and Railways will negotiate with the Victorian * Railways Commissioners with a view to second class sleeping accommodation being provided between Adelaide and Melbourne. This convenience is provided on the Commonwealth railways between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta, but not between Quorn and Oodnadatta. From time to time money is voted for ballasting the East-West line, and each year a. small section is completed; but. as the line will eventually be ballasted for its full length, it seems false economy to do the work in sections. When the work is completed trains will be able to travel faster, and with the added facilities provided in this bill it may then be necessary to run a train each day instead of three trains a week as at present. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; that is another important phase of the question, and one which I have not time to deal with now. As there are large numbers of unemployed in South Australia at present - the position having become aggravated owing to a dearth of overseas shipping - I ask the Minister if construction work on the proposed railway cannot be commenced at Port Augusta and Red Hill simultaneously. Immediate attention should be given to the laying of a third rail from Adelaide to Bed Hill, as provided for in this bill, and that work could be started very soon.  The labour  position in South Australia is at present very acute, and if any relief can be given in the direction suggested a large number of deserving men in South Australia will benefit. I trust this proposal will be discussed on its merits, and that the Minister will give serious consideration to the points I have raised. </para>

Webb was not asked by the South Australian Labour Government to report upon the proposal which has now become the subject of an agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments.

I do not know whether an instance of this kind has ever before occurred in South Australia or elsewhere. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>
