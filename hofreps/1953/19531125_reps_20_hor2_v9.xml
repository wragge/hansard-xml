                        <para>- My question to the Treasurer concerns a matter about which I have received many representations. On the coins recently struck by this Government there has been an omission, for the first time in the history of Australia, of a vital portion of Her Majesty's title, that is, " Defender of the Faith ". When the Prime Minister was asked a question about this matter some time ago by a Government supporter, the right honorable gentleman stated that there was no physical room on the coins for this title. Will the Treasurer say whether it is not a fact that for ' the first time in our history the words " By the Grace of God " have been engraved in full on our coins for the very purpose of preventing the words " Defender of the Faith " from being inserted in the usual way? If that is not so, will the Government, in accordance with a recent request by a meeting of bishops of the Church of England, ensure that that title, which is part of the Royal style and titles authorized by this Parliament, shall be restored? </para>

                    <para>- The matter raised bv the honorable member is not new. From time to time there have been proposals that the War Service Homes Act should be applied to imperial ex-servicemen. The position is that we have so many of our own ex-servicemen still waiting for homes that we consider our first responsibility is to them rather than- to men. from other countries. Moreover, I understand that the United Kingdom has not made any attempt to extend reciprocity. I shall be pleased to examine the honorable member's proposal having regard to its suggestion in relation to permanence of residence. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister for the Interior a question about a report that the Queensland Government has appropriated this year from its loan funds a sum in excess of £800,000 for land settlement of ex-servicemen. That report is in conflict with statements that have been made by the Minister for Public Lands and by the Deputy Premier of Queensland that land settlement of ex-servicemen in that State would be discontinued. It is also in conflict with a report that the Queensland Department of Public Lands was of the opinion that land settlement of ex-servicemen was merely a passing phase and that it would be discontinued. Can the Minister inform the House whether land settlement of ex-servicemen will be continued in Queensland? If it is to be discontinued, can the Minister indicate the manner in which the Queensland Government will expend that sum of approximately £800,000 plus the unexpended surplus from last year? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot tell the honorable member the position in Queensland. As I stated last week, the last .official communication that the Australian Government received from the Premier of Queensland was to the effect , that £855,000 had been allocated this year  from loan funds for land settlement of , ex-servicemen. As recently as last Friday night, the Australian Broadcasting Com- , mission's 7 p.m. news bulletin in Brisbane ; contained a statement which purported; to have been made by the Queensland Minister for Public Lands, Mr. Foley, to the effect that the Wandoan-Taroom area was to be thrown open early next year for settlement under the Lands Act. In other words, the broadcast indicated that civilians would be able to apply for .the; Wandoan lands. That area has always been regarded as an area in which ex-servicemen would be settled. Thirty-six ex-servicemen have been settled in that area. I understand that the whole area has been developed with money that was  obtained from the Australian Loan Council for the purpose of land settlement of ex-servicemen. The statement attributed to Mr. Foley seems to be in conflict with the facts that were contained in . a letter that was written hy the Queensland Premier under date the 30th October. The Queensland Premier said that settlement of ex-servicemen in Queensland would he continued and that £S55,000 had been allocated for that purpose. Mr. Foley did say that ex-servicemen would be given preference in the allocation of those blocks in the Wandoan-Taroom area provided they had the finance and other qualifications. It is not necessary under the Commonwealth scheme for an ex-serviceman to have finance. As I said last week, the statements seems to mean that the lands are to be thrown open for persons other than those who are eligible under the scheme for the land settlement of ex-servicemen. Having regard to the Premier's letter, the statements by the Minister for Lands to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the previous decision of the Cabinet on the 27th July, find the statement to the press by the Minister for Lands early in September that war service land settlement is to be discontinued, I do not know the true situation in Queensland. </para>

If the right honorable gentleman was present on the occasion of the visit of the deputation, will he tell the House the nature of the requests made and indicate the nature of the reply given? Was he able to offer any hope to the representatives of local governing bodies of a new deal in the distribution of the petrol tax and of Commonwealth revenues, to enable the construction and maintenance of roads in outback areas which are necessary for development and defence? If the right honorable gentleman was not present, will he take an early opportunity to assure the Australian Council of Local Government Associations, which is to meet within a few days, that the Government will deal sympathetically with local governing authorities and review the relations between them and the Commonwealth? </para>

                        <para>- I was present when a deputation, representative of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations, met the Prime Minister. The representatives of that body were told, as they have always been told, that their authorities are State instrumentalities and, accordingly, that their representations should first have been made to the State governments which would then discuss them with the Australian Government on a State to Commonwealth basis. They were told, in no uncertain way, that the allocation of petrol tax collections for road purposes is a matter for the States themselves because the States receive their allocations as the result of an agreement entered into between the State governments and the Australian Government. </para>

                        <para>- There was what might be termed a leakage of information from the War Service Homes Division. It had nothing whatever to do with secrecy in regard to the division but it involved a flagrant breach of Public Service departmental procedure. In the course of a debate in this House an honorable member read a letter which had passed between the Director of War Service Homes and the Deputy Directors in the States. That, of course, is traditionally not done. </para>

                            <para>- The question of whether or not it was damaging does not arise. It involved a flagrant breach of Public Service procedure and was regarded as a dishonest act by the public servant concerned who made available confidential correspondence belonging to the division to a person who was unauthorized to receive it and by the member who used the letter in this House. As the War Service Homes Division handles approximately £30,000,000 of the taxpayers' money every year, we have to be particularly careful in matters that touch the honesty of its staff. Therefore, the investigation officers were asked to institute inquiries. In the process of normal routine procedure the person to whom the honorable member for Forrest has referred was questioned. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. The Minister said that it was a dishonest act on the part of the public servant who obtained this letter and also on the part of the honorable member who used it. Well, I used it. When the letter came into my possession, I had no idea of the means or the manner by which the individual who gave it to me had obtained it. For all I knew, the letter might have been handed to him quite honestly and directly by the director himself, or by a  deputy  director, or by any other authorized officer. I strongly object to the application of the term " dishonest act " to my use of the letter in this House. I used it, in a damaging way to the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to order. The Minister said, before any honorable member was named, that the use of a certain letter by an honorable member was a dishonest action. The Chair has authenticated the correctness of my words. Now, the honorable member for Lalor says that the letter was used by him perfectly innocently. I submit that you are bound to direct the Minister to withdraw the statement to which the honorable member for Werriwa has objected. </para>

                            <para>- No one disputes the correctness of your statement, Mr. Speaker, as far as it goes. The word " dishonest " was used in reference to an honor able member, and that is disorderly. I submit that as the word has been used, it should be withdrawn. I ask you to rule that the remark made by the Minister in reference to an honorable member is disorderly, and to ask that it bc withdrawn. I am dealing now, not with the use of the document, but with the characterization of an honorable 111 ember as dishonest. On the statement before the House, the honorable member acted with perfect propriety and in all innocence, and that characterization of him is completely unjustified and out of order. </para>

                            <para>-Order ! I have considered the matter carefully. In this case, the use of the letter in question was either honest or dishonest. I gather from remarks that I have heard that, if honorable members had known of the circumstances by which the letter came into their hands, they might not, or would not, have used it. That is the only interpretation that I can put on the remarks that I have heard. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation. I had no knowledge of the origin of the information. In fact, a day or two after I had received this directive, I approached the Minister for Social Services and talked to him about the information that the Director's letter had conveyed to the  deputy  directors. Is it to be considered that, if I thought that I had obtained the letter dishonestly, I would have gone to the Minister and revealed its contents and that later I would have quoted it in this House? In these circumstances, I ask that the imputation be withdrawn. Never before, in this Parliament or in any other parliament, have I been accused of having done anything dishonest. </para>

                        <para> My question is addressed to the Minister for Supply. In answer to a question asked yesterday, the Minister informed the House that only articles of little value were recently taken from the long-range weapons establishment. Does he know that the stolen articles included Geiger counters, special valves and other radio parts, valued at several thousands of pounds? If that is so, is the Minister satisfied with the efficiency of the security service? </para>

                        <para>- I know that a certain section of the press has stated that Geiger counters and things of that sort were taken from the long-range weapons establishment, . but I did not say that the articles taken were of little value. I said that they were not of security value. They were unclassified material, and therefore no question of security arose. That is what I said yesterday, or that is what I sought to convey, and if the honorable member will look at the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report I believe that he will find that my recollection is correct. The question of the efficiency of the security organization does not arise in that connexion. As I said yesterday, some sort of informal permission was alleged to have been given to troops at Emu Field to the effect that they might take certain equipment no longer required by the British authorities. Pursuant to that permission articles were sent out. The security people, having had their attention drawn to the number of parcels coming out- </para>

                        <para>- I rise to order. On what grounds did you, Mr. Speaker, rule out of order the question that I asked earlier, seeing questions of a similar nature were directed by supporters of the Government to the Leader of the Opposition in times past, and were allowed? The matter that I introduced comes within the scope of arbitration, which is under the control of the Minister. </para>

            <para>Is the Minister for the Navy a ware that naval gunnery exercises we're conducted recently in Port Phillip Bay? Does he know of the distress and worry caused to residents in bay-side suburbs, and of the terrifying effect of the gunfire on young children and on people who are ill, including those in hospitals? Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the damage that resulted from the exercises, not only the shaking and rattling of walls and windows, but also the cracking of plaster and the shifting of tiles? Will he investigate whether claims for damage to houses arising from the exercises can be legally met by the Department of the Navy, and will he take steps to ensure that future exercises shall take place outside the bay ? </para>

            <para> One day last week the Royal Australian Navy carried out a full-calibre exercise in Port Phillip Bay, with unfortunate consequences. The Navy agrees that many people were disturbed by the gunfire. It claims that that was due to a most unfortunate combination of circumstances. Immediately the naval authorities ascertained the facts, they took action to suspend further training exercises in Port Phillip Bay. As the result of a direction issued yesterday, a new range will be used for full-calibre exercises. No further fullcalibre exercises will be conducted in Port Phillip Bay, but sub-calibre exercises will be conducted in that area. </para>

In order to relieve the con gestion in the General Post Office, the department desires to use the funds that are available for the erection of a new mail branch near the Central Railway Station at Redfern.

                <para class="block">This motion is almost identical with a motion that was moved in this House over a year ago though it contains certain modifications to which I shall draw the attention of honorable members. The first is the inclusion in paragraph 4 <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> of the words "unless the Minister at the request of the committee otherwise directs ". That paragraph provides that the committee and its sub committees shall sit <inline font-style="italic">in camera</inline> and that their proceedings shall be secret unless the Minister, at the request of the committee, otherwise directs. It is foreshadowed that there may be occasions on which the Foreign Affairs Committee will sit in public. The last three lines of paragraph 4 (f) are new. The provision contained in those lines is that, if the Opposition is represented on the committee, the copies of the committee's reports to the Minister for External Affairs shall be forwarded to the Leader of the Opposition for his confidential information. Paragraph 4 <inline font-style="italic">(g)</inline> has been modified. That paragraph provides that the committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and that all evidence submitted to the committee shall be regarded as confidential to the committee. That provision, of course, is qualified by paragraph 4 <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> when the committee sits in public. </para>
                <para>I think honorable members are well aware of the reason for the establishment of the Foreign Affairs Committee and of its history over the last eighteen months. On the 20th November I tabled the second report of the committee. Perhaps honorable members have had an opportunity of looking at that report. The committee has worked well over the last eighteen months. The officers or the Department of External Affairs and I have endeavoured to give the committee every assistance, and we have made available for its perusal many hundreds of documents in relation to current external affairs. No fewer than a dozen prominent people from outside the Parliament have attended meetings of the committee and have reported to it on various aspects of foreign affairs with which they were particularly familiar. I think that this experiment, which was commenced eighteen months ago - and I do not say this in a party political spirit - has 'been a great success. The Government regrets that the Opposition has not seen fit to collaborate with the committee. I hope that the Opposition will reconsider its attitude because, broadly speaking, international policy in any country should be above party politics. I hope that in the future the committee will enable honorable members to inform themselves on foreign affairs to a degree to which that has not been possible in the past. I think members of the committee would be willing to tell their respective Houses that no restraint had been placed upon them by myself or by officers of the Department of External Affairs. The committee has been freely given all the information for which it has asked. I repeat the appeals that have been made to the Opposition several times, both in this House and in another place, to reconsider its attitude of non-co-operation with the Foreign Affairs Committee. </para>

                <para class="block">The amendment is very simple indeed. It is one which I hope the Minister will see fit to accept because it will vastly improve the Government's scheme. It will restore the system of free treatment of all citizens in public wards of public hospitals without the necessity of membership of a friendly society or a private fund. We can see no reason why the Minister should not be prepared to accept the amendment. When the Chifley Government left office it was paying 8s. a day in respect of each occupied bed in public wards of public hospitals and in the public wards of approved private hospitals and, in return, all the State governments of Australia were undertaking to provide free treatment in public wards. Every person, irrespective of his means, whose health condition required that he should occupy a bed in a public ward, was able to occupy it without the humiliation of a means test and without extensive inquiry by officials into the state of his finances. Upon leaving the hospital after having been given the necessary treatment he received no bill of any kind for the services rendered. In other words, each citizen contributed to the cost of hospitalization by taxation according to his ability to pay. The money paid into the National Welfare Fund by every citizen in accordance with his means was used to provide hospital treatment for all Australian citizens. The system enjoyed the support of the great majority of the Australian people. All those who participated in its benefits had every cause to be thankful for it. It was a system which allowed a man to maintain his self respect, because he knew that he paid according to his ability to pay and received services according to his needs. </para>
                <para>Up to this point the Minister has been obdurate in his unwillingness to return to the system established by the Chifley Labour Government which represented such a great advance in hospitalization in Australia. As you are aware, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman</inline> - </para>

                <para class="block">We propose by this amendment to give to the Minister another and a final opportunity to see the error of his ways and to restore the system established by the Chifley Labour Government. From the financial point of view, there is no reason whatever for the Minister's refusal to continue that system. As I have pointed out, in 1949 the Chifley Labour Government was paying Ss. a day for each occupied bed when the basic wage was slightly in excess of £6 a week. To-day, the Treasurer is receiving from taxpayers double the revenue received by the Chifley Government, because wages are in accordance with living costs, which have more than doubled during the last four years. This Government is therefore in. a position to pay at least 16s. a day for each occupied bed without imposing any greater strain upon the financial resources of the Commonwealth than the Chifley Government was able to bear without difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- Under this system the Government is paying only 3s. a day, or the equivalent of less than 4s. a day, having regard to the value of money in the days of the Chifley Government. In fact, the value of the benefit provided by this Government has been cut in half during its term of office. Only if a man or a woman will agree to undertake the additional obligation of private insurance will the Government agree to increase the benefit. In that event it will increase the benefit by the small amount of 4s., making a total benefit of 12s. a day. Even when a citizen has accepted the additional obligation of private insurance, this Government- still pays far less in respect of each occupied hospital bed, in terms of real money, than the Chifley Government found it possible to pay four years ago. In those circumstances, it is utterly wrong for the Minister to pretend to this committee that he has done something to improve the financial position of hospitals. As the honorable member for Bennelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cramer),</inline> by interjection a few moments ago, showed that he also has been deceived about this matter I should like to correct his thinking in regard to it. The difficulties experienced by public hospitals in Australia to-day were not created by the Chifley Government. On the contrary, that Government completely relieved the financial difficulties of public hospitals throughout the whole of Australia. </para>

The Chifley Government, in return for an undertaking on the part of the State governments to give free services, provided, in respect of each occupied hospital bed, 6s. a day, or a larger amount than the hospitals normally received from fees and from other sources. In that respect the Chifley Government improved the position of every public hospital in Australia. That fact was acknowledged by the State governments which so willingly accepted the Chifley Government's scheme. </para>

If honorable members opposite contend that the Chifley Government contributed to the financial difficulties of public hospitals in 1949, what must they say about the present Government, which is continuing a contribution of the same nominal value - that is, 8s. a day - but the value of which, in terms of purchasing power, is less than one-half of the value of the contribution made by the Chifley Government? </para>

He has now moved four or five amendments with the object of destroying the bill. The whole principle of this legislation is that voluntary insurance! plus government aid produces an extraordinary increase in hospital revenues.  His  story will not stand investigation for two' seconds.  The Chifley Labour Government introduced its hospital scheme in 1945, and the position in New South Wales at that time was that the total yield from public effort was £2,195,000 a.nd the total amount of State aid was £1,700,000. After the Chifley ,ment's scheme had  been  in operation foi*  two  years, the yield from public effort had declined to £1,300,000. and State aid had to be increased to £4j000,000. Every hospital was in desperate financial straits-. </para>

The State Ministers said emphatically that ti  1  61 r hospitals could not manage without a payment of between 16s. and 18s. a I  Mid  a day. I remind honorable members nhat the Chifley Labour Government had not increased the  payment  to hospitals for several years. The original payment in ]945 was 6s. a bed a day, and. it was increased about a year later to Ss. si bed a day. The position had  become  desperate, hut only for  the  hospitals but als6 for the sick  people.  The hospitals had not sufficient revenues, and they 'expected to forced to withdraw some of their beds from use. </para>

The Premiers fiercely contested the Prime Minister's claim that the Commonwealth was providing, in effect^ free hospital treatment for the people. The Premiers said emphatically that the States were providing free hospital treatment as ii. result of 'the exercise  of <inline font-style="italic">force majeure</inline> by the  Commonwealth.  At that time, the States were contributing approximately £6 per cent, nf the total costs. The then Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr,</inline> and the then Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon,</inline> were stating publicly that their governments had made all hospital beds available free of charge, yet 80 percent, of the costs had to be found by the State taxpayers, or by direct payments  by State governments: The Premiers, when the position of mental, institutions was under discussion, said: that they did not want to be caught, in the same way as they had been caught with public hospitals. They complained that the Commonwealth, wasobtaining all the credit for the fact that the Scheme was free, whilst the States had to provide the necessary  money.  The hospital insurance scheme now provides  much  of the money. The payment of the Commonwealth contribution makes hospital insurances the best investment in Australia. A person pays a premium which entitles him to a contribution from a benefit fund of 6s. a duy, aiia the Government's contribution increases the  amount  to 18s. a day. The New South Wales Minister for Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sullivan,</inline> and the Premier of that State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cahill,</inline> had the wit to recognize  the advantages of this Scheme, arid increased the State's charge to £4 4s. a week, s6 that a hospital receives; with the Commonwealth's contribution, a payment of £S 8s. a bed a week. The New South Wales  authoritiesconsider  that everybody can afford to pay ls. a. week in hospital insurance. </para>

Let us- suppose, for the purposes of this argument, that 10,000 of those beds are occupied by patients who cannot afford to pay fees. The increased revenue for each other bed is approximately £180 a year, The honorable member for Eden-'Monaro, if hu works a simple multiplication sum, will see that hospital revenues are benefiting by an additional fio.000,000 or £6,000,000 a year. In 'the last hine months, the financial position of public hospitals has improved by £3j500,000 <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> £4,000,000. Those figures are revealed by actual banking transactions. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schlink,</inline> of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, visited Canberra recently with the loans of the faculties of medicine in Australian universities, and he told mc. in the course of our conversation, th'at foi- the first time for many years, the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital was able to carry oil with its own resources, and </para>

A few weeks ago-, the financial statement of that  hospital  showed a surplus. Since the  commencement  of the new scheme, tiro institution is no (longer in financial "difficulties. The Grafton Hospital) for the first time in seventeen years, has a surplus of £3,000-, ''and the New  South  Wales Hospitals  Commission  has  stated  that the institution has done so Well that its surplus may be used to finance improvements to equipment. In other  circum  stance's, the money "would  have  'been taken 'into 'general revenue.  However,  the subsidy payable to the  hospital may  be reviewed  next  year. Those instances reveal the improvement 'in hospital finances. The ftonseh.se mouthed by 'the honorable  member  foi"  Eden-Monaro  on this subject neatly makes one ill.

I assure him that the present scheme may be likened to a tractor or a bulldozer that has pulled hospitals out of the financial mire into which they had settled. For the first time, they have a radiant hope for the future* They are able to contemplate necessary improvements. I cite the position of the Bonalbo Hospital in my own electorate. The matron and head sister slept in a room 10 feet by 8 feet. There was no place where the 'night sister Could sleep undisturbed. The  hospital  authorities had tried foi1 twelve years to obtain sufficient money to 'finance 'the construction of a tew additional rooms. Now they say that they will erect the necessary buildings next year. This -scheme has been in operation generally for a year, and in relation to private hospitals for  nearly  two years. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McKell said, when he was Premier of New South Wales, that 80 private hospitals had closed in that State in two years as a. result of the operation of the Labour Government's scheme.

It merely forced the States to. adopt a policy that ' it refused to finance adequately. I should have had no objection to Labour's plan if it had agreed to pay 50, 60 or 70 per cent, of the total maintenance costs of hospitals. But it refused to do so. It provided only a miserable 20 or 25 per cent, of hospital costs and then sat back and said proudly, " Look what we have done. We have given the people a free health service ". The truth is that it forced its scheme upon the States regardless of their wishes.

                        <para>- What silly nonsense ! Hundreds of thousands of pounds of insurance moneys are being paid for hospital attention in Queensland at the present time. Notwithstanding the statements made by honorable members opposite last night, the Queensland Government undertook immediately to make a substantial number of beds available in country districts, and an equal number available in city areas, for patients insured under the Commonwealth plan. Part of its contract with the Commonwealth is that beds must always be available for insured persons when they fall ill. The State Government has promised that, as soon as the Brisbane General Hospital nurses' home becomes vacant in the near future, the building will be made available for use as private wards. Three-quarters of the new hospital in South Brisbane, which has almost reached the point of completion, will be used to provide pay wards 'under the Commonwealth scheme. The contract between the State Government and this Government provides that the State must increase its hospital revenues in such ways as that, and, unless it carries out the contract, the Auditor-General W].1.1 nor permit the Commonwealth to make the general payments under the scheme. </para>

                <para>All the talk that Ave have heard, from honorable members opposite about different agreements in different States is sheer nonsense. Every State still has the power to provide beds free of charge if it wishes to do so, and every State, in fact, provides free beds for indigent persons. The Commonwealth has eased the situation in relation to pensioners by providing 12s. a day for such patients. The governments of New South Wales and certain other States have said that they Will accept this amount as the total payment for pensioner patients. The net result of the present scheme is that hospital revenue from all sources now amounts to £12,500,000 a year, compared with approximately £6,000,000 a year at the time that this Government took office. In other words, hospital revenue has practically doubled since 1949. </para>

Whenever we try to establish a standard, the Labour party objects and says, " But we are not on the gold standard  now.  We are on the brummagem standard, the lead standard, the tin standard, or the bread standard." Honorable members opposite complain that a. 12£ per cent, tax reduction benefits the wage-earner by only Id. a. week. Such criticism is misleading. According to them 100 years ago, a 12£ per cent, tax reduction would not have been of any advantage to the average wage-earner. Let us deal with realities and talk like commonsense men. What is the attitude of the Victorian Government to the Commonwealth medical benefits plan? The day that the Victorian Labour Government took office, it called the State Parliament together to pass a law that enabled that Government to sign the agreement with the Commonwealth and take advantage of the scheme immediately. The Labour party  in  Victoria prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald</inline> from doing so for months, when he was Premier, but it took advantage of the earliest opportunity to ratify the agreement when it came to power. "What' happened in New South Wales? The old agreement had seven or eight months to run, but the State Government approached this Government and asked for permission to set the new agreement in operation at once. This Government agreed to the request and the State Government changed over to the new agreement. The Western Australian Government did likewise. One would think, to listen to honorable members opposite, that Their colleagues in the States were clowns and fools. </para>

                <para>Whenever I walk through the streets of Sydney, Melbourne and country towns  in  various parts of Australia and ask people whether they are insured under the Commonwealth scheme, they tell me that they are insured because they regard health insurance on this Government's plan as the best investment that they know. They say that, for the same rate of premium as they paid under the Labour Government's plan, they are entitled now to twice the benefits in some instances. People throughout Australia, including members of the Opposition no doubt, have taken advantage of the opportunity to make this valua'ble investment. My own opinion is that those who have not taken advantage of it are in need of treatment, not at a general hospital, but in a mental home. </para>
                <para class="block"><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. THOMPSON</inline> (Port Adelaide) I 3.4-7"! . - We should view this matter in a different light from that in which the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> views it. There is a community hospital very close to my home which makes a charge of £2 2s. a day for each patient. Under the Chifley Government's legislation, the hospital reduced each account by 8s.. a day so that the patient had to pay only £1 14s. a day. Under the present scheme, the Minister tells the patient that lie must insure himself for a benefit of 6s. a day. That benefit makes no difference to the hospital, because it charges £2 2s. m day to each person whether he is insured or not. When the account is made i 'lit. the  hospital writes off 8s. a day, as it did under the Chifley legislation, and the patient is required to pay the balance of £1 14s. If he is insured for 6s. a day, he can obtain an additional benefit of 4s. a day from the Government. That is all the help that he obtains from the Commonwealth. He is required to pay a premium for the amount of 6s. a day that he receives from the approved insurance organization. The investment represented by the continued payment of the premium may return a good dividend to him if he has the misfortune to become ill, but he may pay the premium for many years without having to go to hospital. Let us consider the position of a wealthy man with thousands of pounds in the bank. The Government says to that man, in effect, " We pay 8s. a day towards your hospital account if you are in an approved hospital. If you have insured yourself, we shall pay an additional 4s. a day. If you have not insured yourself, you must pay the balance of your account, after we have paid 8s. a day, out of your own pocket." This amendment would give the hospitals an assurance that they would be paid 12s. a day by the Government in respect of each patient, and would receive at least 6s. a day from patients who had insured with appropriate organizations. It would not mean that the hospitals would get any more money than previously. The Minister's remarks referred almost entirely to' public hospitals. They had no relevance to the thousands of people who are treated in private hospitals. Let me tell the right honorable gentleman that these provisions will not ensure that the private hospitals will get any more money. The legislation of the Chifley Government provided that a person who was treated in a public ward of a public hospital would not be required to make any contribution to his hospital expenses. Under this scheme, such a person must insure with a hospital benefits organization for the payment of 6s. a day towards his hospital expenses. The hospital must make a certain charge to obtain the government payment. I am not certain of the figure but, speaking from memory, I think a hospital must charge a patient at least 18s. a day before it becomes entitled to the payment of 12s. a day from  the Government. That is provided for in agreements in respect to public hospitals made between the Commonwealth and the States. The bill states what is to be done in the case of private hospitals, but the procedure in respect of public hospitals is specified in agreements made between the Commonwealth and the States.- Unless a State makes a certain charge to patients in public hospitals, itdoes not become entitled to a payment from the Government. The Minister has said that provision has been made for free beds to he available in public hospitals, but I do not know of any clause of the bill which provides that a public hospital will he entitled to receive the full Commonwealth payment in respect of a patient who occupies a free bed. </para>

Other people were charged less than that, or not charged at all. At that time, the average payment received in respect of each bed occupied in that hospital was less than 6s. a day. When the Chifley Government paid 6s. a day in respect of every bed occupied, the hospital received more money than it had received pre viously. That proves the accuracy of the statement by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro that the hospital benefit scheme of the Chifley Government gave an additional benefit to public hospitals. I do not deny that when costs increased, the hospitals went through a difficult period, but I say that under the Chifley Government's scheme the hospitals received more revenue from beds than they had received previously. Later, the Chifley Government increased the payment from 6s. to 8s. a day. I say quite openly that honorable members on this side of the chamber want to put that system into operation again. We say also that in respect of any patient in a private hospital, whether he be a wealthy person or a wage-earner, the Government should make a payment of 12s. a day. </para>
                <para>It is all very well to say that if a person insures with a hospital benefits organization, the Commonwealth will pay 12s. a day towards his hospital expenses, but if honorable members opposite had a closer association with the ordinary men in the street they would know that many people cannot afford to  insure themselves in that way. Doubtless the Minister will say that an indigent person can be admitted to a public ward of a public hospital. In South Australia, there are many people in small country towns who cannot enter public hospitals for treatment, because the hospitals are too far from their homes. They have to go to the hospitals that are nearby. Unless such people have insured themselves with a hospital benefits organization, the Commonwealth will make no payment in respect of their hospital treatment, because most hospitals of that kind do not have public wards or public beds. Some of them have one or two public beds. The Murray Bridge Hospital has two or four public beds - I forget the number. Recently a man wrote to me and told rae that he had been unable to secure a public bed in that hospital, because they were all occupied. He had to go into a' private ward and pay the appropriate charge for treatment there. Many people who cannot afford to insure with hospital benefits organizations are deprived of the benefit of a payment by the Commonwealth when they enter a hospital. </para>
                <para>This scheme will make practically no difference to the average person with a decent income who goes into a private hospital. He will have to contribute to a hospital benefits organization, which will pay him 6s. a day towards his hospital expenses, and he will have to pay the balance of his hospital bill. The only additional payment he will receive from the Government as a result of being insured is 4s. a day. If the Government were to agree to pay 12s. a day in respect of all patients, that would clear the matter up. I appeal to the Minister to give further consideration to that proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - As the honorable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> has pointed out, the effect of this amendment, if accepted, would be completely to change the basis on which payments are made to public hospitals. There would be, in fact, a reversion to the old system. The real contention of honorable members opposite is that every one  in the community should be treated in public hospitals free of charge. I have done my best to explain to the House on several occasions that there is no such thing as treating every one free of charge in public hospitals. There is no validity in the argument that, because a hospital system exists, nobody should pay anything for hospital treatment or that, having paid taxes for what are vaguely and generally known as social services, everybody should be able to enjoy everything that the hospital system provides without making a further payment. That argument could be extended to include almost everything. It could be said that travel on trams and trains should be free. The Minister adopted the principle that, as the hospital system was not receiving sufficient funds under the old system by which <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments were made to hospitals, a system of voluntary insurance should be introduced. There is no compulsion in  this scheme, and honorable members opposite are merely endeavouring to draw a red herring across the trail when they say that this part of the scheme is compulsory and that a man must insure himself in order to enjoy hospital benefits. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">It is not a compulsory scheme. It is a voluntary scheme. </para>
                <para>The public hospitals of all States arc managed by the governments of the States in which they are established, and each State government has made an almost, identical agreement with the Australian Government. Under that agreement it is the prerogative of the .State government concerned to decide whether or not it will make a charge for its public hospital beds, and in the case of the States that have decided to make a charge there is still nothing to prevent those persons who are unable to insure, and those who are in indigent circumstances, from receiving, free of charge, all the benefits that a public hospital can provide. But there is an arrangement that those who can insure, and can pay for hospital accommodation, shall be requested to do so. If a State decides to make a charge, it has to ascertain the circumstances of each patient. If he is insured for hospital benefits or if the authorities believe that he can afford to pay a charge, then they request him to do so. It is an extraordinary thing to say that such a scheme would have any effect on a man's self respect. Surely, it cannot detract from a man's .self respect if he undertakes responsibilities on his own account, but it may affect his self respect if he allows the State to do everything for him. </para>
                <para>The idea that the hospitals should be free to every one because every one has paid some form of taxation, is analogous to the other claims that the Opposition has made about social services, in which it has argued that because everybody makes some social services contribution, everybody should have all social services benefits, including the age pension, without having any means test applied to them. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> himself stated that that was the Opposition's view. "When he was asked whether he had made any calculations about the cost of the scheme that he advocated, he admitted that he had made none, and that he had no idea of what the consequent increase of taxation would be if his theories were put into practice. The amendment that has been moved on behalf of the Opposition, is founded on exactly that irresponsible basis. No honorable member opposite has calculated the cost that would accrue to the country if die amendments were adopted, but the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has shown that in the nine months that his scheme has been in operation, it has already benefited the hospitals by a sum of between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000. </para>
                <para>The issue before us is simple. Are we to accept a scheme based on responsible and sensible premises, or are we to accept a scheme that is wholly irresponsible and that will benefit neither the patients nor the hospitals? If a man insures himself for hospital benefits - and he is not compelled to do so - is he to be asked to devote the proceeds of that insurance towards paying his hospital fees? The answer of any sensible person to that question must be "yes". If a man is perfectly capable of paying for" his hospital benefits, why should he not be asked to do so? The honorable member for Port Adelaide said that people were crowded out of public beds of small country hospitals, and were put into private beds for which they were asked to pay a charge. All I can say about that is that if that has happened it is the result of extremely bad hospital administration. If a man who cannot pay for a private bed should go along to a public hospital and find that the public beds are all full, surely any reasonable hospital would provide a. private bed, but regard it as a public bed, and make no charge. </para>
                <para>When honorable members talk about a means test, let us be clear on what this means. Strictly speaking, it is a test which excludes from a benefit those who do not satisfy certain conditions. Therefore, if there really was a means test for hospital benefits certain persons who did not satisfy the test would be completely excluded from those benefits. It is misleading to talk about a means test as applied to hospitals, because no one who is unable to pay. is excluded from the hospitals. It is quite unreal to say that simply by making <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, and calling the benefits free, they really become free. The choice is whether we shall finance all our medical services, hospitals and other social services out of taxation, or whether we shall have a contributory scheme on a basis of really apportioning the cost to those who can actually pay. In other words, are we to have a national insurance scheme' on a real basis? As far as hospitals and health services are concerned, the Government's scheme is certainly on that real basis. It may be possible to point to some minor anomalies in the scheme, but it is not possible to point to any major anomalies. </para>

                    <para>.- Under clause 55 of this bill a person is required to contribute to a registered hospital benefits organization to qualify to receive the additional 4s. a day payment made by the Commonwealth. The Opposition has put forward an amendment designed to eliminate the necessity for a person to be a contributor to an organization, because we believe that a patient should be on the same footing as a patient under the Chifley scheme, and receive the benefits of the government contribution without being forced to pay anything to any outside body. I was very interested in the second-reading speech of the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> because he appeared to be primarily concerned with the benefits that hospitals would obtain under the scheme, and not the benefits that the patients would obtain. I was apparently labouring under the misapprehension that the intention of the bill was to assist patients, but the Minister has made it clear that its main purpose is to assist the hospitals. We maintain that hospitals should be financed by the Government in order that they may help those who are ill. Moreover, we believe that a scheme such as that contemplated by this measure is unconstitutional because it is compulsory. People will be required to pay money, not to the Government, but to private profit-making organizations before they become eligible for a government benefit. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Minister laid emphasis on the fact that more hospital beds were available at the present time than have been available for some time past. I suggest that they are available only because people cannot pay the extortionate charges imposed by hospitals, and that the scheme is appropriately named the hospital benefits scheme, because it is a scheme -to benefit the hospitals and not patients. The Chifley Government made 8s. a bed a day available in respect of patients in hospitals, and I emphasize that all patients, received that amount whether they had made any contribution or not. Labour believed that because everybody paid the first ls. 6d. in the £1 of his income tax into a social services contribution fund, he should have the benefit of that taxation. But the people are continuing to pay that social services contribution, and therefore they should continue to have the benefit of it. I suggest that because of the increased cost of commodities caused by the maladministration of the present Government, the 8s. a bed a day  paid  by the Chifley Government would be worth at least 18s. a day at present. Therefore, this Government should pay 1 Ss. a bed a day in respect of all patients in all hospitals. "We believe that hospitalization should be free, and the object of the Opposition's amendment is to make it free. This Government has claimed that it is sympathetic towards the proposal to abolish the means test, and, indeed, it has put forth much propaganda to that effect. But under this measure, the Government is introducing a means test on patients in hospitals. The principle of the Chifley social services administration was that a means test should not bc applied in respect of any new social services legislation, and where a means test did exist it should be progressively eliminated. "We laid emphasis on our belief that all persons in the community should ultimately be freed from the means test. But this Government has introduced another means test. </para>
                <para>Several cases have been brought to my notice of families the fathers of which have been contributing to a hospital scheme. Those individuals had no need to take advantage of the services of a hospital, but wives chronically ill have not been able to obtain the benefit of membership of the scheme. Therefore, I suggest that any hospital benefits scheme should cover a man's wife and family as well as himself. "We strongly object to the provision that sick persons should be compelled to pay to some outside organization before they are entitled to receive benefits that are provided from the general taxation. I therefore strongly oppose the provision that the Commonwealth should force State governments to incorporate that principle into their schemes.' Some Stategovernment's have endeavoured to resist this Government's pressure, but they have been informed that the Commonwealth would not supply them with further money for their hospitals unless they entered the Commonwealth scheme, lt stands to the credit of the Queensland Government that it had the courage to defy this Government and refuse to obey its orders. After about two months, this Government surrendered to the Queensland Government, and so Queensland remains the only State of the Commonwealth that still continues a free hospitalization scheme. The Opposition is of the opinion that, if people have to contribute to a hospital benefits scheme, the contribution should be based on ability to pay, and not on a flat rate. The contribution under the Labour Government's social service benefits scheme started at 3d. in the £1, and rose to ls. 6d. in the £1. That is a far more just and equitable basis on which to finance a scheme than to welch the sick and the poor in the community, as this Government is doing, for the benefit of the hospitals. Honorable members opposite come into this chamber and blatantly tell the people that to-day the hospitals have large credit balances, which they did not have in the past. Is that the way in which a hospital benefits scheme should be judged? Should it not be judged by the benefit that is given to sick people? The Minister for Health has fallen down hopelessly on his job. The stand -over tactics that the Government is adopting are a disgrace to this country. It has been properly called a hospital benefits scheme, because it has given the benefits to the hospitals, and not to the people who are in necessitous circumstances. </para>

Let  mb  'direct  the  attention  of  honorable  members to the  circumstances  that  exist in Western Australia. Prior to 1931, hospital's in Western Australia lived  on  a catch-as-catch-can basis. Every hospital <inline font-style="italic">Witts</inline> -financially  embarrassed  and  badly equippe'd. In 1932,  the  State LiberalCountry party Government introduced  a  hospital  tax of  6d.  in 'the  £1. Th'at entitled "certain classes  of  people  to free  hospital treatment, which  was  based upon  t'h'eir  earnings  and  their family responsibilities. People  who  earned  th/e  basic A.n gIa received free treatment. The  fees  charged  -to  people  who  received more than the -basic "wage were graded according  to Thoi r  family responsibilities. If  a  in Mi earned 'more than  the  basic wage. and if  lie had  large family responsibilities,  he paid a  proportion  pf the  fees  that the  hospital charged. From 1'9'32 onwards, the hospitals in Western Australia,  were iii ii  vastly -different .position  from that  which .obtained .prior  to  T93:i. Western Australia then  had 'a Scheme  which enabled the hospitals t'o  o'bta'in  sufficient money to provide accommodation, amenities  arid  facilities  'for'  treatment, and  which  enabled them  at the  same time  to  ensure that those who could not afford to pay were able to receive treatment. </para>
                <para>When the Chifley Government's hospital benefits scheme came into operation in 1945-46, the Western Australian hospital scheme went by the board. I have told the committee before that the-. Chifley Government's scheme was accepted by the State Labour Government in Western Australia because the Western) Australian Government said that the Commonwealth had pointed a gun at itshead, and that there was no alternativeThe Chifley Government's scheme entitled, every person upon demand - and that word " demand " was used in the agreement - to a free public bed in a publicward in a public hospital. Up to that, stage there were no intermediate wardsOr private wards in any of the countryhospitals in Western Australia. Withintwelve months, a direction was issued tohospital committees and hospital managements that it was impossible to continue to provide a service under the federal hospital benefits scheme unless the hospitals converted some of their publicbeds into intermediate and private beds,, and took action to collect fees from thepatients. This was how the new system worked out in practice: A man might bring his wife to the hospital. Thepa'tient *wo'uld be 'admitted, and then thehospital -management would say to theman, "You would not like your wife togo into a bed iii a public ward? Because he was tom between that suggestion and anxiety for the health and wellbeing 'of a member of his family, the man would say " Of course not ". He would' not consider his financial -circumstances,, hut would 'bo 'concerned only with the humanitarian aspect. He would say, u Never mind about a public 'bed. Admit her, 'and let her receive treatment ". T'h'at  'Vitas  accepted tb mean that thepe'rson did not demand a public bed.. The result was that public beds disappeared from 'the hospitals in WesternAustralia, and the 'Chifley 'Government's^ so-called 'frere hospital treatment disappeared -with them. Because of that subterfuge, "the patient was "required to pay. ^Western. Australia "had 'ali association of fourteen country hospitals, 'which protested vigorously against "this filthysubterfuge that was resorted to 'in order to circumvent a scheme that was intended to be a free hospital scheme. </para>
                <para>The only way in which the difficulty could be overcome was to introduce a scheme under which people voluntarily insured themselves against the day when "they would incur hospital charges. If a person paid 9d. or1s. or1s. 6d. a week, he was entitled to certain hospital benefits. The scheme was similar to that which has been introduced by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> It was introduced, first, to ensure that hospitals received sufficient revenue, and, secondly, that people were able to pay their hospital bills. </para>
                <para>If, the amendment that was moved by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser)</inline> were accepted, Western Australia would return to the state of affairs that existed prior to the introduction of the voluntary insurance scheme. Under that system, those who did not insure themselves voluntarily knew that, when they entered a so-called public bed in a public ward in a public hospital, they were receiving treatment from the hospital as a result of the generosity and charity of people who were making voluntary donations to those hospitals. Almost every country hospital in Western Australia was constantly on the verge of closing down, and had to go cap in hand to the public and ask for money in order to provide treatment for people who, in many cases, were not in a position to pay reasonable hospital charges. Western Australia does not want a return to that state of affairs. The need for hospitals to rely upon charitable contributions for their maintenance has almost disappeared. </para>

                    <para>.- The Australian Government, in dealing with health matters, must be guided by a strong sense of responsibility, because it is quite clear that the States must accept any scheme that is put before them. The States are dependent upon the Commonwealth for funds. Therefore, the Australian Government should bring forward a sound scheme. It  is  not a question of who is going to pay for hospital treatment, because the public always pays. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The question is, "How are the payments to be made?" The Australian Labour party has stated that the public should pay for its hospitals in accordance with social justice through a proper and regulated system of taxation. The' Liberal party and the Australian Country party say that the Government cannot provide those benefits out of taxation, but when a Labour government assumes office they are provided from taxation. Thepeople have received free hospital treatment in the past, but they do not receive it now. </para>
                <para>There is a big difference between  a  plan and  a  scheme. The hospital benefits scheme is inconsistent with the remaining provisions of the bill. Forexample-, the bill does not require any form of insurance for free life-saving drugs. Why is it required only for hospital benefits and pharmaceutical benefits? Under  the  present scheme the people will pay and they will pay twiceas much as they used to. The people who pay taxes have a right to receive out of taxation the benefits for which they pay. Underthe Chifley Government's hospital benefits plan, the people received those benefits, and no questions were asked. Everybody received benefits on the same basis. Under the scheme that is outlined in the bill, the Government denies to a large section of the community the benefits for which they have paid in taxation. The money is paid into the National Welfare Fund. On other occasions I have referred to the manner in which the Government  hap  covered up the sums that it has paid into the fund for social services. </para>

                    <para>.- I refer to clause 74. which reads as follows :  -  (.1.) A registered organization shall, within fourteen days after the receipt by it of the notification of its registration, appoint a (5.) Where a registered organization contravenes, or fails to comply with, any of the provisions of this Act applicable to the registered organization, the contravention of, or failure to comply with those provisions shall, without limiting in any way the liability of the organization, be deemed to be a contravention or failure by the public officer, and the public officer is punishable by a fine not exceeding One hundred pounds or imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months. </para>

                    <para>That, insub-clause (5.), after the word officer" (first occurring), the following words be inserted :  - " unless he proves the contravention or failure took place without his knowledge or approval or that he opposed it and on becoming aware of such contravention or failure notified the Director-General ". </para>

                <para class="block">I also foreshadow an amendment which relates to clause 76. The clause reads -  (.1.) A registered organization shall, within three months after the expiration of the registered organization's accounting year, or within such further time as the Director-General, on the application of the registered organization, allows, furnish to the Director-General - </para>
                <para class="block">The Opposition will propose that subclause (1.) be amended by inserting, after the word " shall ", the following words :  - " make in writing an annual report to its members and shall ". The wording of these clauses throws a very interesting light on the procedure laid down in this scheme. It is in line with the general pattern of Government policy that the British Medical Association, which controls these registered organizations, must, not be touched in any way. The Government, in framing these clauses is, if I may use a colloquialism, virtually seeking to pass the buck to those who are unfortunate enough to be appointed to the position of public officer in one of these organizations. Clause 74, as drafted, makes the public officer entirely responsible for everything done in the name of the organization and excludes from responsibility the directors and other persons charged with the conduct of the organization. No provision has been made in clause 76 for organizations to submit annual reports, which are required of all public bodies that represent a considerable body of citizens, such as public companies, friendly societies and trade unions. That procedure has not been followed in relation to registered organizations that come within the ambit of this legislation because it is the policy of the Government to make the British Medical Association sacrosanct. Penalties  may be imposed upon the public officers of registered organizations. Certain clauses of this bill and certain amendments which were inserted in the existing legislation in March last absolve from penalties members of the medical profession. As these organizations deal with the rights and privileges of the people their directors should be made responsible for all the acts performed in the name of the organizations as is the case with the directors of other public bodies. Surely it is reasonable to ask that if certain duties are imposed upon the public officer of a registered organization, and he carries them out under protest or against his will, he should be given the right to defend his actions. This clause is too arbitrary. </para>
                <para>Some time ago the Minister brought to Australia certain experts from the United States of America to examine and report on the Government's national health scheme. The experts dealt with no-profit organizations, the boards of directorates of which, they said, should be of a truly representative nature. In paragraph <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> of their report, they said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>We believe that non-profit insurance schemes will prosper most if they have a representative board of directors. While the boards of directors of most plans visited appear to be made up of representative citizens of the community, we recommend that one of the criteria used by the Commonwealth in approving insurance organizations for participation in the Commonwealth scheme should be that the insurance society have a representative hoard of directors. At the moment there would appear to be no great problem if the board of directors of a hospital plan for instance be made up solely of hospital representatives. It may be anticipated, however, that even if such boards of directors do good jobs locally, the organizations will be under needless criticism because of such limitation. This could easily be altered by providing for representation of various aspects of community on the boards of directors of all registered schemes. </para>

                <para class="block">The Medical Benefits Fund of Australia, which is the largest registered organization participating in this scheme, is completely owned by the British Medical Association. The only directors of the fund who have any say in its operation are members of the medical profession. Two groups of persons are involved in its operation, the members of the medical profession, and the contributors who have no say in the making of its rules. Contributors are not permitted to attend annual meetings of directors. They are not even entitled to receive notice of the holding of an annual meeting. The rules of the fund provide that seventeen of its 22 directors must be members of the medical profession. Only the medical directors are charged with the control and management of the fund. The rules provide that the five representatives of the contributors must be invited by the medical directors to be present at meetings. They cannot act in a representative capacity on behalf of the contributors. Some of the persons who have already been appointed as so-called contributors' representatives will obviously be yes-men for the council. Eighteen members out of 22 are medical men, and thirteen of them are members of Federal or State Councils of the British Medical Association. The set-up of this organization is the most extraordinary and undemocratic that I have ever seen in a public body. The inner core consists of medical men, who are really the "  topnotchers  " of the British Medical Association. A medical ring or curtain is drawn round them, and contributors will find it as impenetrable a5 the Iron Curtain itself. The contributors have no voice whatever in the conduct of the organization. They are not even entitled to receive notice of an annual meeting. I have no time to discuss the individual members, but I point out that they are leading physicians and surgeons who control the British Medical Association. I have had some researches made into this matter, and I shall reveal to honorable members the questions I asked, and the answers I received. The first question was as follows : - </para>

I remind honorable members that the Bankers Health Society was the parent of the Blue Cross Health and Insurance Society Limited and the approved organization, the Hospital Insurance Society Limited. Later, the Bankers Health Society changed its name to the Blue Cross Health and Insurance Society Limited and, as such, and by virtue of its ancillary, the Hospital Insurance Society Limited, it secured registration as an approved society under the hospital benefits regulations. I asked the Minister for Health some time ago to supply me with a statement about certain societies, some of which had been approved and others which had not been approved. Among those societies I listed the Hospital Insurance Society Limited. I now ask the Minister to investigate the affairs of that society, because I think that it is engaged in a wicked racket, issuing misleading advertisements, with the object of deluding contributors into the belief that they are getting something under the Government's scheme and something under other schemes* </para>

At Ii ist sight it would appear that the subsidiary has complied with the requirements to limit its expenses to 25 per cent, of contributions but, in fact, further heavy management expenses were incurred on this business by the collecting company, Allen Stanley and Co. Pty. Ltd. When all the operations of the Blue (/ross Health and Insurance Society Ltd., and its subsidiaries are taken into account, it is found that over 47 per cent, of the gross contributions were absorbed by management expenses during the half year to 30th June, 1952, and that very little income was available to build up reserves. </para>

                    <para>.- An examination of the position of these societies is extremely interesting. The whole matter requires constant attention. For many years, I have been a member of the board of management of one of the bigger country hospitals in Victoria. We conducted our own hospital benefits association. The organization had a membership of between 1,500 and 1,700 persons, who resided, in West Gippsland. The society was approved by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> The introduction of medical benefits made the work of the association more complicated, and recently, we transferred our activities to the Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria. I point out to the honorable member for Hoddle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cremean)</inline> that the rules governing the registration of such organizations are perfectly simple, and are adequate to safeguard the interests of contributors in every possible way. The registration committee will examine the books, accounts and membership records of all organizations that apply for registration. The Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria, which has an honorary board of directors, is gradually extending its membership and, with a few exceptions, it covers most of the State. There is a hospital benefits association that operates through the West Gippsland Hospital and a big organization in the Latrobe Valley. These are nonprofitmaking organizations conducted by the residents of those districts, and they are doing excellent work. We do not fear any trouble of the kind mentioned by the honorable member for Hoddle in the Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria, to which the organization in which I was formerly interested has transferred its fund. One of the leading doctors of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Victor</inline> Hurley, holds, I believe, the honorary post of  chairman  of the board of directors of the association. The representatives on the board are selected by the association of hospital managers and similar bodies. All the directors are unpaid and they really understand the work of hospitals and of hospital benefit organizations. There may be some teething troubles, of course, for a year or two with some of the organizations. I know that the one that the honorable member for Hoddle mentioned took on more than it could deal with and found itself in trouble. However, I strongly support the whole theory of hospital insurance and I pay a whole-hearted tribute to the honest and genuine efforts that have been made by first-class people with a deep and accurate knowledge of the health problems of the country who have undertaken the work of directing the activities of hospital benefit organizations.- </para>

                <para>I shall not discuss all the argument; that; have been advanced in favour of insurance or the provision of free medical benefits without insurance. A country that is prepared to spend as much as Australia, spends on tobacco, gambling, beer, and so forth, cannot raise a very convincing argument against the principle of people denying themselves a few slight pleasures in order to be responsible for their own welfare. Under the old Chifley plan, the hospital in which I was directly interested had private wards, intermediate wards and public ward?. For many years, about 30 per cent, of the hospital's patients were accommodated in public wards. However, under the Chifley scheme, more and more people applied for entry to the public wards, and the proportion rose to an average of about 40 per cent. On one famous occasion, a. woman arrived at the hospital in a new Bentley motor car and put her father in the public ward. We had him in that ward for some months before we  could get rid of him. Since this Government's scheme has been in operation, that hospital has re-established itself in a sound financial position, and there is no resentment anywhere in the district at the charge of 18s. a day that it makes for accommodation in the public wards. Its financial position is no longer desperate. Had the Chifley scheme continued in operation, we should probably be without hospitals. That hospital certainly would have had to close down. It had an enormous overdraft and had no chance of wiping off the deficit under Labour's plan. To-day, people are again interested in its management and are working for it and helping it. Hospital benefit associations are usually formed by people who have devoted a great deal of study to the heal th needs of the people, and the Minister is to be congratulated upon the fact that people of the highest public spirit, with an intimate knowledge of hospital problems, have come forward, under his plan, to form such bodies. Although the honorable member for Hoddle may know of one or two doubtful organizations, the plan will soon sort itself out. These organizations will become a valuable part of the life of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan),</inline> because L consider that the practice of blaming public officers for all the sins of omission and commission of registered organizations is most unfair. The honorable gentleman cited one example, of which there are many, of the loose thinking that lies behind the provisions of the bill. Certain important safeguards, which I consider to be essential to the effective operation of the Government's scheme, have been overlooked. I direct attention to clauses  72  to  76  inclusive, which deal with registered medical associations. They declare certain conditions of registration, provide for the appointment of officials to be known as public officers, specify their duties, and lay down penalties that may be imposed for failure to carry out those duties. Provision is made for the examination of the books and accounts of medical associations by officers of the Department of Health. The honorable member for McMillan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brown)</inline> has said that all these provisions were included for the protection of members of medical associations. That is all very well. The clauses may provide for the protection of members in a collective sense, but, as far as I can ascertain from a close study of the entire bill, there is a notable absence of safeguards to protect the personal interests of individual members. For example, there is no provision for the protection of members when they make claims upon associations. What will happen if a member calculates that he should receive a certain amount from his association, submits his account, but receives a much smaller amount? How can a member obtain justice if he considers that he has been unfairly treated? Apart from the provision for examination of the balance-sheets of medical associations, there is no provision for continual surveillance in order to ensure that individual contributors shall receive the services for which they pay and which they have been promised in the expensive advertisements that the associations have published. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>There is no provision to enforce an association to increase its staff as its membership increases. The Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria, which has been mentioned in these discussions, takes a long time to pay accounts submitted by its members. It claims that there are two reasons for these delays. The first is that doctors do not submit accounts in the proper form. The second is tl at the sheer volume of claims causes delay. Surely, if its membership has increased so much as to result in such a heavy volume of claims, it should be obliged to increase its office staff in order to cope with the extra work. What right of appeal will a contributor have against an arbitary and unfair decision to debar him from benefit on a technicality with which he is not familiar? The bill provides for no right of appeal. Apparently, every decision made by a medical association will be final and irrevocable. A board of appeal should be established in every State so that individual members may lodge protests against unfavorable decisions. Government supporters may say that a. contributor who has a grievance may refer it to his member of Parliament. What result can be achieved in that way? </para>
                <para class="block">The member of Parliament would have to refer the complaint to the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page).</inline> I realize that the right honorable gentleman is always willing to assist honorable members to the limit of his ability, but the most that he could do in this circumstance would be to request the association concerned to consider the contributor's complaint. Nothing more could be done if the association, refused to alter  it3  decision. This will result in a perpetual state of discontent amongst the membei-3 of associations. The Minister has erred considerably by failing to provide foi- a right of appeal against decisions made by medical associations. </para>
                <para>The situation would not be so bad if members had the right to vote upon the rules of medical associations.  I  am a member of an association, . but I am not aware of any right that I may have to express my views in relation to its rules. I have a complaint against this association because I have had to wait for seven weeks already for payment of benefit to which I am entitled. However, there is no authority to which I can appeal for help. The odds are tremendously in favour of the organization in the event of any dispute between it and an individual member. The member must accept the association's decision even though he may consider it to be unjust. That will not popularize the bill. I urge the Minister to amend it so as to provide for the protection of member's rights. </para>

The proposed amendment refers to sub-clause (5.) of clause 74. Of course, the entire clause has been designed for the purpose of providing for the appointment of public officers. These officials will be appointed specifically to carry out certain acts on behalf of the registered organizations, and it would be strange if they were not to be held responsible for their acts. This is not a novel principle.- There are many instances 'of a specific officer of a company being held responsible for the actions of the company. The amendment would free the officer in this case from all penalties. </para>

                        <para>- If we made provision for an officer of a company to be appointed to perform specific functions and said that he should be held to be blameless if those functions were not performed, we should nullify the purpose of appointing such an officer. I want to deal with the remarks made, by the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bird)</inline> about protecting the rights of contributors. I do not think any appeal boards or appeal tribunals have been established to protect the rights of people who take out policies with insurance companies. If an insurance company does not treat a person properly, that person has recourse to the ordinary processes of law. As the Minister has pointed out, contributors to hospital and medical benefits organizations are protected, not only by the ordinary processes of law, but also by clause 24 of the bill. I cannot see that anything would be gained if we accepted either the amendment moved by the honorable member for Reid or the suggestion of the honorable member for Batman. </para>

                    <para>. -  -I have been interested in the statement made about the expenses of some of these organizations, which have to do a lot of work for the Government. I do not know whether special provision has been made to recompense them for the clerical work they are doing on behalf of the Government. The honorable member, for Batman referred to delays in making payments due to shortages of staff in approved organizations. The Department of Health should look into that matter and ensure that members of these bodies get a proper deal. I do not agree with the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Donald Cameron)</inline> that if a contributor does not receive what he is entitled to, he should use the ordinary processes of law to enforce payment. These organizations are approved by th Government. If the Government insists that a person shall insure with an organization if he wishes to become entitled to. the benefits provided under this measure, it is the duty of the Government to see that that person receives the benefits to which he is entitled. I do not think he should have to go to law to get them. This matter, to a great extent, is bound up with the rules of the organizations. In clause 14, dealing with payments under the First Schedule, reference is made to payments in accordance with the rules of registered organizations. I think it is incumbent on the Government to see that people get what they are entitled to. I do not like the idea of contributors having to go to law to enforce payment by the organizations. </para>

                <para>Let us assume that a man makes a claim on a hospital benefits association, that the association disputes the claim on the ground that the disease for which he was treated in the hospital was in evidence before he applied for membership or that he is a chronic sufferer from the disease, and that the man disputes the contention of the association and claims he is entitled to payment. If the association does not pay its contribution of 6s. a clay, the man will not receive the Government benefit, because that is paid by the association and refunded by the Government. I should like to be sure that, when a dispute of that kind occurs, the person concerned can go to an office of the Department of Health and ask the officers there to look into the matter for him and ensure that he receives at least the appropriate payment from the Government. Even in the case of services and operations referred to in the Second Schedule, in respect of which payment is made only by the Government unless the rules of the&lt; association concerned permit it to make a payment also, the contributor is paid by the association, which is reimbursed by the Government. I hope the Minister will resolve the doubts that have arisen and assure the people that their interests will be protected. </para>

They wanted to place the responsibility in this connexion on certain officers and to make certain that those officers would do their jobs properly. They wanted also to ensure, if such an officer infringed the provisions of the measure owing to ignorance or circumstances partly beyond his control, that the offender could be dealt with leniently. The Government is not entirely satisfied with the clause as drafted, but it does not believe the amendment, moved by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> would cover the position. We shall consider the clause again, and, if it is possible to do so, we shall move an amendment, in the Senate to overcome the difficulty that has arisen. </para>

                        <para>- The Government will also consider that matter. The honorable member for Hoddle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cremean)</inline> and other honorable members referred to certain organizations. The Bankers Health Society was in existence for a long time before the present hospital and medical 'benefits scheme was put into operation. When I examined the affairs of the society, I came to the conclusion that, in the form in which it then existed, it could not possibly discharge its obligations to insured people. However, 80,000 or 90,000 people were insured with the society at that time. The problem with which we were eonfronted was to protect the rights of those people and the equity that they had established over a number of years. I discussed the matter very fully with officials of the society. I explained that it was quite impossible for the Government to accept it as  a  registered organization in its existing form, but I said that if they formed a completely new organization that conformed to the requirements of the Government's scheme, we should be prepared to approve that organization for the purposes of the scheme. A nonprofit making organizationwas formed to deal with hospital insurance. When the question of the sister organization to deal with medical benefits arose, we said we could not accept that organization. The position is not very satisfactory. We have not been able to do anything with regard to the organization. We have suggested that its members should join other societies. Honorable members may have read that the big friendly societies and the medical benefits society have offered to accept the members of the other society for medical benefits purposes on the same basis as if those members had been continuously insured with them. The members have lost no rights and have suffered no loss. </para>

                <para>Let me explain what we have done to safeguard the public and prevent the position from arising in which an organization will not or cannot pay the benefits to which its members are entitled. Continuous supervision over all registered hospital and medical benefits organizations is exercised by expert officers of the Department of Health and by the special registration committee, consisting of the Commonwealth Actuary or his delegate and two officers of the Department of Health. This supervision is primarily directed towards ensuring the financial stability of the organizations and safeguarding the funds of contributors. Clause 67 provides, in effect, that a medical benefits organization shall not be eligible to apply for registration unless its rules authorize it to use contributions to its medical benefits fund only for the purpose of paying medical benefits and meeting administrative expenses incurred in connexion with the receipt of contributions and the payment of benefits. Clause 68 contains comparable provisions with respect to hospital benefits. </para>
                <para>Each organization seeking registration is required to furnish certified copies of it's constitution, rules, accounts and balance-sheet, as well as particulars of membership. It is impracticable to insist on membership lists being kept completely up to date, because the staffs of the organizations are working very hard on the enrolment of new members and the payment of claims. The organizations have said that if we insist on membership lists being brought up to date each week, they cannot, with their present staff, pay accounts quickly, as they are eager to do. So we have said that can be done each month instead of each week. </para>
                <para>The accounts, rules, rates of contribution, benefits provided and all other particulars, are examined and analysed by trained officers of the Department of Health, and a report on them is referred to the registration committee. Honorable members will remember that clause 23 provides for two methods of payment. The first method is that the contributor shall pay his bill and get a refund from the organization, and the second is that the organization shall pay the benefit and the contributor shall pay the difference between that and the total charge. We have been astonished to learn that the second method has been used by only a small number of people. About one in every 1,000 contributors has taken advantage of that method. The great majority of them prefer to pay their bills and seek a refund from their organization. If contributors had asked the organizations to make payments for them if there was any hardship, they would not have had the worry to which reference has been made. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Opposition desires to submit several amendments in this group of clauses. The first applies toclause 95. That clause reads - </para>

                <para>That, in sub-clause (1.), the words "may, if he thinks fit," be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word " shall ". </para>
                <para class="block">As honorable members will perceive, if the amendment is accepted the clause will provide that where the authority of a medical practitioner or a chemist has been suspended or revoked, the Minister shall cause notice of that action to be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> I hope that the Minister will see fit to adopt this amendment, because nothing; contained in it will in any way injure the effective working of the scheme ; it will merely assist in its operation. Under the present provisions of the measure, a chemist is prohibited from filling a prescription which has been written by a doctor whose authority has been suspended or revoked. Clause 133 specifically provides that a chemist, a medical practitioner or a hospital authority shall not supply for the purposes of. that part of the measure a pharmaceutical benefit on a prescription written by a medical practitioner whose authority has been suspended or revoked. But the bill will afford no protection to the chemist concerned in such a transaction, and the chemist will have no way of knowing for certain whether a prescription brought to him has been written by an authorized doctor. How would it be possible for a chemist to know whether a doctor's prescription brought to his shop to be filled, has been written by a medical practitioner who has been authorized to write it, unless the Minister is required to publish notice of suspension or revocation of authorities in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette?</inline></para>
                <para>If the operation of the " guillotine " permits, the Opposition will also submit an amendment to sub-clause (4.) of clause 96. Clause 96 deals with appeals against thesuspension or revocation of an approval or an authority, and it lays down that upon appeal a supreme court shall have regard to the evidence before a committee of inquiry, and the report of the committee. But, a committee of inquiry isinno way limited by the rules of evidence. In its hearing it can take into account hearsay evidence or any kind of testimony that it thinks fit. The committee can then decide to suspend or revoke an authority, and the person affected has the right of appeal to., a supreme court. But the court has no power to demand further evidence or to arrange for the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The Opposition believes that the considerations of ordinary justice require that that provision should be amended. The relevant part of the clause at present reads- </para>

                <para class="block">A further amendment that we desire to submit relates to clause 122. The clause reads - 122. The proceedings of a Committee shall be held in private. </para>

                <para>A further clause to which we direct attention is clause 133, which reads -  133. - (1.) When the authority conferred upon a medical practitioner by section eightyseven of this Act is suspended or revoked, that medical practitioner shall not, during the period of suspension or after the revocation takes effect, write a prescription for the purposes of Part VII. of this Act. </para>
                <para class="block">The Opposition proposes to move at a later stage as follows: - </para>
                <para>That, in sub-clause (1.), after the word  revoked", the following worths be inserted: - " Notice thereof shall be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> and,". </para>
                <para class="block">Clause 133 deals with the effect of a suspension or cancellation of an approval or authority. The Opposition's proposed amendment is an attempt to ensure that all those who are required to know of the revocation or suspension of an authority shall have a means of obtaining that knowledge. There are various other matters that the Opposition desires to bring before the committee during the consideration of these clauses, but for the moment I confine myself to moving the amendment to clause 95. </para>

                    <para>. - I am not sure of the legal interpretation of the words "may" and "shall" as used in the clause and amendment, because whenever I have asked lawyers about them I have never been able to obtain a satisfactory answer. In fact, it seems to he a case of tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee. Surely it is in the interest of the Government to ensure that all chemists shall be notified when a person's authorityhas been withdrawn. The fact that the Government has inserted clause 95 in the bill indicates its desire, and the changing of one word from "may" to " shall " seems to be quite superfluous. I now draw attention to clause 98, which is designed to enable payment to he made for the supply of medical benefits by a chemist and by hospital authorities. That c lause reads, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia -</inline> (1.) The Minister may determine the rates at which, and the conditions subject to which, payments shall be made in respect of the supply of pharmaceutical benefits . . . </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">It is obvious that the Minister must confer with somebody in relation to pharmaceutical, medical and hospital benefits. Clause 33 indicates that the conferring body in regard to medical benefits is the British Medical Association in Australia. Clause 98 does not mention with whom the Minister is to confer in regard to pharmaceutical benefits, hut it seems to be obvious that he will confer with the representative of chemists throughout Australia, that is thebody known as the Federated Pharmaceutical Services Guild of Australia. The Minister has referred to this body from time to time, and has expressed his appreciation for the assistance that it has rendered to him in solving the problems of this complex bill. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that he should consider inserting in the clause words such as these, " after consultation with the Federated Pharmaceutical Services Guild of Australia ", to put it beyond all doubt that that is the body that he will consult. Then the clause would read - </para>

The Standing Orders provide distinctly that, if the  Chairman  of Committees gives the call to an honorable member and another honorable member rises, an honorable member may move that the second member be heard. The honorable member for Grayndler did not take advantage of the opportunity at the time. Now the right honorable the Minister for Health has the call. </para>

                    <para>.- In order to understand the measures proposed in the clauses under consideration it is necessary, first, to understand the machinery that has been developed for the provision of pharmaceutical benefits. A list of drugs is compiled by an advisory committee which consists of four specialist highly qualified physicians and a pharmacologist. Provision has been made in this bill to add to the committee a. pharmaceutical chemist .because it is believed that the practical knowledge possessed by such a person would be of great assistance to it. The secretary of the committee is also a chemist and an officer of the Department of Health. It is the function of the committee to determine which life-saving drugs should be placed on the list. A great many drugs, especially those of the antibiotic variety, ar,e being manufactured and produced. Some of them have very definite side effects, which makes their use dangerous. Some are extraordinarily scarce and it is difficult to provide supplies of them all over the Commonwealth. The principle underlying the pharmaceutical benefits scheme envisaged in this bill is exactly the same as that in the original act. Life-saving drugs are to be made available free to all residents of Australia. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Obviously, if a drug is in short supply, it cannot be placed on the free list because, if that were done, supplies would quickly run out and the drug would not be available for the treatment of the specific diseases for the treatment of which it was prepared. The committee decides which drugs should be placed on the list, and provision has been made in the bill that, its decisions shall be binding. The Minister is obliged to accept its recommendations. The bill also provides that no drug shall be placed on the free list unless its inclusion on the list has been recommended by the committee. </para>

                        <para>- No. The committee bases its decisions mostly on the side effect of the drug. Let us consider, for instance, the effects of the use of cortisone. Although cortisone is valuable for the treatment of certain conditions, its therapeutic value in certain instances tends to diminish very rapidly. In some instances, within a period of two or three weeks a patient who has been administered cortisone suffers a relapse, and his condition becomes worse than it was before the treatment began. In other instances the use of cortisone creates a condition of euphoria, an extraordinary sense of well-being, which may disguise a ruptured gastric ulcer or gall bladder. In some instances, after a patient has died the post-mortem discloses that his real condition was completely disguised by the condition of euphoria brought about by the use of cortisone. In order to derive the greatest advantage from certain kinds of drugs we must use them only for the treatment of specific diseases. It is one of the functions of the advisory committee to determine the diseases for the treatment of which certain drugs are to be used. The committee is assisted by a research organization, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Thompson</inline> is the head, which is associated with the National Health and Medical Research Council. The members of the organization, from their comprehensive  knowledge  gained from contacts all over the world, are able to give advice  of great value to the committee. In that way the supply of life-saving drugs is preserved and steps are taken to see they are properly used. If life-saving drugs are used for the treatment of diseases which may be cured by other means the patient's blood may become so affected that they are no longer of value to him. Again, the patient may develop an allergy which prevents their continued use. </para>

                <para>No hard and fast rules have been laid down for the compilation of the list. Provision has been made in the bill and by regulation that additional diseases may be included in the list in instances where or her forms of treatment have failed to effect a cure. Diseases may be added to the limited list of diseases on the recommendation of the  Deputy  Director-General of Health who acts upon the advice of the Royal Australian College of Physicians. </para>
                <para>Arrangements have been made with the Federated Pharmaceutical Services Guild of Australia to ensure that these life-saving drugs shall be properly dispensed. When the bill is before the Senate an amendment will be proposed to clause 98 for the purpose of enabling the Minister to determine the basic rates at which these drugs -.hall be sold to the Government. To insert the amendment in the bill at this stage would delay its despatch to the Senate for consideration. I mention that matter because the honorable member for  Isaacs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haworth)</inline> has made representations on that subject. I inform the honorable member and the committee generally that the omission of the words proposed to be added in the amendment which will be moved when the bill is before the Senate was merely an oversight on the part of the Government when the bill was being drafted. The drugs will be distributed free on a doctor's prescription. Unfortunately, in respect of anything that is free there is always a possibility of abuse. Abuses could occur by doctors overprescribing the drugs, or by the waste of drugs, either, in the homes of patients or in other ways. There may be collusion between a dishonest doctor and a dishonest chemist. A dishonest chemist may write ficticious prescriptions for the drugs. In order to guard against such abuses the professions have established disciplinary committees. The British Medical Association first offered the services of these disciplinary committees to the Government in 1950. They are staffed by men of the highest standing in the professions. Committees have been established in each State, each consisting of four men chosen by the Government from a panel of eminent men especially associated with this class of work. Certain provisions in the bill relate to the manner in which the disciplinary committees shall take evidence and carry out their task. The motion proposed by the Opposition which relates to this matter will be dealt with by the lawyers on this side of , the chamber because of the legal technicalities involved. They will explain the objects of the relevant clauses in the bill. </para>
                <para>When life-saving drugs were first made available free of charge some members of the medical profession, especially young doctors, tended to prescribe them overgenerously. As the result of the guidance of senior members of the profession and the activities of the disciplinary committees we have been able substantially to reduce the use of these drugs and their cost to the community. Last year the pharmaceutical benefits scheme cost approximately £800,000 less than in the preceding year, notwithstanding the fact that the population had increased by approximately 200,000 persons. That was largely duc to the fact that abuses were less prevalent and the volume of drugs wasted in the homes of patients had been greatly reduced. We have made pharmaceutical benefits available free in all public hospitals of the States from the date of the signing of the hospital agreement where we are satisfied with the method of control. We have told the States that we would pay for them, retrospectively to the date of their signing of the agreement. . That has involved the Commonwealth in an expenditure of £1,300,000 in a period of two years. We have told the States to use these drugs because we are satisfied that they will shorten the duration of illnesses, in some instances, by many days, and thus materially help the turnover of beds in hospitals. If we are able to shorten the duration of stay of a patient in a hospital from fourteen to twelve days we are in the position of having the equivalent of 14 per cent, or 15 per cent, additional beds at our disposal. These drugs are very potent and are quickacting. In many cases of pneumonia, which in earlier years took three or four weeks to cure, we are able to abort the attack and to get the patient fairly well in two or three days. We have made a test of the effect of the use of these drugs in Canberra, which is well suited to tests of that kind. We found that we were able to save 15 per cent, of patients from having to go into hospital who otherwise would have had to do so. The drugs are administered in the home of the patient and thus the use of a hospital bed is avoided. The cost of curing the patient is very materially reduced. </para>
                <para>I mentioned earlier the work of the disciplinary committees of the professions associated with this scheme because of the terms of the motion proposed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser)</inline> in relation to clause 95. If the honorable member will examine the bill he will observe that penalties may be imposed by the Minister, on the recommendation of the disciplinary committees, on persons who commit offences against the provisions of the legislation. Some of these offences are due to carelessness. Others are committed in an attempt to defraud the Government. Still others are due to ignorance. One of the best ways in which to deal with delinquency is through publicity. The publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of the information that a person is guilty of certain misdemeanours brings the fact to the notice of all his professional contacts, and does him some measure of harm. However, we consider that if the penalty for minor misdemeanours is too stiff, the punishment will not exactly fit the crime. An idea of the difficulty in this matter may be gained from tie experience of dealing with ramps when price-fixing was in operation. When too severe penalties were provided by the law, the prosecution found it almost impossible to obtain convictions. What is the reason for this provision in the bill ? A professional man may be suspended for- a week or a fortnight while the inquiry is proceeding, and then it is found that he has committed only a minor misdemeanour through ignorance or carelessness ra ther than through actual deceit or fraud. In those circumstances, the committee may consider that the period of suspension is sufficient punishment without publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> I remind the honorable member for Eden-Monaro that professional committees have always been most insistent that the maximum penalty should be imposed. The departmental representative might be inclined to be lenient, but the professional members would probably insist upon a severe penalty. Therefore, it is advisable that the Minister should have discretionary power. The damage done to thu practice of a professional man by an inquiry and the resultant publicity may be regarded as sufficient punishment. In that event, it would not be wise to publish the matter in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> If tie law ' provided that every adverse finding must be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> that fact, might cause a committee to exonerate a person who should not go scot-free. Therefore, the Government considers that this discretionary power should be allowed. </para>
                <para>The next point that arises is how information about the imposition of a penalty shall be conveyed to the people who really matter. They, of course, arc the doctors, chemists and hospitals. Our idea is that they should be notified that the man concerned has been suspended. The suspension might take effect immediately, because fraud is suspected. The man may be suspended at the beginning of the inquiry, and, in that event, if he was a doctor, the chemists and hospitals should be notified. </para>

                <para class="block">No provision is made for u dentist to write a prescription for the supply of a pharmaceutical benefit for the purposes of this Part. I point out that members of the dental profession are highly qualified and responsible persons, and that they may be entrusted with that authority. They contend that under the provisions of the bill they will not be authorized to prescribe certain drugs for their patients. A prescription has to be issued by a medical practitioner. In other words, a dentist must send a patient to a doctor for a prescription. The patient will be put to additional expense, and will he subjected to worry and delay. Thu waiting rooms of medical practitioners will be cluttered up with patients of dentists. Sometimes, delay in such matters is prejudicial to the health of a patient. </para>
                <para>The indiscriminate use of drugs is not sought by the dental profession. Actually, dentists are interested in only twelve drugs and some vitamins. Members of the dental profession are well aware of the need for discrimination in the use of antibiotics. They are highly qualified men who underwent a long university course, and any notification of the need for special precautions could be issued to them through the Australian Dental Association. Representatives of the dental profession have made a list of the drugs with which they are concerned. Some of them are very simple. The first is distilled water. I did not know that it was regarded as a drug, but nevertheless, it is included in the list. The other drugs are as follows:penicillin, penicillin oily, procaine penicillin crystalline, procaine penicillin oily, sulphadiazine, sulphamerazine, sulphathiazole, sulphanilamide, sulphonamides mixed A, sulphonamides mixed B, sulphonamides mixed C, vitamin K aqueous, vitamin K oily, vitamin K oral, </para>
                <para>The dentists ask for authority to prescribe those drugs instead of being obliged to send their patients to medical practitioners for the necessary prescriptions. I consider that the dentists have a sound case, which should be carefully considered by the Minister. They would like to know why the law gives a dental practitioner the right to administer those drugs, but deprives him of the right to write prescriptions for the supply of drugs which are pharmaceutical benefits. "Why should a dental practitioner and his patients be placed at a disadvantage when the administration of therapeutic drugs is required immediately, while no such restriction is placed on a medical practitioner and his patient? The dentists should be included in the bill to the limited degree that I have stated. The cost to the community would not be great, because few dental patients would be involved. </para>
                <para>I submit this ease on behalf of members of the dental profession, and urge the Minister to give careful attention to this most important matter in the interests of dentists who are trying to do their best to treat their patients expeditiously and effectively, and also in the interests of patients who are put to  additional expense, because only medical practitioners are authorized to write prescriptions for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. </para>

                <para>But that is not the subject with which the committee is principally concerned at the moment. We are now considering amendments proposed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser)</inline> to clauses 95, 96, 122 and 123. All those clauses are machinery provisions, which follow the power given to the Minister under clause 94 to cancel the authority of a medical practitioner to pre-  scribe and a chemist to supply pharmaceutical benefits. Clause 94 enables the Department of Health, through the Minister,  to police the prescription and supply of pharmaceutical benefits under this legislation. It is obvious that the Minister must have power to police the supply of drugs, and control the medical profession and the pharmaceutical profession in -order to ensure that the terms of the act shall not be evaded. The amendments are directed at machinery provisions which follow those clauses. </para>
                <para class="block">The first amendment which has been moved is to clause 95 and seeks, to compel the Minister to give  notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of the cancellation of the authority of a doctor or chemist. That is not a matter of great importance,  hut I should have imagined that a doctor or- a, chemist would consider it preferable that the Minister should not be obliged to give notification of a cancellation of authority when he did not deem it to be necessary. Obviously, it would not be in the interests of the doctor or chemist, whose authority was cancelled,   that  the whole world should be advised -,of that fact. The Minister has the power, !&gt;|if he  wishes  to use it in the public interest, to publish in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notification of the cancellation of authority. The bill is correct in its present form. I consider that the Minister should possess a discretionary power to advertise or not. </para>
                <para>The next amendment  which has been foreshadowed is to : -.clause 96, which gives a doctor or chemist affected by the cancellation of his authority the right of appeal. The authority is cancelled in the first instance by a committee established under thi3 legislation. The committee, whether it be a medical committee or a pharmaceutical committee, consists of the Director-General and four members of the profession of the person concerned, that is, four doctors or four practising chemists. In accordance with the bill those members sit in private, and that is perfectly correct, for reasons that I shall explain later. The committee is authorized to recommend the cancellation of the authority of a doctor or a chemist. The Minister has power to act on that recommendation, and cancel the authority. The doctor or chemist concerned then has the right. of appeal to the Supreme Court of a State. The amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro seeks to give the court authority to re-hear the whole of the proceedings that have taken place before the committee. I do not consider that to be desirable. Under the bill in its present form, the court has a definite, defined duty to perform, and that is to determine whether the Minister has acted, reasonably on the evidence presented to him by the committee. If the court is to be given power to re-hear a case, an administrative discretion would, in effect, be given to it upon it. The Minister, in cancelling an authority, exercises an administrative discretion conferred upon him under the bill. A person who objects to the cancellation may then appeal to the court, and the court determines whether the Minister has acted reasonably on the evidence submitted to the committee. If we impose on the ' court the duty of re-hearing the wholes-matter, we shall transfer the administrative authority under this legislation from the Minister to the court. I assure any member of : the Opposition who considers that to be the. correct and; -proper, course to  follow that there is ample authority to the contrary in decisions of the High Court. This is not a criminal matter. The situation would be different if the proceedings before the medical committee involved a criminal penalty. Then, perhaps, it would be correct to suggest that the court should re-hear the matter. However, that is not the situation. We are considering an administrative inquiry to determine whether or not a chemist or doctor is fit to have authority to prescribe or administer benefits under this legislation. The Minister's discretion will be an administrative discretion. That fact is inescapable. To give the Supreme Court power to re-hear the whole matter would be to confer that administrative discretion upon it, which would be highly undesirable. I shall he happy to inform honorable members opposite, if they are interested, of the legal authorities contained in decisions of the High Court to which I have referred. They are too numerous for me to mention now. </para>
                <para>The next foreshadowed amendment refers to clause 133 which deals with the consequences that will follow upon the withdrawal of the authority of a chemist or doctor. The Opposition seeks to oblige the Minister to give notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of the withdrawal of authority. My earlier remarks apply also to this proposal. It is highly desirable, in the interests of the doctors or chemists concerned, that the Minister should not be obliged to advertise their misfortune if he does not think such action to be necessary. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro made much of the suggestion that a chemist could be penalized for having supplied pharmaceutical benefits on the prescription of a doctor who had lost his authority under the legislation. There is little substance in that objection. Nobody will suggest that the Department of Health would launch a prosecution against a chemist if he could satisfy it that he had been unaware that the doctor's authority had been withdrawn. The department instead would seek to punish the doctor, and severe penalties are provided for a doctor who issues prescriptions after his authority has been withdrawn. </para>
                <para>The final amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro refers to clause 122, which provides that the proceedings of committees shall be held in private. The Opposition proposes that committees shall have discretion to' order inquiries to be held in public if they think fit. This proposal, too, is undesirable in the interests of doctors and chemists because, as I have said, these inquiries will be administrative, not judicial or criminal investigations. The rules of evidence will not apply, and it would not be common justice for such inquiries to be conducted in public. In view of the facts that I have stated, the committee will be well advised to reject all four of the amendments moved by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. </para>

                    <para>.- I refer to the amendment of clause 95 proposed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser),</inline> which has been summarily dismissed by the honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne).</inline> The Opposition considers that the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir. Earle Page)</inline> should be required to publish in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice of the suspension or revocation of the authority conferred upon a doctor or chemist under the terms of this legislation. There should be no doubt about the matter. Clause 94 indicates that authority or approval cannot be suspended or revoked unless the offence committed by the doctor or chemist has been of a serious, nature. Therefore, publication of the name of the" off fender in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> is warranted. The proposal to give the Minister discretion in this matter has a dangerous significance. Unless the clause is amended, the Minister will have power over trie ' livelihood of certain doctors and chemists. Why should he have the right to decide whether all or any of the names of chemists and doctors who have committed offences should be published? Any doctor or chemist whose name is published will be known throughout Australia as an offender, whereas those whose names are not published will be let off lightly. Such discretionary power tends to lead to favoritism, and the enactment of the clause- in its present form would establish a dangerous precedent. The Minister could ruin the reputation of a chemist or a. doctor by deciding to publish his name whilst keeping secret the names of others who had' contravened the legislation. Either it should be mandatory upon the Minister to publish the name of every such offender, or the publication of names in such circumstances should be forbidden. The Opposition considers that the wisest course to follow is to make it obligatory for the Minister to publish the names of all offenders in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline></para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Why, should doctors or chemists receive special treatment that is not afforded to other people who break the law ? Lawyers who contravene their articles, and politicians who step off the straight and narrow path, have their names' blazoned in headlines in the newspapers. Nobody worries about the smashing of the charac  ter  Qf a' politician, a lawyer or a union Officer. Doctors and chemists should not be treated as a special class in the community. Clause 95 provides for a kind of discrimination that is absolutely distasteful to me, and, I 'believe, to all of my colleagues. Clause after clause in the bill provides that doctors and chemists, for whom generally I have a very high regard, shall be placed in a special category as untouchables. This sort of discrimination in favour of a small group of citizens is opposed to the traditions of British fair play. The amendment proposed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro is perfectly just and reasonable. All offenders under the provisions of the bill should be treated alike. Either every name should 'be published,  ot  none should be published. I wholeheartedly oppose the idea of giving the Minister power to ruin the reputation of one chemist or doctor whilst allowing others to go virtually free. </para>
                <para>Mir. McMAHON (Lowe - Minister for the Navy and Minister for Air) [8.42]. - I shall discuss only the amendment to clause 96 foreshadowed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Eraser).</inline> . Under clause 94, the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> will have power, after investigation and report by a committee of inquiry, to suspend or revoke the authority or approval conferred .upon :a medical practitioner or a chemist under this legislation. The important fact is that the Minister will not be able to exercise that power unless the appropriate committee has first made a recommendation to him. This is, in fact, an administrative power, and the Minister alone is the proper person to exercise such power. Acceptance of the foreshadowed amendment would confer upon the persons concerned the right of appeal to a court on what the Opposition claims to be a judicial matter. I propose to show, first, that the amendment is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the law ; secondly, that it is unnecessary -. and, thirdly, that in any case it is nonsensical. I remind honorable members of a recent pharmaceutical benefits case before the High Court in which a legal provision in terms almost identical with the amendment proposed by the Opposition was in dispute. The High Court, held that the Supreme Court could, not, validly he required to exercise an undefined discretion concerning the suspension or withdrawal of the approval of  an  appellant; in other words, that the court could not be asked to exercise an .administrative, rather than a judicial function. In another recent case, the High Court held unanimously that section 77 of the Constitution does not authorize the nesting in a State court of functions that are essentially administrative and not judicial. The bill provides for an administrative function to he exercised by the Minister, but honorable members opposite suggest that that function should be exercised by a court, although they should know that it Gould not validly %e exercised by a court. If this amendment were accepted, probably it would be- held to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> and of no effect. </para>
                <para>As I understand the arguments presented by the 'Opposition during this debate and prior to the hill coming before the Parliament, there are two questions with which they are chiefly concerned.

If the amendment were- accepted, it would have no effect in law. In any event, it is unnecessary, because ample protection is given to individuals by clauses 110 and 124 (4.). </para>
                <para>Let me deal with the question whether the amendments make sense. I say quite emphatically that they do not. It is proposed that clause 96 should be amended by the insertion of a new su'b-clause, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> of which provides that, upon an appeal under this provision, the court may have regard to the evidence before the committee of inquiry and report to the committee. What on earth does that mean? Surely honorable members opposite do not want the court to report back to the committee. Tim amendment would make sense only if lt stated that the court should have regard to the evidence  before  the committee and the report of the committee. The proposed amendment is quite absurd, and would have to be inter preted b.y, some, court of la.w. The. suggestion that the clause be amended to provide that the court shall <inline font-style="italic">\e</inline> empowered  to  demand, instead of admit, further: evidence is extraordinary. Frankly, I do not think it is. intended to, be taken seriously. All that the amendment could be designed to do is to make unwilling witnesses come before the court by means of a subpoena. Provision i,s already made for ' that in the Judiciary Act and other acts. That amendment, could, have been foreshadowed OnlY foi: political purposes,, because it could have no real effect in law. </para>
                <para>The third paragraph of the proposed amendment to clause 96 is quite unnecessary, in view of section 79 of the Judiciary Act, which provides that the laws of' each State, including the laws relating to procedure, evidence and the competency of witnesses shall, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth, be binding on all courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that State in all cases to which they are applicable. The proposal that the Mil should be amended to provide that, upon an appeal, a court should permit the examination and cross-examination of witnesses is, in the light of section 79 of the Judiciary Act, nonsensical. I do not think it was put forward seriously by the Opposition. If the amendments were accepted, they would have no effect in law. I do not think they ftr-9 necessary. Upon analysis, it is obvious that no great care was exercised in. drafting the amendments, because they are unnecessary and, in one instance, nonsensical, </para>

Under this bill, a committee before proceeding to deal with a case, may have to decide whether the excuse given by a doctor or chemist for failing to attend the hearing is valid. If the committee decides against, the doctor or chemist, its report will be the only thing that can he examined by either the Minister for Health or the appeal court.

                        <para>- May it not be that the thousands of doctors and chemists in this country are not aware of the provisions of this clause? If a committee decided that the excuse given by a doctor or chemist for failing to appear before it was invalid and proceeded to determine the case in the absence of the man concerned, I hesitate to think what a properly constituted court would say if it were required to adjudicate on an appeal from the decision of the committee but was denied the right to hear evidence given by the appellant and his witnesses. These committees, which will determine whether professional men shall retain their means of livelihood in some instances, will have powers not possessed by other similar bodies. The Minister may believe that the provisions of clause 124 (4.) are satisfactory, hut let him consider clause 324  (5.)  and then state whether he still holds the same opinion. I suggest that the amendment moved by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro cannot do any harm to the Minister or to the committees of inquiry, and that it may well do some good. Any Minister for Health may be biased in favour of a report by a committee that he has set up. Occasionally, doctors in a certain area become hostile towards one of their colleagues, and it is not unknown for them to refuse to administer anaesthetics for him, or render him any other assistance. If this provision becomes law, and that doctor is brought before a. committee evidence will be given against him by the other doctors  in iris area who have shown their hostility towards him. I hesitate to think of the terms of a committee's report about such a doctor. All reports of these committees are to be sent to the Minister for Health, and I have no doubt that the Minister, ' whether he be the present Minister' or any future Minister, will be biased iri favour of those reports. But the reports, as I have shown, might be based on evidence that could not be described as impartial or unbiased. If the Opposition's amendment is accepted, justice will be done to all doctors including those who are unpopular with their colleagues. A doctor whom a committee has reported against should have the right to ordinary justice and should be allowed to call fresh evidence before the appeal court in order to obtain the justice that might have been denied to him by the committee. </para>

The amendment is reasonable because the discriminatory power which will be vested in the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> by clause 95 should not be so vested. It would be idle for honorable members to deny that certain undesirable practices have come into being under previous legislation of this type. Some months ago I directed a question to the Minister for Health in which I asked him whether it was not a fact that a practice known as channelling was growing in relation to this very matter that we are discussing. The Minister very indignantly repudiated my charges, but I believe it is well known that the practice known as channelling is continuing. Indeed, I have in my possession a letter from, a chemist which substantiates the charges about channelling that I have made. This gentleman has a chemist's shop in a country town in New South Wales, and he says that for the first three months of this year he has received,' about £40 -from the .Department of Health when he should have received :,bout £180.

                        <para>- It is not for me to stop it, but more vigorous action than has been taken by the Minister so far is required. Surely the Government is not adopting a defeatist attitude and admitting that channelling is going on but that it cannot do anything about it. The attitude of the Government is apparently demonstrated by the honorable member for Isaacs, who interjected, " How can we stop it ". Channelling is depriving some chemists of legitimate business, because it is being indulged in by some members of the medical profession, in alliance with chemists, completely against the spirit of the law. The Government should take a firm stand on this matter, and try to do something for those members of the pharmaceutical profession who have some conscience and scruples, and who are trying to observe the law. Such men should be protected, and the Government should not be balked  by the attitude of some honorable members .who say, " How can we stop it ". It is obvious that honorable members on the Government side know that channelling is going on, and I hope that the Minister will take a firm stand on this matter and instruct his departmental .officers that they must enforce the provisions of the law and not allow a defeatist attitude to cloud their approach to the matter. The Department of Health should uphold those who are trying to observe the law rather than encourage those who arc breaking it. </para>

That was illustrated recently in Sydney when a citizen and a police sergeant were involved in a court case. Their careers and characters were involved, but as the result of appeals to higher courts the characters of the individuals were cleared. This measure should ensure that full justice shall be done to all those who take part in the scheme. With regard to .pharmaceutical benefits, the Minister still pins his faith to what are known as life-saving drugs, in the face of the vast quantity of worthless junk that has been dumped into this country and the fact that 95 per cent, of these drugs have been completely wasted because of overdosing. The Minister would do well not to rely so much on these wonder .drugs, and to investigate more closely the procedure adopted under the Chifley scheme of allowing the medical profession to proscribe simpler, cheaper and more effective drugs.

Beechamp called them mycrozymas. In the positive .state, according to him, they are life's primal architects, or body builders. In the negative state, when the body is in a state of lowered resistance, they evolve into bacteria and become destructive in their nature, but .they are inherent in the .system.

The predicament of the medical profession in relation  to  these wonder drugs provides further confirmation of the Bechamp doctrine.

Those vitamins probably would be much more effective than the lifesaving drugs, and many of the abuses to which honorable members have referred would he eliminated. The right honorable gentleman indicated the correct approach before he became Minister for Health.  His  line of attack on the -Chifley Government's pharmaceutical benefits scheme was that it was not necessary to prescribe all these drugs. He said that one could not get good health out of a bottle of medicine, and I do not think that one can obtain it out of a bottle of antibiotic pills. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not wish to waste the time of the committee, but I cannot allow to pass unchallenged the extraordinary statement that was made by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> when he referred to all the new antibiotics as blunder drugs and when he suggested that it would be a good idea to give them all away and return to the use of the ordinary drugs and chemicals that are set out in the <inline font-style="italic">British</inline><inline font-style="italic">Pharmacopoeia.</inline> If one looks at the mortality figures since the antibiotics were introduced, he realizes how effective they have been. The number of deaths from lobar pneumonia fell from 2,099 in 1920 to 678 in 1952, in spite of the fact that the population of Australia has risen from 5,000,000 to nearly 9,000,000 people. The number of deaths from tuberculosis fell from. 3,607 to 1,289, the number of deaths from meningitis fell from 596 to 145 and the number of deaths from puerperal septicaemia, fell from 250 to 5. I am more inclined to agree with the statement that was made by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> when he impressed on the committee the necessity to provide safeguards in relation to the standards of the drugs and chemicals that were supplied - drugs whose therapeutic effect has been demonstrated. </para>

                <para>The human race is very gullible in relation to medicines. I am sure that the honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Donald Cameron)</inline> will understand that statement. For some reason the human race is easily influenced and because of its gullibility and credulity there is always an obliging crowd of charlatans and quacks who will cater for its wants. That is not a new thing. I do not know whether the honorable member for Oxley remembers the case of the famous Joanna Stephens in the clays of Queen Anne. Joanna Stephens had a famous remedy for a stone in a certain part of the anatomy to which I need not refer. Of course, gout was the prevailing disease in those days. People with all sorts of conditions turned their back on the college of physicians and went to Joanna Stephens. She said that as a public benefactress she would sell her remedy to the people, and a public fund was opened. The church and many other people supported her. She wanted £5,000 for the prescription, hut, in spite of a great public effort, the £5,000 was not forthcoming. The Government then, under public pressure, set up a committee which comprised three of the most eminent doctors in the land. The unanimous decision of the doctors was as follows : - </para>

                <para class="block">The clamour was so great that the British Parliament then passed a special act which provided for the giving of a reward to Joanna Stephens. After she received the £5,000, she published her prescription. The medicine was a decoction containing boiled herbs and soap, with swine's cresses burnt to blackness. That was only for the purpose of disguising it, she said. There were also pills consisting of wild carrot and burdock seeds, hips and hawes reduced to ashes with  alicant  soap and honey and a powder which was composed of roasted egg-shells crushed with garden snails in the month of May. This barn-yard rubbish was supplied by Joanna Stephens. The British -Government paid her £5,000 for. it ! .. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I refer also to the occasion when Benjamin Franklin was deceived. He had a god-son whose name was Graham. Graham was a super-  quack. He practised at a place which was situated between Blackfriars and Westminster Bridge, in London. In the vestibule of that place there was an enormous heap of crutches and walking sticks which he proudly pointed out to people who consulted him. His great artifice was his temple of health which contained an apartment which he called the " Great  Appollo  Apartment ". He described it in the following terms: - fu this tremendous edifice are combined or singly dispensed the irresistible and salubrious influences of electricity, or the elementary fire, air, and magnetism, three of the greatest of those agents or universal principles, which, pervading all created being and substances that we are acquainted with, connect, animate, and keep together all nature. </para>

                <para class="block">His principal apparatus was a thing that he called his Celestial bed. It was a magnificent edifice which stood on <inline font-style="italic">4$</inline> pillars of glass. He called it his "  Medicomagneticomusicoelectrical  bed " and the fee for sleeping in it for one night was £100. Anybody who slept in it had the right to engrave a crest on his tombstone. The young people who slept in the bed retained their good looks. The old people experienced its effects and they were rejuvenated. If married couples slept in it, he said that their progeny would be healthy and virtuous. The interesting aspect of it was that the lady whom we will call the senior hostess was a' 'girl named Emma Lyon, who afterwards became famous as Lady Hamilton. This Graham was extra good. He had as a sideline a remedy that he called 'his " Elixir of life ". If anybody paid £1.000. he got a written guarantee that he would ; live to be 150 years- of -age. That was! the minimum. If that person continued to take the remedy and continued to pay sums of £1,000, there was no limit to the age to which he might live. Apparently Graham was not so good at mathematics, because he himself died at the age of 50 years. </para>
                <para>I mention those things to show that this quackery and charlatanism has existed over the years and that gullible people will always be deceived. To-day, we have the antibiotics, radio-active isotopes, and other marvellous drugs. We have the knowledge that enables us to standardize those drugs and to study with the strictest accuracy their effect on the various complaints to which people succumb. But that does not mean that unscrupulous people will not try to market the most worthless of drugs in a very inhuman way. A. drug called para amino salicylic; acid, otherwise known as P.A.S., is used in the treatment of certain forms of tuberculosis. Recently it was discovered that of twelve samples of this drug that were tested biologically <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> fewer than eight were more or less worthless. As the honorable member for Re id has suggested, we should not look to the past with all its old-fashioned remedies, but we should concentrate on the development of drugs that have a definite medicinal value. "We should make sure that, when they are given to the public, they arc of the strength and quality that are required. </para>

                <para class="block">That provision covers the whole of the operations of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I recall that a few years ago, in Adelaide, collusion occurred between a doctor and a chemist in connexion with the supply of free medicine. As a result of those improper practices, certain persons obtained from the Government a great deal of medicine to which they were not entitled. A gentleman who had a knowledge of the matter said to me, " We have a clear case against these men. We know what they have been doing. But because the chemist acted in conjunction with a doctor, the profession is doing everything possible to prevent the story from being told to the public ". Members of the medical profession did not want the people to learn what had been happening. The purpose of the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro is to ensure that when the Minister acts upon the authority conferred upon him by the provisions of clause 94 (1.) the revocation or suspension of the authority conferred upon a medical practitioner or a pharmaceutical chemist shall be notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> It should not be left to the Minister to decide whether or not he shall publish a notice of the suspension or revocation of such an authority. </para>
                <para>Clause 94 (2.) provides that the Minister may, for good cause shown, by notice in writing, suspend or revoke the approval of a hospital authority to provide pharmaceutical benefits. In the event of such a suspension or revocation, notice should be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> Pharmaceutical benefits are provided at the expense  of the taxpayers, and for that reason, stringent conditions should be applied in respect pi those who .administer .or take part in the .scheme. ..Only in that way can the -revenue 'be protected against exploiters. W.e appeal to the Minister to agree to publish in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notifications of .all such .suspensions ;and revocations. A person who is convicted in the courts for haying committed a misdemeanour is more often concerned about the publication pf the facts -of his .conviction than about the fast that he has broken the law. Only in rare instances does a court order the press not to publish the details pf the case. Authorities on this subject tell us that the publication of court proceedings for misdemeanours is the greatest deterrent to crime and wrongdoing. If it is right that such cases should hg reported in the press, it is also right that the suspension or revocation of an authority conferred upon a medical practitioner, pharmaceutical chemist .or a hospital authority for contravention pf the provisions of this legislation should be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> Publication of such suspension or revocation is, in itself, a heavy penalty. </para>

I could cite many instances of .quackery practised in more recent times that wore unearthed .by a royal .commission which inquired into proprietary medicines and preparations. No doubt many of them are still being offered for sale. I was a member of a committee which was established during the war to inquire into some .of these preparations. The committee found that, in many instances, 86 per cent, of their cost -was represented by advertising charges. There is ample .evidence in the medical profession of the adverse effects of the use of many of the new antibiotics. The Minister for Social Services to-night referred to the rapid curative effect of certain drugs in the treatment of pneumonia. I do not know whether the honorable gentleman had in mind the use of antibiotics. He referred to a period when the population of Australia was about 5,0.00,000 persons. That would be about 4.0 or 50 years ago- </para>

It is a remarkable fact that since he has been in office, he has made no attempt to put his theories to a practical test. I agree with the suggestions that he then made. I regard them as constituting a proper approach to this problem. Instead of spending millions of pounds on imported drugs, the therapeutic value of which has been questioned by the medical profession, he would have done much better had he provided free fruit juices for the people. Had he done so, he would have assisted local industry, and provided employment for our own people. I do not pose as an expert in these matters, but I am able to make my own observations in regard to them. Honorable members opposite have to accept this bill, which has been forced upon the Government by the medical profession and, consequently, they try to laugh it off. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister may establish a pharmaceutical services committee of inquiry which shall consist of the Director-General and four pharmaceutical chemists appointed by the right honorable gentleman. Why  has  npt the Minister followed a similar procedure for the appointment of members of the medical services committee pf inquiryand made provision for that body to consist of the Director-General and f  Disqualified  medical practitioners? The Minister would then possess complete power. I think that he should exercise his authority. He should not abdicate in favour of an outside organization such as the Federal Council of the British Medical Association. Has it any statutory authority? Is it just a common law collection of individuals? Suppose a breakaway organization of medical. practitioners was established? Would it bc given any rights in this matter? I recall that the Australian Medical Association was established years ago as a breakaway group from the British Medical Association. A similar breakaway may occur again as the result of a (sharp difference of opinion among medical practitioners. It would be sufficient to mak* provision in the bill for the committee to consist .of six legally qualified medical practitioners. At present, the Minister has to appoint six medical practitioners who have been nominated by -the British Medical Association. All sorts pf .difficulties might arise. If a Labour government were in office, the British Medical Association might refuse to co-operate, and the Minister for Health would 'be ham-strung. If the Federal Council declined to nominate six medical practitioners, he could not appoint a committee to police ,the scheme. </para>

                        <para>- I acknowledge that it was a remarkable gymnastic performance, for which the Minister is specially suited. Those members of the committee who were present will recall that he condemned this amendment up hill and down dale. He said that it was utter nonsense, that it was completely fantastic, and that the merest tyro would know that it was completely unconstitutional. The only thing that the Minister did not know when he made those remarks was that this provision was incorporated by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> in the National Health Bill which he introduced last March. I do not know why this provision has been omitted from the bill now under consideration, but the Minister for the Navy will find difficulty in explaining his present contention that the clause, which he was so ready to support last March, and which was approved by the Parliamentary Draftsman and the legal advisers of the Government, should, now of a sudden, because it is moved by the Opposition, be complete nonsense, utterly fantastic, and so completely unconstitutional that the merest tyro should have been aware of that fact. If the Minister can get any satisfaction out of the extraordinary position in which he finds himself to-night, he is very easily satisfied indeed. </para>

The remedy was subsequently made public, and was found to be an utterly odious mixture. ' '' The important point that honorable members should bear in mind is that the committee of the British Medical Association of that day gave its imprimatur to that nefarious and shocking woman's remedy. </para>

                        <para>- Well, the committee of medical men of the day gave- their endorsement to Joanna Stephens's remedy. Therefore, I consider that we should not accept, with complete equanimity, . the . Minister's proposal to . vest, such tremendous powers in the hands of the medical profession of the present day. The honorable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Donald Cameron)</inline> will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that members of the medical profession consider that there never has been a time in history when the doctors of the day did not realize that their colleagues of 50 years previously were doing their patients far more harm than good. </para>

                <para>The Minister for Social Services also referred to the drug P.A.S. for the relief of tuberculosis. He made what I thought was a most remarkable disclosure to the committee when he said that an investigation had proved that eight of twelve different preparations of this drug on sale in Australia were completely worthless. Presumably the manufacturers were actuated by a ruthless desire to make money regardless of the suffering they caused. That, I suppose, would be justified by Government supporters as an example of the healthy working of private enterprise. I say that the ' disclosure made by the Minister was a damning indictment of the practices of commercial interests in this country which would deliberately prepare an utterly worthless form of a drug in order to gain profits for themselves while wrecking the health of people who need that drug in order to combat the ravages of a dreadful disease. </para>
                <para>I refer now to other matters that the Opposition wishes to bring to the notice of the committee in the' limited time that is left to us. I mention first clause 100, which the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> has already mentioned. This clause, which provides for the establishment of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, indicates the willingness of the Minister for Health to allow the British Medical Association to exercise complete domination over his legislation. Of a committee of six members,  four are to be medical practitioners appointed by the Minister from six nominated by the British Medical Association. The contrast between this clause and clause 112. which provides for the establishment of the Pharmaceutical Services Federal Committee of Inquiry, is remarkable indeed. The Minister is prepared to accept by complete domination the British. Medical Association in the first instance, but he is not prepared even to give the Federated Pharmaceutical Guild the right to nominate representatives in the second instance. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ! lt lias not the privilege of being represented by a Minister in this chamber. t direct the attention of the Minister to a small matter- which might well be remedied before the bill is sent to the Senate. Clause 76 provides that registered benefit societies must annually supply certain particulars to the Director-General of Health. One requirement of the clause is that each society must provide a balance-sheet and revenue account nf the medical benefits fund or hospital benefits fund, as the case requires, for each year. As the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> will readily agree, it is completely impossible for an organization to provide a balance-sheet for a. year. It can be provided at a point in time, but it cannot be provided for a year. I suggest, therefore, that clause 76 be <inline font-style="italic">reexamined</inline> before the bill goes to the Senate. Finally, I direct attention to clause 124, which provides certain rights for medical practitioners and chemists who are brought before a committee of inquiry. They will have the right to examine witnesses, to give evidence, to nail witnesses on their behalf, and to address the committee. I point out that some members of the medical profession and some chemists, although they might hu  vp  an excellent case to submit to a com.mittee, might not be skilled in putting their case. Therefore, it would be proper to amend the clause so as to allow doctors mill chemists in such cases to have the right of legal representation. </para>

Had the honorable gentleman been, listening attentively earlier to-night, he would have heard two lawyers point out that, since the original bill was drafted, the position has completely changed as a result of a judgment given by the High Court, which ruled that it would be impossible for a Supreme Court to deal with administrative matters of this sort. Appeals must be dealt with on the evidence that has been given previously. That was made clear to-night both by the honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne),</inline> and by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon).</inline> That is why the provision embodied in the first bill was left out of the hill now before the committee. If we adopted the honorable member's suggestion now, the clause would be futile because it would be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the law. That is the opinion of theAttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> and of the legal advisers of the Crown. As T have said, the original bill, provided that further evidence might he admitted in the event of an appeal. That fact proves that the Government is not opposed to thesuggestion. However, the inclusion of such a provision in the present bill would be a travesty because it would not have legal force. Like other proposals made by the honorable member for Eden Monaro, this one is useless. The Government has acted on the best legal advice obtainable and has dealt with the matter in the only way possible. It is ridiculous to say that the word " demand " is the same as the word " admit ". I shall not delay the committee further. </para>

                    (Grayndler) 1 10.7 J. -The more one studies the provisions of this bill, the more clearly one realizes that the time allowed for its consideration in committee is altogether too brief. Almost every clause could be improved if the Opposition had time to deal with the measure in detail. I support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser),</inline>
                    who stated an effective case clearly and concisely. The statement by the Minister for Health
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline>
                    that he has acted on the best legal advice is not good enough to satisfy the Opposition. If the advice came from certain members of the Government, the Minister should discard it at once, because every constitutional proposition that has emanated from the lawyers in the Cabinet has been rejected by the High Court of Australia or some other authority. Who are the competent legal authorities of whom the Minister has spoken? Are they like the mysterious individuals mentioned in the agreements to which this bill refers and which the Minister has kept secret? I should like to know the identity of these famous legal brains. The honorable member for Reid
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan),</inline>
                    who is an outstanding product of the law schools of New South Wales, is at variance with the Minister and his supporters on this issue. Other members of the Opposition, such as the honorable member for Werriwa
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam).,</inline>
                    also disagree entirely with the Minister's interpretation of the clause that the committee is considering. The right honorable gentleman's statement that he has the benefit of the advice of the best legal brains of the Government weakens his case at the outset. To say that the amendment moved by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro is impossible and useless is no argument against it. I should like to know why the various amendments that have been proposed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, which I have not had time to discuss extensively, should not be adopted.
                </para>
                <para class="block">I wish the Minister would reply effectively and properly to our questions instead of becoming hot-headed and refusing to support his attitude with sensible reasons. </para>
                <para>I know now much more clearly than .1 did yesterday why the Minister did not want the bill to be discussed in detail. He cannot answer our questions, and he is unwilling to let us examine the clauses separately because he knows that wc should find weaknesses in almost every line. The right honorable gentleman's whole scheme of medical benefits is suspect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> as the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Services in the former Labour Government, gave to the Australian people a simplified pharmaceutical benefits scheme that was three times cheaper to administer than is this Government's scheme. Labour's scheme was sabotaged by the present Minister for Health, aided and abetted by his bosses in the British Medical Association. The Labour scheme provided the people with a comprehensive coverage of 99 per cent, of the ailments from which they suffer at an average cost of 6s. (ki. for each prescription. Under this Government's scheme, the average cost of prescriptions in 1951-52 was £1 Os. 7d. The figure has SinCe fallen to 18s. Id. because, at long last, the Minister has realized that it is necessary to take precautions, as members of the Opposition advised him, to make sure that drugs are not prescribed indiscriminately. The purpose of the amendment moved by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro is to put an end to the wasteful prescription of valuable drugs. The Minister knows that, on one occasion, aureomycin was fed to fowls hy a poultry farmer at the expense of the medical benefits scheme. The right honorable gentleman has done little about such scandalous waste, but he has sought to gain notoriety for himself by talking about his proposals in double Dutch at a world health conference. He knows that such extravagances as the use of aureomycin to feed fowls has boosted the average cost of prescriptions under the scheme to its present high level. Medicine to-day costs the public purse three times as much as it cost under the Chifley Government's scheme, but the present plan provides only about one-fourth of the coverage. Every- citizen knows that he must have one foot in the grave and an undertaker before the Minister will approve of the use of the so-called wonder drugs. Even if the patient is dying, he is often expected to cling to life for three months longer while the Minister imports some vital drug from the dollar area or elsewhere because adequate stocks are not maintained in Australia. I notice that the right honorable gentleman smiles. "Well he may do so, because no greater confidence trickster in the health sphere has been known in our time in this Parliament or any other parliament in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I intended only to make a passing reference, to the fact that the honorable member for Mallee was upset by the charge I made about fowls. The national health scheme introduced by the Chifley Government was better, cheaper and more extensive than this scheme. It provided adequate cover for the Australian people. The present scheme is over-complicated, overregulated, bureaucratic, not understandable and penal in character. It should be condemned because it does not give to the Australian people what the Labour party believes they should be given. Because the Minister realizes that his scheme cannot stand the light of day, he is not prepared to accept the amendments that we have moved. He knows they would show up the scheme in all its badness, if I may use that expression. I support the amendments moved by the Opposition. The Minister wants to gag and "guillotine" the bill through the committee because he knows it cannot stand investigation. Ultimately he will pay the penalty for having foisted upon the Australian people this complicated scheme in place of the more extensive, simpler, and more beneficial scheme given to the country by a Labour Government. </para>

                        <para>- I heard the Minister for Health make a statement similar to that criticized by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro. The honorable member has said that he referred <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a statement made by the Minister for Socal Services, but his remarks were applicable also to the statement made by the Minister for Health. Those remarks, whether they were made in reply to the Minister for Social Services or the Minister for Health, were most unfortunate. They reflected on a very honorable profession and misrepresented the effect of what was said originally. Honorable members know that certain drugs, including the one known as cortisone, give remarkable relief to some sufferers from arthritis and other diseases. Honorable members know also that if those drugs are used in the treatment of other diseases, they produce abnormalities. Therefore, they are suspect to some degree. They are prescribed only to save patients from greater dangers. Doctors have to consider whether, in order to relieve their patients, they should take the risk of using the drugs. The drugs have not been placed on the free list because there is, so to speak, a question mark against them. </para>

                <para class="block">Townley), which the honorable member for New England apparently did not hear. The Minister for Social Services said that the drug P.A.S., which was extremely valuable in the treatment of tuberculosis, was made by a number of manufacturers. He said also that an analysis of twelve samples of the drug made by different manufacturers revealed that eight of the samples were completely valueless, and apparently had been offered for sale in a deliberate attempt to defraud the people in order to make profit. That was the statement on which I commented. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has given an extraordinary explanation of the deletion from the March bill, if I may so describe it, of some of the provisions with regard to appeals. It seem? that when honorable members opposite speak, whether they be legal men or medical men, we are expected to accept their statements as authoritative utterances. I have already referred to an appeal involving a citizen and a police sergeant in New South Wales that was given some prominence in the press. The citizen concerned appealed to a district court judge against a decision of a magistrate on a matter that vitally affected his character. On appeal, the case was re-opened. The powers of courts are derived from parliaments. If this ParKa* ment were to invest a court with power  do  hear fresh evidence on an appeal, the court would be entitled to receive such evidence. Certainly a district court in u State could be given such power. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The courts that will deal with appeals from these committees should be empowered to receive fresh evidence. The members of the committees will not be men with legal training. Even in the ranks of the Federal Council of the British Medical Association there is some concern about matters that come before it which call for some legal knowledge and training. It would be a good idea to provide that either the  chairman  or one of the members of these committees should he a man with legal knowledge. The medical boards in the States that deal with misdemeanours alleged against medical practitioners are presided over by u judge. That would be an appropriate procedure in this connexion. Under the present provisions, a committee that heard a charge against a medical practitioner might reject evidence wrongly, due to lack of legal knowledge, but the court that heard an appeal from the decision of the committee would be bound by the evidence presented to the committee. Facts that should have been considered by the committee, if it had acted properly, could not be considered by the court. It seems to <inline font-style="italic">mv</inline> that the whole procedure is <inline font-style="italic">wrong.</inline> The Minister should give serious consideration to the amendment moved by the Opposition. It follows the wording of a sub-clause that was contained in the previous bill, with the exception that th-s word " demand " has been used instead of " admit ". I am certain the honorable member for Eden Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Allan Fraser)</inline> would agree to the amendment being altered to make it conform exactly with the wording of the sub-clause contained in the previous bill, which was drafted by legal officers of the Commonwealth. The sub-clause that we propose should be inserted is in line with similar provisions in other legislation. It would permit further evidence to be admitted by the appeal court, either orally or upon affidavit. It would also permit the examination and cross-examination of witnesses before the court. If the committees were presided over by men with legal training, probably justice would be done in the first instance in many cases,, but if a wrong decision were made, or an injustice perpetrated, appeals could be heard by a court that had authority to admit further evidence. Why should not fresh evidence be received by an appeal tribunal? Apparently the Government believes the British Medical Association to be sacrosanct. Members of the British Medical Association will sit on these committees, which will be virtually star chambers. Doctors who come before the committee will not have the right to be legally represented so that their cases can be presented fully and properly. The committees will be dealing in secrecy with matters that affect the livelihood of doctors, but the doctors concerned will not have the right to be legally represented - a right possessed by every citizen who is tried in the ordinary courts of the land. When a case comes before a court on appeal, a full and proper enquiry should be permitted to ensure that justice will be done. </para>
                <para>The scheme was conceived by the British Medical Association, and members of the British Medical Association will implement it. They control some of the insurance organizations. They render the medical services and get substantial financial benefits. In addition, they want to police the scheme, and to do so in such a way that a higher authority will not be permitted to sift evidence and ensure that justice is done. </para>

                <para class="block">The argument for my amendment follows the general line of the Opposition's contention that when the authority of a medical practitioner is revoked a notice of the revocation should be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> so that people may know that the authority has been revoked. We contend that in all matters such as this, publicity should be given to the decision of a committee. If a person's motor driver's licence is suspended, publicity is given to the matter through the daily press, and everybody is able to inform himself about the suspension of thelicence and the reason for its suspension. If a doctor has been found guilty of doing something definitely wrong and the Minister is of the opinion that his authority to prescribe drugs has been abused, and revokes the authority the world at large should know that that has been done. No doubt the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> will contend that the doctor, whose authority is revoked, has not committed a crime, and that, therefore, the revocation should not receive publicity in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> However, if the Minister has power to revoke the authority and does revoke it, he takes a serious action. That action may have grave consequences both for the doctor and his patients, and should receivepublicity. </para>

                    <para>.- The Government rejects the amendment of the honorable member  for  Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> because, the Opposition's previous amendment having been rejected, the revocation of an authority would not receive publicity even if this amendment were passed. Another objection to it is that it is proposed to be inserted in the wrong place. If it were acceptable it  would be inserted in clause 132 and not clause 133. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">This is a very important matter. Item 1 of Part 1 of the First Schedule particularly excludes optometrists from the benefits of the bill, and indicates an extraordinary anomaly in the schedules. An opthalmologist or eye specialist charges about three guineas for a visit, whereas a general practitioner charges 15s. Suppose a patient ' consults an optometrist who tests eyes and makes spectacles and who is highly trained and qualified. The optometrist decides that the patient should visit an opthalmologist or eye specialist. If the patient goes direct to the opthalmologist he will be charged three guineas. Under this schedule, because he is recommended to see the specialist by a man who is not a, medical practitioner, the Government will pay 6s. and the insurance fund will pay another 6s. towards his fee, and he will have to pay the balance of £2 l1s. out of his own pocket. But if the patient is smart, and reads the schedule, he will go to a medical practitioner first and be referred by him to the opthalmologist. For his visit to the medical practitioner the Government will pay 6s., the insurance fund will pay 6s., and the patient will have to pay only 3s. In respect of his visit to the eye specialist the specialist will be paid £1 by the Government and£l by the insurance fund, and the patient will have to pay only £1 3s. from his own pocket. Therefore, in respect of the whole transaction the patient will pay £1 6s. out of his pocket, but if he acts directly on the advice of his optometrist he will pay £211s. This procedure will result in the overcrowding of the waiting rooms of medical practitioners. I suppose it will mean more money for members of the medical profession, but I do not think that they expect that sort of thing. If that is the idea behind this clause, it is a very low trick. In any case, it is an anomaly. 1 think that the optometrist should be given the privilege of recommending that his patients should go direct to a specialist and that under this schedule the people should be recouped to the full extent of the £2 which the medical benefits fund and the Government provide. The optometrists are worthy of consideration. They have completed a four-year course of training at a university. During that time they have acquired a knowledge of the structure of the eye and they can recognize diseases of the eye.

                    <para>. -Most of the operations that are covered by item No. 92 would be performed in a general hospital. If the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joshua)</inline> knows anything about the workings of a hospital, he should know that the hospitals keep a very accurate record of the time a patient is in the operating theatre. The question of making provision for members of professions other than the medical profession to recommend patients to specialists is one that has been given much thought. The matter has been discussed very fully, not only with the optometrists, but also with members of the dental profession and other professions. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to voice an emphatic protest at the cavalier manner in which this bill has been rushed through its various stages. I venture to suggest that it is the most ill-conceived and outrageous measure that has ever been introduced in this House. Over the last three or four years there has been correspondence between the Government and various organizations, but honorable members were not told- anything about the Government's, plans until the' Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> introduced ' the measure and rushed it through with the aid of the "guillotine ".; </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that the bill should be withdrawn, redrafted, and then re-submitted. It is the most extraordinary measure that I have ever seen. I do not think it has been prepared by the Commonwealth legal authorities. It is obvious that tie bill has. been prepared elsewhere. There are ninety-four unspecified items in the schedules. . That 'indicates that somebody else has been responsible for the preparation of this measure. The bill should be redrafted and re-submitted in order to provide an -opportunity for full and proper discussion. There are many items which the Opposition would like to discuss. Only the Minister for Health, who is a medical man, another honorable member who is a medical man, an honorable member who is a pharmacist, and one or two others spoke on behalf of the Government in support of the bill. That indicates that supporters of the Government do not know the contents of the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- This Parliament is an instrument of democracy. It is elected by the people of the six .States of Australia, including the State of New South Wales, and its existence can be justified only by its defence of democracy. I use these words because, to-day, the Cahill Government introduced a bill into the New South Wales Parliament entitled the Sydney City Council (Disclosure of Allegations) Bill, which provides that any newspaper, corporation or person who publishes allegations of offences under the Secret Commissions Act or under section 101 of the Local Government Act must reveal the sources of its or his information. Heavy fines are provided for breaches of its provisions. In the case of corporations a fine of £1,000 may be imposed, and in the case of individuals a gaol sentence may be imposed. In my opinion the bill is a shocking travesty of the freedom of the press and of the individual. It is a blatant attempt to muzzle the press and to shut the mouths of those who are willing to give information. It is a challenge, not only to the people of New South Wales, but also to the people of Australia to rise in their wrath and fight for the preservation of their freedom against a power-drunk and crazy State Labour Government which is prepared to go to any lengths to protect the adherents of the Labour party from, disclosure of their widespread corruption. If the people of Australia accept legislation of that kind- </para>

                            <para>- If the people accept legislation of that kind they have allowed themselves to be degraded to the position of people in a slave State. What has given rise to this extraordinary attempt to stifle free expression which can only be described as the last refuge of a group of cowards? As" every one knows, for months past there have been rumblings in Sydney over certain actions taken by the Sydney City Council. No one needs more information on the subject than is possessed by the ordinary man in the street to know that all sorts of suspicious actions have been taken by the council in relation to hotel leases, barrow licences, resumptions, tenders, permits, inter-city planning and staff employment. The attention of the city has been directed to them by the opposition aldermen in the Sydney City Council and by the Opposition in the State Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Before my speech, was interrupted I was directing the attention of the House to the record of Labour since it has been in control of the Sydney City Council. These suspicious actions date back to the time when the Bunnerong power house was being erected. At that time a certain officer of the Sydney City Council was convicted for an offence and committed to gaol for six months. An alderman, who was charged with a similar offence, is now Deputy Lord Mayor of Sydney and deputy chairman, of the Sydney County Council. The recent trouble came particularly to the notice of the public when the boundaries of wards in the council area were gerrymandered and altered in such a way as to make it. impossible for any political party, other than the Labour party, to gain control of the council. A bitter fight subsequently took place over certain perks of office, particularly in relation to the lord mayorality, over certain trips abroad and over certain functions to be held during the forthcoming visit of Her Majesty the Queen. Factions were formed, and then the beans were spilt. There is a saying that when thieves fall out anything may happen. Charges and counter charges were made. Little groups of people in the city made charges and formed public opinion in relation to them, until every person in the street was talking about corruption in the affairs of the council. The executive of the Labour party in New South Wales itself recognized this fact and set about cleaning up the mess. It brought the people concerned before it and investigated their private affairs and bank balances and tried to discover the culprits. </para>

                    </continue><para>Is it any wonder, in circumstances such as that, that the press should take the matter up and that a public demand should be made for a royal commission to investigate these charges? Nothing else could satisfy the public demand in rela tion to this matter. Under the measure that has been proposed by the New South Wales Government, information on this matter could only be obtained in isolated instances from people who were prepared to leave themselves open to all sorts of difficulties. Consequently, only a royal commission could satisfy the people. Sufficient individual cases have been mentioned. There is no need for me to waste the time of the House in repeating them. But people will not give particulars of their cases without the protection that is provided by a royal commission. Before a royal commission the matter can be opened wide and it is a great wonder to me that the Premier of New South Wales is not prepared to appoint a royal commission in order to discover the details of these matters. If the press were forced to reveal its sources of information it would have to break faith with the people who inform it of what it publishes. Such a step would also subject those who have information to the fear of reprisals - even the fear of physical injury to themselves. This is the kind of legislation which leads to the formation of a. police state. After the passing of such a bill every one would be too scared to supply any information in relation to these matters. There is no need to introduce legislation of this kind. The law as it stands, protects individuals against libel or slander. I wonder what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cahill</inline> is afraid of? We have had the recent instance of the Doyle case and the public. has heard the disclosures that have been made in relation to the council of the Municipality of Leichhardt. </para><continue>

                        CALWELL  (Melbourne) [".11-'13'|. - The honorable member for Bennelong
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cramer)</inline>
                        has spoken as a frightened man. He has created a furore here because he and his party have something to hide in connexion with happenings in New South Wales. What has the Government of New South Wales done? It has introduced legislation to require newspapers to provide the names of informants who have made charges of bribery and corruption against other people. _ The legislation provides that application for the information has to  be made by a superintendent or inspector of police. Why has the Government included that provision in the bill? Because the Cahill Government is a decent government -which is led by a decent man against whom there is no charge of corruption and it has attempted to find the source of allegations of bribery and corruption. That Government has stated that if it is given the necessary evidence it will launch prosecutions. Yet, when senior officers of the New South Wales Police .Department approached newspaper editors the editors said that they would not give them any evidence. Consequently, the New South Wales Government has decided to probe this matter to its depths, in its own way. It has decided to prosecute everybody against whom it can obtain evidence. It has decided not to be intimated by a pack of press hounds and others into appointing a royal commission for the purpose of  embarking  on a smear campaign.
                    </para><para>Do honorable members opposite suggest that police officers should not be told by newspaper editors where alleged bribery and corruption can be uncovered? Do honorable members opposite contend that the newspaper proprietors are entitled to compound felonies? That appears to be the attitude of Government supporters. They have accused members of the Sydney City Council of bribery and corruption. Action was taken against the Sydney City Council for bribery and corruption for the first time in 1854 by the then Chief Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Martin,</inline> who was afterwards Chief Justice of New South Wales. That happened 36 years before the formation of the Labour party. The Liberal party and the wealthy interests in New South Wales have lived on bribery and corruption throughout their careers. During the days of the rum currency how did the wealthy families of New South Wales get their laud and assets, except by the refined form of bribery and corruption of the period? Why did the Liberal party in New South Wales withdraw its nomination of a former New South Wales senator who is a. member of the Sydney City Council? Did it not have some suspicion that there was something wrong with his association with the Sydney City Council? Remember the Darlinghurst scandal which occurred under the regime of the last anti-Labour controlled Sydney City Council. Apparently something has been wrong in the Sydney City Council, because the New South Wales executive of the Labour party examined the position. But any graft that has occurred has been chicken - feed compared with the graft that has taken place when the opponents of Labour have been in power. </para><para>In a Uriah  Heepish  manner, the honorable member for Bennelong said that there was nothing wrong with the Sydney City Council except when the Labour party was in power. There was a lot wrong with the Sydney City Council before 1927, when action had to be taken against it a second time. It would also be found that there was something wrong with the Sydney County Council if the position of that body were properly investigated. It has been contended that there is no need for legislation of the type that has been introduced by the New South Wales Government. The law officers advising that Government have said that the New South Wales police are at a dead end. They cannot get any further information because of the obstruction of the press barons and they need to have this bill passed in order that they may prosecute. Honorable members opposite have called for the appointment of a royal commission. I should have thought that they would have had enough of royal  commissions.  A royal commission was held i" order to inquire into a secret fund and the findings of that royal commission werenot to the advantage of honorable members opposite. I refer to the fund which the Treasurer administered and amounts from which were paid into a series of accounts. The former honorable member for Bradfield helped to administer that fund. During the course of the royal commission the judge told the Treasurer and the former honorable mem'ber for Bradfield to go outside and see if they  could  reconcile their evidence. The Opposition is not afraid of a royal commission. But those who make charges should be obliged to prove them, and if  newspaper  proprietors want to make charges in order to conduct a smear campaign against the Labour party they should take the con sequences. Consequently the New South </para><para class="block">Wales Government has decided that persons who make allegations will have to prove them or go to gaol for twelve months or be fined £500. I am amazed at the moderation and generosity of the New South Wale3 Government in providing such a light penalty. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- What I have to say about this matter will have little in common with the statements of the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> either in fact or in spirit. I do not regard this as a comic matter. Neither do 1 think that any useful purpose is served by semihysterical and almost lunatic attempts to turn the debate to other subjects. I propose to confine my remarks to the legislation introduced into the New South Wales Parliament to-day. The truth of the matter is that the passing of that legislation strikes a blow at the liberties of the people of this country, such as we have never seen before in the history of any British country. It is on that level that I propose to discuss the subject. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I take, first, the title of the bill - the Sydney City Council (Disclosure of Allegations) Bill. The very title, surely, is sinister enough. I have never known a bill with that sort of title to be introduced in any other British parliament. I do not think that we have heard of legislation of that kind in any British country since Cromwell's day. Such legislation has been introduced in Japan, Nazi Germany, arid, of course, Communist Russia, but it has been left to the Australian Labour party to produce legislation of that kind in this country. </para>
                    <para>The bill contains certain important provisions, and I shall deal with them briefly. A judge may order, on the evidence or allegations of a policeman, any corporate body to produce documents or disclose information. I pause at this stage only to say that recent events in connexion with traffic charges show perfectly well that the unfortunate police of New South Wales must take their orders from the government of the day, in the same way as every one else must do. There is no defence for the people in the integrity of the police, because the integrity of the police in that State has been undermined by the govern ment of the day. A judge may order that the source of information of a newspaper be made public. If that order is not complied with, the body corporate may be fined £1,000, and every person who is a director or officer of any newspaper involved is deemed to have committed an offence, unless he can prove that he opposed the noncompliance with the order to the maximum, of his abilities, and he may be fined £500 and sent to gaol for twelve months. By whom is this justice to be administered? I ask the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> with all his pretensions to fairness and insistence on the rule of law, to consider this matter. </para>

The legislation specifically provides that he will be summarily disposed of in a court of petty sessions, with a stipendiary magistrate sitting alone. If that is the sort of justice to which we are accustomed in this country, it is news to me. </para>

                    <para>Broadly speaking, the bill will have two effects. First, it will close up all sources of information of corruption and bribery laid against the Sydney City Council. In the time available to me, I do not propose to discuss whether or not those charges of bribery and corruption are ill founded. I do not know enough about them. But I do know that never before has the administration of the greatest city in this land been in such a disgraceful, venal and dishonest state as is the case at the present time. Surely to goodness the citizens of that State have a right to bring these matters to the notice of newspapers which are, indeed, their only defence against that . sort of thing, with the sole exception of members of parliament. Therefore, I say that the first effect of the bill will be that no persons henceforth will dare to come forward, make charges, and give information against those people involved in the Sydney City Council. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the second result of the bill. It is well known that a considerable number of members of the Australian Labour party are disgusted with the civic administration. I do not put this matter on a party basis for one moment. I admit that many honorable members opposite hate, detest and fear this sort of thing, just as much as does any honorable member on this side of the chamber. But the second effect of this bill will be that such persons will no longer dare to go to the press, as they have done in the past, times without number, and point out things that have gone on in their own party. Even if they did come forward, the press would not dare to publish the information. It is all very well to speak of informers as people who are necessarily dishonorable men. We know that many of them are, but the informer, one way or the other, is one of the few safeguards which the citizen has against corruption, maladministration and incompetence. There comes a time when the only hope that scandals of this kind will be made public is that in the political party or the civil service, there is a person of sufficient courage and principle to say, " I will not stand this any more. I will not keep my mouth shut on this matter. I will go to the press, or to the parliament, and make public what I know ". That has always been one of the surest safeguards against corruption and maladministration in this country, and that avenue is being quite securely sealed by this bill. </para>
                    <para>Let no one doubt that those things will happen. The people in charge of the New South Wales Government are able and competent men, whatever else they may not be, and they have taken most effective steps to ensure that charges of corruption may not henceforth be brought against them. That is the effect of this bill. </para>

                            <para>- Legislation of this kind is to be expected from governments of a certain kind. It is the first step taken by totalitarian governments of any description. Hitler took that step in Germany. It is the first action taken by Communist governments when they gain control in satellite countries. But it is extraordinary to me that the Australian Labour party, which was once the champion of the under-privileged and which fought for the right of the people to assemble and express themselves, should find itself taking such a stand on this issue. </para>

Where do honorable members opposite stand on this matter? Are they in favour of the stifling of criticism by such means, or are they  opposed  to it? Will they sit  mumchance  in the cowardly hope that a rather lazy and tolerant people will forget this legislation, and pass over it by the next election, as, indeed, they have forgotten and passed over many other evils which have been committed by those in power in New South Wales at the present time. </para>

                    <para>My time has almost expired, and 1 shall close with the utmost sincerity on the note that the origins of this country were such that our first residents knew little enough of liberty. They were constrained in the most elementary exercise of liberty. By efforts, those conditions were changed. The Labour party itself played a great part in the emancipation of those people. It is astounding and terrible to see the same political party forging those very chains to put on the people again. It is the duty of this Parliament to protest against such action by every means in its power. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> certainly dealt with this matter in a different tone from that used by the honorable member for Bennelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cramer),</inline> but he nevertheless showed appalling ignorance of the nature of the bill which has been distributed by members of the press. As a matter of fact, he made a statement concerning the bill which I believe is totally inaccurate. In endeavouring to change the tenor of the debate he avoided referring to the contents of the bill. I am informed by a leading pressman in the House that it contains a provision to the effect that where a statement or report relating to a member of the council, or a servant thereof, is made or published and the statement suggests or implies that an offence has been committed under the act, a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales may take certain action. On the affidavit of a superintendent or inspector of police which shows reasonable grounds for believing that the person who made the statement or report has documents or information within his knowledge, the judge may order those documents to he produced and the information to be given for the purpose of launching criminal proceedings' against a person who is alleged to have committed the offence of corruption. That is all. The legislation obviously proceeds upon the basis of a published statement to the effect that an offence of corruption has been committed in the Sydney City Council. I am sure that honorable members would have gained the impression, from the speeches of the two honorable members opposite to whom I have referred, that something arbitrary or totalitarian is proposed. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I have not seen the bill, but to the best of my knowledge and belief its substance is as I have stated it. It provides clearly for a special procedure which is designed to enable the police authorities to obtain information or reports in respect of criminal offences which are alleged to have been committed, but only after the prior authorization of the Supreme Court of New South Wales which may, or may not, make an order. The court has power, under the Defamation Act of New South Wales, to order that the name of an informant of a newspaper which publishes a libellous statement shall be disclosed. Sometimes the court may order such a disclosure, and at other  itmes,  having regard to all the circumstances, it may refuse to do so. The bill with which the House is concerned seeks to provide a somewhat analogous procedure by assisting the administration of the criminal law when there is reason to believe that an offence has been com-  mitted  so as to facilitate the prosecution of cases of corruption in the council. </para>
                    <para>If there were no such law, what would be the duty of a citizen to whom information of that kind came ? Would it not be to assist the police to detect and prosecute the criminal? The Supreme Court of New South Wales has able and learned judges of great integrity to administer this law. What is there to fear? The judges will refuse to make an order unless they believe that it is necessary in the interests of justice. To speak of democracy and the freedom of the press in this connexion is altogether beside the point. The freedom of the press does not come into the matter. Apparently, the. legislation will simply provide for procedure to assist the criminal law to deal with a corrupt person by getting information upon which a statement is based that there has been corruption, so that such information cannot be concealed by a person who publishes it. </para>
                    <para>The provision for the imposition of a fine or a term of imprisonment is merely to cover the position which would arise should there be a refusal to obey an order of the Supreme Court. This Government, in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, has provided for the imposition of precisely the same penalties in the case of a refusal by a trade union to obey the industrial laws. Trade unions have not the right to go before a jury. They must go before a police magistrate, because in New South Wales a police magistrate has jurisdiction to imprison for twelve months in respect of such matters. The alternative would be that if a person did not obey an order of the Supreme Court he would be adjudged guilty of contempt and might be kept in prison until he has purged his contempt and complied with the order. I suggest that that explanation indicates that the penalty is by no means as severe as it might seem. </para>
                    <para>In order to gain a little political capital which the Government so badly needs, honorable members opposite have dragged up this matter and spoken about democracy. Let them be careful. Do they or do they not believe in the effective prosecution of crimes of corruption, which they denounce, in city affairs ? Do they believe in prosecutions according to  the ordinary criminal law? Do they believe that the law should provide a procedure which will make it' absolutely certain that all relevant evidence and information in the possession of newspapers or private individuals will be made available to the court or the police? Do they consider that persons should have power to retain such information in their possession indefinitely and so prevent prosecution? That is the issue. Apart altogether from this law, the retention of evidence of this kind is a dangerous expedient and might well come close to being part of a criminal conspiracy to prevent the course of justice. If there is evidence in the hands of certain persons who allege that a criminal offence has been committed, it is their duty to give that information voluntarily to the police. All that the proposed legislation aims to do is to give the Supreme Court of <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales power to make the appropriate order that that information shall be handed over. Censorship of the press is not involved. The rumours which have been circulated concerning the bill are perfectly absurd and monstrous. </para>
                    <para>I have endeavoured to describe the nature of the bill, which the honorable member for Bennelong and the honorable member for Henty failed to do. So far from it making the way of a bona fide informer more difficult, the bill will ensure that relevant information is made available. The Supreme Court will be master of the whole situation. It is ridiculous that, because the <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales Government is trying to sheet home by way of criminal prosecutions proof of offences of corruption, an attempt should be made in the National Parliament to attack the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, which is to be the final arbiter of this procedure. Surely we can have confidence in the judiciary. Surely we can bo assured that the power which is to be given to the judiciary will be used properly and will not be abused. The purpose of the bill is not to avoid prosecution but to assist prosecution for corruption. I think that the Cahill Government is entitled to credit for trying to stamp out such corruption by prosecuting offender? according to law. </para>

                            <para>- We fear intimidation and utilization of the power of the State to overpower the individual. What happened to the unfortunate individual who did disclose some information and say that he was prepared to go to the police and to testify ?  His  character was besmirched under privilege in the Parliament of New South Wales, his records for 30 years back were searched and a basher gang was set upon him as an example to anybody else who might dare to open his mouth. The Leader of the Opposition has engaged in a long legal argument in an effort to explain why a citizen should be compelled to disclose information. Freedom of the press is one of our fundamental democratic freedoms. Another one is the freedom of members of parliament to express themselves openly, without intimidation. If intimidation is to 'be permitted, and if a citizen who goes to a newspaper with information is to be dragged before a court and forced to disclose the sources of his information and give to the people who are corrupt the evidence that he has in his possession, so that they may intimidate him, the next step may be an attack upon the privileges of this Parliament. At present, a citizen may come freely to any member of this Parliament and give information to him  in privacy. Is the next step to be an invasion of our liberties? If the editor of a newspaper is to be forced to disclose information, members of this Parliament may lose their privileges, too. The freedom of the press represents the freedom of every citizen. The Cahill Government has adopted the method for which its bill provides, because, it claims, it wants to ascertain the  truth in relation to the allegations of corruption in the Sydney City Council and does not want the council to be besmirched by people who make charges against it. It has a very simple remedy at hand if it wants to expose this newspaper campaign as having no foundation in fact and as being a vicious attack upon the Labour party itself. The remedy is to appoint a royal commission that will ascertain the truth and prove that the newspapers are without evidence of corruption. The New South Wales Labour Government learned a lesson from the Doyle royal commission. It knows that, before that royal commission was appointed on the eve of the last State general election, the Premier travelled about the State repudiating the charges that had been made against Doyle, and saying that they were merely political propaganda. He was forced to appoint the royal commission only because a State election waa two or three days off. </para>

                            <para>- And from the Labour party as well. This bill of which the Leader of the Opposition has spoken goes further than any democracy has dared to go previously. The New South Wales Government proposes to force the State Parliament to make a law to require that, before any victim of political corruption may complain publicly -in the newspapers, he must be named to the people who have victimized him by their corruption, presumably so that they can add intimidation to their corruption. That is the purpose of the bill. Nobody will be game to stand up and open his mouth in New South Wales on any subject connected with the Sydney City Council. Yet the Leader of the Opposition, who, when he was  president  of the General Assembly of the United Nations, defended the four freedoms, the Declara tion of Human Rights, and all those other wonderful ideals that he espoused only a few years ago, to-night advocated the opposite view. In fact, from the great knowledge of the bill that he has displayed, it appears to be quite possible that he is the author of it, or suggested its provisions to the New South Wales Government. </para>

                            <para>- I want to draw an analogy. In Argentina, a. great newspaper, <inline font-style="italic">La</inline><inline font-style="italic">Prensa,</inline> in the city of Buenos Aires, challenged the government of the day. It stood for liberty. It was the greatest newspaper in that country and had a circulation of 400,000 copies daily. Peron tried to convert it to his own point of view. .However, it was an independent newspaper and it printed what its editors thought should be printed. Peron tried to suppress it, but it continued to be critical of his Government. Finally the government did suppress it by preventing the employees from entering the publishing works.. Eventually, it chased the editor out of the country. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the honorable member has asked that question. This great Argentine newspaper, which stood for democracy and liberty, was suppressed and is now a union journal. Five months after it was closed down by the Peron Government, the newspaper reappeared, still under the title <inline font-style="italic">La Prensa,</inline> but as the organ of the government controlled General  Conferedation  of Labour and under the editorship of Senor Paso, the former editor of the  Peronista  newspaper <inline font-style="italic">Democracy.</inline> So, the government of Argentina has gone the whole hog and stifled democracy. To-day anybody who dares to open his mouth in Argentina to express his opinions is liable to find himself in a concentration camp before very long. </para>

                        <para>.- The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> spoke glibly of the freedoms that he said the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> had defended in the United Nations, hut, in reality, the Postmaster-General defended the right of newspapers in Australia to smear indiscriminately the characters of individuals without producing evidence to support their attacks. The honorable gentleman said in effect that, if the right of the newspapers to ' indulge in character assassination was taken away from them, that right would no longer exist in this House. I object to the existence of that right in this House as well as amongst the newspapers of Australia. I realize that the people are appalled by the stories of bribery and corruption amongst public figures that are being circulated throughout the country. When a person guilty of bribery or corruption is brought before h court, and it is proven to the satisfaction of the court that he is guilty, those who seek to destroy the democratic institutions of this country and the faith of the people in their representatives say. " Well, of course the law is a net which catches some of the small fish but through which the big fish smash their way". They use that propaganda to destroy the  confidence of the people in democracy. Throughout Australia to-day, an attempt is being made to destroy confidence in public representatives. I believe that by and large the public representatives of this country are as honorable as are any other section of the community. T do not believe they are more honorable, but I think the community requires safeguards to protect its interests against the unscrupulous public representative who, because of his position, is enabled to accept bribes and indulge in corrupt practices to promote his own interests, but to the disadvantage of the community. </para>

Of course, the right honorable gentleman treated that suggestion with contempt. Later I suggested to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> that the law that operates in Norway in that connexion might be applied here.

                    <para>The suggestions that I have put forward refer to laws that operate in other countries. Will the Government put them into operation in Australia? I suggest that it will not do so. If it did, it would provide a means by which the public could be protected and by which public representatives could be deterred from using their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of the community. By that method, the Government could protect the reputations of those in public positions who are not guilty. In protecting the reputations of those people, the- Government would defend the institutions of democracy. It would defend this Parliament and the institutions that are being insidiously attached throughout Australia and in other countries. The proposition of the New South Wales Government is at least a step in the right direction. It does not go as far as I would go, but at least its legislation is intended to provide that persons shall not be entitled to use the tar brush as they like and escape all responsibility for the result of their actions. Such persons will have to stand by their accusations. What is wrong with that? I challenge the Government to put into operation legislation that will make it difficult for public representatives to violate their trust. If the Government will not do that, it should forever hold its peace. </para>

                        <para>.- Unlike the honorable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Peters)</inline> I am not interested at the moment in freedom in the United States of America, South America or Norway.  T  am interested in freedom in New South Wales. I am appalled, as all free New South Welshmen will be, at an attack upon our democratic institutions. I am appalled at the deliberate attack that is being made upon the liberty of the  pres3.  The bill that is under discussion is such an attack. It is an attack upon our freedom. It seeks to prevent free discussion in the press of charges of corruption against the Sydney City Council. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> made a. joke of the proposal. He did not appear to be joking, but he must have been, because he was formerly a justice of the High Court of Australia. He could not be so naive as to believe in the suggestion that he put forward. He tried to convince honorable members that the New South Wales measure is intended only to provide safeguards, to enable evidence of corruption to be obtained and prosecutions to be launched. The right, honorable gentleman read part of a press report referring to the bill and I shall read a section of the same report which states - </para>

Who will speak to the press in those circumstances ? This is an attempt to muzzle the press. I believe that I can prove that statement beyond all doubt. If the bill were merely intended to enable the police to get evidence, why could not the New South Wales Government take the action that everybody has asked it to take and appoint, a royal commission to inquire into the charges? The royal commissioner would have full power to direct inquiries. I shall read to the House the provisions of section IS of the Royal Commissions Acts of New South Wales, 1923-1934.

                    <para class="block">What other powers are needed to find evidence on which to launch prosecutions? Is this an attempt to enable the police to collect evidence? Or' is it an attempt to suppress evidence? The New South "Wales Government has power to establish a royal commission to inquire into these allegations. The royal commissioner would be clothed with all the powers to which I have referred. Who can suggest that any further power is needed to collect evidence? </para>
                    <para>I challenge the Loader of the Opposition to say again that this bill is intended to enable the police to collect evidence. When the Royal Commissions Act gives the New South Wales Government the powers to which I have referred, and when the whole of the State is clamouring for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into these allegations, it is obvious that there is another purpose behind the bill. That purpose is the one that I have suggested - to muzzle the press. The Leader of the Opposition made a joke of this matter, but he took the joke to absurd lengths when he said we on this side of the House were attacking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The bill contains a provision thatan inspector may get an order from a Supreme Court judge. Because we object to the provision and, indeed, to the whole of the bill, the Leader of the Opposition has said that we are attacking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. We are begging the New South Wales Government to invoke the jurisdiction of the court and to appoint a judge of the court as a royal commissioner to inquire into these allegations, hut it is afraid to do so. </para>
                    <para>The Government that has prepared a bill to muzzle the press of New South Wales is contemptuous of democracy, and obviously is fearful for its own skin. An ingenious excuse for its action has been offered by the Leader of the Opposition. I hope I have disposed of that excuse, but others will be made. It will be said that a spate of charges of corruption is being made by the press, and doubtless the New South Wales Government will try to mislead the people and make them believe that the bill is  a  defence of the Sydney City Council against those charges. That will be a lame excuse. The citizens of New South Wales have known for years that the whole of the Labour movement in that State is corrupt. The Labour-dominated Sydney City Council and the Labour Government of New South Wales itself are only instruments of the organized Labour movement in the State, the centre of which is in the Sydney Trades Hall. The Trades Hall is the master from which the City Council and the New South Wales Government take their orders. The people of Sydney knew for years that the Leichhardt Council was corrupt. They have known for years that the Sydney City Council is corrupt, and they have suspected corruption in the Labour Government of New South Wales. What was the reaction of the Cahill Government and of the McGirr Government before it to allegations of corruption? It was, first, to stifle criticism of the Leichhardt Council and delay an investigation for as long as possible. The allegations against members of the Leichhardt Council were known to the present Premier of New South Wales as long ago as  1949,  but it was only this month that charges against the former Mayor of Leichhardt were heard. The New South Wales Government smothered criticism of the Sydney City Council. When allegations of corruption reached its own level and affected a member of the Government, it laughed at them, denied them and tried to cover them up. Eventually, as a result of the accidental association of aconfederate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur,</inline> the former New South Wales Minister for Mines, with the work of a petty forger, further investigations were made that rendered it impossible for the New South Wales Government to cover up <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur's</inline> activities any longer. Then a royal commission, restricted by the most carefully drawn terms of reference, found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> had been guilty of improper practices. He was thrown to the wolves. He went out. What has happened since then ? He still frequents Parliament House in Sydney. Is it unfair to suspect that, as he still frequents Parliament House and hobnobs with his former cronies in the New .South Wales Government, he is still connected with them and, in the past, had connexions with some of them that cannot be shrugged off? </para>
                    <para>The result of all this is that the attention of the people has been turned directly to corruption in the places about which 1 have spoken. They are regaining their courage. They are going to the press with _ stories of stand-over tactics, especially in the Sydney City Council. There has been a flood of charges, and "there are continuous, valid and reasonable demands for a royal commission to be appointed to inquire into the City Council. Those demands have been rejected. Now that the charges have become so numerous that the Cahill Government is physically incapable of dealing with them, that Government, instead of appointing a royal commission and clothing a judge of the Supreme Court with the powers to which I have referred, has done something that will prevent information from being given to the press, under the pretext of trying to provide evidence for prosecutions. </para>
                    <para class="block"> What is the truth about how charges of this kind come out ? When people who hold public office have been charged with corruption by responsible persons, or when the charges have become so numerous that they have a wide currency, it has been the invariable practice to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the charges. That should be done now. </para>

                        <para>.The honorable member for Bennelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cramer)</inline> came into the House tonight and asked us, as democrats, to listen to what he thought was a democratic speech. He asked us to believe that democracy was threatened. As far as I understood his speech, he wanted to act as a traitor to his own State and to tell the people of Australia, through the medium of the press, that the people in charge of that State were people of the worst character. He left no stone unturned in his efforts to deride the place from which he came, as has been his habit during the time he has been in this Parliament. When he reached the stage of making some kind of charges, the charges that he made were hysterical, far-fetched, and based on no evidence. He spoke from a written brief that had been thrust, hurriedly into his hands. He talked about the freedom of the press. Why does not he think sometimes of the freedom of the men serving in parliaments ? Why does he not cease to be the tool and the thing of some one outside the Parliament who persuades him to run into this House and mumble, like the sawdust Fuehrui that he is, about things of which he does not know anything? He does not know the clauses of the bill. It is enough for him if some one jams a brief into his silly claws and he comes here- </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it is inappropriate. I withdraw it. When a member of this House is made the tool of outside interests and mealy-mouthed people cry about democracy, it is not . surprising that one loses one's sense of balance and temper. The honorable member has made no contribution to the struggle ahead of us to get high levels of decency in civil affairs, which, for the time being, have apparently been lost. The honorable member has been for many years a well-known and highly respected member of a municipal body,, but the only contribution he has made to this debate is the statement that everything is rotten. He has been associated with that rot, year after year, in the inefficient control of a very big enterprise, with his eyes shut to what has been going on, but when it is useful for him to come into this House and defame his State, its. Government and its people, he plays the traitor. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw the word. I leave the honorable member to judge what he is. The matter was made crystal clear. I do not refer to the cub trying to write an editorial who spoke in the name of the electorate of Henty. He did  not know anything about the matter. The Leader of the Opposition explained the purposes of the bill. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> mumbled something about liberty being threatened. Ministers of this Government run to this table to scream about liberty and the freedom of the press. What is the freedom of the press? Can anybody define it ? The Postmaster-General made a hash of his attempt to do so. Let me get back to the factual statement that was made by the Leader of the Opposition. He said that the bill drafted by the New South Wales Government is an attempt. to get to the bottom of crime that is being committed. Who has been hurt by the measure? It is designed to do the very thing that the newspapers have been trying to do. If we can believe what is published in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> that newspaper has become its own investigator and established its own gestapo. It uses 400,000 copies of the newspaper each day to say, in effect, " If you know anything dirty about anybody, come and tell us ". Then, when the New South Wales Government says that those persons must tell their stories, not to the press but to the people, the newspapers say, in effect, " Protect us. We have been assailed ". So much for the freedom of the press! I have been a journalist since I was a boy, and I know that no reasonable journalist wants to do jobs of this sort which make him crawl in the gutter. He does not want to be like a beetle worm when he can do a good job for the newspaper that employs him. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Where is this freedom of the press ? The Government asks those who make these charges to tell their stories to the people. The newspapers say, " Help shed light on council malpractices. After all, it's your city and you want to see it run honestly ". The newspapers say to certain individuals, in effect, " If you know any one guilty of any corruption call at our inquiry counter. If you know a little bit of sin, get in our lift or come up our stairs and bring it to us. In the security of our office tell us all you know. Then we can increase our circulation above the demand for Joe PalOoka. The people will have something to frighten them ". Is it not fair, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, for the New South Wales Government to ask these persons to disclose the facts? Is it not fair that the Government should clean up this matter, because there is nothing in half the allegations that are made. The newspapers are not trying to protect anybody; they simply wish to protect themselves from the facts. Half of the statements that they make are untrue. I recall that during the general election campaign in 1951 one newspaper conducted a gallup poll, as the result of which it made the asseveration that a prominent member of the Australian Labour party would be beaten by over 5,000 votes. That right honorable gentlemen was not defeated and inquiries that were made following the election disclosed that the gallup poll was concocted in the mind of one man on that newspaper. That newspaper now asks all and sundry to shed light on council malpractices. </para>
                    <para>If the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> and its satellites which pour out these asseverations will not have them substantiated by a court or investigated by a government, why do they engage in such tactics ? They do so in order to increase their circulation because some other things have run thin. All that the New South Wales Government has said, in effect, is, "Let us segregate this thing. Let us cut it out of the body politic ". The journalists who report these charges know that they are groundless. They know that "Freedom of the press" is a false cry. A newspaper should be treated as is any other product that is sold. It should, perhaps, be registered under a kind of pure foods act. This is a footling matter. Does it not stink of insincerity? The people are asked, " If you know of anything tell the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph.</inline> Call in and see us ". What a great time the press is having with these snoopers, these people who, imagine that they have been offered bribes. They are all rolling up the stairs. This particular newspaper has gone on a collection of garbage. It says to the snoopers, "You make the asseveration and we will publish it ". Yet, when the State Government acts as the custodian of public morals, the newspapers object. </para>
                    <para>The claim made by the Postmaster-General that the informants of the  press gave their information in confidence and that they should he protected in order to uphold the freedom of the press is irrelevant. If the Government held a referendum and asked the people whether they would like to have this cesspit of allegations every morning, or whether the Government should make those who make the allegations stand up to them, I have no doubt about what the people's answer would be. The honorable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> made much of the point that a. royal commission should be appointed to investigate these charges. What do royal commissions prove? The honorable member, as a lawyer, knows that in the long run royal commissions regardless of the breadth of terms of reference do not prove anything. In this instance a declaration has been made about a wrong that has been committed and the New South Wales Government is merely seeking to have the matter investigated by a Supreme Court judge mid to provide that a senior member of the police force should be engaged in the inquiry. There is nothing wrong with that proposal. Australians have fought a war for the preservation of democracy of which the honorable member for Bennelong makes a mockery. During that conflict we had to do certain things in order to crush insidious corruption that was eating into the body politic. </para>

                        <para>- It is a matter for congratulation that the House has deemed it fit and proper to discuss a measure that lias been introduced as an emergency bill by the New South Wales Government. I listened with the greatest of interest to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> but I have never listened to a more specious or more plausible argument than that which the right honorable gentleman advanced to-night. He did not do either himself or the House justice in taking the line that he took. I should not measure swords with him on a question of law. He is a great lawyer. But one of the fundamental things that I have learned about the law is that it is the business of Parliament to enact laws. When those laws have been enacted it is for the judiciary to interpret them, and the duty devolves upon the Government to execute them. When the Leader of the Opposition claims that if we criticize the proposal that is the subject of this debate we automatically criticize the Supreme Court of New South Wales, which will have no alternative but to give effect to the law when application is made to it to interpret it, he does not do justice either to himself or to this House. Furthermore, he forgets something that was common knowledge in New South Wales a few years ago. </para>

                    <para>It would appear that every now and again a rash of intolerance and totalitarianism breaks out in the Australian Labour party. At the time to which I refer, a gentleman named Lang introduced into the New South Wales Parliament a bill, a copy of which I have in my possession, that provided that if a person criticized a Minister's policy he rendered himself liable to precisely the same penalty as is provided under the bill that was introduced into the New South Wales Parliament to-day, that is, a fine of £500 or imprisonment for twelve months, or both. Lang actually introduced his bill into the New South Wales Parliament, and it had passed through certain stages before his Government was suddenly stopped in its career. What would have been the position if that law had actually been passed ? The offence for which the penalty to which I have referred was prescribed was to he criticism not of a Minister himself but of his policy. In such circumstances, criticism, including parliamentary discussion, would have been stifled. In addition, if the State Government decided to launch a prosecution, what could the Supreme Court have done in such circumstances? It would have been obliged to interpret that law just as it will be obliged to interpret the law which the New South Wales Government now seeks to pass. The Leader of the Opposition has said that. Government supporters who criticize that dangerous, meddlesome and pernicious measure, which is an echo of the legislation that caused the people of New South Wales to throw out the Lang Government, are reflecting upon the Supreme </para>
                    <para class="block">Court of that State. That is sophistry of the worst kind and should not be put forward as an argument in a case like the one now before the House. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> said that the honorable member for Bennelong was a frightened man because he had brought this matter forward. I hope and pray that, for the good of the country, we shall all be frightened men and women when legislation that is directly aimed at intimidation is brought forward. Every honorable member of this House, including those of the Opposition, understands perfectly well the purpose of this legislation. The Labour Government in New South Wales intends, by means of its legislation, to intimidate everybody who is willing to come forward and give evidence about public corruption. If a man comes forward under protection of a royal commission, he knows that if he tells the truth he has nothing to fear, but that if he tells lies he may be charged with perjury. For the honorable member for Melbourne to say that this legislation is designed to protect the purity of life in this community, is a travesty of the truth and the use of words is a. mockery and a farce. The honorable member for Melbourne used the phrase " a smear campaign ". I also heard that phrase used before the last New South Wales general election. I .heard the honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline> vilified, and called every name that a decent man should not be called, merely because he had the courage and determination to press to its conclusion the investigation of a scandal which resulted in the resignation of a Minister from the New South Wales Parliament and his expulsion from the Labour party. Every man and woman in New South Wales should be grateful to the honorable member for Mackellar for the courage that he displayed in that matter, despite the efforts made by the New South Wales Government to defame and deride him and bring him into ill repute. This matter, about which the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> spoke so glibly, strikes at the fundamentals of liberty in this country, and <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> venture to predict that, together with the proposal to force compulsion on every man and woman in a system of industrial conscription in New South Wales, it will bring about the expulsion of the New South Wales Government from office. That Government has lost the respect of the community by allowing bribery and corruption to flourish until, as in the case of the Leichhardt Municipal Council, it was forced to take some action. Now, when it sees the abyss opening beneath its feet, it has taken a step which is a disgrace to any democratic country, which reflects no credit on the New South Wales Government and which must make every decent man and. woman in New South Wales feel sick to think that that Government controls the destiny of the main State of Australia and one-third of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

The story of honorable members opposite about the freedom of the press is a plea for freedom of the yellow press that disregards all forms of decency. Day after day they look for somebody and then take him into a secluded corner and say lo him, "I must whisper to you in this corner for fear I will get bashed up ". We hear the story that two reporters take a man to a building in a secluded part of the city, get him to tell his story and then give him a few shillings supplied by people who are prepared to buy any sort of filth and fill their filthy newspaper columns with it. I make no. apology for saying that in all my life I have never known such filthy propaganda as that which has been disseminated in the press of Sydney in the last month, in an attempt to destroy the New South Wales Labour Government. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has said, "Our Government will go to the next election on our record ".  His  Government has no record, unless it is the record of graft and corruption in connexion with the proposed merger of Trans- Australia .Airlines with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, which would have represented a gift of £3,000,000 to the latter concern. I have heard a story of a gentleman walking about the corridors of this building with a pocket full of filthy lucre to buy votes on. the particular night when the matter of Trans-Australia Airlines- </para>

You said, something about, logrolling in the corridors when a certain gentleman, whose pockets were full of money, was taking certain honorable members into the bar and other places on the fateful night when the vote was taken.' and the agreement was approved. Next morning that gentleman had ' flown.. Where had he gone? Honorable members opposite may laugh. They are alwayswilling to throw mud. when they think there is a chance that some of it will stick, but when, the position, is reversed they do not like it. We have heard of the sale of Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, Amalgamated Wireless Australia Limited, the Glen Davis shale project, and the Hotel Ainslie. Quite early in this Government's life, t heHotel Ainslie was sold. To whom was it sold? It was sold, to some b.i»: estate  agency iti Sydney, with which n. certain member of this House in very  closely  connected. I do not want to mention any names, but a certain member of the Liberal party was very closely connected with the sale of the Hotel Ainslie. Honorable members opposite talk about graft. They just make me sick. The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drummond)</inline> said that it sickened him to listen to such talk. It sickens me, too, as it should sicken every good Australian, ro hear protestations of honorable members opposite. . The Cahill Government is the greatest State government that Australia has over had. It is prepared to legislate in the interests of the people that it represents - the working people. Apparently the compulsory unionism proposal has put the anti-Labour forces on their toes and they are out to destroy the Cahill Government somehow. But they cannot destroy it on its record. They know its record is clean, but their filthy minds are constantly distorting the truth. The barons of the yellow press constantly distort statements. They have had a licence to do it until now, when the State Government has brought down a preventive measure. Now they arc howling. The dogs may bark, but the Australian labour party will still roll on despite the yellow press and its distortions. I know it is sickening for the boys in the press gallery to know that they arc the employees of such disseminators of distortions. However, I think this debate should be stopped in the interests of fair play. This Government should set an example to the Treatts  of the Statu Parliament and all the other disseminators of filth in the daily press, by closing this (It-bate and forgetting all about the matter. </para>

                        (Mitchell) [12.34 a'.in.j. - The honorable member for Watson
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline>
                        referred to fair play, but I must say that the Cahill Government in New South Wales ha? adopted Rafferty's rules rather than fair play. The honorable member, in the course of his grand flight of eloquence, referred to the caravan of Labour rolling on. I can only say I am reminded of the old ballad, " Where my caravan has rested ". Listening to the honorable membur for Watson, I thought his voice was more attuned to the selling of papers than to the condemning of them. I must say in fairness to the honorable member that he does not draw the colour line, because he frequently referred to the yellow press. However, he did not mention the red press. He showed a liking for superlatives but he frequently got them mixed. I think it is obvious to all members of this chamber that the New South Wales Government has for some time past been entirely contemptuous of the rights of the people, but nobody thought it would be foolhardy enough to try to restrict the freedom of the press, which basically is the freedom of speech. Surely this is a clear demonstration of the length to which a government will go when it has ceased to have regard for the welfare of the people. It is an example of what a government can and will do when it has ceased to be its own master and bows its knee to outside influences. The position that we are debating has arisen from allegations made by the press that bribery and corruption exist in the Sydney City Council. I do not know whether or not that charge is true. All I can say is that if such an allegation were made against any of the councils or local-governing bodies in the electorate of Mitchell, the councillors and aldermen concerned would rise as one man to demand an inquiry to clear their names.

                    <para>Every dictatorship has started off by trying to muzzle the press. In our time we have seen what Hitler and  Goebels  tried to do, and what Russia is doing to-day. The action that the New South Wales press will take to resist this oppressive legislation remains to be seen, but surely the New South Wales Government ha3 no control of broadcasting. It may control the press, but it cannot control wireless. I believe therefore that the press will be at liberty to use broadcasting. If so, will the State Government put notices on wireless stations forbidding broadcasts to the people of Australia ? It is interesting to consider also whether the New South Wales Government would have any control over a newspaper that was printed in another State. Possibly the remedy for the situation may be to print a newspaper in Queensland or Victoria for distribution in New South Wales. If we want an example of press  dictatorship nearer home we have only to remind ourselves of the action taken by the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> at the height of his power as Minister for Information. I have no doubt that he had some provocation, but emboldened by his power, and showing his disregard for the democratic way of life, he sought to control the press of New South Wales. When the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> obtained a court decision to force the honorable member to go into the witnessbox to be examined on oath in defence of an action, he refused to do so. </para>

                    <para class="block">So much for the freedom of the press and a would-be dictator. But look at what dictators can do. In April, 1944, on the orders of the honorable member for Melbourne, a delivery truck was held up at the point of a gun in the transport dock of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph.</inline> The <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> had criticized the honorable member for misusing war-time powers for political censorship. The honorable member has his own ideas about the means by which he will even his score with those newspapers, but if the New South Wales Government continues on its present course it will be long before the honorable member for Melbourne is in a position to even his score with the press. This measure can be regarded only as the thin end of the wedge. I believe that the sanctity of confidence has always been a cardinal virtue of the legal profession. A client may express his views to his advocate or defender under the cloak of secrecy and be assured that, if his legal adviser is ethical, that confidence will be respected. That right may be taken away. Even the right honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">.(Dr. Evatt),</inline> under an extension of the application of the proposed legislation could, be forced to" reveal the intimate negotiations that took place between himself and the Communist-dominated unions when he accepted a brief to appear in court on behalf of those unions. The whole essence of democracy is that free people should have the untrammelled right to express their innermost thoughts. The science of psychology has maintained that the unburdening of a person's soul and the freeing of it from oppressing thought is good for the soul. I commend that statement to the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen).</inline> I cannot refrain from saying that the political ghost of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> T. Lang is now haunting the corridors of the New South Wales Parliament House.  His  oppressive actions led the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labour party to ruin and perdition. Under similar circumstances, the devil seems to have entered the soul of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cahill</inline> and lie and his followers, like the Gadarene swine, are racing over the precipice of sanity and reason. </para>

The bill that was introduced in the New South Wales Parliament yesterday provides that, if a newspaper publishes an allegation of corruption, a commissioned officer of the New South Wales police  force may approach a justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and ask for an order that that newspaper shall reveal the source of its information. If the justice makes that order and if it is not obeyed by the officers of that newspaper company, they may be sentenced to specific terms of imprisonment or fined certain specified amounts. </para>

                            <para>- Or both. It is well for honorable members to realize that the New South Wales Parliament has the duty of administering justice within the borders of that State. The legislation was introduced because the Sydney press bad sought to usurp the administration of justice in that State. It had conspired to demand a particular forum before which these allegations might be ventilated. If any persons have been guilty of corruption or of securing advantages for themselves in breach of the Secret Commissions Prohibition Act of New South Wales or of the Local Government Act of New South Wales, those persons should be prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law. The Sydney press barons have adopted the attitude that they will withhold the information that they have unless and until a royal commission is a ppointed. </para>

                    <para>I am not unaware of the procedures that are followed by royal commissions. I, as counsel, assisted the longest, bestpublicized and to date the least conclusive royal commission that this country has had. A royal commission is the appropriate way of ascertaining facts in order to assist and guide a government in the framing of legislation. It is not a proper or a fair way of securing information for a prosecution. The press so publicizes and pre-judges a man that thereafter it is impossible to secure for him an unbiased trial. It was found repeatedly during sittings of the royal commission which inquired into the liquor laws and allied subjects in New .South Wales that the first that a man- knew that his reputation would be attacked or that his acts would be called in question was when he read the evidence in the press. A man is condemned by a royal commission but is not tried. He suffers, but he is never sentenced. There have been procedures in the sovereign State of New South Wales for many years under which persons who have committed crimes could be tried. The criminal law of New South Wales has never been found wanting. If anybody knows of any wrongdoing in that State, that person has a moral duty and a legal obligation to take the information to the police in order that the offender may be brought to justice. That person who has that in formation does not serve the ends of justice by taking it to the press. He does serve the ends of justice by going to the police. What could induce a man to take information about a crime to the press instead of to the police? </para>

It is typical of the courage of the people who, under various aliases, propagate their points of view. Honorable members know that, if such allegations are made under parliamentary privilege, there are plenty of newspapers that are prepared to publicize their authors. Such people never make those allegations outside places like this House, which might be referred to as cowards' castles. The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drummond)</inline> said that a man who appears before a royal commission can tell the truth and that he has nothing to fear. He may tell the truth before a stipendiary magistrate and have nothing to fear. </para>

                            <para>- It may be an illfavoured thing, sir, but my own. If I may comment on the interjection that was made .by the honorable member for Evans, let me say that he would do well to remember that he is not now strutting the quarterdeck, but that he is well and truly travelling steerage. The measure that is under discussion was introduced for the purpose of facilitating the administration of justice. The act which was passed by the New South Wales Parliament yesterday was to facilitate the administration of justice. Is democracy served by concealing evidence of a crime? Does the press justify its freedom by hindering the administration of justice? Where does one's obligation lie - to the Queen, as the fountain of justice, or to a newspaper editor, as the fountain of publicity ? </para>

                    <para>He was a hold man who, in this Parliament, raised the question of corruption among men in public life. The honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has already referred to one convict among the Liberal ranks in the New South Wales Parliament. He was also a Liberal member of this House. In recent years two other convicts in the New South Wales Parliament were members of the Liberal party. They  Were <inline font-weight="bold">Major Jarvie,</inline> M.L.A., and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ronald</inline> Bruce Walker, M.L.A. If I were to follow the example of the honorable member for Bennelong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cramer),</inline> I should cite the example of a man who was tried and acquitted. I refer to Brigadier-General Lloyd, M.L.A., as he was at that time. Honorable members opposite, and members of the real estate trade, which includes the honorable member who raised this subject, can be thankful that in this case the New South Wales Parliament has confined its attentions to the operations of the Sydney City Council. </para>

                        <para>. - I should hesitate to enter into this discussion, were it not for two things. The first is the fact that the recent legislation in New South Wales is a definite blow at democracy, freedom of expression of thought, and freedom of opinion. The other is possibly best summed up in an article that was published in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> yesterday. There is a remarkable parallel in that article to the matter we are discussing. Alderman Roberts, the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, recently resigned from the Labour party because he did not agree with the idea that the executive of the Labour party should override members of the council. The article reads - </para>

                        <para>The Lord Mayor (Aid. Roberts) has adopted the logical procedure on allegations of graft within the City Council over petrol service stations; he has passed the letter on to the Criminal Investigation Branch. The public is feeling most  uneasy  about charges of graft and corruption and fears that it may be shown " where there is smoke, there is lire ". The C.I.B. inquiry is a necessary initial move to uncover definite evidence to sustain a charge against a person or persons. If such concrete evidence is unobtainable, but investigations reveal that irregularities have occurred, then an open inquiry should begin immediately. </para>

We complained about them because we believe that the New South Wales Government is trying to intimidate the people of New South Wales. In other words, the New South Wales Government is trying to deprive the people of that State of freedoms and rights that have been bought at a great cost of human life and much human suffering. We should continually bear these things in mind. I do not think that honorable members on the other side should treat this matter with any levity whatever. I should have thought that if the newspapers were making completely incorrect allegations, the laws of libel in New South Wales - if they are adequate - would cover the case. I can see no reason why we should countenance these tactics of intimidation, which are so foreign to a freedom-loving people. I hope that the publishers and editors of some newspapers in New South Wales will have the courage to carry this thing to its logical conclusion, and that, if necessary, they will be prepared to go to gaol to fight for their freedom. </para>

                            <para>It would  be  impracticable to define how many attempts had been made by the Departments of Navy and Air to salvage the Royal Australian Air Force Dakota which crashed into the sea near Cronulla about a  year  ago. However,  it  can be stated  that  the search, which commenced some 30 minutes from the time the aircraft was overdue, has over the  past  year occupied some three months of full time use of a trawler in association with Royal Australian Air Force aircraft, where this has been deemed desirable. Every possible means  nf  locating the aircraft has been exploited.  Trawling operations, which were the most  likely  avenue of  success  were hampered by  the  great depth of water, some 80 or 70 fathoms, and the nature of the sea bed, which is thick with rocky outcrops and heavy marine growth at the site of the crash. </para>
