                        <para>- The honorable member refers to the wheat for which the farmers have already received 3s. 6d., and asks when will they receive the balance. That wheat has not yet left the country, and we have received nothing for it. Indeed, nothing will be paid for it until March next. The payment to be made in respect of the new crop will come out of an advance financed by the Commonwealth., I cannot indicate, even approximately, when the difference between the 3s. 6d. already paid on the old wheat - plus the cost of handling and railway charges - and 4s. 9d., the price at which the wheat was sold, will be paid to the farmers, but every effort is being made to expedite payment. </para>

                        <para>In the early stages of the work the opinion was held that internal-combustion engines could be obtained which would haul material for building the line, for carrying on construction work, and be afterwards available to work the public traffic, and apparently the idea of obtaining these engines was not abandoned to the time of the present Engineer-in-Chief taking office. Presumably with such hopes, the ordering of steam locomotives was deferred. </para>
                        <para>When the present Engineer-in-Chief took charge, in April, 1914, it was found that engines on hand, or which had been contracted for, numbered thirty-two; of these, six were not suitable for railway construction work of such magnitude. They were light passenger engines that had been running many years on the New South Wales&#39; railways. They were procured in the early stages of the work because of the delay which occurred in the development of the internal-combustion idea and in having suitable steam locomotives built. They were not equal to the heavy construction traffic, nor were they capable of moving the tracklayer train from point to point as required to facilitate platelaying. So light and unsuitable were these engines that in assessing our requirements their services for main-line traffic had to be practically disregarded. They could only be deemed to be of value for minor runs and for shunting in the dep&#244;t yards. The number of properly serviceable engines provided for to this date was, therefore, twenty -six; of this number, two only had been delivered, eight only had been delivered by June, 1914, sixteen by July, 1914, but it was not until July, 1916, that any further deliveries were effected and engines put into running. Even now, only nineteen of the twenty-six have been delivered. </para>
                        <para>Serious water trouble had arisen in connexion with the locomotives, the boilers and tubes being badly affected thereby; also a decision was reached before the middle of 1914 to adequately ballast the line, this work to be carried out, as far as practicable, before plate- laying finished. </para>
                        <para>Additional locomotives were therefore needed, and, on 14th January, 1915, the then Government decided, on the recommendation of the Engineer-in-Chief, to procure twenty more, which would make forty-six main line locomotives in all. </para>
                        <para>Of these, eight were imported from Great Britain, as local manufacturers were unable to supply sufficiently early. The remaining twelve were submitted to tenders within the Commonwealth. </para>
                        <para>Representations by local manufacturers were made that twelve was too small a number for economic construction, and that better conditions could be secured by the Government if the number were increased to, at least, twenty. </para>
                        <para>It is1 understood that the Government at the time had in view the possible construction of a north-south railway, and a strategic railway eastward of Port Augusta, either during or immediately after the war. &#39;It appears to have been seized of the importance of linking the capitals, as far as practicable, by railways of uniform gauge, and of the necessity, in particular, of connecting for defence purposes the standard gauge Commonwealth line with the New South Wales system of similar gauge, as subsequently recommended by the Railways War Council. This latter work, it might now be emphasized, is essential from a defence point of view. The Commonwealth line, without such linking up to make State rolling-stock available, would be of. little value for military purposes. It would be impracticable to hold upon it sufficient rolling-stock to adequately meet the defence demands, even for light transport. It is imperative, therefore, to have direct access to the rolling-stock of the New South Wales railways if regard is to be paid to effective service. </para>
                        <para>It would be apparent, also, at the time, from inquiries made among private manufacturers and the various State workshops, that the volume of work in hand was such that if the Commonwealth Government did proceed with any other railway proposition, either as a defence measure in some immediate emergency, or as a means of providing employment for returned soldiers, or for the development of the country, the difficulties, delays, and expense which have arisen from shortage of locomotives for the construction of the KalgoorliePort Augusta railway would be repeated in respect of the new work. </para>
                        <para>There was ample evidence, moreover, that prices of locomotive raw materials would rise, which has since been demonstrated, to the extent that most of them are now, and will continue to be, practically unprocurable. This condition will not be greatly eased immediately by the cessation of war, because of the war wastage to be repaired. </para>
                        <para>The Government accordingly accepted tenders for twenty-six locomotives to be manufactured within the Commonwealth (twenty in Queensland and six in South Australia). </para>
                        <para>The contractors, in consequence of difficulties arising from the war, have applied for eighteen months and nine months extension -in delivery time respectively. </para>
                        <para>It might be added that locomotive manufacturers in this country do not possess the requisite plant or facilities foi that of construction. Consequently it has happened, not infrequently, that locomotives had to be imported from abroad, by Commonwealth and State Governments alike, to meet requirements that were beyond the abilities of local manufacturers in the matter of prompt delivery. </para>

                        <para>- The objection to giving the growers direct representation on the Central Wheat Board was that the constitution of the pool provided only for the representation of Governments as such, on that Board, and the Ministers of Agriculture of the four wheat-producing States and the Commonwealth are directly represented. In the second place, there is no need for the wheat-growers to have a representative on the Central Wheat Board, because they are directly represented on the State Wheat Board. The Central Board does not deal with handling, charges or with the arrangements for handling the wheat. In effect, it deals only with the sale of wheat, and for that reason the Board could not see fit to agree to the request of the, Farmers Conference. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot tell the honorable member w-hat the prospects are. I only know that the. best possible arrangements for the transport of wheat, in the circumstances, are being made. The greatest quantity of wheat ever despatched in any one year was that sent during the present year. I think that, in 1913-14, 1,2000,000 tons of wheat were despatched, whilst this year we have sent away about 1,500,000 tons. After the present harvest, all being well, there will be available in Australia, with the residuum of last year&#39;s crop, nearly 3,250,000 tons. If we have the same facilities as we have had this year, it will take about two years &#34;to shift that wheat. If those facilities are reduced, the time will be longer; if they are increased, it will be shorter. It is hoped that greater facilities for transport will be available. </para>

                                <para>- I should not care to say that that arrangement will apply in all cases. The idea is to shift the wheat from the ports most convenient to Great Britain first. No man in the pool will be prejudiced by that arrangement. It does not matter to him which wheat is sent first, because the money received for it will be distributed evenly to all concerned. A few bushels of new wheat might happen to go before the old, but, speaking generally, obviously the old wheat will have to be shifted before the new wheat can get down in any quantity to the wharfs. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question, so as to clear up the financial position with regard to the No. 1 and No. 2 wheat pools. For the future, will sales of wheat be credited to the No. 1 wheat pool until it has been wound up, or proportionately credited to the two wheat pools? Now that the value of the wheat has been definitely fixed in respect of both pools, we have a scrip which* is as good as money. 11 For the benefit of the growers and&#39;&#39; the financiers of this country, I shall be glad if the Prime Minister can give me this information. </para>

                                <para>- Questions of this kind are a little difficult to answer off-hand. I should say, however, that each pool stands, if I may use such a term, on its own bottom. If, for instance, the sale of the 1915-16 wheat crop returned to the farmer 4s. 4jd. per bushel - I am taking that price only by way of illustration - it might happen that the new crop w.ould not return the same value, so that, if the  two pools were taken together, it would follow that the man who grew wheat in only one year, and not in both, would be the loser. The idea is to clean&#39; up one pool - to -treat it separately - before we go on with the other. </para>

                                <para>- I have not the data at hand, and can make only a general statement. With one exception, all the vessels of the fleet have been used to carry wheat. In the case of the exception referred to the ship was loaded with copra for glycerine at the request of the Imperial Government, which required it for explosives. It was impossible to obtain freight for this purpose, because mixed freights pay much better, and private ship-owners were not prepared to carry copra. We placed one of our ships at the disposal of the Imperial Government at their express request. With that exception all our vessels have carried wheat. It was proposed to complete our c.i.f. transactions with Commonwealth steamers, because in that way we should be assured of freight being available for that purpose. It  is only fair to explain to the House that we have been able to obtain only one steamer, and, I think,  though  I am not quite sure, five or six sailing vessels in four months. There is no freight to be got, and, as I have stated, it costs as much to take a bushel of wheat to London as the wheat is worth. To take it to Mediterranean ports it costs even more. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member had better give notice of his question. I have explained the matter fully in reply to the honorable member for Echuca and other honorable members. The position of the wool-grower is that&#39; the Central Board is representative of the industry. The price of each man&#39;s wool is determined, not by any Board, but by skilled experts. The only difference between the selling of wool to-day and the sale of it in ordinary times is that there is now a fixed basis of price, and that the value of a particular clip goes above or below that fixed basis as the quality may demand. Once the wool-grower realizes that the price is not fixed by any body at all, there will be no trouble. The basic price - the flat rate, as it were - is  15&#189;d.  per lb. for greasy wool. A bale is brought  before  an appraiser, who, having examined it, says,  &#34; On that basis of value, this bale of wool is worth 22 &#163;d.&#34; And that is what the owner gets. There are three appraisers. Any one who is dissatisfied with their decision has the right of appeal to the Central Board. The interests of wool-growers are much better safeguarded than they were- in ordinary circumstances in the auction room. It is not now to any one&#39;s interest to give them a smaller rate than that which they should receive. The only limitation is the basic price of 15&#163;d. per lb. for greasy wool. No one denies that that is a perfectly fair price, and it follows that the interests of the small wool-grower are amply safeguarded. If it can be shown that the arrangements made fall in any way short of protecting the small wool-growers, I will see that ample provision is made to safeguard their interests. </para>

For all practical purposes that practice will be followed under the present scheme, subject, of course, to the fact that we are now acquiring the whole clip. We shall not pay for the/ whole clip within fourteen days, but the time from which the wool will pass through the appraisers&#39; hands until the grower gets his money will be &#39; about the same as it would have been in the case of an ordinary auction sale. </para>

I should be glad if he could clear a doubt in my mind as to whether he means that under the arrangement made a man may get 22&#163;d. for any of his wool that is worth that price, but that in respect of his whole clip the price paid must not exceed  15&#189;d.  Where his wool is not worth 15Jd. per lb., will he get the actual value placed upon it by the appraisers? </para>

                                <para>- Let me illustrate the position by a reference to the procedure in regard to wheat. We sell .f .a.q. wheat for 4s. 9d. a bushel, but if a man comes along with a lot of chick- wheat we do not agree to take it at that price. In fixing the price for wool, the British Government said, &#34; We will pay you on the basis of 15Jd. per lb. of greasy wool.&#34; As the honorable member knows perfectly well, some brands of wool always fetch much more than others. Some are sold for 6d. and 9d., while others fetch five or six times that sum. The only difference between normal sales and this sale to the British Government is that a sort of equilibrium is maintained so that the price cannot fluctuate wildly. It is only the quality of the wool itself which oscillates in regard to this level of 15Jd. per lb. for greasy wool. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to the amendment proposed by the Treasurer, but I desire to know what effect this clause will have on the season tickets issued by sporting, athletic, social, and other clubs. The point could be raised on any of the clauses up to clause 12, but I think we ought to have some information now. There are many such clubs devoted to bowling, quoits, and other games, for membership of which working men and others pay &#163;11s. or more annually. From such payments there is absolutely no gain whatever to any person; and clubs of the kind have now the greatest trouble in financing their way. As is well known, no charge is made for admission to any of their competitions, but members and others show a ticket or token, such as I suppose many honorable members possess, and such as I myself hold in connexion with the Melbourne Cricket Club. On my ticket, for instance, I presume the club, if such membership payments are liable to taxation, will have to pay about 3s. 6d. I am speaking on behalf of many athletic and social clubs, which are not moneymaking institutions. Many cricket clubs spend all the money obtained from members&#39; season tickets in beautifying their grounds. I wish to know whether a percentage of the revenue that these clubs obtain from members&#39; tickets hag to be paid in the shape of an entertainments tax. In many cases the holders of these season tickets pay their money, not for the purpose of being entertained by others, but for the purpose of taking part in sport themselves. For instance, the revenue derived from the annual subscriptions of rowing clubs does not equal the upkeep of the clubs. These clubs have also to depend upon donations, and the only return that the members get beyond the actual sport itself are the prizes for which they compete. The same remark applies to the big cricket clubs. They get practically no revenue apart from the football matches, and since the beginning of the war very little income has been derived from that source. As a matter of fact, with the exception of a few patriotic demonstrations, the Melbourne Cricket Club has not been able to provide any entertainments for the holders of its season tickets. The consequence is that the upkeep of the ground has had to be paid out of the revenue obtained from the membership tickets. In addition, it has been stated that the club has lost 2,000 members, or a revenue of over &#163;4,000 a year. This club does not ask for exemption, but it and other clubs are entitled to fair treatment. There should be some exemptions. Possibly; the Board of Referees referred to by the Treasurer in his financial statement could pronounce upon cases where there should be exemptions. At any rate, I do not think it is the wish of the Government to tax clubs, the whole of whose revenue, obtained from membership tickets, is spent in maintaining and improving the grounds, and which are not run for the profit of the individual. I appeal to the Treasurer to exempt them. </para>

If there are two entertainments in the year at which a charge for admission is made, a proportion of the annual ticket is taken to represent those two entertainments, and the tax is payable on that proportion. Where there is no entrance fee there is no charge against the annual ticket. There will be no hardship imposed. </para>

                    <para>.- The mere fact that we have the Bill before us shows that times are different from what they were. I know something about football clubs. Players who formerly received an allowance for playing in order to cover out-of-pocket expenses - and it has been stated that it used to be pretty high - now receive anything up to 5s. a week in order to recompense them for the time they lose when training, the allowance they formerly received having been donated to patriotic funds. But they are given honorary tickets. I wish to know whether these honorary tickets are to be taxed? There are also trainers&#39; tickets. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope that the drafting is clear m regard to the taxation of annual subscriptions, which give the right to admission to race meetings and other entertainments. Provision is made in the case of a subscription covering in part a period for which the tax is not enforced, that there may be apportionment, but I am not sure that the clause enables the Commissioner to take into account, when a subscription ticket is used to obtain admission to subsequent entertainments, that the tax was assessed in the first instance on a lump sum. </para>

                    <para>. - Obviously there will be only one assessment in connexion- with season tickets. A subscriber to the Melbourne Cricket Club has the right to enter the. grounds whenever he presents his ticket at the gates, but while one member may avail himself of this privilege frequently, another may never use it at all. What will the Commissioner have to do? Is he to estimate the value of the ticket to the holder,&#39; and prepare a scale accordingly? The members of some agricultural societies have the right of entrance to the show-grounds even when they are leased for the purpose of some entertainment not connected with the society. </para>

                    <para>.- While we desire to have the machinery of. this tax as perfect as possible, we wish to avoid inquisitorial administration. I have known entertainments to be got up in connexion with a convent to provide, perhaps, a playground. The children often try to assist by organizing separate entertainments to raise funds for, say, a stall. They may charge1d. for admission to their entertainment. In this way there is generous co-operation in philanthropic and religious effort. But under the clause the children would have to make application to the Commissioner for permission to hold their subsidiary entertainment. Is that intended? The clause says that the Commissioner must be satisfied ; that is, he must be satisfied in advance. It might happen, if persons in Western Australia, say, did not take the precaution of writing to the Commissioner, that some one might, under another section, march into the convent to find out what they were doing. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a possibility that in our anxiety to protect religious and philanthropic institutions we may go too far. Recently a lady in Adelaide received permission from the War Council to give an educational lecture for patriotic purposes. When the accounts were submitted they showed that the lecturer received &#163;5 5s., and a gentleman &#163;3 3s., and out of takings, amounting to nearly &#163;30, only &#163;2 was available for patriotic purposes. I do not think that any serious hardship will occur if the sub-clause is passed in its present form. In reply to the honorable member for Angas I may point out that the application will be made, not to the Commissioner in Melbourne, but to the  deputy  in each place, and the Act will be administered in such a way as to recognise all <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> efforts. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not think that the Treasurer will lose any revenue by accepting this amendment. Today religious, charitable, and philanthropic institutions find it very hard to make both ends meet. It is difficult to raise any money at all for charitable purposes. The Institute for the Adult Deaf and Dumb some time ago held a bazaar in the Melbourne Town Hall for the purpose of raising funds for the erection of a building at Blackburn Farm. The whole of the work in connexion with the bazaar was voluntary. But the promoters had to pay rent for the hall and advertising expenses, and I think the expenses were over 20 per cent. of the takings. When a church is conducting any of these entertainments it has the advantage of the use of its own hall, rent free. In Victoria, if goods are to be sold, after 6 p.m., in connexion with any bazaar or fete, a permit has to be obtained from the Factories Department. Under this Bill another permit will be required from the Commissioner* of Taxation, and in addition to that, the organizing body, if the entertainment be for a charitable or philanthropic institution, will have to obtain a hall. It will be difficult for the expenses to be kept below 50 per cent. </para>

Every honorable member knows the way in which women have to work for these bazaars and fetes, and that the rent of the hall is often one of the biggest items of expense. We have no right to impose taxation on those entertainments, practically the whole of the proceeds of which are devoted to religious or charitable purposes. </para>

                    (Richmond) &#91;12.381.- The amendment proposed by the honorable member for Brisbane will have an effect opposite to that which the mover desires, inasmuch as it will exempt only entertainments the gross proceeds of which are devoted to philanthropic or charitable purposes. If the paragraph is allowed to remain in its present form, and the percentage allowed in clause 13 is increased, the honorable member&#39;s desires will be accomplished. Whilst I recognise that it is desirable to encourage efforts such as those referred to by the honorable member for Yarra, there is another class of entertainment which people organize ostensibly for charitable purposes, but which have no charity in them except for the promoters.

The great bulk of the proceeds of a charitable entertainment should go to charity, otherwise the effort ceases to be properly a charitable one. To increase the allowable expenses to 50 per cent. will permit of a very big slice being taken out of the proceeds of entertainments organized under the guise of charity. I should like to know how the Eight Hours Demonstration and similar efforts will fare under this Bill.. My impression is that, although the Eight Hours&#39; Day celebration in Melbourne is ostensibly for charitable purposes about 80 per cent. of the proceeds go into the coffers of the promoting organization. </para>

                        <para>- What is to prevent the organization altering the nature of its demonstration in order to get the benefit of the allowance of 50 per cent.? The demonstration purports to be a charitable effort, but whether <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> will be so interpreted by the Commissioner, I cannot say. If we are to exempt the proceeds of certain efforts for religious and charitable purposes, the Committee should provide that only a minimum proportion of the takings is absorbed in expenses. An allowance of 50 per cent. is very great. If this clause has been framed on the basis of balance-sheets submitted by those who have conducted these efforts, the Committee is entitled to that information. We should not pass a clause like this without data, which would enable us to judge whether 20 per cent. or 50 per cent. is the more reasonable allowance. </para>

Under the clause as it stands, the tax must be paid, but if the Commissioner is satisfied that the expenses of the entertainment have not exceeded a certain percentage, a refund is to be made. That is an unnecessary piece of red-tape. </para>

                        <para>- Those of us who have had to do with the running of entertainments know that it is often an easy matter to get tickets out, but very difficult to get them back. It is often very hard to obtain the money for tickets that have been issued in that way. Many of the tickets sold for entertainments of this class will, no doubt, never be presented, but the tax will, nevertheless, have to be paid.&#39; In all probability, from 80 to 90 per cent, of this taxation will be derived from picture shows and theatres, race meetings, fetes, and carnivals, and not from the smaller entertainments such as tare held in local halls in the metropolis, as well as in country districts. As the result of experience,  the  Commissioner may find it&#39; desirable to ask for certain amendments of this measure. I agree with the proposal of the Treasurer to raise the percentage mentioned in this clause from 20 to 50 per cent. The honorable member for Wimmera, in his anxiety to attack trade unions, made a violent speech concerning the Eight Hours Anniversary Committee. </para>

The balance-sheets of the Eight Hours Anniversary Committee are open to public inspection. That cannot be said of every like concern. The expenses of the Committee, in some cases, may seem to be high, but an analysis of its balance-sheets will show that, in every case, its expenditure has been well justified. </para>

                    <para>.- An allowance of 50 per cent, is too large for all circumstances, and I suggest that we should provide that the whole of the expenses of the entertainments shall not exceed 20 per cent. , except in case of bad weather or other adverse circumstances, when they may reach 50 per cent. Our only object is to provide for cases where the weather is so bad that the expenses take up the great portion of the total receipts. If we allow 50 per cent., no matter how good the conditions may be, we may permit such, undertakings to become a source of profit to private individuals. </para>

                    <para>.- When speaking previously I instanced the Eight Hours Art Union in Victoria. The tickets for this, which is claimed to be a true art union, are sold broadcast in all parts of the Commonwealth, and not only give chances for prizes, but admit the holders to the demonstration. The receipts for that art union from all sources in 1915, amounted to &#163;5,912, which, after deducting &#163;300 temporarily drawn from suspense account, and &#163;57 earned by way of advertisements on the tickets, meant a net revenue of &#163;5,555. The distributions to charities, after deducting expenses and salaries, cost of luncheon to delegates, clerical assistance, bands, office expenses and so forth, amounted to &#163;923,&#39; or only about 16 per cent. The art union is supposed to be purely for the benefit of charities  and under the clause it will be possible for the promoters to claim exemption from taxation on the whole of the admission tickets sold. I believe that the feeling of the Committee is in favour of raising the allowance to 50 per cent., but, before that is done, the Treasurer should be able to give us the data on which he fixed it at 20 per cent. By raising the allowance to 50 per cent, we shall open the door to&#39; abuse, and enable people, under the guise of charity, to use such organizations for the purpose of providing billets and enriching themselves. The honorable member for Yarra took exception to my reference to this particular undertaking, and, as usual, defended it because of some association with trade unions. I am not surprised, however, at such championship, because honorable members in the Opposition corner have to obey instructions on all occasions; no matter what the case may be, if any of their own institutions, are affected, they must be defended. Is the honorable member satisfied that the sort of. thing I have instanced shall continue under the guise of charity ? </para>

                    <para>.- The honorable member does not lose any opportunity of attacking the working man. He is always anxious to get his knife into the working classes, but he need not be anxious, as I understand the State Attorney-General has decided that the art union will not be permitted again, be-  cause of the efforts of his friends in the Liberal party, which has always been anxious to crush the organization that promoted it. I have no doubt that they will never succeed in crushing that organization. Every time action is taken in that direction, the workers strive harder to improve their position. The expenses in connexion with the art union referred to may appear to be very high, but I believe that as much as 30 per cent, commission had to be paid on the sale of some of the tickets. Speaking from memory, I think the boys who sell the tickets in the streets of Melbourne are allowed about 15 per cent. The man who. hands out the tickets to the boys gets an extra 5 per cent&#39;, to cover his risk. Agents in the country districts are paid 25 per cent., and agents in other States are paid 30 per cent. Honorable members in their desire to injure the trade unions point out one side of the picture only. They take very good care not to let the people know that the country barber or the country hotelkeeper, or others, are paid about 25 per cent, for the sale of these art union tickets. All the advertising is paid for by the central committee. The honorable member is interested in several country newspapers which obtain high prices for those advertisements. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the point taken by the honorable member for Wimmera was that only 16 per cent. of the gross takings went to charity, but the honorable member did not show where the rest of the money went to. He did not show that the biggest percentage was spent in advertising and in paying commission on the selling of tickets. The 50 per cent. agreed to by the Treasurer is a fair compromise, but as I have expressed the opinion privately to the Treasurer, I think that it will cost more to collect the tax from this source than will be actually received. I do not anticipate that the revenue from the very small percentage of entertainments that <inline font-style="italic">come</inline> under this clause will be more than &#163;4,000 or &#163;5,000 per annum. If this irritating taxation could be wiped out it would be a wise step on the part of. the Treasurer. If during the working of the measure the Treasurer finds that what I have said is true, I hope that he will bring down an amendment <inline font-style="italic">giving</inline> the Commissioner power to make certain exemptions, at the same time notifying Parliament as to the class of entertainments so dealt with. </para>

                    <para>- It is , absolutely necessary that there should be some check on the abuse of the word &#34; charity,&#34; which is going on on all sides. The art-union referred to by the honorable member for Wimmera is not the only case. Entertainments are held for which &#39;high prices for admission are charged, but from which there is but a small amount derived for charity. . If one is privileged to look at the expenses he finds that nearly all the money is mopped up by such items as refreshments, hire of costumes, hire of wigs, and so on. It would be well to make provision, either in the Bill or by regulation, to compel every one to pay the maximum amount of the tax until a duly audited balance-sheet is furnished when the Commissioner may make a rebate if it be necessary to do so. </para>

                    <para>.- The mistake in this Bill is that there are too many separate offences grouped under the one penal provision. There are six subclauses with great disparity between them as regards the enormity of the offence dealt with. Apparently the proposal is to leave it absolutely to the discretion of the judge in every case to say what penalty shall be, imposed. The reason why there are so many limitations as to sentences in our Statutes is that we distrust the wisdom even of Judges in regard to the imposition of sentences. In Great Britain there have been Judges who have inflicted sentences of fifteen years&#39; imprisonment for offences for which other Judges have not imposed sentences of more than twelve months&#39; imprisonment. The last&#39; offence provided for is the fraudulent gumming, sticking, or attaching to each other by any process whatever the pieces of a stamp or stamped ticket which has been divided or cut. Therefore, if a youngster fifteen years of age gummed together the pieces of a ticket to get admission into a subordinate entertainment, he would be guilty of an indictable offence, and could be sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years if the Judge trying the case were foolish enough to impose such a penalty. The Treasurer says that he has been copying the English legislation in this matter, but I would point out that a good many of the faults in our war legislation are due to the slavish copying of the English law. Thus we have adopted the moratorium laws of the Old Country holus bolus, without regard to the action of the States. We ought not to copy English legislation without regard to our local conditions. However, as the Bill is to go to another place, I ask Ministers to consider whether they cannot provide a lower maximum penalty for some of the minor offences that may be committed under it. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to express my disapproval of the Bill. I am opposed to the Federal Parliament invading an arena of taxation which it was not intended that it should enter. The framers of the Constitution did not intend that this Parliament should impose taxation on every source of revenue, regardless of the fact that our Constitution is a Federal one, and that the States, as well as the Commonwealth, have financial obligations. The Bill provides for the taxing by two authorities - the Commonwealth and the States - of the same source of revenue. That is very undesirable. From all oyer the country come complaints of this double taxation. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill is one to provide machinery, and we shall have two machines - the Commonwealth machine and the State . machine - doing the same work. The collection of the tax will cost a great deal. I object to the placing of a double burden on the people. The tax was originally proposed by the last Government, but this Government is almost identical with its predecessor. It is in consonance with the policy of the Labour party to do all that it can to destroy the Governments of the , States, and thus lose no opportunity to bring about Unification. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and they have given two or three turns to the screw since Federation. I agree with the right honorable member for Swan that this double-banking of taxation must come to an end at some point. It cannot go on indefinitely; but I think this tax is an unfortunate one to choose for making a fight. If possible, I would rather see a clear line of demarcation agreed upon, so that our respective spheres of taxation may be adjusted scientifically. But in time of war. anything which savours of luxury is a proper subject for taxation for war purposes. I hope the time will soon come when we shall readjust altogether our ideas of taxation. The sooner we reach that day, the better; but, until that time, this National Government is entitled to tax any luxury for the purposes of the war, and not for the purposes of the ordinary civil administration of the country. At the same time, I agree with the right honorable member for Swan that if the double-banking of taxation proceeds as at present it will bankrupt both the States and the. Commonwealth. As to the suggestion that I am a Unificationist, I must let my record be my answer. Ever since I have been in the Federal sphere I have stood for reasonable State rights; and I think State rights rest on the safest and surest foundations when they recognise our national rights, and the supremacy of the National Government, particularly in the strenuous days of war. </para>

                        <para>.- I quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we must use every reasonable source of taxation in war time, and, of course, we cannot quibble at the amount of the sacrifices we are called upon to make, considering the tremendous pressure brought to bear on the men who are gallantly fighting for us in the trenches. In comparison with what they are doing, our little abnegations are not worth talking about. At the same time, in raising taxation it is incumbent upon us to raise it in the manner most productive to the State, most uniform, requiring the least machinery, and in the manner closest to economic principles. I do think that, in the taxation of entertainments, we ought not to be duplicating the machinery of the States. In America a meeting is held periodically to arrange between the State and the Federal authority what taxes are to be imposed by them respectively; for, while it is competent for both Congress and the State Legislatures to impose any direct tax, yet in matters of minor taxation they realize the folly of having two sets of machinery to produce the same result, and two sets of taxes on the same individual under different laws. I am glad that, after the slumberous composure of the last fifteen years, the Prime Minister and the Premiers are awaking to the importance of some measure of Unification in connexion with the direct taxation of land, electoral laws, and also income tax. This policy was recommended by many of us in the early days of Federation. In1901 I moved in regard to some of these matters, and I find now an awakening to their importance. In the course of the debate in 1910, attention was drawn to the evil of having two methods of valuation for income-tax purposes, and two sets of laws applicable to the same individual. It is for that reason that the right honorable member for Swan referred to the fact that it was expected that, whilst we would not surrender our powers of direct taxation, in minor matters some arrangement should be arrived at as to the exercise of our rights. It would be even possible to arrange that the total amount of the taxation should be collected for both authorities by the  one set of machinery. I hope that some Administration will prove itself worthy of the good name that should attach to a wise Administration, by looking into these matters, which, though they do not pay for the moment, from a party point of view, are of great importance to the taxpayers of the States. </para>

There is no necessity to explain the 25 per cent. increase. The second difference, the provision of a separate schedule for ascertaining the rates applicable to parts of composite incomes derived from personal income and property respectively, is necessary owing to the judgment of the High Court in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Adam Forsyth</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Commissioner of Taxation.</inline> That case rested upon the interpretation of sub-section 2a of section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1915. The Department has taken the total taxable income from all sources, and ascertained the amounts of tax that would have been payable on it if it had been derived wholly from personal exertion or wholly from property. By dividing these amounts by the total income, the average rates of tax on the personal exertion basis and the property basis respectively were obtained and applied to so much of the total income as was derived from the respective sources. The High Court held that this method was not supported by the law, when the part of a composite income derived from personal exertion or from property exceeded &#163;7,600 in the case of a personal exertion income, or &#163;6,500 in the case of property income, and that the rates of tax fixed by the schedules applicable to income from personal exertion and property respectively must be applied. That judgment reduced the tax assessed by an estimated amount of &#163;30,000. In regard to the third difference, this is a complete departure from the scheme of the Income Tax Act of 1915. </para>

For 1916-17 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> estimated to receive &#163;3,250,000, and from the 25 per cent. increase &#163;1,000,000, making the total &#163;4,250,000. I do not anticipate receiving &#163;1,000,000 from the 25 per cent. increase, because a quarter of &#163;3,250,000 is only &#163;850,000 in round figures. I am informed by the Department that the reduction in the Estimates is caused by adjustments made in assessments and the general decrease in profits from business. So that we do not anticipate to receive as much from the income tax this year as was received last year. </para>

                        <para>- The allowance for every child under this Bill is &#163;26, as against &#163;13 under the existing Act. On incomes of &#163;500 and over, from either personal exertion or from property, there will be no exemption. I have here a few examples&#39; of the difference in the tax which will be paid under this Bill as compared with what is payable under the existing law. On an income of &#163;400 derived from personal exertion, a tax of &#163;3 19s. 7d. would have been paid under the old rate, whereas under this rate the tax will be &#163;7 19s. 7d. On an income of &#163;400 derived from property the tax was &#163;6 18s. 2d., but under the new rate it will be &#163;9 2s. 8d. On an income of &#163;500 from personal exertion the tax under the old rate was &#163;6 3s. ; under the new rate the tax payable will be &#163;12 13s. 3d. </para>

                        <para>- Apart from the abolition of the exemption it is an increase of only 25 per cent. An income of &#163;1,000 from personal exertion under the old rate paid a tax of &#163;27 17s. 3d. Under this rate it will pay &#163;35 3s.1d. On an income of &#163;1,500. from personal exertion, the tax formerly payable was. &#163;53 18s.1d Under the new rate it will be &#163;67 7s. 7d. On an income of &#163;2,000 from personal exertion, the tax under the old rate was &#163;87 10s. ; under the new rate it will be &#163;109 7s. 6d. It will be observed that the increase in the tax becomes proportionately less as the amount of income rises. This is due to the fact that under the old law the exemption disappeared when an income reached &#163;1,020 per annum. It is the abolition of the exemption on all incomes of &#163;500 and over that is responsible for the increased payments in respect of the lower incomes. On an income of &#163;8,000 from personal exertion a tax of &#163;1,097 10s. was payable; but under this Bill the tax payable will be &#163;1,371 17s. 6d. </para>

                        <para>- These are not my figures. They are from a scale I have had prepared, showing the taxation that will be payable on all incomes, from the lowest grade upwards. Under this Bill, the income of a person without dependants becomes taxable when it reaches &#163;100 per annum; but there is a gradually disappearing exemption, which wholly disappears when an income of &#163;500 is reached. Under the old law in respect of a person without dependants no tax was payable on an income of &#163;156 from personal exertion. Under this Bill, however, a person without dependants earning such an income will pay &#163;11s. 3d. Under the old law, l1s. 7d. would have been paid on an income of &#163;200 per annum from personal exertion; under this law, a tax of &#163;2 5s. 2d. will be paid. On an income of &#163;300, a tax of &#163;2 2s. 6d. would have been paid under the old law, but under this Bill the tax payable will be &#163;5 2s. 6d. On an income of &#163;400 under the old law, a tax of &#163;3 19s. 7d. would have been paid by a person without dependants; under this law, the tax will be &#163;9 7s. 6d. The increased payments are brought about partly by the abolition of the exemption in respect of all incomes of &#163;500 and over, and partly by the increase of 25 per cent. on the flat rate applying to all incomes. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it can be so regarded. The Department is particularly anxious that this Bill should be passed without delay. I regret that time will not permit a much simpler form of taxation, but I hope that in the future either myself or another Treasurer will have the benefit of some arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth to insure uniformity of method. This would be a great saving, not only to the Commonwealth, but to the taxpayer, inasmuch as, at the present time, owing to the complex nature of the forms, it is necessary to engage an expert to make up the returns. However, there is to be. a conference early next year between representatives of the Commonwealth and the States with a view to arriving at some uniform basis for the future. There is no necessity, in my opinion, to have so many duplications as there are to-day. The ordinary taxpayer, when he makes out his return for the Commonwealth, ought to know that at the same time he has made out a return that will apply to the State. </para>

                    <para>. - I confess that the Treasurer has me completely &#34;knocked out&#34; with his curves and his schedule. However scientifically the honorable gentleman may express himself, and however precise may be his mathematics, we have the result here in plain cold figures; and it seems to me, looking at the figures, that we have here a simple device to begin on the lower rungs of this tax, and make them as high as possible while leaving the others at, perhaps, a moderate rate. We have been led to believe that what was proposed was an increase of 25 per cent. in the income tax; but it turns out that, in some of its bearings, the increase amounts to nearly 100 per cent. Let us take the case already presented, namely, that of a man with &#163;500 a year from personal exertion. This is the man who, with his fixed income, is to-day in many ways hard put to it, considering the social and other obligations laid upon him. Such a man, who feels the pinch, perhaps, as much as any in the community, will pay under the Bill &#163;12 13s. in taxation as compared with &#163;6 3s. previously - an increase of over 100 per cent. That, I venture to say, is a tax that nobody ever dreamed would be attempted when the Government made their announcement to the House. Surely, under the circumstances, some alteration should be made. We ought not to pretend that we are imposing an increase of 25 per cent. when, as a matter of fact, the increase is from 75 per cent. to 100 per cent. I suggest to the Treasurer that he should do away with all this rigmarole of figures, wipe out his curves, and let <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> as a sort of recreation, go over the matter during the Christmas holidays. The Treasurer could, I think, by a simple enacting clause, increase the taxation by 25 per cent. in the way promised. This ought not to prove by any means a difficult matter; and all the provisions about exemptions and so forth might be left to a future period, when we are reviewing the finances as a whole. This is not the time to deal with such a question exhaustively, and, further, this has come on us all as a surprise. </para>

                        <para>- That is an easy way of putting it, but would not the proper way be to say that such a man is called upon to pay double what he paid before? In view of what it means in revenue, I question whether it is worth while getting at these men, who find themselves heavily taxed all round now. It all comes from the Treasurer slavishly following his predecessor, that Svengali who covered things up in his own way, and hypnotized us until we did not know where we were. </para>

                        <para>- In order to deal with the third degree in sub-section c, there is required an introduction to take the form of almost - well, I shall not say an <inline font-style="italic">Odyssey</inline> - but it requires a suitable introduction, whereas my colleague has broken it to the Committee too abruptly. The two sets of figures have to be read in connexion, and the fatal mistake of the Treasurer was in attempting to deal with them singly. I am not going to express any astonishment at the results that are allegedly declared by this method; all I say is - and no one can deny it - that the basis is scientific. By mathematical, infinitesimal, and equitable gradations, each &#163;1 of additional income bears its fair additional increment of taxation. If the result prove unsatisfactory, that would appear to me to be ample proof that the taxpayer has unaccountably found himseli in the wrong place; if he were lower down in the schedule, the tax would press on him less hardly. The intention was to increase the taxation by 25 per cent. But the Treasurer, as he pointed out in his second-reading speech, decided to remove certain exemptions, and that has caused the trouble. I have no doubt the Treasurer will consider what has been said, and, if possible, proceed with the Assessment Bill while he and his officers have an opportunity to generally consider the position. </para>

                        <para>- No, no. If it is found that the amount of money the Treasurer requires cannot be reduced, then, of course, it cannot be reduced. It is quite impossible to make an amendment such as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, unless and until there has been an opportunity to find precisely what the effect would be on the Treasury; and it cannot be expected that this could be calculated at a moment&#39;s notice. The amendment might, perhaps, make a difference of &#163;100,000 in the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- It is evident that the revenue cannot stand that. If an additional 25 per cent., with the exemptions removed, gives a certain revenue, and if to restore the exemptions means a loss of revenue to the extent of &#163;120,000, perhaps the loss may be made up by increasing the income tax by 27&#189; per cent. I do not know whether that would be the case, but, no doubt, there must be an increment which would give an equivalent return. The Treasurer must have the money, and the question is how to get it with the least possible hardship on the community generally. I agree that people with incomes of &#163;500 may already have burdens on them which are very difficult to bear, and that we have no right . to impose a heavier proportion of the tax on them than on the man with &#163;50,000, but if we lessen the burden on the men with incomes of &#163;500, we must place the burden somewhere else. That means that we must steepen. the curve, so that instead of the increase being 25 . per cent. on all incomes it may be 26 per cent. or 27 per cent. The Treasurer himself will indicate which course he prefers to follow: whether he will go on with the Assessment Bill now, and take the opportunity of reviewing the taxing measure at a later hour, or whether he proposes to deal with the latter now. </para>

                <para>Mr.BOYD (Henty) &#91;4.2&#93;.- When the Bill was passed last year just before the Christmas holidays, it was passed on the same attitude that the Prime Minister has adopted to-day. He admitted that he did not understand anything about&#39; it, but the House caught the infection of his genial laughter, and the Bill was allowed to go through without a solitary member knowing the ABC of it. Here, again, not a solitary member of this House can explain the schedule before us to-day. The position nowadays is that an officer of the Treasury, or a statistical expert of the Commonwealth, dove-tails some scheme for taxation drawn from the higher mathematics, and puts it before Parliament in the shape of a Bill, and when honorable members go to their constituencies they cannot explain its meaning. On several occasions I was asked by some of my constituents to explain the schedule of the last Bill, but I said that I would take home to my children the curve and the problem contained in it, and see whether they could work it out, for I could not do so. My constituents said to me, &#34; Then why did you allow a Bill like this to go through?&#34; I candidly confessed that it was because I did not understand it, and that I had been told that it was a scientific, accurate, and equitable schedule. I am told that the schedule now before us is also scientific, accurate, and equitable. </para>

                        <para>- The principal thing is that we should know what we have to pay. When I get a notification from my banker that my overdraft is so much, and that he wants me to wipe it out, I know what I have to pay. When the Postmaster-General charges me for telephone calls, many of which I know I have never used,I simply pay up. As representatives of the people we ought to understand clearly the meaning of these formula?. I reflect on no honorable member when I say that there are not two men in the House who could explain them.- When taxation is imposed is it not reasonable that the people who have to pay it should have some enlightenment upon it from those who have passed the legislation? </para>

                        <para>- A thousand reasons may account for it, but if the Treasurer must have increased revenue, and an increase of 25 per cent. will not give it, then let the Treasurer, as the Prime Minister suggests, make the increase 26 per cent., or even 30 per cent., so as to secure the requisite revenue instead of putting before honorable members a lot of Egyptian hieroglyphics such as we have in front of us to-day, and which we are asked to agree to, and later on to explain to our constituents. It will not only put the individual honorable member in a ridiculous position, it will also make Parliament appear stupid. I do not know any State that has a scheme of income taxation similar to this. If we take the rough-and-ready method adopted in Victoria, where the graduated scale goes up in &#163;100 stages, it is easily understood; but where we impose a graduated rise of (3   1 over 181.058) pence, what is the variation in the scale from &#163;400 to &#163;500 ? Will the Prime Minister work it out for me? </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister got out of the form he was in last year when he shifted this proposition on to the Treasurer. It was evidently too steep for him. I would like to know how he got on in his last examination. But, seriously, I ask him and the Treasurer to consider the question of placing before honorable members the principle of the tax in such a way that every one can understand it; not only every honorable member, but also every person who has to pay the tax, so that he may understand what he has to pay, and be able to calculate it for himself. If I am sent up for trial, and the Court proceedings are conducted in the Greek or Dutch language, when I, as a Britisher, think that I ought to be tried in the English language, would I be satisfied with the verdict - unless I was let off? We are quite prepared to pay the amount of taxation that the Government say it is necessary to raise in this war time, but the scheme laid before Parliament should be clear and distinct, and honorable members should know what they are doing. Furthermore, it should be the work of the Government, and nor. that of an expert in a Department, to propound schemes of this sort. Not one honorable member can understand the scheme before us to-day. </para>

                    <para>.- It is unfortunate that we have not before us a statement showing the operation of the proposed tax on varying; amounts. It was understood by honorable . members that the existing tax was to be increased by 25 per cent., but, according to the examples given to-day, instead of the increase being 25 per cent., it is over 100 per cent. on certain incomes. On an income of &#163;500 the increase in taxation is about 100 per cent., and on an income of &#163;600 between 75 and 80 per cent., because of the alteration that is proposed in the exemption. Previously, all incomes below &#163;156 were exempt from taxation, but now the income of a person who has no dependants is not exempt if it exceeds &#163;100. If it is fair that the man without dependants, getting a salary of &#163;100 a year, should pay &#163;1, it is equally fair that a man getting &#163;156 should pay a like amount; but, in my opinion, neither salary should be taxed. I do not agree with the honorable member for Wannon that the exemption should be lowered so far as small salaries are. concerned. </para>

                        <para>- We are given to understand that the method proposed is mathematically correct, but I doubt if even members who have had a University education can explain it. Unfortunately for them, not many of my constituents are called upon to pay income tax, and, therefore, I have never been asked to explain the methods of the Income Tax Department. If the suggestion of the honorable member for Wannon be carried out, and the exemption lowered, they will be taxed. The honorable member for Wannon said that the members of the Liberal party should not object to the lowering of the exemption so that men with small incomes might be taxed. It is unfortunate that this proposal has been sprung on us at what, perhaps, will be the last sitting of the year. The statement which has been made by the Treasurer this afternoon should have been circulated for the information of honorable members before the discussion of the measure. It seems to me that it would be better under the circumstances for the Treasurer to propose a simple increase of 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I have not said so. Last year all incomes under &#163;156 were exempt, and the exemption diminished by &#163;1 in &#163;10, until it disappeared in regard to salaries of &#163;1,000 or thereabouts. As to the merits of that proposal, I have nothing to say now, but I consider it unfair to pass the present proposal without discussion and a proper understanding of it. I am certainly in favour of increasing the exemption in respect of children under the age of sixteen. It has been said that we should deal with this matter to-day, so that the community may not be called upon to pay the Commonwealth and the State income tax at the same time. The State of Victoria now requires returns for the financial year ending on the 30th June, instead of the calendar year - that is, for the same period as that for which the Commonwealth returns must be furnished. In my opinion, we should relieve taxpayers of the trouble of making separate returns, as they do now. Even honorable members whose salary is a fixed amount find the making up of returns a trouble, and to the business community it must be a serious undertaking. I plead for a simpler method of estimating the tax, and for a simpler schedule. We shall be meeting again in February, and I think, therefore, that the Treasurer might agree to a postponement of these proposals, so that honorable members may have an opportunity to study the examples that he has given, and to deal with the matter with full information. </para>

                    <para>.- I am in favour of raising revenue by income taxation; there can be no sounder or more equitable taxation. Some honorable members have captiously criticised these proposals without understanding them. The only points that are now at issue are whether the exemptions shall be retained at what they were or reduced, and whether the rate of the tax shall be increased by 25 per cent. We, on this side, have always contended that it is unfair to exempt one section of the community from taxation. The members of the Corner party claim that in practice all taxes are borne by the whole community. That is too big a subject for me to pursue this afternoon. It is of very little concern to the constituents of the honorable member for Yarra what the exact machinery for computing the income tax may be. That is entirely a matter for the taxation officials. Being highly scientific, the computation must be complicated. The scale makes a distinction between the taxation of small incomes and that of large incomes. It would be, however, unfair during war time to absolutely exempt from taxation persons who can afford&#39; to pay, putting the whole burden on the comparatively few well to do. The obligation of fighting for the country has been recognised by individuals in every class of the community. I should like to know why a single man with an income of &#163;150 a year should not pay taxation. Every one whose income is above that amount might fairly be taxed on a graduating scale of increases, because it may be assumed that &#163;3 a week will provide the necessaries for a home. The people, especially in war time, should be prepared to pay in accordance with the privileges which they enjoy. At a time like this all capital should be assumed for the purpose of taxation to return a certain minimum interest. Unless you make that provision you allow crafty individuals to hide their incomes and to evade taxation. A balance-sheet should be associated with every return of income, and there should be an assumed minimum return of, say, 4| per cent, from all the capital during war time. It may be that certain industries would be hard hit, and pay more than they should under that system ; but in war time, when money must be found, I cannot conceive of a more equitable system of taxation than the income tax. The present Government and their predecessors have forecasted a wealth tax to provide funds for the purpose of prosecuting this war. Let us imagine the case of a widow and her children, to whom &#163;2,000 has been bequeathed. Under the proposed wealth tax, that &#163;2,000 will have to bear a levy of &#163;30, although the revenue from it, if the capital be invested at the highest rate of interest - 6 per cent. - would yield only &#163;120. I have heard no honorable members in the Labour Opposition Corner raise their voices against the iniquity of taking away &#163;30 from the capital from which the widow and children are to derive their income. But I have heard protests from all round the chamber because those who were previously exempt are to be hit by an equitable* form of taxation. I agree with the proposals of the Treasurer in the main. If there is one equitable form of taxation, it is the in- come tax, because it makes no distinction as to the source from which a man gets his income, whether from shipping, mines, or land. All must pay on the same basis. I have a distinct objection to that particular form of taxation which assails the man who puts his money into land. There are land-owners&#39; in this country who have not much equity, when they have to pay&#34; two land taxes and two income taxes, while men; whose fleets are floating round the world, are collecting 200 per cent, and 300 per cent, more profits than ever before. Their industry is operated from no base, but they are allowed to go free, whilst the men who carry on the primary industries of the country are singled out for special taxation.&#39; </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee will hesitate before slaughtering the proposals of the Treasurer. There can be no doubt that the Committee agrees with most writers that the income tax is the fairest form of taxation. As the Leader of the official Labour party remarked, it is unfortunate that the Treasurer did not introduce his proposals at an earlier date, in order to give the House an opportunity of studying them in detail. As I understand these proposals, the Treasurer is asking the Committee to increase the rate of tax by 25 per cent , to lower to &#163;100 the exemption allowable to those who have no dependants, and to make an allowance of an additional &#163;13 for each child. He proposes, also, that the exemption shall et ase at &#163;500, instead of at &#163;1,020.&#39; In  Victoria,  the exemption has always terminated at &#163;500. When&#39; this Parliament imposed the income tax last year, it made the exemption too high. The Treasurer has stated that, owing to the extent to which the war profits tax is likely to affect incomes, he expects the receipts from the income tax to be reduced by &#163;700,000 or &#163;800,000. If the Committee insists upon taking another slice from the income tax revenue, where is the Commonwealth to obtain the money with which to finance the war? A good deal of criticism has been offered in regard to the schedule. It is not a good principle to have&#39; increases in the rate of taxation at every &#163;50 or &#163;100. This schedule clearly sets out the basis upon which the income tax will be levied, and the amount of tax that will be paid on incomes of all amounts. An objection has been raised that the taxpayer will not be able to ascertain from this schedule what his liability to the Department is. I am confident that the majority of taxpayers, when they submit their schedules, leave it to the Tax Department to assess the amount of tax they must pay, just as we leave it to our banker to calculate the interest we must pay on our overdrafts. </para>

                        <para>- When my income tax assessment reaches me, I can calculate the tax accurately enough to satisfy me as to whether the computation of the Department is correct. I would sooner have a schedule based on a scientific principle than a schedule which increases the rates of taxation at every &#163;50 or &#163;100. For instance, in Victoria the lowest rate commences at &#163;100. The tax then increases at various stages until at about &#163;500 the exemption is extinguished. The effect is that the man who has an income of &#163;490 gets the full benefit of the exemption, but the man whose income is &#163;501 gets no exemption whatever. Under the system contained in this schedule a man pays on a graduated scale, every pound of income bearing its own weight, and receiving the exemption that is due to it. If the Treasurer could see his way clear to postpone further consideration of the tax until a later hour in the day, so that honorable members might have a chance of reckoning the effect of the adjustments he has made, it would be an advantage to all of us ; but having regard to the war profits taxation to be dealt with later, and to the levy in connexion with the repatriation scheme, I ask the Committee to hesitate before asking the Treasurer to slice off &#163;120,000 from his income by altering this schedule, which, I say, is based on a thoroughly scientific and sound principle. If the exemption was too high before, the Treasurer has done right to reduce it. I understand that because of the exemption, and the raisins of the allowance for each child, the gradual extinction of the exemption until it expires at &#163;500, instead of &#163;1,020 as formerly, and the increase of 25 per cent. in the tax, there is a large apparent increase in the tax on incomes between &#163;100 and &#163;500. The schedule seems to have been adjusted in order to give us a more scientific system of income taxation, a method of taxation which every honorable member agrees is a fair one. </para>

                        <para>- But if that exemption is just in regard to a man who is earning only &#163;156, there ought to be the same exemption of the living wage in the case of a man earning &#163;1,000 a year. All income over and above that living wage the Treasurer may tax by any scientific formula he chooses to adopt. Income that has been earned is quite capable of bearing taxation. One of the reasons which&#39; the Treasurer has advanced for this scheme is that whilst he is decreasing the exemption on some income in a certain ratio, he is giving another concession in the form of an increased allowance for each child. The honorable member knows as well as I do that the men who are earning to-day incomes over and above the living wage are principally men well up in years, and that, their families being grown up, they do not get the benefit of this allowance for each child. Therefore, that increase in the allowance for children cannot operate as an inducement to pass the schedule. It operates merely in regard to those who are young, and whose opportunities are such that they can earn just the living wage, which I am willing to exempt. I say again, that if &#163;156. is to be regarded as a living wage, it should be sacrosanct, and be exempt in regard to all income. That would be a fair and reasonable attitude for the Treasurer to adopt. Then those who are earning larger incomes could be made to bear the burden of taxation to whatever extent the Treasurer thinks necessary. Let me refer briefly now to the method by which the amount of tax payable on a given income is to be determined. Here we have what is commonly known as the mathematical curve. I can understand what it  means, but it may be difficult to explain it to a general audience. We have an algebraic formula put forward as a means of ascertaining the tax payable on any income; but under that formula, in order to arrive at the actual amount of taxation payable on a given income, one might have to dive into no less than six places of decimals. It would be practically impossible for a man on a public platform to explain it to a general audience assembled to hear him give an account of his stewardship, without hurting the self-respect of his hearers by treating them as one would treat a child in an elementary school. In order to make himself intelligible, he would have to do so. </para>

                        <para>- And also a great deal of patience, in order to give his audience even an elementary knowledge of algebra. But when you come, as in this case, to something approaching  the differential calculus, which is amongst the highest of our mathematical studies, the position is still worse. As it is, if a member were asked by an intelligent constituent in a public meeting how the formula was applied, he would have to hurt the feelings of other people, who could not follow his explanation unless he resorted to the simplest terms. If this system is to be  adopted, then I suggest that every member of Parliament should be armed with a sort of ready reckoner, so that when a constituent approaches him to ascertain what is likely to be the tax on his income, he may be able to enlighten him without having to resort to the devious ways of the third degree, the mathematical curve, and all these algebraic formulae. </para>

                        <para>- Personally, I do not need one; but it might satisfy the Postmaster-General. The point that I wish to emphasize is that, since on an income of &#163;500 the increase in the tax would amount to something over 100 per cent., instead of 25 per cent., as we were led to believe, the Treasurer should allow the exemption to continue as before until an income of &#163;1,020 is reached. That would give him an opportunity to increase the present rate of tax up to, say, 26 per cent, or 27 per cent, on incomes below &#163;1,000 a year, without involving such a drastic and extraordinary increase as is embodied in the proposal now .before us. When the public realize what this proposition really means, I do not think they will thank -this Parliament for imposing a burden of over 100 per cent, increase in respect of certain incomes which cannot bear that additional impost. Incomes between &#163;300 and &#163;800 are to-day bearing a very large portion of the taxation of the country. The public will be surprised when they realize that those who have incomes of from &#163;1,000 to &#163;7,000 per annum are not being called upon, under this proposal, to bear anything like a proportion of the extra taxation&#39; which is falling upon those who have incomes of between &#163;400 and &#163;800. I ask the Treasurer to make his scheme a little more equitable, and, if possible, to do away with this algebraic formula for ascertaining the amount of tax payable on a given income, so that there may be an ordinary reply to an ordinary question that may be put&#39; to an ordinary politician in regard to the amount of tax payable on any income. </para>

                    <para>. - While I have the greatest admiration for the highly-cultured gentleman who supplied the Treasury with this system of determining the taxation payable on incomes, I am afraid that his formula will be the cause of many headaches. I should like to compare this system of ascertaining the amount of taxation payable with that prevailing in Great Britain, and particulars of which are to be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hazell&#39;s Annual.</inline> The system followed in Great Britain appears to be simplicity itself, compared with the highly-technical formula adopted by us. It can be understood by a schoolboy, whereas our method can be understood only by clever accountants. I asked three different accountants to explain to me a certain matter relating to income tax payable under the Commonwealth Act; but, apparently, .they were puzzled, since I could not get two of them to agree as to the amount to be levied. At page 582 of <inline font-style="italic">Hazell&#39;s Annual</inline> for 1915 there appears a table showing the amount of tax payable on certain incomes under the Imperial Finance Act of 1914, and under  the proposals made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 17th November, 1914. </para>

He is a gentleman who can estimate the distance from star to star, and is one of the greatest statisticians in the world; but we do not want to be called upon to go into tremendous . mathematical calculations, such as are applicable to astronomy, in order to ascertain the amount of tax payable on any income. The Treasurer ought to sweep away all these degrees, and have a simple table, so that the man in the street may thoroughly understand the position. </para>

                    <para>.- Like most other honorable members I quite believe in the principle of the income tax, and if we depended more on this than on other methods of raising money it would be better for the community generally. I object to the Treasurer telling us that the income tax was to be increased by 25 per cent., and. then introducing a &#34;scienti fic &#39; &#39; method by which incomes of &#163;400 and &#163;500 are called upon to pay an increase of, in some cases, 250 per cent. I am pleased to notice that the Treasurer has raised the exemption on account of children to an amount equal to 10s. a week each ; but I think that he might well go further and also provide exemptions for older children who are attending our secondary schools, and even the University. Parents in poor circumstances often deny themselves many luxuries in order to give their children the benefits of education ; and it is the nation with the highest standard in this regard that prospers. Here we have one of the best investments for the State, largely due to the self-denial of such parents, and when an opportunity offers I shall certainly move an amendment in the direction I have indicated. Another suggestion I make is that, as in the case of the wealth tax, people might be permitted to pay their tax by instalments. More especially is such a reform necessary in the case of death duties. </para>

                        <para>- No, it was not; and it &#34;would be a great advantage, especially in the case of business estates, if the payment of probate duty could be extended over a period of, say, two years. This would not only prove of considerable assistance to those interested in the estates, but keep the financial market steady. As I said before, I am very glad to find that consideration, in the case of the income tax, is given to married men with , families, for no &#39;doubt such men are serving the State unselfishly, and to the best advantage. A married man with a large family spends three or four times as much as does a single man, and, moreover, contributes in a much greater degree to the revenue through the Customs House. Our Customs- revenue is something like &#163;17,000,000, or &#163;3 8s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> and a married man with six children contributes &#163;27 4s. before he is touched by the income tax, as against &#163;3 8s. spent by the single man. As the children grow up, the married man&#39;s expenses increase, and calls are made upon him at every turn. We pay enormous sums of money to promote immigration; and a man cannot serve his country better than, by rearing a large family. It may be information to the Treasurer that, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> statistical records, there are 26,000 more single men up to forty-five years of age than there are married men within the same limit. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking on the authority of the latest <inline font-style="italic">Tear-Book</inline> of 1914-15. It is gratifying to&#39; hear that an effort is to be made to arrive at some co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to the basis of taxation, for there  is no doubt that at present the varying methods are most confusing, especially in the country districts. It is not so much the amount of the tax that is objected to as the complex returns, the making out of which involves the expense of engaging experts. I shall support the Treasurer&#39;s income tax proposals, provided the increase does not exceed 25 per cent, in each individual case, as just and equitable, and I hope he will .take into consideration the few suggestions I have made. </para>

                    <para>.- We must, of course, provide the Treasurer with the money that is necessary; but, considering the importance of the matter, these proposals, with the examples, ought to have been before us several&#39; days ago, so that we might have had an opportunity to thoroughly study them. I must confess that, the examples are a perfect eye-opener to me. It appears that it is not until incomes of &#163;1,500 are reached that the proposed increase of 25 per cent, operates, and that down to &#163;400 the tax is almost doubled, while in no case is it  only  25 per cent. But we are only having the usual experience when we find such proposals as these introduced &#39; on the last day of the session, when, of course, they have to be rushed through. Something has been said in condemnation of the Federal basis of taxation, but I infinitely prefer it to that of the States. I do not profess to be able to explain the mathematical aspect, but I know that I have to pay a great deal less on the Federal basis than I have to pay under the rough-and-ready system that prevails, not only in my own .State, but, so far as I know, in every State in Australia. The  States basis is not only unscientific, but absolutely unfair. Surely the Labour party have been in power long enough to make some effort to have a uniform basis of valuation and taxation, and to provide that the returns shall be made at one period of the year. At present two sets of income tax returns and two sets of land tax returns have to be sent in at different times; one has no sooner done with the State returns than the Federal returns have to be prepared. Taxation is mounting up in a most extraordinary way, and if it continues this will be a good enough country to get out of. I quite agree with the suggestion that there should be some simple amendment of the law to provide for an increase in the income tax of 25. per cent.&#39;, leaving the other proposed alterations for future consideration. </para>

                        <para>- But the examples show that the increase is much more than 25 per cent. until the big incomes are reached. The present proposals may have been in the mind of the Treasurer, but members generally have had no opportunity to consider their real effect, and suggest possible improvements. Under the circumstances, it would be infinitely better to have a postponement. The Treasurer practically presents a pistol at our heads, saying, &#34; I must have the money, and this is the way in which it will be gathered.&#34; All the trouble arises from the fact that, in the true Micawber . spirit, the Government defer making any provision until the last moment. We have passed Loan Bills and Supply Bills and acted as if that settled the whole matter, but now we are faced with the result and find that the taxation is a perfect surprise to us. , </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer might give a little more time for the consideration of this matter. The proposal to increase the income tax by 25 per cent., has met with the general approval of honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- It is not equitable to charge a higher rate of increase on the lower incomes and a smaller&#39; rate of increase on the larger incomes. The position we are in proves what I have contended in regard to the scientific method of calculation - that it does not give what really is in the minds of honorable members. I raised this objection when the scientific method of calculation was first introduced in regard to the land tax, and. I raised it again when the income tax was introduced. </para>

                        <para>.- I suppose that the meaning of the provision is that if a lessee makes a profit by an assignment he is to be taxed on that profit as income. This introduces a new principle. It is very hard to say whether this profit should or should not be taxed. It is often difficult to determine what is capital and what is not, and a profit obtained in this way may have been accruing over several years instead of coming in one year. However, I shall not oppose the amendment. </para>

                            <para>.- This is a clause that requires a good deal of study, though I think that, on the whole, it is right.Under section 16 of the Act the income of a company is the balance of the total income after deducting the payments by way of interest or dividend. There was a doubt whether, in the case of a company carrying on business here, but incorporated elsewhere, payments of interest to debenture-holders not resident in Australia were liable to income tax, that is, whether we had the jurisdiction which wo professed to have in respect of them, and could tax the interest paid to them.. It has been decided in America that a similar tax is invalid. An inconvenience, which was pointed out by a few of us when the measure was under consideration, is that by making the company here an agent for the absentee shareholder or debenture-holder who is living in London or elsewhere, for the purpose of levying the tax in respect of his dividends or interest, we can prevent the company from being sued for the reimbursement of the amount. Although we collect the tax here, and make it compulsory on the company to pay it, we cannot empower the company to deduct it in England, and, therefore, if the absentee preferential shareholder chooses to sue the company at home, it can he obliged to pay to him the tax that the Commonwealth has collected. The amendment of the law now proposed enables us, without any doubt, to tax the interest paid to preferential shareholders resident in England; and to tax dividends paid to absentee shareholders. If a company, registered in England, starts business in Australia, we tax the whole of its profits here, and under the amendment now proposed we endeavour to make the preferential shareholders or debenture-holders pay taxation. We tax the whole of the company&#39;s income made here, and then allow the debenture-holders, if resident in Australia, to get an abatement in respect of their proportion of the tax. But if a debenture-holder or preferential shareholder resides in England, there is no power to allow the company to make a deduction in respect of his interest. We collect the tax from the company, but I am almost convinced that we have no power to make absentee debenture-holders contribute to our revenue. An absentee, on suing the company, could recover any amount deducted by it from&#39; his interest. We have provided that - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>In other words, if the company under the earlier portion of the clause has paid income tax on so much of its assessable income as is distributed to shareholders or stockholders who are absentees, or if it has paid income tax on interest paid or credited by it to an absentee, then we profess to allow it to charge them with what it has paid on their share of its total income. We profess to do that and to apply the same principle in regard to resident debenture-holders or shareholders. But while the Treasurer can collect the tax, he cannot enable the company to charge it to debenture-holders or shareholders who are absentees, because it has been decided in Queensland in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Spiller</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Turner</inline> that the absent preferential shareholders are bound by the contract entered into in England, and that we have no power to bind them in respect of interest paid by the company elsewhere. Although we have power to tax a company on the whole of its local profits, and although the </para>
                    <para class="block">Treasurer can thus get at the interest paid to shareholders here, I do not think he can enable the company to regain what it pays from the shareholders or debenture-holders resident in England. That difficulty might be overcome by an amendment as follows: - &#34; Provided that a company shall not be liable under (1a) of this section to pay income tax on incomes or interest in respect of existing debentures or shares in cases to which (1b) of this section is, from lack of jurisdiction, inapplicable.&#34; </para>

After the company pays taxation here, the preference shareholders in England . may recover from it their share of it, and the result will be that the resident shareholders in Australia will have to bear the brunt of double taxation. </para>

                        <para>.- Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> of section 18 of the principal Act as proposed to be amended by this Bill, provision is made for an exemption of &#163;26 in respect of each child who is under the age of sixteen years at the beginning of the financial year in which the income was received, and who is wholly maintained by any taxpayer who is not an absentee. I should like to move the omission of the words &#34; who is under the age of sixteen years at the beginning of the financial year in which the income was received,&#34; so that the exemption would apply to all under twenty-one years of age. Any man who is supporting a boy or girl who is attending the University or is apprenticed to a trade or articled to a profession is doing his duty to that child and to the S;tate, and should receive some consideration. It costs as much to maintain a youth of eighteen as it does to maintain a man. My proposal would also meet the case of those who have to maintain invalid children over sixteen years of age. </para>

                    <para class="block">My amendment, if carried, would carry out what I think the public were originally led to believe was the intention of the Treasurer, namely, that the income tax should be increased by 25 per cent, all round. As the Bill stands, the tax on incomes up to &#163;500 is increased by over 100 per cent, instead of by 25 per cent. In other words, such incomes are called upon to bear a burden which is too much for them. Will the Treasurer accept my amendment ? </para>

The honorable gentleman himself pointed out that this variation front the proposals of his predecessor would increase to a very great extent the income tax payable on the lower grades of incomes. The increase of 25 per cent, is reached only when we come to the higher grades ; the increase on the lower grades of income is more than 25 per cent. Will the Treasurer tell us what loss of revenue the adoption of this amendment would involve ? Is the amendment so serious that it would greatly impair his proposals before the Committee ? </para>

                        <para>. - I would remind honorable members that they have already agreed to a Bill which makes provision for the abolition of the exemption in respect of all incomes of &#163;500 per annum and over. In making my financial statement I distinctly told honorable members that an all-round increase of 25 per cent, in the income tax was proposed. I also said that the exemption of &#163;156 would disappear when an income of &#163;500 was reached. In the working out of this system it is found that incomes of between &#163;200 and &#163;1,020 will be subjected to more .than an increase of 25 per cent, in the tax. That is in consequence of the abolition of the exemption. I am not quite sure what would be the effect of this amendment. </para>

If it was desired to raise the same amount of money the schedule would have to be altered, but otherwise the Treasurer has only to shade off the exemptions at a more gradual rate. Of course, the Treasurer knows his requirements, and we must, to a large extent, depend on his recommendations. If he feels that the sacrifice involved is too big for him to make, that ends the matter so far as 1 am concerned. The whole scheme, to my mind, is most equitable and just. </para>

                            <para>- Then the matter may as well stand over, but it involves a point of considerable importance. As things now stand, if a company that is registered in England, and carries on business in Australia, borrows money on debentures in England, and the contract is to pay the interest on the debentures in England, we cannot interfere with that contract beyond declaring that the company, in its operations here, can be taxed on the amount of interest paid on the debentures. We leave it to the company to recover from the debenture-holders the amount of the income tax paid on their behalf. As a matter of fact, the company has no recourse against the English debenture-holder as long as the debenture-holder resides in England and lends the money to the company under a contract by which the interest is to be paid in England. The provision made in the Bill, by which the company may make a deduction&#39; from the interest payable to debenture-holders in respect of the proportion of the income tax paid, that might be debited to them, is all right sofar as it applies to those who receive their interest or their dividends in Australia, but it will not apply in the case of those of whom I have spoken. Consequently, the company will have to pay for something that it cannot recover. </para>

                            <para>- Because we have no jurisdiction in that regard. This point has been decided in several cases, and particularly in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Spiller</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">Turner,</inline> a Queensland case, decided in 1897, in which the decision was that the terms of an English contract with the company, under which the company was bound to pay, without deduction, the full amount of interest, could not be altered. Now we propose to tax that interest, and, apparently, give power to the company to deduct it in face of the contract with the debenture-holder in England, but it cannot be done. </para>

                    <para>Mr.GLYNN. - We deduct the amount of taxation we require by declaring that the whole of the income of the company is liable to taxation, and we allow the person who receives interest to claim an abatement of his personal taxation in respect of that portion that ought to be debited to that interest, but we enable the company which pays the interest to charge proportionately to the debenture-holder the taxation that it pays collectively. Tn other words, the company will pay the taxation, and not the individual shareholder, but. the company cannot have recourse to the preferential shareholder who resides in England, and has lent his money to the company in England. It is an English contract to pay the interest in England, and is beyond our jurisdiction. Therefore, although it is a proper proposal to get at these preferential shareholders, we will not be doing&#39; so. The company will have to pay the taxation, and will be unable to deduct the proportion payable by these people, or to recover it from them.I raised this question on the original Bill, and pointed -out that the provisions were <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> It has since been discovered that they were wrongly drafted, and now the measure has &#39;been very properly amended, giving the powers that I have indicated ; but, incidentally, we are not giving the company the power to pass on the tax to the absentee shareholders:. The only method of meeting the difficulty is to have an arrangement with the Imperial Government to enable it to be done, or to pass an amendment such as I have suggested, namely, that the tax will not apply in the case of existing shareholders against whom these companies have no recourse to recover what is paid on their behalf. But I do not press the point, although it affects a considerable number of companies operating in Australia. </para>
