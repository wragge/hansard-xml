                        <para>- Yesterday the Minister for the Navy stated that certain factories, among which were woollen mills, were to be permitted to recommence work on Monday next, and others, I think, this day week. Are knitting mills included in the permission? Can knitting mills, which depend on electric power, as well as those which generate their own power, start on the dates named? </para>

                            <para>- There are two paragraphs in the newspaper referred to. One is headed &#34; How the money goes,&#34; and in the other there is a reference to the position of the Administrator. As to the subject-matter of the first paragraph, I may say that the whole question of the administration of the Northern Territory is now under the consideration of the Government. In the second paragraph there are statements which are wholly unwarranted. Last night a representative of the press put two or three questions to me on the subject, but the whole conversation did not comprise, I suppose,  more  than two or three sentences. The press representative asked me whether anything had been done during the day with regard to the Northern Territory. I replied &#34; No.&#34; Then he asked whether anything had been done with reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gil</inline> ruth I answered, &#34; Nothing.&#34; I was then asked &#34;When will anything be done?&#34; and my answer was that something might possibly be done on the- following day. That is all that occurred, and out of that brief interview this paragraph has been manufactured. There is absolutely no warrant for saying that I have expressed to the press any dissatisfaction with regard to the administration of the Northern Territory. That being so, there is no justification for the paragraph as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- I said the other day, in referring to a general statement on this subject, that I thought that it was the duty of every employer to respect the law and to share the responsibilities under it with those to whom the proclamation directly applies. My view is that every employer should reinstate his employee in the position which he filled when called out to perform military duty. No&#39; general statement can be made as to what the Government will do when an employer fails to do this; but if the honorable member will supply me with definite, concrete cases, I will endeavour to deal with each one on its merits. I cannot deal with such cases generally. I should have to issue an order at large directed to no particular person. If the honorable member will give me particulars of individual cases, I will deal with them. </para>

                        <para>- In many out-back country districts the mail services have been wholly discontinued, on the ground that the revenue derived from them is insufficient to maintain them. I&#39; ask the Postmaster-General whether, remembering specially that many people in these country districts are keenly interested in the fate of their relatives at the front, he will review the action of his Department, with a view to reducing some of the services in the residential city areas so as to allow of the restoration of these country services ? </para>

                        <para>- The pruning-knife has already been freely applied to postal services in the metropolitan areas of Australia. As to the question of postal facilities for country districts, I have called for reports from the Deputy Postmasters-General indicating what changes have been made through their instrumentality, and upon receipt of their reports I shall endeavour to do what I believe to be right in the matter. </para>

May I ask the Postmaster-General whether, having regard to the shortage in the finances, the present Administration has given any instruction for the reimposition of the twopenny postage in Australia? </para>

                        <para>.- When progress was reported last night, I was endeavouring, as far as my ability would permit, to refute certain statements made during the recent referendum campaign as to the Labour party&#39;s attitude towards, or in connexion with, another organization, the adoption of the slowing-down process, and the practice of sabotage, and to place before honorable members the position of the official Labour movement, industrially and politically, in regard thereto. I stated that, personally, I had never yet heard any recognised official or member of our party, industrially or politically, advocate the principle of sabotage. I repeat that sabotage, while it may be new to this country, is not a new practice. My reading&#39; on the evolution of the system of production has shown me that sabotage was practised in the Old Land so long ago as 135 years. The men who were then responsible for the practice might to-day be justified on the ground of their ignorance. When machinery was introduced into the mills at Home, the men and women connected with the industries came to the conclusion that it would mean the throwing of many of them out of employment for all time; and, in their wrath at the new methods, they entered factories and destroyed the plant. Honorable members had impressed on them the other day by the Prime Minister the fact that this Government intends, if possible, to stop the advocacy and practice of any system of sabotage. I only wish to say that if sabotage has been practised, we who are connected with the recognised Labour movement accept no responsibility for those practices or for the advocacy of them. As a party, we say clearly and emphatically, that in this country there is no necessity for resort to sabotage, or for- those who do not believe in certain laws to go to the extreme steps of taking human life and destroying public property. If the object of giving such prominence to the Industrial Workers of the World to-day is to do injury to the Labour movement, the people who wish to achieve that purpose will have a very difficult task indeed in convincing the people of the Commonwealth that the recognised Labour movement indorses such doctrines. </para>

                            <para>- I have not. We are told that the Industrial Workers of the World are attaining to considerable power in America, and that those who have taken control of the branch in New South Wales, where the organization has its head-quarters, are new arrivals from other parts of the world. I repeat that whilst there may have been in the past justification for certain people putting into practice the principles advocated by a section of the Industrial Workers of the World, I am certain that there is no justification for such practices to-day. </para>

                            <para>- They have one  organization throughout the world, with branches in every portion of the British Empire and in America, Germany, and France. There is, however, a large section of people connected with the organization who do not believe in the taking of human life and the destruction of property. Those whom I have heard advocating the principles of the Industrial Workers of the World have only urged the use of the one weapon, and that was the general strike. I have never heard any of their number advocate on the public platform the destruction of property or resort to violence. </para>

                            <para>- The only point I have raised in connexion with the trial is that when men are standing in the shadow of death, as every man is who is on trial for an offence the penalty for which is death, I object to any man, and particularly the Prime Minister, going upon the public platform and prejudging the accused. I will adopt that attitude in regard to even the meanest cur on earth, for it is a recognised principle of British justice that a man who is on trial shall not be prejudged in public by any individual or the press. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but it is taken for granted that such comment may influence a jury. The Prime Minister stated also that he and his Government will no longer allow themselves to be dictated to by irresponsible outside bodies, and that the basic principle of democratic government was in danger in the Commonwealth when irresponsible bodies dictated to the representatives of the people in this Parliament as to how they should record their vote&#39;s. In making that statement, the Prime Minister was referring to the governing bodies of the Labour movement, the organizations which created him and his supporters. Let me draw attention to the work which those so-called irresponsible bodies have done in the past for the Labour party and the people of Australia. We boast on the public platform of our White Australia policy, a principle which was debated and placed on the platform of the Labour party long before it was adopted by members of Parliament. I have with me the records of the Labour movement, industrially and politically, practically from its inception in Australia, and I find that, in regard to the proposals for a White Australia, for the establishment of industrial laws, State and Commonwealth, for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank, for the Commonwealth note issue, for a tax on unimproved land values, and for the defence scheme, the proposals emanated, not from Labour politicians, but from the rank and file of those irresponsible bodies referred to by the Prime Minister. </para>

If there should be a reward for services to any movement, industrial or political, and if the highest reward that can be given is election to a seat in Parliament, then I say there are many men in our movement who have not graced the legislative chamber with greater claims to election than many who are in Parliament to-day. </para>

                            <para>- No; we did that afterwards. In regard to the recruiting proposals of the Prime Minister, we are told by those who took the platform in favour of conscription that they supported compulsion because of the failure of the voluntary system. But they cannot justify their action on those ground&#39;s, because it was the magnificent success1 of the voluntary system that made possible their support of conscription. When the Prime Minister returned to Australia, he said, &#34; We want 11,500 men per month.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister told us in a certain place that he required 11,500 per month; but, twenty -four hours later, he said that he required 16,500 per month. He told us that the number of recruits forthcoming was not as numerous as the number that came forward earlier in the year. The number of men that Australia can supply is limited. Out of the available medically fit men, practically 300,000 had already volunteered, and been accepted. Yet, after that great drain on the young manhood of the country, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence were of opinion that the number of recruits forthcoming should be as great as the number that volunteered at the earlier stages of the war. The falling off in the number of men actually offering their services was only proportionate to the great number that had already been taken into camp at the inception of the war.. During the referendum campaign, figures were quoted from public platforms for the information of tie electors, but they &#39; were never permitted to appear in the press. The campaign was conducted on lines consistent with the statement made by the Prime Minister on the floor of the House just prior to the adjournment, in reply to a question submitted by the honorable member for Batman. The honorable member for Batman asked the Prime Minister if it was his intention to issue a statement of the case for and against the referendum, but to that the right honorable gentleman replied, &#34; No. There is only one side, and that is not yours.&#34; In accordance with that view, the people were denied, during the referendum campaign, information which as citizens was due to them, having in mind the importance of the issue that they were being asked to decide. </para>

                            <para>- In the newspapers, morning after morning, we read of the call from the boys in the trenches. In on&#169; column we were told that our men were falling from exhaustion due to the lack of reinforcements; that they were kept weeks in the trenches without a spell, and were, therefore, not in a condition to do justice to themselves. In other columns of the same papers, however, were descriptions of engagements in which Australian soldiers had taken part, and statements of the admiration of eye witnesses including experienced military men, who said, &#34;The Australians do not fight like ordinary soldiers. Every man of them goes into an engagement like a trained athlete.&#34; One set of statements was in complete contradiction to the other set. The Prime Minister has stated in a veiled sort of way that he accepts the decision of the people, but in another place it is suggested that there is a possibility of a further appeal to the people on the question of compulsory military service. But, to-day, the people are in possession of the true facts, which have come to them, not through the newspapers, but in the letters sent from overseas. Every mail brings letters from men in France, on. Salisbury Plain, and in the hospitals in London, and the statements therein contained are in complete contradiction of those which have been made, on the floor of this House, and in the press, regarding the attitude of our troops towards conscript tion. We were told that to win the fight we should have to get a clear majority of from 150,000 to 160,000 in Australia to counteract the tremendous &#34; Yes &#34; vote that would come from abroad. It was said that every soldier in France and in England would* vote &#34;&#34;Yes,&#34; and many of the people here believed it. On the morning of the referendum, a. vessel carrying the first consignment of wounded sent from France arrived at Port Mel. bourne. The men heard of the conscription referendum when coming up the bay, and recorded their votes when between Queenscliff and Port Melbourne. Their votes were given openly, and when they got to the pier they made another demonstration of their feeling of bitter hostility towards the Government proposal. The vote of the Anzacs and of the men on Salisbury Plain indicated the same feeling. We were led to believe that our men abroad were suffering untold hardships because others in Australia were not volunteering, but the evidence that has come from the front gives the lie direct to that statement. The letters that are coming daily from the front make it more than certain that if the question were again referred to the people conscription would be defeated, by a majority not of 60,000, but of 250,000. The number of men who had volunteered between the date of the outbreak of the war and the end of September, 1915, was 147,000. In October, 1915, 10,789 men volunteered; in November, 9,674; and in December, 9,307. In January, 1916, 22,688 volunteered; in February, 18,665; in March, 15,862; in April, 9,908; in May, 10,656; in June, 6,592; in July, 6,170; in August, 6,161; in September, 9,072; and in October, 11,522; a total of 147,066. Notwithstanding those figures, we have been told that the voluntary system has failed in Australia. We were told that to provide necessary reinforcements conscription was absolutely essential. Therefore, it was the stupendous success of the voluntary system that justified the advocacy of conscription. The Prime Minister had told his party, the </para>

                            <para>- That is the kernel of his speech. He said, referring to the war, that the outlook was never more black than it is to-day. He pointed out what Australia had done, and what still remained for her to do. Men were essential, he said, for the success of the British and their Allies in this war; but the production of meat, wool, and wheat in Australia was equally essential. In proportion to her population, Australia, situated practically 13,000 miles from the seat of war, has already raised the greatest and the most expensive volunteer army ever put on a battlefield. Having regard to the great drain that has already been made upon our manhood, and to the importance of maintaining our industries, I am forced to the conclusion that Australia has - practically come to her limit so far as the supply of men is concerned. </para>

                            <para>- There are sections of this community who do not have big families. It is not fashionable to have them. An elderly gentleman, who resides in the electorate of Henty, recently came to the House to complain of certain regulations that had been put into operation in connexion with the referendum. He is a native of Collingwood, and his father was born in Edinburgh, while his mother is an Englishwoman. When he went to record his vote he was objected to and told to see the chief presiding officer. There was only one reason for this action. It appears that a prominent lady worker who was canvassing the electorate in support of the &#34;Yes&#34; campaign had called at his house, and had been told by him that he intended to vote &#34; No.&#34; He explained that he had seven sons, three of whom were already at the front, and that under the Government proposals a fourth son would be taken from him. It had been a struggle for himself and his wife to rear these boys, and there were other people of whom he knew, whose boys were being exempted because &#39; they were &#34; only sons.&#34; He added, &#34; These people have only one son each, because they have been selfish all their lives. My wife and I, on the other hand, have not been selfish, and although we have three boys at&#39; the front, we are told that a fourth must go.&#34; As a result of this conversation, this man&#39;s right to vote was queried on the ground that he was disloyal, or on some other pretext.  His  name is Daniel Charles Collins - a name that is British enough for any one. Returning to the important question of the supply of nien, I repeat that many of the young men now available in Australia are members of families who are already well represented at the front. The parents of these young men objected to their going to the front in the circumstances. There are few families that have not made some sacrifice. In some streets we may find homes in which there are two or three young men who have not offered their services, but these are exceptional cases. An overwhelming majority of Australian and British families here are represented at the front to-day. The Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister, instead of going through the country and crying &#34; stinking fish,&#34; should be proud, as representatives of the people in the National Parliament, of what Australia has done in the way of supplying men and the expenditure of public wealth in prosecuting the war. </para>

                            <para>- I am expressing my own opinion. There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer, and it is one that has apparently escaped the memory of the Prime Minister, who has made no reference to it since his return from the Old Country. Some time prior to his leaving for England, the Labour party proposed that there should be a referendum of the people in regard to certain amendments of the Constitution. The necessary Bills were passed through both Houses, and the case for and against the referendum was printed for distribution, an expenditure of &#163;30,000 or &#163;40,000 being incurred in connexion with it. At that stage the present Prime Minister came forward with a clear and definite promise from the Premiers of Australia that, if we would agree to the withdrawal of the referendum, they would pass through their State Parliaments the necessary enabling Bills to  give  this Parliament the powers we desired it should have. </para>

                            <para>- The promise was made, but it has never been fulfilled. The Prime Minister must know that if he was not tricked his party at least was tricked into, that arrangement, and, while he has plenty of time to spend in condemning those who have done so much for him in the roast, he has no time, apparently, to utter a word of protest against the Premiers of Australia who played this trick Upon him and his supporters. I enter my protest against the failure of the prime Minister to take action in regard to this matter. As to the attitude of our party, I hold it to be our duty to fight the Government at every stage of its existence. There is only one Opposition in this Parliament to-day, and it consists of the official Labour party. We are in opposition, and we should go on continuously fighting the Government at every stage of its existence. We should be increasing in our hostility to it, until it has been put out of power, or until there has been an appeal to the people. If such an appeal be made, I believe the people will once again say that they have every confidence in the great and recognised Labour movement of Australia. </para>

I am not very much concerned with that fight between the two parties, but there should surely be some concern for the country which my honorable friend represents, in common with the rest of us, in these dire days. Not one expression of anxiety concerning the country in its relation to the war has escaped the honorable member&#39;s lips during the hour and thirty-five minutes that he has occupied our attention. Not once has he expressed the hope even that we shall win the war. Not once has he expressed any intention on his part to lift a finger to help to bring the war to a successful conclusion. From first to last his speech was a diatribe against the Government for what they have, and what they have not, done. Never once has a sentence escaped his lips any more than a sentence escaped the lips of his Leader yesterday as to what was necessary to bring the war to a successful conclusion. On the contrary, he says that the country has done enough, and that we have no more men to spare. In plain words, speaking for his colleagues, he says, &#34; We are out of the business, so far as the war is concerned.&#34; That is the attitude which the official Labour party is taking up. </para>

He ought not to do any more recruiting, because he does not believe in it - because he says we have done enough, and have recruited all the men we can spare. I am very sorry to hear these expressions fall so glibly from my honorable friend. This war will not be won until we get a very much greater appreciation of the real difficulties in front of us than that which pervades the speech and mind of the honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- I say that any man who begins prattling about peace at this time of day has a complete misapprehension of the condition of affairs at the war. This is not the time to talk of peace. Let us talk war until the war is over - until the victory is won. We are asked to  talk of peace and publish our proposals for peace. We are asked to make those proposals public, and to let the Germans see them, so that &#34; in the interests of humanity&#34; we may have an &#34; early and honorable peace.&#34; People who talk in that strain are out of the war business altogether. </para>

                            <para>- These interjections are very instructive. They indicate the attitude of mind of the honorable member and others with him. They indicate clearly that they think that the war ought to cease at the earliest possible moment, and that we ought to get the best terms that we can. Perish sentiments of that kind ! That is not the way of peace, but the way of further war and bloodshed. I am surprised to see my honorable, friend, the ex-Treasurer, laughing. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Fawkner spoke of the Government and its misdeeds; and we have seen how a heresy hunt has been set up in recent days on the one question of the nation&#39;s safety, or otherwise. This causes me to wonder, and to ask that honorable member and his friends a question. The honorable member took about an hour to prove that he and his fellows, and their organization, have no relation whatever to the Industrial Workers of the World - that they have nothing to do with them. While those honorable members and their friends were conducting this heresy hunt against the Government - whose only crime was that they took their own view as to what the requirements of the nation were, and what the safety of the nation demanded - did they ever conduct, or have they ever conducted, a heresy hunt of a similar kind against the Industrial Workers of the World in their unions? I should like my honorable friends to answer that question. Have they ever conducted a similar heresy hunt against those men who set out to burn cities and destroy properties? Have they ever conducted against them such a hunt as they are conducting against the Government of the day on the one question of the safety of the nation ? </para>

Have my honorable friends ever tried to hunt them out as they are trying to hunt the members of the present Government out&#39; of political life? Have my honorable friends ever declared war to the death against them, in round set terms, as they have declared war against the Prime Minister and his Government? It is time we asked these questions, when we hear honorable members declaring that their one duty is to fight the present Government step by step to the bitter end, encompassing their political death, if that be at all possible, for the one reason that they believed that, their country required them to compulsorily recruit men in order to secure its safety and future peace. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable member mean that, in order to preserve liberty of speech, a man is to be allowed to say anything he likes, and no exception may be taken to it? That is a strange doctrine. I know of a whole pile of Statutes which say that a man may not express any opinion he chooses to hold, and under which he is sent to gaol if he does so. He is only permitted to act and speak within the laws of the country. However, my object is to point out that I have heard no protest from the honorable member against the sort of thing disclosed by the extracts I have read. The honorable member has not declared that he will fight this kind of thing to the death. </para>

I should not have referred to it at all but for the bitter statements hurled across the chamber this afternoon concerning the Government, whose only crime, after all, was that they believed that their country needed a certain course of action to be taken, and they had the courage and conscience to try to lead it in the direction they thought right. Whilst the honorable member for Fawkner asks me to grant these Industrial Workers of the World liberty to express their opinions in any way they choose, he will not allow his fellow members to hold any opinion concerning a question of national importance. He says to them, &#34; If you dare to express an opinion of any kind on conscription, you are anathema, and all your previous services to the cause of humanity, the unions, and the working man shall count for nothing. We shall bring about your political death at the earliest possible moment.&#34; That seems to me to be strangely inconsistent. </para>

                    <para>Concerning the industrial question in general, the Commonwealth has a record in this respect of which it has no cause to be proud. There nave been 824 strikes during the two years of war, notwithstanding that every possible effort was made to prevent trouble and&#39; adjust disputes on a peaceful basis. Notwithstanding all the laws that have been made at the request of the men themselves for the settlement of industrial trouble, the fact remains that they have set the laws aside, flouted the tribunals, and engaged in 824 strikes while the country has been at war. In my judgment, this is all traceable to . the one thing I have been fighting for the last twenty years - the politicising  of the unions. It is the political poison in them which is doing all the mischief. Behind their fair, legitimate and justifiable objectives there are these political objectives which are tincturing the whole environment in which they live, and which are leading to all this trouble and unrest. Take the miners&#39; strike, for instance. Who does not know that the eight-hours question is but an incident in connexion with their general objective, which is to do away with wage slavery, as they call it, and as an ex-Prime Minister described it, and bring about the owning of the mines and the operating of them by the operatives themselves, or, rather, shall I say, by the State for them ? </para>

                        <para>General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Robertson, in proposing &#34; The Commonwealth of Australia,&#34; said the part which the Australian contingent had played in the war was second to none of the oversea Dominions. The Australians had done unprecedented work on the Western front and in Egypt. In a letter the Commander-in-Chief said the great achievements at Pozieres had never been surpassed. The Australians had never relinquished the ground they had won. </para>
                        <para class="block">They had established a very fine record, which he was sure they would sustain. We wanted all the men we could get, not only &#163;o win the war, which with God&#39;s help we should, but to win a lasting peace such as was demanded by the great sacrifices we had made. </para>

                            <para>- I shall tell the honorable member how I would bring a little peace into the mining districts. I have put it to the House many times before, but it has been turned down and flouted. Perhaps I may put it again. In the Newcastle district there could be, with great advantage, a Board at every mine, so that when disputes occur they can be settled instantly by men on the spot who know all the ramifications of the industry. I do not believe that any Judge, situated far away from the environment of these cases, is able to appreciate exactly all the details of the situation. Furthermore, these things come upon the men so suddenly. Like mushrooms they spring up in the night. A man may fire a shot over night, and in the morning find the spot a deficient place. When such a thing occurs we want a Board at the mine td settle the trouble, and allow matters to go on peace- Mly. </para>

                        record of 824 strikes in two years of war time is a record of shame. The real fundamental trouble in these days is the growing sense of disrespect for law and authority. It is useless to blink the fact. When the decisions of the Court are flouted, how can there be any respect for the laws that govern and control us? That is the root of the trouble in connexion with our industrial productivities. If our Democracy, particularly on the industrial side, is to develop as it ought to develop, there must be social, as well as. military, discipline, the laws must :be obeyed when they are made, and the decisions of the Courts must be obeyed, and there must be continuity of employment in this country. If we are to proceed on the lines of arbitration and the :settlement of disputes by law, there must be a reasonably complete acceptation of awards when they are made. The trouble nowadays is that when an award is made &#34;it is regarded as a jumping-off point for another, and there is no end to the matter. lt never ceases. Therefore, there is no -order or security in the evolution of industry, and there is constant trouble, -which hits the man as hard as it hits the proprietor. No employer can make contracts for two or three years ahead, as he should be able to do. This kind of thing goes on. To-day both sides are suffering. I am not speaking for the one more than the other. I am pointing out that we must get at the fundamental principles of this question before we can get back to industrial and -social peace in this country.
                    </para>
                    <para>Just now there is necessity for the nation producing more and more - that is the great outstanding requirement - just when the nation needs every ounce of its energy and strength pressed into its productive industrial enterprises, when the call is on the whole nation, it is brought up standing because of a dispute which could &#171;nd should have been settled long ago in the mining districts themselves. Our war debts are increasing. Our perpetual obligations are increased. Therefore, increased production is the requirement of the moment, and that just at the time when there are less &#34;men to do the producing. It may be that when our men come back from the war they will be better men for having gone, better disciplined, and more efficient. Let us hope that that will be one of the results of the terrible struggle through which they are passing, and of the discipline which they must necessarily endure while they are away from our shores ; let us hope that it will send them back better and more efficient citizens, for assuredly they will be needed when they come back to help us to bear the staggering burdens of the war. More men and more resources are needed, and the sooner we get down to these bed-rock principles the better it will be for us. </para>
                    <para>I have been, led aside somewhat because, in order that trouble might be avoided in the future, I felt that I had to answer the points that the last speaker stressed in his speech of an hour and a half. The position in this House is very peculiar. A Government is in power with less than a third of the members of the House whom it can call direct supporters. </para>

                    <para>I am glad to see, once and for all, in the forefront of the statement of the Prime Minister that responsible government does count for something in this country. In the immediate past, one has been led to wonder many times as to what had become of responsible government, but, at any rate, in the forefront of the statement of die Prime Minister, there is his declaration of freedom. Whatever has occurred in the past, no more will he permit outside organizations to dog his footsteps in the House on matters which concern no pledge or platform, but he will preserve the freedom that ought to belong to free men, and in facing the. great national responsibilities that confront him he will decline to take the dictation of any outside body or junta. </para>

                        <para>The Government, considering that such methods are not only inconsistent with responsible government, but incompatible with the basic principle of democratic representative government - rule by the majority of the electors through their duly elected representatives in the Parliament - sets its face steadfastly against them. </para>

                    <para class="block">I quote that statement with great (pleasure. To me it is like an echo from past years. The manifesto reminds me of one which I issued twenty-five years ago, couched in much the same terms, though framed under different circumstances. I then emphasized the point that a representative should be a representative, and not a mere delegate or the mouth-piece of outside organizations. This is not a mere technicality or matter of political prudery; it is a basic, fundamental, democratic principle. A member should keep in touch with those who send him to Parliament. He owes his allegiance first to the nation as a whole, and, secondly, to his constituents. I congratulate the Prime Minister on the assertion of this principle after his troubled experiences. No Government can rightly discharge its duties to the country if hampered and hamstrung by outside organizations. No Government can do what it should do if on the floor of the House Ministers . cannot answer &#34;Yes&#34; or &#34;No&#34; to a question such as that which I have just put to the Leader of the Australian Labour party. I am one of those old-fashioned people who believe with Edmund Burke that a man&#39;s electors have as much right to know his opinions when he is against them as when he is for them. But there is something incomplete about the statement of the Prime Minister. Responsible government, for its proper and efficient working, requires not only the freedom of the Administration from outside influences, coteries, and. juntas, particularly in relation to national matters, but also the existence o&#39;f a party in the House, working, framing, shaping, and adjusting its proposals, and carrying them into effect by means of the strength inherent in those who follow them. </para>
                    <para>As to the referendum. I deeply regret, what has taken place, and the position in which we find ourselves. However, it is useless to cry over spilt milk. The vote has been taken, and the result is that the camps are now nearly empty. That is the tragic fact that we have to face. Those who advocated a &#34; No &#34; vote cannot explain it away. There are no men for reinforcements. What are they going to do about that now ? They killed every proposal that the Government put forward. What is their constructive policy ? </para>
                    <para>There were many incidents which militated against the success of the &#34; Yes &#34; vote, and I am bound to say, militate also against recruiting. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports and others set out to shorten the line, and they have shortened it. They have shortened it from five divisions to four. That is the result of their efforts. What has taken place is very unfortunate. My honorable friends are enthusiastic over their win. They have won; but some wins are equivalent to failures. This is a win which injuriously affects the nation. I leave to my honorable friends what glory they can get out of the present military situation. </para>

                            <para>- Now that the honorable member is out of office, he says &#34;Hear, hear&#34; to every condemnation of dilatory and inefficient methods for which the Government of which he was a member was responsible. I wish to remedy grievances so as to facilitate recruiting. The fatal defect in our war organization is that long views are not taken. We have lived from hand to mouth ever since the war began. Irritating regulations are issued from time to time which militate against recruiting, and create infinite trouble and friction. They were promised &#34;during the campaign, as I understand it, an increase of the separation allowance to wives and families. I do not know whether anything has been done in that respect, or whether I wrongly interpreted what was stated during the campaign. Then there is- the question of suspending the liabilities of men who have enlisted, and of those who are already at the front. I hope the moratorium has been completed, and that it will be applied all round as perfectly and as fairly as we can make it. </para>

                    <para>It has been said that the calling up of our men stimulated recruiting. The fact is hardly borne out. Not 5 per cent, of the men called into camp volunteered to go to the war. One could multiply a lot of these mistakes did it boot to do so. The fact remains that our camps are nearly empty. That is the point I wish to drive home. I appeal to my honorable friends in the Opposition corner to give up this squalid squabble, and &#39; help us to try to fill the camps again. Our main object should be bo fill the gaps, and the sooner we do so the better it will be for our brave boys at the front;. </para>
                    <para>To win this war, many things will still be needed. I shall indicate one or two of them as they bear upon, the administration of the Government. As I conceive it, we shall have to rely upon ourselves if this war is to be won. We shall not win it by relying on other people, as some of my friends in the Labour party have suggested before to-day. We shall not win it by relying- upon the Germans running short of copper, or upon bread riots in Berlin. We shall not win it by relying upon revolutions in Berlin, or upon the breaking up of the Austrian Empire. We shall win it only when we concentrate upon it every ounce of our strength and all the unity and determination of the nation. We shall break the German lines when we have broken the German spirit - then, and not till then. </para>
                    <para>And so I want to indicate that the war is resolving itself into a question as to which side can stay the longest. The nation with the greatest reserves is going to win in the long run - the nation with the greatest staying power - and, therefore, we ought to address ourselves particularly to the question of how best to maintain, expand, and develop the staying power of this country. </para>
                    <para>One thing we ought to do at once, that is to increase our efficiency . in every respect, and to insist upon economy in the various spending Departments of the Government. Saving money is the equivalent of making money, so long as it is done wisely and with due regard for efficiency. Unity in the nation is the great pre-requisite of all. But, if the nation is to be united, what an example the previous Government was setting the nation when in every Department there was constant turmoil, trouble, and friction, week after week, month after month, , and year after year. Every Department is being inquired into. In the Department of Home Affairs there have been two or three Commissions sailing merrily ahead. It is a scandal to this Parliament that such a thing should be going on. The sooner it is ended the better for all concerned. We have seen one member of a Government indicting another member of it, and a Royal Commission being appointed to inquire into the matter, while the Government themselves have remained intact. Such a spectacle has never been witnessed in recent years in any responsible Government. The sooner this is ended, the better. It is hurting the Government outside; it is interfering with the prosecution of the war, and is fatal to economy in the service. </para>

                    <para>On the cessation of this strife and friction, there ought to be a vigorous pruning of the expenditure of all the Departments. Any expenditure that can stand over until the war is over ought to do so. That&#39; is the principle I lay down. I do not care where this expenditure is going on, if it can wait reasonably till the war is over, it should be firmly made to do so. I hope soon to see something done in that direction. Honorable members ask me where I would begin. I would begin on all our public works. Let anything at the Federal Capital, if you like, wait till the war is over, if it can reasonably be allowed to wait. Take the East-West railway. I speak with bated breath and whispering humbleness of this work, <inline font-style="italic">iti</inline> the presence of the right honorable member for Swan; but even there anything that can wait should be firmly set aside until the fight is over. In the Northern Territory - I do not know what to say about it, I was going to describe it as a sink of public money - some drastic reforms should be made. Our experimentation has been far too costly. It has been carried on upon too great and lavish a scale. </para>
                    <para class="block">Since we know, from bitter experience and at great public cost, some of the things we cannot yet do up there, the whole scheme of its government should be shorn down conformably with the work that is left us to do, and to do with some prospect of efficiency and success. </para>
                    <para>One undertaking that I would not curtail is the Murray waters scheme. Every penny devoted to that work will be money wisely spent. I see no more promising repatriation scheme in the whole of Australia. The sooner the Government get to work upon it in a practical way, and develop it, the sooner we shall be able to make homes, comfortable, happy, and smiling, I hope, for many of the brave boys who are now doing their bit at the front. That is an expenditure that cannot wait. It is doubly urgent in view of the circumstances in which we find ourselves. </para>
                    <para>Whilst we. ourselves are setting this example, I hope we shall force economy upon the States. I say that deliberately. It is high time we did. If we ourselves are going to save - if we are going to administer the physic to ourselves - then we must see that the States receive an equal dose. We must stop the nonsense that is going on in Queensland, where, with our money, which ought to be devoted to the war, the State Premier is buying stations, opening butchers&#39; shops, and pushing on with .his Socialistic enterprises. That ought instantly to stop, and there should be no repetition of it. The situation, as I see it, is not an easy one. On the contrary, I take it to be somewhat confused. But if we only address ourselves to the task as we ought to do, and stand up to it with firmness, determination, and sagacity, it ought not to be beyond our compass to control it in a way that will suit the requirements of the war. </para>
                    <para>For some time past proposals have been pouring out from this Government and its predecessors for  increased  taxation. No one objects to taxation if it is needed; but I object to the multiplication of taxes unless it can be shown that the proceeds are to be specifically devoted to war purposes. I object to piling those burdens on the people to keep our ordinary civic administration going. Do honorable members realize the extent of the taxation&#39; we are paying? Last year our Commonwealth direct taxation, all told, was &#163;6,500,000. This year, if the Government realize all they anticipate, we shall impose direct taxation to the extent of &#163;10,500,000, ostensibly for war purposes, and made up as follows: - Land tax, &#163;2,000,000; probate duties, a little over &#163;500,000; income tax, about &#163;4,500,000; war-time profits taxation, &#163;1,500,000; entertainments tax, &#163;350,000; .and one-fifth of the wealth levy, &#163;1,835,000. That gives us a total of &#163;10,500,000 sterling. </para>

                            <para>- Owing to the accounting system adopted in the Treasury and other Departments, there is no possibility of finding that out. Although for two years there has been a demand from this side of the House for the separation of these accounts, a beginning has not been made in that direction. And so it comes about that at the end of the year we are still without Estimates, and without a proper Budget statement. Here is an increased taxation of over &#163;4,000,000 sterling in one year alone. All the facts - and I regret that they are the facts - indicate that our spendings will not be as much as we anticipated on the war. The Treasurer himself says he anticipates spending on the war &#163;6,000,000 less than was forecasted by his predecessor a few weeks ago. If we are going to spend less and less on the war, why should we multiply these taxes? We* should remember that the money which these taxes represent, left in the people&#39;s pockets, can be put to reproductive use. Until we actually need them for war purposes it is far better, therefore, to leave them in reserve. It seems to me that they will be needed before we are through with the war. Above all else, we ought not to attempt to waste our reserves as we go along. Rather should we conserve them, holding them for the days of stress and strain, when we can call upon them appropriately to fulfil the nation&#39;s need&#39;s, and to perform the nation&#39;s tasks- </para>

                    <para>Taking the balance-sheet by and large. I candidly do not see that there is need for all this increased taxation. As to the proposed wealth levy, I have always preferred to regard it as a war charge, and to have it put on the same basis as other war expenditure; or, if something special is to be done, I see no reason why we should not raise a war loan for this purpose, and ear-mark a portion of the direct taxation  to pay it off in a very much shorter time. This levying on the wealth of the community is a thing to he done with the greatest possible delicacy and care. If you destroy or diminish the wealth of the community, you destroy its source of income ; and we may not do that to any extent with&#171; impunity. </para>
                    <para>Just one set of further figures before I conclude. In the three years of war - for I am confining myself to the war period - the Commonwealth has increased its administrative expenses from &#163;23,000,000 to .&#163;32,586,000, an addition in. the war years on ordinary administration of &#163;9,500,000. In my judgment, that is not justifiable. In the States, in the same period, there has been an increase from &#163;4-6,500,000 to &#163;52,750,000. In the year 1913-14, the total expenditure in Australia was &#163;69,560,000, and it is estimated that we shall require this year &#163;85,366,000. The receipts from taxation during the same period in the Commonwealth have risen from &#163;16,588,000 to &#163;22,450,000, while in the States the increase has been from &#163;6,304,000 to &#163;9,150,000, an addition in these war days, from taxation alone, of from &#163;22,S92.000 to &#163;31,600,000. These figures -show to me a condition of swollen extravagant expenditure which is not compatible with the strenuous times through which we are passing. Every effort ought to be made to avoid taxation and save or.r financial resources for the prosecution of the war, preventing the piling up of the enormous staggering load wa shall be called upon to carry; but we have been spending our resources on ordinary administration. We ought to remember the differences between Great Britain and our own country. Our war-time profits tax is down to 75 per cent. - for which relief, I have no doubt, there will be much thanks - but it is still 15 per cent, over and above the tax in Great Britain. Why that should, be so, I do not know. There are, as I say, great differences between Great Britain and Australia. We have no reservoir of vested wealth into which we may dip with, impunity without making the nation poorer. Our wealth here is our working capital, and to take that is, to a large extent, to cripple our enterprises, and make the nation poorer. In Great Britain, as pointed out by a writer the other day, the industrial plant and equipment is already purchased ; there the railways are built, the ports and public buildings practically provided, endowments for charitable,&#34; educational, and religious purposes have gone ahead - in a word, the industrial equipment is pretty complete at the present time. Here, on the other hand, we have had to provide all that kind of thing, so far as it has been provided, in two or three generations. We need much further capital expenditures to make our industrial equipment complete, and to develop this great, rich, and prosperous territory. In Great Britain, private wealth is largely inherited or invested, or at any rate, it is so to a greater degree than here. As a writer to whom I referred has said, Great Britain is like a household with an income drawn largely from inherited property and investment, whereas here it is drawn from our yearly earnings. In Great Britain, again, the bigger incomes are largely unearned, while here they are, for the most part, earned from day to day and year to year. I press the figures, which I have felt it my duty to quote, on the serious notice of the Treasurer, and suggest that the sooner he sets himself to cut down the swollen extravagance pf all our Departments the better for himself and the country at large. This is unpleasant and unpopular work, but it har to be done, for the nation requires it. As was said yesterday, the nation will net tolerate much longer this double-banking taxation ; something will have to move if it goes on as it has been going on in recent years. We have a spectacle which amounts to a public scandal. Every State has been rushing in to jump our legitimate sources of taxation for war purposes. Every State has rushed the entertainment tax, and increased its income tax. Every State has raked up every tax it could get hold of ; and, being more mobile, because less in scope and. character, the States have been able to get ahead of us. We thus find ourselves coming after them in this double-banking taxation of the people. This is not fair to the nation, and it must end very speedily, or the people, in my judgment, will end it in a way that, perhaps, some of us would not like. I appeal to the Treasurer to take the position seriously to heart, and let us see some real economy, consistent with real efficiency, pressed into the ordinary civil administration of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Government, and also into the conduct of this war. </para>
                    <para>Notwithstanding all that which seems to us at the moment to be more or less in the nature of cloud and fog, and notwithstanding the momentary pessimism that may come to us, we are all conscious of a better feeling in regard to the grand final strategy of the war. Shall I say that we are beginning to realize a new, a better, and a different war consciousness? We have not the thrill we used to have, a year ago, for instance, in the pain caused by retreat on the western front - the thrill which comes from being pushed back by superior forces, superior organization, and superior preparation - the thrill that is the result of desultory and unco-ordinated fighting - the thrill which comes from a feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, such as arose when the Zeppelins were dropping death and disaster on undefended villages. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but only to a slight extent compared with what used to go on. We are conscious of a new strategy to-day, despite all the untoward incidents of the moment. We are conscious of more co-ordination and planning along the whole line of front. We are conscious of the nations overseas bet.ter organized for war, and becoming better organized every day, despite political troubles and untoward political circumstances. We are confident also in our generals to-day. We believe they are &#34; fit for their jobs,&#34; and will see us through if we support them. The pride of race is revived if anything; and whenever we are in danger of falling into pessimism and doubt, we can always fall back on the unconquerable qualities of the British nation. I see no cause for doubt as to the final . result. We shall win this war, but when, and how, and at what time, depends on the energy with which we prosecute it - depends on our recruiting performances, on our administration, and on the training- and discipline of our troops - depends oh all those things, which mean efficient warfare. Thank God, we have seen enough of war to know that the Empire is not what it was alleged to be a little while ago, a &#34; fen of stagnant waters,&#34; but that the spirit of the Old Country is revivified, and she is the unconquerable Britain of old. </para>

                            <para>- Those who are so anxious that conscription should be introduced, have stated repeatedly that the voluntary system has broken down. But the honorable member for Fawkner showed that, during the last thirteen months, there had been 147,066 enlistments in Australia. I have obtained from the Defence Department particulars of the monthly wastage for the same period, and the figures show that in only two months of the thirteen did the total wastage from all causes exceed the voluntary enlistments. The wastage for the whole period was 84,885, leaving a surplus of recruits under the voluntary system of 47,729. It must be remembered also that practically 30,000 of the slightly wounded and ill returned to the ranks, so that the net wastage would be not more than about 50,0&#39;0fl.  These  figures show that the statement of the right honorable member for Parramatta that the camps are practically empty is not correct. </para>

                            <para>- It does not, but we know that there are approximately 100,000 men in the fighting line, distributed over a distance of about 90 miles. The Australian troops are not, as some people believe, grouped on the one sector. Some are at Ypres, and others at Armenti&#39;eres, Pozieres, and om the Somme. If the public of Australia are told the exact position, they will be in a better position to judge what is desired of them. Questions have been asked as to what is the war policy of the party with which I am associated. I should like to ask the Liberal party and the Government what their war policy is. The Government say that they want every man that they can possibly get. That bald statement is of no use. The public should be told what, in the opinion of the Government, is Australia&#39;s duty, and. the number of men that we should send to the front. Can the Australian people be expected to accept the opinion of a War Council in Great Britain that we should send 16,500 men per month <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is for the Australian people to say what they can do, and what they will do. It is for them to determine what is Australia&#39;s duty. </para>

                            <para>- The Government and those who keep them in power should tell the people of Australia clearly what they consider to be the Commonwealth&#39;s duty in this war. It is of no use to be indefinite, and say that we must &#39;send every man. Not long ago, the Minister for Defence said that the men raised under the voluntary system taxed the whole of the shipping accommodation available. The Leader of the Liberal party has been very severe in his references to the party to which I belong, and has asked us what we intend to do in regard to the recruiting scheme. I reply candidly that the conscriptionists have spoilt Australia so far as recruiting at the present juncture is concerned. They have been so vituperative and insulting in their references to those who voted, against conscription - and they have been especially insulting to the working classes - that, in my opinion, voluntary recruiting is spoilt for the time being. </para>

                            <para>- That statement is untrue. I shall tell the honorable member what scheme I favour. Australia is being started on a fresh recruiting scheme, just after one of the most bitter contests the country has ever passed through. Honorable members will admit that the time is bad. In the next place, it is proposed to appoint the honorable member for Balaclava  chairman  of the Recruiting Committee for the State of Victoria. No more unfortunate selection could be made.  It is thought that the public of Victoria are so short in memory that they forget the incidents that took place when the honorable member for Balaclava referred to the honorable member for Batman as being  pigeon-livered  and white-blooded, and he was challenged to go to the war himself, seeing that he was of military age and physically fit? What did he do ? He went to Armadale, and addressed a crowded meeting, and said that he would volunteer on the following day. He got tremendous cheers; but, after making that bold pronouncement, he sought to impose the condition that the honorable member for Batman should go with him. What was the result ? The honorable member for Balaclava went to the Prime Minister, and asked him whether, in his judgment, he should go? Speaking at Armadale, he said - </para>

                            <para>- The figures I have quoted are up to the end of October, and, as the document is dated the 6th December, I take it that these are the latest available figures with which the Defence Department could supply me. There is too much secrecy connected with the Defence Department. In a free Democracy a policy of hush creates suspicion. The Department should publish each month the casualties and wastage side by side with the enlistments. Then the manhood of Australia would clearly understand whether they were adequately supporting the men at the front or not. When we get first one set of figures, and then another, they are confusing to the public. In fact, it is very difficult for honorable members to get at the true state of affairs so far as the war is concerned. With regard to Australia&#39;s position in the war, and with regard to what she has done, seeing that we have already enlisted 300,000 men, if the further enlistments keep up the wastage with regard to that number, Australia will have done her duty in this war. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Some people seem to think that if we get every available man, and push him into the war, we are going to win. The contest may be longer than they expect. In addition to sending 300,000 men from Australia - more men than Britain put into the Boer war - it must be remembered that they have had to be sent so far away, Australia&#39;s position being quite different from that of Canada. It costs us twice as much to put our men into the field. Canada&#39;s deaths to August last were 9,000, as against 14,000 deaths amongst the Australian Forces; yet Canada has a population of 8,000,000, as against a population of 5,000,000 in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Does it not strike all with horror to think that 5,000,000 of men have been killed in this awful struggle? Does not the resolution say that nothing but an honorable peace must be accepted? Did not the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> say this morning that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> or Viscount Grey laid down terms, so far as Great Britain and her Allies are concerned? Surely there is nothing in the resolution but an expression of the view that we desire to see this struggle ended if we possibly can. The. right honorable gentleman* talked a lot about the stupendous debt that was coming upon Australia. If conscription had been adopted, what would have happened? It would simply have meant adding to that load of debt. Then why does the right honorable gentleman complain on the score of expense? The honorable member for Lang has handed me a newspaper stating that messages from Toronto announce that the country has been deeply impressed by the publication of the Canadian list of casualties, which number more than 65,000. But Australia has had 84,000 casualties, bearing out what I say, that Canada has not suffered in the war as Australia has; and Canada is reaping more benefit than any other Dominion, and will do so in the future. There is another phase to which I would like to draw the attention of the Treasurer. </para>

                            <para>- I have not been speaking for that length of time. Twelve months ago I made the suggestion to the Minister for Defence that recruiting should be based on the Federal electorates, and the Minister admitted that the idea was a good one. Had it been brought into force, instead of the system of running around with lists and census cards, which caused a lot of irritation, there would have been greater success in recruiting. The point to which I wish to draw the attention of the Treasurer is the item of &#163;10,500,000 for deferred pay  which appeared in the financial statement submitted by his predecessor. Great dissatisfaction is being caused by the delay in making those payments. I have received several letters on the subject. Private J. S. B. Thomas, who is in dire straits for want of his pay, has &#163;57 17s. 6d. owing to him by the Defence Department. In another case a man who has served 405 effective days cannot get his money. </para>

                    <para>When in France I made special inquiry as to how Australian-made boots were standing the test of hard wear in warfare. The reports coming from Australian officers are that our leather is unsuitable, because it absorbs water too readily. They say that the boots need a stub toe, because now, when they get -wet and hard, the toe sags and cripples &#34;the men. I understand that we pay from 13s. to 14s. per pair for these boots, but that the English-made boots cost &#163;1 per pair. The secretary to the Federated Tanners and Leather Dressers Employees Union of Australia has written to say that the reports that I have mentioned bear out the contention made by members of his council to the Minister for Defence, and to his predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that the defects are due to the chrome process of tanning. If the English method of tanning were followed, the &#34;boots would cost more, but they would be as good as the Briash -made boots. I have drawn attention to the matter because it is of importance. In Australia we should be able to produce leather as good as any in the world, and should be able to pay a higher price, if necessary, to adopt a better method of tanning than that now followed. As to recruiting generally, I hope that the Minister for Defence will consent to publish, monthly, side by side, the casualty list and the number of recruits. The manhood of Australia will then be able to see at a glance whether the men in the trenches are being properly supported. The gibe against the opponents of conscription that they are unwilling to support the men at the front does not help the prosecution of the war. Every man in this country wishes to see Great Britain and the Allies succeed. There can be no question of my attitude in that matter at any time. But I am not going to be bluffed, bullied, and insulted into standing on the same platforms with men who have not the decency to treat properly those who differ from them. The appeal issued in Canada by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Borden should be a lesson to this Government. </para>

In the game of politics there are only two bosses, the Laborites and the Liberals, and a man must range himself on one side or the other. When a gentleman like the Treasurer leaves one party, he is certain to be received with open arms by the other, but -he should not complain of his treatment by those whom he leaves. He must know that the fastening of conscription upon Australia, seeing that we are fighting Germany because of our opposition to its military spirit and military domination based on conscription, would be illogical. Because of his advocacy of conscription, he and others got completely out of touch with the workers of this country, and they have no reason to complain of the treatment that they have received. </para>

                        <para>.- My main reason for rising is to make some  remarks on the financial statement, but I am tempted also to say something about the policy of the Government set forth in the manifesto of the Prime Minister. What is most distressing in the present supreme crisis is the condition of things hi this House. There is a vicious warfare between two parties, those sitting on the Corner benches launching most malignant personal attacks on the Prime Minister and his supporters. This is in striking contrast to the condition of affairs existing when the Corner party members were behind the late Ministry. The Opposition, at the outbreak of the war, told the Government that it was determined to put aside party politics, in order that the efforts of Parliament might be concentrated in assisting the Government in the conduct of the war. The members of the Liberal Opposition consistently supported the last Government, and have indicated that they will give the same support to the present Government, which, I venture to think, will prosecute the war with enhanced vigour. Party politics are too insignificant for serious consideration at a juncture like this. My honorable friends in the Corner, as well as we of the Opposition, have a national duty to perform, and that is to give the Government their patriotic support. </para>

                            <para>- Our efforts should be concentrated upon the one object - the winning of the war. I ask my honorable friends on the Corner benches to follow the lead of the Liberal party in this matter, and, setting aside their present personal animus towards the Prime Minister, to join us  in encouraging and assisting the Government to carry out the vigorous war policy that it has promised. There is no man in Australia who is more capable than the Prime Minister of guiding our destinies at the present time. He is qualified not only by . his native ability, but also by reason of the advantages he has enjoyed in consulting with the Imperial authorities, who are responsible for the conduct of the war. It is therefore due to him that we should pay the utmost deference to the advice which he is giving Australia. The right honorable gentleman has done a great Imperial service - a service which commands the admiration of overwhelming numbers throughout Australia, as well as in the rest of the Empire. It behoves us in these circumstances to set aside all the other issues to which I have referred, and to concentrate our energies in the effort to bring the war to a successful issue. We should encourage and assist the Government in the great burden they are carrying on behalf of Australia. Some of my honorable friends of the official Labour party have utterly amazed me by their attitude. They have forgotten the all-important fact that this is Australia&#39;s war as well as the war of all other parts of the Empire. The enemy would be only toe glad of an opportunity to defeat and capture Australia. My honorable friends in&#34; the Opposition corner forget altogether the danger to which Australia has hitherto been exposed. They overlook the efforts that have been made by the barbarian enemy we are fighting to secure strategic positions in the Pacific, to make provision for a naval base in New Guinea itself, and to lay out other plans for the capture of this rich prize. Germany has long had designs upon Australia, and so surely as the Mother Country goes down-&#187;-so surely as the British Navy is defeated - so surely will Australia become a German possession. That is what my honorable friends are ignoring when they say that Australia has done enough. I want them to realize that Australia never can do enough until she has reached the very limit of her power and resources. While we have done well, we have done nothing like what the Mother Country has. </para>

                            <para>- The statistics conclusively prove that we have not done anything like what the Mother Country has. I invite my honorable friend to consider what would be the position if the Mother Country and her Allies had said that they had done enough. If such an attitude is to be assumed, then it means that we must cravenly lie down and permit the enemy to walk over us. Honorable members of the official Labour party cannot blink the fact that we are actually and definitely in the war, and that there are only two alternatives open to us. We have either to cravenly submit to the enemy and permit her to crush us, or we must fight the war to a finish. We can fight it to a victorious finish only by organizing, not merely our man power, but our resources. In this respect we have not yet attempted to face the critical situation with a full appreciation of its gravity. Australia has been carrying on business as usual, and we have never seriously undertaken our duties in this direction. I am not going to discount for one moment the splendid service that Australia has already rendered, and the glorious achievements of our brave boys at the front. But while a number of Australians are at the front I regret that Australia herself is not. Australia can only do what she ought to do by adopting a proper and efficient system of organization, such as the Government now invite us to approve. The result of the recent referendum caused me the deepest disappointment and humiliation. I recognise in it a failure on the part of Australia to perform its duty in the present supreme crisis. We must, however, accept the position as we find it. I admit that a great deal was asked of the people by this referendum. They were practically called upon to conscript themselves, which presupposed a high and exalted patriotism, a high and exalted spirit of unselfishness. I am glad to know that upwards of a million Australians conformed to that high standard. </para>

                            <para>- Let me remind the honorable member that this is not a war affecting only one section of Australia. It is a war affecting Australia as a whole, and which appeals to the patriotism . of Australians as a body, none of whom should be permitted to evade national responsibility. It is a struggle in which the honour and safety of Australia and the whole Empire are immediately involved. That being so, the Corner party is doing itself a grave discredit in seeking to discourage the efforts of the Government. The Government occupy a difficult position, since there is denied to them a means of recruiting on which they had hoped to rely, and which was resorted to by every belligerent nation engaged in this war. Conscription being&#39; denied to them, they have no alternative but to revive the. voluntary effort. In the making of that effort the responsibility peculiarly rests upon honorable members in the Labour corner, because they opposed conscription, and throughout the campaign insisted, on various platforms, that voluntarism had never had a fair chance. </para>

                            <para>-I invite the honorable member to join with the Government in giving it a fair chance on this occasion. The recruiting scheme that has been put before us calls for a wholehearted earnest effort on the part of every honorable member of this Parliament to bring it to a successful issue. I am not prepared to say whether or not it can be made successful, having regard to the discouraging conditions resulting from the recent campaign. But the existence of those conditions does not release us from the grave responsibility of doing all that we can to assist the Mother Country and her Allies. I was utterly amazed to hear the honorable member for Bendigo say that neither the Government nor the Liberal party had given any indication of what Australia&#39;s duty is to-day. If he was sincere in that statement, then his ears must have been closed and sealed; but I take it that it was mere pretence on his part. He knows that it is the duty of Australia to stand side by side with the Mother Country, and to assist her to win the war. He should realize that it is our war as well as that of the Mother Country. The obligation cast upon us to stand by the Mother Country at the present time is practically unlimited. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be very glad if my honorable friend&#39;s future&#39; efforts belie the statement I have made concerning him.- I hope we shall be prepared in every way to assist the Government in prosecuting the war. There is only one other matter to which. I desire to refer, and that is the deplorable industrial unrest that has characterized the community of Australia ever since the war began. I had intended to make a somewhat fuller reference to this subject, but it has been dealt with so amply by the Leader of the Liberal party that I shall do no more than say that nothing could be more humiliating to Australia than this disruption of her internal affairs at a time when mighty national interests are at stake. A united effort is called for at the present time, and when we realize that something like 800 industrial disputes and strikes have occurred during the last two years, we must feel that Australia cannot he in dead earnest or fully alive to its duty in the present vital struggle with the enemy. This state of affairs is in marked contrast with that prevailing in the Mother Country. The most recent returns from Home show that there has been there a most substantial reduction in the number of industrial disputes. The contrast offered by Prance is still more pronounced. The spirit of France commands the admiration of the world. From the inception of the war not one industrial dispute has occurred there. This record is due to the fact that the people of France realize that the struggle which is going on is a life and death one; they are imbued with the national duty cast upon them to prosecute the war with all their might. That is the spirit which should animate this community. It is the spirit that will enable us to join with the Mother Country in delivering the knockout blow which, I am convinced, is going to be administered to the  enemy. The Empire is wakening up. The Mother Country is rendering great and powerful service at the present time, and I am fully persuaded that she is going to deal the final knock-out blow in this titanic struggle. In this, however, Australia has a proportionate duty - the duty to assist in developing our man service and our resources. It is man power that is going to win this war. </para>

I am satisfied myself that  what  I say is true ; and no effort should be spared to secure the services of these men. I&#34; noted with much pleasure the splendid effort being made by the Government to secure our wool, meat, and &#39; wheat for the Mother Country. I. say, moreover, that we should bend our energies towards supplying our primary productions for the Empire&#39;s use. I should be very glad if a committee were appointed with a view to rendering help in this direction. One point I should like to emphasize is that our farmers should be encouraged to turn their milk into cheese rather than into butter, after satisfying all local requirements. Butter is a luxury, whereas cheese is a food. </para>

Turning now to the financial statement, I join with other honorable members in congratulating the Treasurer thereon and on the spirit of reasonableness which characterizes it from beginning to end. The honorable member has, of course, said a great many things- which must be a source of satisfaction, but he has left unsaid a great many other things that, no doubt, he will take his own opportunity to disclose, for I gather from the statement that these are under his consideration. One encouraging feature is that the Treasurer is determined to exercise every economy at his command. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is in accordance with the people&#39;s desires, and nothing should be left undone to satisfy the people in this connexion. Our war bill is, indeed, a heavy one; and we dare not attempt to curtail it in so far as the money is efficiently used. I am quite certain that no attempt will be made on this side to hamper the Treasurer in the financial prosecution of the war; but there are various matters which he ought to take into serious consideration. While I do not render my adherence to every measure proposed, it would be foolish and disloyal to do anything to embarrass the Government on the present occasion. The Treasurer has indicated his intention of, to some extent, modifying the recent proposals for the taxation of war profits. The all-important consideration to be borne in mind by the Treasurer and by honorable members is that, under vastly different conditions, we are attempting to introduce a measure similar to that which obtains in the Mother Country. The main object of the war profits legislation at Home was to discourage enterprise in all other directions except that of making munitions; but here, as I have said, the conditions are different. We are anxious that every form of production and profitable employment should be encouraged; and it would be deplorable if any measure we introduced had the effect of restraining or discouraging the expansion of industries, and thereby creating unemployment. There is much attraction in the idea of securing a substantial share of war profits if these can be differentiated; but any one who has given close study to the question must see that the measure before the House goes much farther, and if not radically altered, will seriously hamper industrial enterprise, and work disastrously so far as our production is concerned. </para>

                    <para>SirROBERT BEST. - There is something very attractive in the idea of a tax on war-time profits, but if that tax is to be imposed at the expense of our industries, and at the risk of a limitation of production, we should hesitate, and consider well, the terms in which it should be operated. The Prime Minister, when interviewed by a deputation in London some months ago, laid down certain fundamental principles to be observed, and this was the view he expressed when dealing with the subject of double taxation - </para>
                    <para class="block">Whilst substantial taxation can never be made very acceptable to the taxpayer, it must at any rate be just. The object must be obtained with as little friction as possible, and all persons affected must be treated alike. </para>
                    <para>I think the Treasurer has realized, to a certain extent, that the Bill in its present form proposes some very striking inequalities, and will act disastrously if permitted to come into operation without radical alteration. In his statement he admitted as much when he said: &#34; The operation of such a tax in an old and established country where businesses, generally speaking, are of long standing, is not a reliable guide to us in a new country.&#34; I cordially agree with that statement. He said also that the Department had investigated some 300 balance-sheets of companies, and they disclosed the fact that old and established businesses are not affected by war-time profits legislation to the same extent as businesses of recent formation. Those words are essentially correct, although I am not sure that the Treasurer realizes the extent of their accuracy in the proposal he is making. Every professional man is aware of many vast concerns earning incomes of as much as &#163;80,000 per annum - old and established firms and individuals who will not be touched by the war-time profits legislation. A striking anomaly under the present Bill is that an old-established business may have been making 20 per cent. or 100 per cent., or any percentage you like, for years past, and if a new or less prosperous business in the same trade makes during the war 8 or 9 per cent., that is, anything above the statutory percentage of 6 or 7 per cent., the latter is taxed, and the former escapes. I do not protest against the former escaping, but I use the example to show the inequalities created, and the folly of the measure. It is the little man and the new businesses which will suffer under these proposals. </para>

                    <para>SirROBERT BEST.- If the Government are seeking revenue they can get better results in- a much more equitable way. There are many cases, some of which have been brought under the notice of the Treasurer, of new businesses which have had a struggling existence for the past four or five years, and only now are beginning to reap any substantial result. To such businesses the present Bill spells absolute disaster. I could quote many cases of the kind which have come under my individual notice. The Treasurer admits that businesses of this character must be specially dealt with, and I do impress upon him that, perhaps to a greater extent than he realizes, this legislation will work disaster if some comprehensive alteration in it is not made. </para>

                            <para>- I &#39;am glad to hear that. I would also remind the Treasurer that the war has brought into existence many new businesses and partnerships, through businesses being turned into companies, or partners being taken in, to enable the principals to go to the war, or for some like reason. There ought to be some provision whereby the profits originally made by such a business should be taken into account in ascertaining the pre-war standard of profits. The pre-war standard is to be ascertained by either taking two out of the three prewar years and arriving at the general average, or by fixing a statutory percentage, 6 per cent, in the case of companies, and 7 per cent, in the case of individuals. That provision is absolutely inadequate, and I would urge the Treasurer, when considering this matter, to remember that the special risks of trade at the present time make it -absolutely essential that the margin should be at least 12 or 15 per cent. If the Treasurer can see his way clear to increase the statutory percentage a very substantial means of relief will be afforded. </para>

                            <para>- According to . the press, that is so. At any rate, I believe that the taxation has been substantially increased. But I will argue on the basis of 60 per cent., which until recently was the tax in the Mother Country. Thus, &#163;600 of the &#163;1,000 would go directly to Great Britain in taxation. The Bill provides that of the balance of &#163;400, 50 per cent., or &#163;200, should be paid to the Commonwealth, leaving only &#163;200 for the trader or manufacturer. In other words, assuming that the Imperial impost of 60 per cent, has not been increased, the Bill at present before the House will mean that 16s. in the &#163;1 must be surrendered by the taxpayer. </para>

                            <para>- The English Act permits allowance to be made for payments made in connexion with excess profits in the outlying portions of the Empire. Even on the basis of 50 per cent, the manufacturer would only enjoy  an excess profit of &#39;20 per cent., out of which he would have to pay all the numerous imposts of taxation and bear a1&#39;, the risks of trade, which in a war time are very considerable. Many merchants and manufacturers are holding very small stocks because they are afraid that at the end of the war values will decrease considerably. They dare not hold large stocks, and dare not carry on in the ordinary way, or indulge in any large production, because of the risks. I wish to point out how the 50 per cent, rate will actually operate in the case of one company that has come under my notice which is registered in Great Britain, and carries on a large business here and also in London. For every &#163;1 of war-time profits there will be payable - </para>

I shall gladly supply the full particulars of this case to the Treasurer, whose officers -may check the books of the company; but, by reason of the 50 per cent, war tax and the various other imposts that have to be met, over 20s. in the &#163;1 is absorbed, allowing nothing whatever for war risks. </para>

                            <para>- But this is not a solitary case ; this is one of a large number. I am merely pointing out that this form of taxation is another screw on industry that will result in limiting the expansion of our trade. The calculations that I have given are based on a war-time profits tax of 50 per cent. If the tax is to be increased to 75 per cent., the manufacturer or trader is to suffer a heavy penalty for the privilege of being, allowed to carry on his business. I am sure the Treasurer never had such an intention. He looks forward to getting some substantial revenue from this source in 1917, but I tell him that the result of the taxation will be that it will defeat itself, as the excess profits will not be made. The Treasurer or Parliament should not dare to penalize industries in Australia as is proposed to be done in this measure, and thus to bring, disaster to our industries. I ask the Treasurer to reconsider the position from that stand-point. The proposed taxation of 75 per cent, on profits will penalize the most enterprising of our citizens. </para>

Thehonorable member was not in the chamber when I pointed out the anomalies under this measure, and that there are vast concerns in Australia that have been producing for years incomes of from &#163;30,000- to &#163;100,000 per annum, which will not be touched. It is mainly the new and small businesses that will be touched. I have also pointed out that the circumstances justifying the introduction of war-time profits taxation in Great Britain are totally different from those in Australia. It was introduced in Great Britain for the purpose of limiting enterprise and preventing the expansion of trade, in order to divert it into the manufacture of munitions. </para>

                            <para>- Of course; but what I have mentioned was the outstanding reason for the introduction of the legislation. In Australia, on the other hand, we dare not limit enterprise. It is our task to encourage production in every way. I hope that I have said sufficient to indicate that this is a phase of the matter that cannot be too lightly considered. The proposed measure also introduces the undesirable principle of double taxation, which this Parliament and various Governments in Australia have protested against from time to time, so far as the Mother Country is concerned. When the Prime Minister was in Great Britain, a deputation which waited on him stressed two points. One was that income should be subjected to one taxation only. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly, and I am not complaining of this; they are old-established firms, whose profits do not arise out of the war, and whose businesses go on now just the same as before the war. The deputation which waited on the Prime Minister in Great Britain also pointed out that the taxation of incomes should only be within the jurisdiction of the country in which they are earned. That is a sound principle, and I am. glad to see that the British Government, which has hitherto been a little obstructive in that direction, is now prepared to deal with the matter and avoid double taxation. It is most desirable that each country should tax only the income earned within its jurisdiction, but our War-time Profits Bill provides for the continuation of double taxation. Not only . will the Mother Country tax the profits made here, but we in our turn will set to work and say that in certain contingencies we will tax incomes earned abroad. The process of double taxation is a mistake. The Canadian Businesses Profits War Tax Act specially exempts all payments made to the Mother Country, or to any outlying Dominion, or to any of the allied nations. In a specific manner they have avoided the unfair and iniquitous double taxation which is included in our Bill. I am not justified in enlarging on the matter further, but there are one or two other tilings to which I wish to refer. In regard to the repatriation scheme, I notice that the Treasurer has proposed a modification by extending the payments of the 1| per cent, over five years instead of the three years previously proposed, but I wish to ask him to make further inquiries upon that point. The War Councils of the various States have done splendid work, and although  their  experience so far is perhaps limited, what they have had has shown the absolute impossibility of spending legitimately as much as one-fifth of the 1&#163; per cent, of the wealth of the community each year. The Treasurer has indicated that he will probably be able to extend the earlier payments further. I ask him to take into consideration the view that payments should extend over a period of ten years. If that is done, the Treasurer will get as much money as will be required for the repatriation of soldiers, at any rate in the earlier  years  and the tax will be practically an income tax. </para>

                    <para class="block">That provision was discussed at length ir this chamber, and I took part in the discussion. As the result of the representations then made, the Prime Minister gave the Committee his positive assurance that honorable members would have an opportunity of reconsidering this matter when we were considering the tax next year. We have now had a year&#39; experience of this provision, and its operation has been disastrous to those  affected  by it. Our policy should be, first, to do all that we can to assist Australian industries, by giving them every encouragement possible. Our next duty is to encourage trade with the Mother Country by giving preference, and in other ways. There are on the statute-book various preferential arrangements instituted with that object. The section that I have read, however, is injuring our trade with the Mother Country very seriously. It has the effect, in the first instance, of differentiating between the British manufacturer who is represented here by an agent and his fellows who carry on their Australian business either by employing travellers or by sending out circulars, or by means of a buying house in the Old Country. Secondly, the provision gives a direct preference to foreign traders. The Americans, for example, do most of their trade with Australia either by sending travellers here or by means of circulars and catalogues. Consequently they pay no income tax. On the other hand, British manufacturers who have agents here are taxed. That is a gross injustice. The effect has been that many British manufacturers have withdrawn their Australian agencies, to the distinct loss of this country, because every agent who is doing business here is giving employment, consuming Australian productions, and paying income tax. The section makes agents individually liable, which is most unfair. The British manufacturer says &#34; I object to paying double taxation. If Australia is going to tax agents, they must pay the tax themselves.&#34; As the Prime Minister promised to give an opportunity for the reconsideration of this matter, I ask the Treasurer to pay attention to the remarks that I have made. I do not desire that he should lose revenue. </para>

                            <para>- Great Britain is bearing the burden of the war and financing her Allies and other parts of the Empire. Consequently, she has to tax her people to an enormous extent. What she has done shows the wealth of her resources. My honorable friend seeks to make a comparison where no comparison is possible. As I do not wish the Treasurer to lose revenue, I suggest that he should levy a flat rate of 10s., or, if necessary, &#163;1, per cent, at the Customs on the value of goods imported, to take the place of the unjust and inequitable taxation provided for in the section that I have read. This would give more revenue, and would remove an injustice. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with them later. I congratulate the present Treasurer on his elevation to office, though my congratulations are very much in the nature of the hand shaking that takes place before a boxing match in which the combatants intend to knock each other out at the first opportunity. I should have been glad to help the honorable gentleman a little had he supplied me, as he supplied the right honorable member for Parramatta, with an advance copy of his speech. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer will gain nothing by his failure to extend this courtesy to me. Had I been supplied with a copy of his financial statement at the same time as the Leader of the Opposition, I might have been able to assist him in the remarks I am about to make. The honorable gentleman has seen fit to reduce my estimate of revenue from the war-time profits tax. Instead of the 100 per cent. that we proposed to take, he intends to take only 75 per cent. of war profits. The present Prime Minister was in favour of the original proposal, and, as far as I know, the present Treasurer also approved of it. What is the reason for the alteration ? </para>

                            <para>- Quite so, and I venture to say that when the Bill is brought down  the percentage of war-time profits proposed to be taken will be still further reduced as soon as members of the Liberal party enter a protest. The Treasurer, in fact; will be quite prepared to accept any reduction proposed by the Liberal party. In attempting to estimate the revenue to be derived from the War-time Profits Bill, one is merely groping in the dark. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Kooyong apparently is unable to understand why such companies have been exempted. The reason is that those who have been purchasing their shares during the last ten or fifteen years have been paying such a high price for them,  that  they only return 5 or 6 per cent, on the money invested, although they are paying dividends as high as 20 per cent. Why should the honorable member for Kooyong object to those companies escaping? </para>

                            <para>- I am quite in favour of the section in the Income Tax Act, which takes into consideration the life of <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> mine, being applied to gold-mining companies under the war-time profits taxation scheme; but where a gold-mining company, during war time, is making more than the usual profits, why should it not pay the war-time profits taxation the .same as any other company will have to do? I think we all approve of the exemption of the agricultural industry. The lot of the farmer should be made as happy as possible. </para>

Those who have read the lecture recently delivered by a Director of Agriculture, in which he dwelt on the drift of population towards our big cities, will realize that the lot of the farmer cannot be as happy as it ought to be; otherwise, such a drift would not be setting in. We should make the lot of the farmer as pleasant and profitable as possible. </para>

The Leader of the Liberal party knows that not one member of our party belongs to the Industrial Workers of the World, or desires to be associated in any way with those who have been suggesting to the workers outside that they should resort to sabotage, or the destruction of machinery and buildings. In my own electorate I have been subjected to attacks on the part of members of the Industrial Workers of the World. One member of that organization at Mount Chalmers, another at Mount Morgan, and still another at Many Peaks, did his level best to interrupt my meetings, and, as a matter of fact, to take away votes from me. The Industrial Workers of the World, of whom I do not suppose there were  more  than half-a-dozen in the whole electorate of Capricornia, objected to my representing the district because they do not believe in political methods, but in what they call &#34;direct action.&#34; The Labour party, on the other hand, believes in political methods; and I explained to these gentlemen that if we could not educate people to put a piece of paper into a ballot-box in favour of reform, we could not &#34;hope to induce them to take up arms with that object. </para>

What business is there in the programme of the Government? They propose, if they can, to go into recess until next Mardi, when they will have enough money to carry them on till April.- When will they introduce  their programme of legislation ? In April we shall have to be preparing for a general election.&#34; </para>

                    <para>The proposed levy for repatriation purposes met with a good deal of criticism outside; it was referred to as a hurried measure, as indeed it was. But who was responsible for the hurry? Not the ex-Treasurer. The Treasurer cannot be Prime Minister as well as Treasurer, and that Minister must have some say. The Prime Minister was in favour of this levy; in fact, I do not suppose he would deny that it was his proposal. Why is he now running away from it? Is it. because there are only thirteen members of his party in the House, and he fears the Opposition? As Treasurer, T said we would consider the proposal, which was .brought in in a hurry, because the Prime Minister, as he always is, was in a hurry. The proposal was not approved by the Government until half-an-hour before the House met on the day  on which  it was introduced; and the financial statement had to be delivered within two hours afterwards. In fact, about the time the House was meeting I was reading over the financial statement in type at the Government Printing Office, in order to expedite matters for the convenience of honorable members. </para>

                            <para>- Nobody said the proposal was well considered; and as soon as it had been introduced we said that it would be considered after the referendum. Having now had time to consider, the proposal, I agree with the Treasurer that it is not necessary to raise such a large sun&#93; of money. In another six months time there will be &#163;10,500,000 due to soldiers in deferred pay, and that amongst 250,000 men means about &#163;40 each. </para>

There is no doubt that all our soldiers will not require help, because many of them are men of means; and, therefore, I do not see any reason for anything like the levy that was proposed when we met on the last occasion. </para>

                            <para>- I would rather not reply to any of the honorable gentleman&#39;s interjections, because that might lead to some heat, and I have no desire to quarrel, with him. There is no doubt that the suggestion that we should levy on war bonds led to a depreciation in the value of the stock. My statement, as Treasurer, was delivered on 26th September, and the value of the stock dropped from &#163;99 17s. 6d. to &#163;99 5s. on the loth December. No doubt that drop was, to some extent, due to the proposed levy. I know that the honorable member for Parkes was very much concerned on this point, but I am not aware whether he put any of his own stock on the market in consequence. </para>

                            <para>- The trustees of the fund are scattered throughout the Commonwealth, and in all probability they may never meet more than once a year, so that inevitably the fund must be administered by one or two men whose training, I venture to say, cannot be equal to those officers already in the Service. I do not wish to be hypercritical, but I should like to know what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gilbert</inline> knows of this kind of business. He is a very good newspaper man, but I am not satisfied that he knows much about the administration of a fund raised for such a purpose. I hope the Government will take the business in hand, so that if anything goes wrong we may be able to come, here and criticise the Minister and his- officers. As to the Treasurer&#39;s appeal for economy, I have no doubt that he did as I did, and as I suppose, .every Treasurer does, asked the heads of Departments if anything could be done to cut down expenditure. But it is not so easy to cut down expenses; and the Treasurer may do a great deal of harm if he adopts the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition in this regard. I believe one of the honorable gentleman&#39;s brilliant suggestions was to abolish the Public Works Committee. </para>

                            <para>- The constituents of the honorable member ought to remember that they get two mail deliveries a day, whereas many people outback do not get a mail more than, perhaps, once a month. If the Postmaster-General starts to cut down expenditure, as the Leader of the Liberal party has suggested, he will require to discharge a number of skilled workmen, and scatter them to the four winds of heaven. These men are accustomed to a special class of work, which cannot be done by men who have not had a certain training. The Postmaster-General might have a difficulty in getting those men back again when he required them. I ask the right honorable member for Parramatta if there would be any advantage in throwing such men upon the unemployed market ? Would that help to win the war? Everybody must admit that there has been an increase in ordinary expenditure in all Departments, but the public and critics must remember that the Government, as well as every private employer and individual, has had to suffer through the increased prices of all kinds of goods and services.   In that way the ordinary expenditure is swelled. The activities of the Departments, too, have been increased. For example, to the Treasury has been added control of war pensions, and that work requires not only an increase in the expenditure for pensions, but also an increased payment for the wages of the staff. The income tax, also, is new, and a considerable number of officers is employed in the Taxation Department. The control of capital entails a little additional labour. </para>

                            <para>- The fact I have mentioned is so evident that I do not propose to take up time combating the honorable member&#39;s statement. Not being willing to pay the high prices asked for land alongside the railways, intending selectors must go out 20 or 30 miles from the railhead. A few other settlers follow their example, and then there follows an agitation for a new railway line, and afterwards for a postal service and telegraph office. The unused lands alongside railways would accommodate thousands of farmers if the people could get access to them at a reasonable price. They are not allowed to use those areas, and the result is that the railways do not pay as they .should. There are thousands of miles of telephone and telegraph lines which would be unnecessary for years to come if selection had been possible on the unused, lands abutting upon railways. I suggest as a way out of our financial difficulties that there ought to be a super-tax on unused lands alongside railway lines, so as to compel the owners to put  such  lands to use. </para>

                    <para>The expenditure on the Federal Capital has been the subject of some criticism. When I was in charge of the Treasury, a proposal was made that we should spend &#163;500,000 on the Federal Capital in the present financial year, but, with the consent of the Government, that item was cut down to &#163;150,000. I am sure that the Leader of the Liberal party, who represents a New South Wales constituency, will not consent to the wholesale reduction of expenditure in connexion with the Federal Capital. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to do that, except to a very limited extent. My experience of public life has taught me that the system of having a Public Service Commissioner through whom all appointments are made, has a great deal to recommend it, but it also possesses a serious defect in the fact that no Government, either State or Federal, has any proper control over the civil service. I regard it as very important that the Government should be given effective control over the Public Service, and to that end I would insert in the Public Service Act a provision that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Act, the Government of the Commonwealth should  have power to suspend or dismiss any officer who, in their opinion, was incapable, or was discharging his duties in an unsatisfactory manner. </para>

                            <para>-  The honorable member has put his finger on the spot. The reason is that the Government, have not the power to interfere with them. The Government have the power to make a charge against an officer, but the officer must be tried by a board of his peers, really his own friends, and as they say &#34; It may be our turn next,&#34; nothing can be done. The ex-Minister for Trade and Customs has told me of the case of a man who was charged with passing goods through the Customs without paying duty. He was tried by a departmental Board. </para>

                            <para>- And the man is still in the Federal Public Service! That is a glaring instance of the fact that no Government has any power over the Civil Service. I have no desire to mention names ; my experience in the Treasury was rather happy, for I had the benefit of the assistance of some very able officers, but I know that there, are officers in the Civil Service who should be retired, because they are not carrying out their work properly. The Government cannot retire them because they cannot come down with a specific charge. I suppose that they could make the general charge of incompetency, and if they did so the Public Service Commissioner would appoint a Board. The Board, knowing the officer well, would hear his case, but it is not likely that they would bring him in as incompetent. Consequently he would still remain in the Service, and the Service, so far as his particular Department would be concerned would not be run properly, which would mean a waste of public money, and the rendering of inefficient service to the public. </para>

                            <para>- No. I suppose that in the time of the right honorable member for Swan the practice of his political party was to placate opponents, and not supporters. On that subject, I remember seeing a cartoon in the Sydney newspapers many years ago. A man asked a Minister for a job, and said, &#34; I have supported your party for twenty years.&#34; The Minister replied, &#34; We never run after a &#39;bus we have already caught.&#34; So the man did not get a job. There is no doubt that, prior to the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner, opponents of political parties in office were concerned in getting into the Public Service many incompetent men. But I have not said that the system of Public Service Commissioners is bad. What I say is that it needs to be strengthened by a simple provision such as I have suggested. It would not mean that the Government would make appointments, though I think they should make the appointments of all heads of Departments. </para>

                    <para>I should be glad to get from the Treasurer the details of the reduction he proposes in the Home Affairs Department, No doubt there is plenty  of room for the curtailment of expenditure in the Defence Department. It is absurd that the civilians who are doing clerical work, and are not going to the front, should be rigged up in war costumes. Why do they need to wear such costumes? Why do Canon Garland and other clergymen need to wear war costumes ? Some of them look absolutely ridiculous in them. It was nearly as amusing as Charlie Chaplin to see Canon Garland at Enoggera Camp walking about in his uniform. This is one direction in which there could be curtailment of expenditure. In the navy also there is plenty of room for curtailment of expenditure, but when I say that I am also confronted with the prospect that the Minister would have to throw a number of men out of work, and I hesitate to suggest any particular place where expenditure might be curtailed, because I know that on one occasion the Minister had certain work carried out at Port&#39; Stephens en order to give employment to some unemployed. </para>
                    <para>I am very much interested in the statement that the Treasurer proposes to establish a sinking fund of 1 per cent, to extinguish the war debt in thirty-nine years. When I was in office I was in favour of a sinking fund of 10s. per cent., but the Prime Minister - that young man in a hurry - stipulated for 2| per cent. Why has he backed down ? </para>

                            <para>- Because I was not the Prime Minister. Is that not a fair answer ? To my mind a sinking fund of 10s. per cent, is quite enough. The nation is very much in the same position as parents who have children to bring up. Parents who work themselves to death in order to amass money to leave it to their children make a very great mistake, and posterity, who are going to have this huge country, as large as Europe, handed over to them should be -willing to bear a share of the heavy war expenditure that this country is now undertaking. </para>

He has discovered that the sum of &#163;1,700,000 has been voted by the House as Treasurer&#39;s Advance; and he thinks this* is too large a sum. If a Government is not going to meet Parliament it must have a Treasurer&#39;s Advance of large dimensions. We cannot allow every Minister to please himself as to what he spends.- Some one must keep an eye on the expenditure and that individual should be the Treasurer. Among the items which I agreed should be paid out of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance during the month of September were &#163;38,500 for the  Kalgoorlie-Port  Augusta railway and &#163;41,300 for the purchase of foodstuffs for the Government of India. There was nothing wrong in connexion with the expenditure of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance. </para>

                            <para>- We arranged to give the Prime Minister &#163;2,068,000 for the purchase of those ships. It was my desire, and I hope it is the desire of the present Treasurer, that the Prime Minister or some other Minister should introduce a Bill to legalize that expenditure. It was a very large sum to intrust to one man, but it had to be done. If everybody in the community had been informed that the Prime Minister was about to purchase ships he would never have got them at the price at which he got them, if he got them at all. That was the reason for the Prime Minister keeping that matter more or less secret. </para>

                    <para>But it is now due to the House and the country that the Prime Minister or some other Minister should introduce a Bill at an early date to have the transaction legalized. Another reason why we should cut down Supply from three months to two months is in order that we may get the Government here and, if they do not pass this Bill, put them out and get another Government in office that will do so. It is not necessary to go through the long list of items paid out of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance. If the Government is not going to meet Parliament it must have a large Treasurer&#39;s Advance. The Treasurer is asking for three months&#39; supply. When he gets that Bill through he will reimburse his Treasurer&#39;s Advance Account and have&#39; a million pounds to spare, which will enable him and his Government to stay in recess for four months instead of three months. I would not trust the Prime Minister to meet Parliament in March if he had sufficient money to enable him to wait until April. </para>

The Treasurer has drawn attention to the largeness of the Treasury balances, and has stated that they have averaged &#163;20,000,000. I should like to mention that the Government balance at the Commonwealth Bank has been swollen mostly by war-loan money. </para>

                            <para>- On the 1st July, 1915, the cash balance at the Commonwealth Bank was &#163;459,457. A month later it was only &#163;391,161. On the 1st September it had grown to &#163;1,816,719; on the 1st December, it was &#163;6,979,201 ; on the 4th January, 1916, it was &#163;5,935,573; at the beginning of February it was &#163;6,907,006; on the 1st March, &#163;9,391.089; at the beginning of April, &#163;8,700,882; and at the beginning of May, &#163;12,337,060. In addition, there were &#163;2,000,000 held on fixed deposit. At the beginning of June, the balance was &#163;15,922,866. It is admitted that these are large balances, and honorable members have said that we ought not to have such large sums earning little or no interest. T ask them how much they think the money can earn in Australia? If we can do without it in Australia, it may be well to send some of it <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> London. </para>

                            <para>- He may take some of it. I have been pondering over the matter, and  considering  whether we should leave all the money in the Comonwealth Bank, or distribute it among the private banks, which might be prepared to pay interest for it. We have to raise money in Australia for the war. Bank managers are very conservative. As the war has progressed, they have been careful to keep their reserves as strong as possible. They wish to take the least risk. Their training makes them more nervous than other persons. They see the collapse of the dreams of those who think that they can make a fortune if they can only borrow. Knowing the uncertainties of business, they are conservative. Naturally, when we deposit in the Commonwealth Bank a sum -like &#163;20,000,000, most of which, but for the existence of the Commonwealth Bank, would be in the coffers of the private banks, the latter are not prepared to contribute to Commonwealth loans as freely as they would do if part of the money were allowed to remain with them until needed by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- We have given very liberal terms, * for which the public did not ask, but which they have readily accepted. I have no doubt that the public and the banks will advance money more freely if deposits could be made in twelve instalments. That arrangement would suit the Government, because money would be coming in regularly every month with which it could meet its bills. This would leave less money lying idle in the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                    <para>I wish, in the few minutes remaining to me, to deal with the subject of recruiting. If there has been a falling-off in the number of volunteers, it is due to the fact that the Prime Minister and the honorable members for Flinders and Balaclava have discouraged recruiting by their speeches and conduct. To deal first with the honorable member for Flinders: This gallant Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George has appeared on several public platforms urging men to go to the front. He has told the public that there are thousands of persons who are hungering to do something in connexion with the war. Why has he not done more than make speeches? Is there no work - noncombatant work - that he could do at the front ? </para>

The mere sending of a birthday telegram is a &#34; wanton profligate outrage.&#34; This gentleman is accustomed to use that sort of language. Apparently, he cannot find any other. Surely public men, in referring to the leading citizens of other nations, should at all times use the  language of moderation. The honorable member was known abroad as the ex-Premier of Victoria, and naturally people there might attach more importance to his words than would those in this State who know him so well. He does not use the language of moderation; he prefers the language of vituperation, hoping, I suppose, that it will give to him the appearance of bravery which he does not in reality possess. He went on to say on this occasion - </para>

He was the only member of the Liberal party who did consult with him. I wonder whether he was trying to intrigue the Leader of the Liberal party out of his position. On the return of the Prime Minister from Sydney after the referendum campaign, he went to Seymour to meet him. </para>

There was another proposal to avoid land taxation, and, while I was Treasurer, the honorable member called to see me several times on the subject.

                            <para>- Yes. The honorable member for Balaclava came forward with a proposal that the Australian Farms Limited should not be asked to pay land tax when it has in process the dispersing of large estates for the special purpose of putting New South Wales and Victorian returned soldiers on the land, and that no present land taxpayer should be called upon to pay a higher rate of tax because of any fresh investment in the company. I got the Commissioner of Taxation to investigate the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the Australian Farms Limited, to see how far they had been successful in settling farmers on the land - to ascertain their history and practice, and what was the Commissioner&#39;s view of the proposal.  His  reply was as follows : - </para>

                        <para>.- Mud slinging has been carried on, not only in this chamber, but from one end of Australia to the other during the last six or seven weeks, lt is most astonishing to find men, who pose as leaders of thought and as empire builders, indulging in tactics that would disgrace people of the lowest order in the world. Criminal charges have been preferred against certain people in the community, and those charges are made a stalking-horse for political purposes. The object is to associate members of this House with people who are alleged to be guilty of criminal actions. It is most cowardly and contemptible to attempt, for political reasons, to damn the character of men against whom nothing can be said, either publicly or privately. During the referendum campaign I myself was charged with being connected with the Industrial Workers of the World. I know nothing of that association - I do not know a single member of it, and was never connected with it in any way; yet this charge was made against me. I repudiate any charges of this kind, and to say that I was astonished at such being levied against me is to express my feelings in very mild language. We hear of what is called the &#34;higher criticism,&#34; and it would seem that the rarefied atmosphere in which some people live induces them to indulge in such criticism as I have described. When, during the campaign, we told the people what Australia was doing, and was prepared in a. legitimate and honorable way to do, we were told that we were in the pay of Germany and the agents of the Kaiser, and then, as a piece of &#34;&#39;higher criticism &#34; <inline font-style="italic">in excelsis,</inline> we were said to be members of the Industrial Workers of the World. Such tactics reflect no credit on the people who adopt them, and the vote of the people of Australia on the 28th October is the best reply that can be made to them. When we have a campaign, let it be conducted on the merits or demerits of the question before us, but do not let us look in mud puddles for filth to throw at one another. Those who make charges of the kind in connexion with myself I challenge to place their character against my own. It is damnable to, first of all, say that there is a criminal association in existence, and then to connect the names of honorable men with it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may not have done so personally, but those who hold the whip over his party outside - his press &#34; barrackers &#34; - have done so. One of the reasons for the. falling off in recruiting is to be found in such tactics, although there are other reasons, as I propose to show.One of those other reasons is the idiotic, and, in. some cases, the callous, administration of the Defence Department, in face of which we cannot possibly hope to have a proper response to our appeal for recruits. What is wanted, first of all, is the abolition of the present policy, and the adoption of a policy of justice and common sense. One case, which is typical of many, is that of a man who enlisted as a private, and, after being at the front for a short time, &#34;was given the temporary rank of corporal, which carried with it an increase in pay of 4s. a day.  His  wife had been left with an allotment of 3s. a day and a separation allowance of1s. 5d., or a total of 4s. 5d. a day. This she was getting on the pay of her husband as a private. But it suddenly dawned on the Department that it had been paying the woman a separation allowance which the regulations did not allow, the temporary rank of corporal, at 9s. a day, bringing the payments over the proper amount. In a letter which the woman wrote to me she said that on a certain day, when she went to draw her allowance, she was informed that she had overdrawn by . &#163;20, and that her payments in the future would be reduced to1s. a day until that:amount had been refunded. She said she had been told that there were hundreds of others in a similar position, some of the husbands being in Egypt and some in Trance. She pointed out in her letter that it was impossible for a woman to live in Sydney on 7s. a week, and that she was an old woman whose working days were passed. It will be seen that this was the Department&#39;s own mistake and incompetence, but, all the same, the woman&#39;s allowance was cut down to1s. a day. I know that the Assistant Minister is very sympathetic, and, if he had the power, would quickly remedy this sort of thing. </para>

The young man has been sent back to serve three years&#39; hard labour in our ordinary prisons, and his career practically is blasted by a form of officiousness which one can quite understand would influence a- large majority of people against anything like militarism.&#39; </para>

                        <para>Will you do your best to get at the matter at once, even if a temporary expedient can be found in releasing Fountain, with Quill and Dalton on parole until further inquiry has been made. Will you also endeavour to get at once a copy of the records of the case.

                        <para>Even if the case were much worse than what is painted, one&#39;s blood boils at the method of the punishment and the confinement of these young men in the State&#39;s prisons for years in respect to, a breach of discipline. </para>
                        <para> In the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Quill,</inline> I understand that he is a married man with <inline font-style="italic">wife</inline> and young children, and that the authorities have refused to give her any allowance. </para>
                        <para>I have to confess, as one who believes in universal service, and has acted as  chairman  of a War Recruiting Committee, and visited at the homes of many young men, that this list of punishments which has been published has almost frozen my zeal. One, of course, subscribes at once to punishment for lack of discipline in matters of great moment, but one cannot subscribe to forms of punishment which appear to have the viciousness that is akin almost to a barbarous vengeance. </para>

                        <para>On the 10th March three of us, Privates Quill, H. J. Dalton, and self, three of us on the same charge, were sentenced for three years&#39; penal servitude. No, it was not for manslaughter or blackmail, but for disobeying in such a manner as to show wilful disregard of military discipline and authority, as the crime-sheet shows it. And they still say, &#34;Your King and country need you.&#34; And to think that a man enlisted to fight for men like that. After seventeen weeks on the Peninsula, we, 20th Battalion, were sent back to Egypt, and then across the Suez Canal on the Arabian Desert. One of the jobs allotted to our battalion was that of building a light railway. There was a party of us told off for outpost duty. Next morning the party for railway was found to be short, and our party was taken at a minute&#39;s notice to make up the complement. Before leaving for work, we asked Sergeant Turner about water, as we would be away from camp from 8 a.m. till 4.30 p.m. We could get no satisfaction - the rest of the party had filled their bottles previous to this. On arriving at the job about 8.30 a.m., after a march of 1 mile, the three of us (Quill, Dalton, and self) were told off with a party &#39; under Corporal Cunningham. We sat down, and did not start work. The corporal came along and asked us why we were not working, and we said we wanted some water first. He, the corporal, said that water would be sent for at 10 o&#39;clock, that would mean 11.30 before it came back- we would have to work in the broiling sun with a shovel for three hours without a drink. We asked the corporal for a drink out of his bottle, which was then full of water, and were refused. Sergeant Turner was then brought along, and he also refused us a drink. Lieutenant Blanchard also refused us. We were then placed under arrest, and we were tried by court martial on the 10th March. At court martial it was pointed out this was my first offence, and my character was very good. </para>

They have their relatives - one man has a wife and children, the other boys. have their parents, and the three families have their friends. Particulars of their harsh treatment spread like wildfire. Questions concerning the case came to me from fully fifty different sources as to what action I am taking in the matter.

                            <para>- What evidence has the Department other than a statement that they were sentenced by a court martial in Egypt? How does the Minister know that those men received a fair deal ? In view of the statement of the boys themselves, why cannot the &#39;Minister allow them out on parole? The boys and the people are well known, and plenty of sureties could be obtained. Why should not the Department liberate these prisoners, holding the sureties until the papers arrive, and then if it is proved that they have been guilty of something which deserves punishment to the extent of three years&#39; imprisonment in a common gaol, perhaps we will allow them to go there. One of these boys held a responsible position in . a public Department, but he felt it &#39; to be his duty to give up that position and go to the front. The three of them served for seventeen weeks in that hole of hell, Gallipoli, and even if they did commit an indiscretion, even if they had the awful temerity to ask for a drink of water in the Egyptian desert, that does not justify them being sent to a criminal gaol for three years. </para>

Instead of &#34; Mangling Doyle&#39;s manifesto,&#34; let it be &#34; Mangling Gallipoli heroes.&#34; We should not be too harsh on the Australian boys who have been to Gallipoli. They had never been under militarism previously, and, after leaving sunny conditions here and being suddenly thrown where the lid was taken off hell,  it was only natural to expect that some of them would lose their mental balance. Let us show that we hav.e some sympathy for them, and that we are prepared to assist them. Do not let them be dealt with by the iron hand of militarism.

                <para>On the 13th of May this Comforts Committee had nine hundred pairs of sand shoes placed on board the transportA72, along with the 36th Battalion, for the use of the men on. board the boat. These shoes were paid for by money raised by this committee, and were a free gift to the men. We now hold a letter from one of the men, stating that the shoes were sold to the men of the 36th Battalion on board the boat at1s. per. pair. </para>
                <para>What my committee wishes to know is :  - Is it correct for the gifts from the Comforts Funds to be sold to the men for whom they are intended? If it is correct, what becomes of the money received for them ? </para>

                <para class="block">The state of affairs shown in the letter from the Comforts Committee, if true, is a scandal, and the reply from the Department shows that there is laxity somewhere when such a thing can take place, and&#39; they admit that there is no information available up to the present time on the subject. If the Department is being run as it should be run, and the interests of the men are considered, it ought to know immediately whether any comforts were placed on a transport for the use of men. There is too much of this sort of thing. going on. It creates an uneasy feeling in the minds of people that the goods, they donate for the use of the troops are not being given to them, but are being sold to them, and that some one is making money out of the deal. The great thing that is helping to kill recruiting is the laxity in the administration of the Defence Department. Unsympathetic administration tends to kill that healthy feeling which enables a good response to be made to the call for volunteers. I. opposed compulsion, and I am still opposed to it, but I am not opposed to voluntarism. I have always been in. favour of it. and have always endeavoured to do my bit for my country. I am still prepared to do what I think is the right thing. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that commonsense administration of the Defence Department would help to get recruits more than the sending of flamboyant telegrams all over the country. We would get far more recruits and more confidence in the Department. What kills recruiting is the fact that the people outside have no confidence in the administration of the military authorities to-day. </para>
