                    <para>On the 30th January, 1916, General Birdwood, the General Officer Commanding, cabled expressing the hope that the suggestion contained in the War Office cable, for the organization of two divisions in Egypt and only one in Australia, be adopted and put in hand at once, and stating that the question of the disposal of the large accumulation of reinforcements and returned convalescents in Egypt was urgent, and in the interest of the discipline and well-being and training of the troops of the Commonwealth required early settlement. </para>
                    <para>On the 2nd February, the Commonwealth Government cabled the Secretary of State for the Colonies agreeing to the War Office proposals. </para>
                    <para>On the same date General Birdwood was informed of the Government&#39;s decision, and he replied as follows on the following day : - &#34; Thank you very much for your cable of 2nd February. Am most grateful for all the consideration which has been shown me.&#34; </para>
                    <para>These communications had an important effect on the numbers which it was contemplated would have been required, and also on the period over which they would have to be raised, as they meant that, in order to comply with the promise of the Government, as modified at the request of the War Office, 209,000 troops would require to be despatched by the end of June, 1916. It will bo seen that these modifications were made at the request, and on the suggestion, of the War Office, and were not proposed by the Commonwealth Government. At the same time, the Government does not take the view that its  offer  of the 26th November, 1915, exhausts the possibilities of Australia so far as contributions of fighting troops are concerned, and the Acting Prime Minister, in statements made, has endeavoured to make this point clear, and has appealed to the various recruiting organizations throughout the Commonwealth to continue their efforts to gain recruits. </para>
                    <para>The latest available figures show that, up to 6th May, 1916, there had embarked from&#39; Australia 189,000 troops, and there were in training throughout Australia approximately 62,000, making a total of 251,000.

                    <para>On the 12th April, 1916, the Federal Government referred to the Federal Parliamentary War Committee the following minute : - </para>
                    <para>While Government takes entire responsibility for deciding as to voluntary or compulsory service, and does not invite the Federal Parliamentary War Committee to make any recommendation thereon, it is desired to ascertain from the Committee whether, in view of the necessity of efficiently maintaining our industrial and commercial life, together with  the responsibilities of Australia in this war, and in comparison with the contributions of other Dominions, the Committee is of the opinion that&#39; the Commonwealth is adequately represented at the front. The Committee is therefore invited to offer any advice or recommendation with a view to the improvement of the present system of recruiting. </para>
                    <para>On the above, the Federal Parliamentary War Committee made the following recommendation : - </para>
                    <para>The Committee notes that the Government does not submit to it the question of voluntary service as compared with universal compulsory service. </para>
                    <para>The Committee, without expressing any views on the question of the comparative contributions of th* other Dominions, is of the opinion that Australia is not adequately represented at the front. </para>
                    <para>It recommends that the Government fix an early date for a minimum number of new recruits, accompanied by a public intimation that if the number be not forthcoming by the specified date the whole question of the voluntary system will Be reviewed. </para>

                            <para>It cannot be definitely stated how long the war is likely to last; consequently the time within which Australia will be required to send men to the front is indefinite. It is pointed out that, in the early stages of the war, it was urged upon the Government to fix upon a definite number - 100,000 - as the contribution of the Commonwealth to the Empire. If this suggestion had been adopted, It would, without any doubt, have &#39; had a disastrous effect on recruiting, because, when the number decided upon had been raised, it would have been contended that Australia had fulfilled its obligations. The same objection holds good now against fixing any definite number. </para>

It is proposed to introduce and pass a Supply Bill for one month for the payment of salaries, &#38;c., falling due this week, and to introduce a further Supply Bill at a later stage to cover any adjournment that may be decided upon. If the Houses are willing to pass the Estimates within a reasonable time, it is suggested that the general debate on questions of policy and administration can take place thereon. Other Bills to be considered will be: - A Bill to amend the War Pensions Act, to make better provision for the relatives and dependants, and deceased or incapacitated soldiers; a Bill for a further war loan; a Bill to provide for the appointment of trustees for the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Fund, and for the regulation of the fund; a Bill to provide for the taxation of war profits; a Bill to make provision for the difficulty caused by the expiry of the term of the Public Service Commissioner&#39;s appointment. Some other Bills amending existing war legislation, of an urgent character, may be required. It is then proposed to adjourn until the return of the Prime Minister to Australia. </para>

                    <para>- According to a cable message printed in the daily press of today, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> Premier of Queensland, has bean making some observations in London. He stated, among other things, that Australia had had an opportunity to make what he called a &#34; safe peace&#34; with Germany, but that she preferred the more &#34; perilous &#34; course - I am again using <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan&#39;s</inline> own adjective - of identifying herself with the Mother Country. As the cable makes it appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> was speaking on behalf of Australia, I wish to know whether this is the case, also whether the Commonwealth Government have had this consideration before them in any shape or form, or whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> was simply trying to get into the limelight that is at present monopolized by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline></para>

                        <para>- All along I have been anxious to expedite these decisions, but unfortunately the matter concerns more than one Department. Where it has been possible to expedite the matter and give a definite decision one way or another, I have endeavoured to do so; but honorable members are aware of the difficulty of obtaining freight in order to shift our wheat. The trouble is to get vessels. Recently I pleaded with the Wheat Board in regard to this matter, and it was agreed that the transport of coal should be expedited as much as possible. But the difficulty lies in getting vessels to carry the coal, and not so much in the embargo upon it. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if vessels of the Australian merchant fleet have been sold to Japanese ship-owners. If Australian vessels have been sold to Japanese buyers, and the Commonwealth is in urgent need of freights, I wish to know why the Government cannot purchase the vessels which Australian shipowners are disposed to sell, instead of allowing them to go to the Japanese, or to purchasers of other nations? </para>

                            <para>Our receipts will disclose some surprises, and our expenditure and commitments cause not a little anxiety perhaps. When, however, it is known that the private wealth in Australia is estimated to be &#163;1,000,000,000, and the estimated income of the people &#163;200,000,000 per annum, it will be seen there is no occasion for alarm. In saying this I have no desire to minimize the gravity of the situation. While we have as yet no ground for serious anxiety, it is also true that wise public and private economies must be practised if Australia is to find money to carry on the war. </para>

During . the transition period some persons may be weeks or even months out of employment, and the possession of a few pounds in the* Savings Bank, or invested in 4^ per cent, war bonds, which can be lodged with the Commonwealth Bank as security for an advance at reasonable rates, will provide a most welcome resource during a period which, in the case of those who will not save, may prove distressing and a sad experience. </para>

                    <para>Customs and Excise. The increase in Customs revenue from &#163;12,105,698 in 1914- 15 to an estimated &#163;13,200,000 in 1915- 16 will be found to be mainly due to the importation of sugar, agricultural products and groceries, textiles and attire, oils, paints and varnishes, earthenware, cement, china and glass, jewellery and fancy goods, hides, leather and rubber, paper and stationery, and vehicles. </para>
                    <para>The estimated increase in both Customs and Excise on tobacco, cigarettes, &#38;c., is probably due to the requirements of soldiers who have enlisted for active service. </para>
                    <para>The actual revenue received from imported sugar in 1914-15 was &#163;60,403. This year, we expect to receive a sum of &#163;450,000- an increase of about &#163;390,000. </para>
                    <para>There has been a decrease in the amount of revenue received from ale and spirits imported from abroad. This will no doubt account for an increase in the Excise duty received from the consumption of Australian beer. If hotels are to be closed in all the States of Australia at six o&#39;clock p.m., as in South Australia and Tasmania, the Commonwealth may expect a diminution in both Customs and Excise revenue derived from the use of beer and spirits. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>The number of factories and employees in Australia at the establishment of Federation was: - Factories, 11,143; employees, 197,783. The latest returns to the end of 1914 are: - Factories, 15,430; employees, 329,825. These figures disclose expansion, but I am authorized to say that the Government hav&#169; no wish to continue to receive so large a sum as &#163;13,200,000 by way of Customs revenue. The Government would prefer that such an increase may take place in Australian manufactures as will lower the huge total appreciably. </para>
                    <para>Land Tax. The total number of assessments made for the current financial year was 14,714, representing a tax of &#163;1,774,058, of which &#163;31,541 has been collected. </para>
                    <para>It will be remembered that the Land Taxation Acts were amended so as to apply to the year beginnings 1st July, 1914. The amendments &#34;took the form of an addition to the rate of tax which raised the average rate from  3&#189;d.  to 5d. in the case of an estate worth &#163;75,000, and the introduction into the taxable area of Crown leaseholds which had hitherto escaped taxation. </para>
                    <para>It was expected that large additional revenues would accrue from these sources; but these expectations have not been realized. </para>
                    <para>Under the old rate of tax the amount collected for the financial year 1913-14 was &#163;1,591,452. For the following year,_ 1914-15, under the enhanced rates of tax an amount of &#163;1,958,808 was collected, but an amount in this year of &#163;277,973 is outstanding. This represents the tax due in cases which&#39; are under reference to the Courts, and tax assessed in cases where the benefits of the &#34; hardship &#34; section in the law have been claimed. It is probable that a large part of this sum will not be collected, as the land-owners who have sought relief undoubtedly suffered greatly from the drought. With the consent of the Government the Commissioner did not require payment of tax pending investigation of the cases, which is still proceeding. </para>
                    <para>As already stated, the tax assessed for the current year is only &#163;1,774,058, which falls short by &#163;200,000 of the amount assessed last year, and is not &#163;200,000 in 1 excess of the tax collected under the old rates. </para>
                    <para>In the reports of the Commissioner for Taxation, the effect of the impost in stimulating subdivision and transfer of the largest land interests in Australia has been indicated. The movement is constantly going on ; breaking up the largest estates into smaller estates, and, in many instances, throwing land entirely out of the Commonwealth taxation sphere. </para>
                    <para>The number of taxpayers does not reduce - in fact, there is, on the contrary, a tendency to increase; but the average holding per taxpayer is lessening so materially that the revenue-producing powers of the higher rates of tax are gradually being neutralized. In addition to sales of land by one person to another, arrangements have been made under which parents have transferred parts of their estates to children or other relatives. In some cases these transfers are nominal, and deliberately made to avoid taxation. An amendment of the law should provide for complete and unencumbered transfer. </para>
                    <para>So far as the taxation of leasehold interests is concerned, Parliament decided to tax only the excess of value in leaseholds over and above the valuers- presented by the rent paid to the Crown. Lease-holders have taken advantage of the provisions of the law in this connexion by asserting that there is no value in their leaseholds beyond the value of the rent they pay. This has imposed upon the Department the work of checking the statements made, and, as the field of industry is immense throughout Australia, the work of applying the check has not yet been accomplished, and it is still a matter of doubt as to whether the revenue to be derived from this source will be material or not. </para>
                    <para>It may be mentioned that the right of the Commonwealth to impose tax upon Crown leaseholds has been challenged in the Law Courts. The High Court unanimously decided in favour of the Commonwealth Government, but the appellants have appealed to the Privy Council. </para>
                    <para>Estate Duty. For the year 1915-16 up to the present date, the number of assessments made was 2,733, representing a tax of &#163;587,629, of which &#163;357,109 has been received. Almost the whole of the outstanding balance of &#163;230,520 should be in hand before the end of the financial year, as the last date for payment has not yet arrived. In some cases executors and administrators are asking to be permitted to pay by instalments, for&#39; which the law makes provision in special cases. This may cause some delay in securing the balance. </para>
                    <para>It is necessary, also, to state that following the death of a testator, considerable time often elapses before the estate is in a position to pay tax. The Commonwealth cannot assess its tax until the State has determined the amount of duty which is payable to the State, and where interests are large and complicated, much time is often expended before probate or administration can be applied for. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth has been greatly assisted by the &#34;States in connexion with the administration of this Act. It has been possible, by accepting State valuations, to make the Commonwealth assessments with a very small expenditure in administration . </para>
                    <para>Income Tax. Up to the present date, 198,568 assessments have been made, amounting to &#163;2,902,576 in tax. Of this, &#163;666,186 has been received, and the balance of &#163;2,236,390 may almost all be Expected before the end of the financial year. A number of assessments remain to be made, but these will be completed in time to receive the year&#39;s revenue before the end of June. Of the returns received, approximating &#39;400,000, a very large number has been found to be non-taxable. </para>
                    <para>On the figures at present to hand, the revenue should be well in advance of the estimate of &#163;3,000,000 in November, 1915, but it is not safe to assume that the average per assessment which has been secured up to the present will be maintained until the end. </para>
                    <para>It is possible that there will be some litigation which, if decided adversely to the departmental view, will reduce the assessments already made where companies are concerned. </para>
                    <para>If the remaining States follow the example of Victoria, and impose a liability on State public servants to Commonwealth income tax, the revenue will be further strengthened. It is understood the State of Queensland has pledged itself to this course already; but, so far as is known, the remaining States have not taken steps to legislate similarly to the Commonwealth, which took action to make its public servants liable to State income tax. It would be inequitable to allow the large body of State public servants throughout Australia to escape the Federal tax which the general public have to pay. </para>
                    <para>In a number of cases State public servants have furnished returns and voluntarily paid tax, in some instances expressing the desire to share in the national burden. In some other cases, also, members of the public have increased the amount of their tax in order that they may similarly help the Commonwealth in a very trying financial time. </para>
                    <para>In reducing the original estimate of revenue to be derived from income tax, the Treasurer was influenced by the facts that companies escaped tax on their income distributed in dividends; that there was a doubt as to the power to collect tax from the great body of public servants employed by the States; that large numbers of taxpayers were absent at the war, and exempt so far as their personal exertion income was concerned; that income derived from Commonwealth and State securities was not subject to tax; and that in the year 1914-15 the great body of land-owners had suffered severely by drought, which had deprived many of the whole or a substantial part of their income. </para>
                    <para>The fact that the tax is likely to produce revenue in advance of the revised estimate of &#163;3,000,000 may be attributed to increased trade, the result of war expenditure. </para>
                    <para>War Census. The aggregate net income of persons resident in the Commonwealth, as furnished by a progress return to the 3rd April, 1916, is &#163;183,374,102. but the Commonwealth Statistician <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. G. H. Knibbs)</inline> states that these figures are subject to revision, as cards representing probably upwards of &#163;20,000,000 of income have yet to be tabulated. </para>

From the 1st November, 1915, to the 24th January, 1916, the amount of gold specie and bullion exported was &#163;1,253,184. </para>
                    <para>On this latter date a deputation representing the Associated Banks of Victoria waited on me to discuss the removal of the embargo. It was contended by the deputation that the prohibition of the export of gold interfered to such an extent with trade that the rate of exchange became unduly high, necessitating an extra charge which had to be passed on to the consumer ; also that &#34; the exportation of gold is a matter of no absolute direct interest to the banks.&#34; </para>
                    <para>I took the stand that it was in Australia&#39;s interest that the export of gold should be restricted; but if gold was to be exported any profit that might accrue should be placed at the credit of the nation to clear off portion of our national debt, or be used to meet our current war obligations. </para>
                    <para>To test the question whether a limited export of gold would reduce to the public the rate for telegraphic transfer - a rate which is decided absolutely by the bankers themselves - I agreed in February last to a limited export of gold from the Commonwealth on the following understanding: &#34; Any bank lodging full-weight sovereigns with the Commonwealth Treasury or with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, as agents for the Treasury, to receive telegraphic payment in London at the rate of &#163;98 for every 100 full- weight sovereigns lodged; the amount of &#163;2 per cent. to be kept in hand, and, after all expenses have been paid, the balance to be adjusted at the discretion of the Treasurer.&#34; </para>

                    <para>Expecting that the banks represented by the deputation might avail themselves at once of the arrangement, &#163;500,000 was sold through the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at a premium of &#163;1, and, later, &#163;500,000 at a premium of17s. 6d. </para>

                    <para>It appeared that as the advertised rate of exchange for telegraphic transfer to the public remained at 37s. 6d. (sellers) throughout nearly the whole period during which the gold was being exported under the agreement, viz., from15th February to 25th March, the export of Australian gold (though, no doubt, some benefit to a small number of large customers to whom the banks sold telegraphic transfer at 32s. 6d.) was of no advantage to the general public. </para>

We are spending for war purposes out of revenue &#163;3,379,701, and out of revenue for ordinary Defence purposes &#163;5,939,788, making the total &#163;49,861,975. </para>
                    <para>The Army. The public do not appear to be well acquainted with the part that Australia is playing in the waT. About &#163;70,000,000 will have been spent from 30th June, 1914, to 30th June, 1916, in Defence expenditure. This &#163;70,000,000 does not include soldiers&#39; deferred pay, estimated to amount to &#163;4,500,000 to the end of June, nor our indebtedness to the Imperial Government for the maintenance and. equipment of our soldiers abroad, the amount of which I have been unable so far to ascertain. </para>
                    <para>The number of men embarked up to the 17th April, 1916, was 182,834. The number of men in camp in Australia at the same date was 62,006. The casualties up to the 28th April, 1916, were as follow: - Deceased, 6,837; wounded, 9,854; missing, 1,838; sick, 22,638; prisoners of war, 61; nature of casualties unknown, 296; total casualties, 41,524. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth is producing almost every necessary item for the military equipment of our soldiers going to the front. No unit up to the present time has embarked from Australia deficient in any single article of clothing or equipment which would in any way impair its fighting efficiency. </para>
                    <para>For transport and supply services in connexion with troops embarked to date and due to embark by 31st May, 3,400 vehicles and 13,600 sets of harness have been provided. Practically all &#39;of these vehicles have been made in Australia. The Government Harness and Saddlery Factory has turned out an enormous amount of leather and canvas work. Twenty-five per cent of the rifles supplied to the Australian Imperial Force have been manufactured at the Commonwealth Small Arms Factory. </para>
                    <para>The Fleet. The vessels of the Royal Australian Navy are taking their part in the work of the main Naval Forces of the Empire. This work includes - besides the concentration of battleships to oppose the German fleet, which so far has avoided battle - the patrolling of trade route&#39;s the world over, and keeping the seas clear of enemy raiders. I would here pay a tribute to the gallant officers and men who man the Fleet, for such has been their efficiency that not one ship has failed from her appointed station. </para>
                    <para>Transports. The work of the Transport Branch is continuous and exacting, and during the whole twenty-one months of war, while taking our troops to the front, the great fleet of transports has not had any serious accident. The fitting out of transports at Melbourne has been under taken by the Minister for the Navy, foremen having been appointed and men employed direct. </para>
                    <para>Training Establishments. The Royal Australian Naval College now has its full complement of cadet midshipmen, 116 embryo officers being on the roll. The first year&#39;s entry, consisting of about twenty-four boys, will finish their course this year, and will then go to sea. </para>

                    <para>Flinders Naval Base. One hundred and fifty-six men are employed by the  Navy Department at Flinders Naval Base. The preparation of the site is practically completed, and the Home Affairs Department is engaged in erecting the necessary barracks, workshops, residences, &#38;c, to enable transfer to be made from Williamstown. </para>
                    <para>Henderson Naval Base. Three hundred and twenty men are employed at Henderson Naval Base, commencement having been made with the first section of the approved plan. Land for the base has been acquired, and a quarry will be opened for the supply of stone for breakwaters. </para>
                    <para>Transports. The freight receipts from transports amount to &#163;1,917,947. The expenditure in connexion with freight earnings of transports cannot be separated from the expenditure on these vessels as regards their employment as transports. The actual expenditure to date, which is solely in connexion with handling cargoes, such as expenditure on stevedoring, commission, freight, rebates, dumping, port charges, and all expenditure in connexion with loading and discharging cargo, is &#163;482,655. </para>
                    <para>Late German New Guinea. The late German New Guinea possessions, which capitulated to. the Commonwealth Naval and Military Expeditionary Force under the command of Colonel William Holmes, D.S.O., V.D., on the 17th September, 1914, are still being administered by the Commonwealth Government. </para>
                    <para>Colonel Holmes relinquished the command of the Force on 8th January, 1915, and he was succeeded by Colonel S. A. Pethebridge, C.M.G., Secretary, Department of Defence, who was also formally appointed Administrator from that date. </para>
                    <para>The islands are being occupied on behalf of His Majesty&#39;s Government, the ultimate disposal of the same being, of course, a matter for future settlement - at the termination of the war. </para>
                    <para>The cost of administration and all other expenses are at present being paid by this Government, any necessary adjustment being left until the conclusion of the war. </para>

                    <para>Commonwealth Public Service. Honorable members will observe in the Estimates provision for the usual increments to officers in the Commonwealth Civil Service. The Government came to the conclusion that, as trade, generally speaking, would appear to be very prosperous, it would not be just to single out the Civil Service for class taxation. </para>
                    <para>Postal Expenditure. &#34;Under the heads of salaries, conveyance of mails, cables, contingencies, and miscellaneous, the total increase in the estimate for 1915-16, which is bailed on nine months&#39; actual and three months&#39; estimated, over the actual expenditure for 1914-15, is &#163;267,437. </para>

Though this consent was obtained on 22nd January, 1916, our financial advisers in London have not yet recommended going on the market to raise this money. Permission was, therefore, sought and obtained from the Government of the United Kingdom for the Commonwealth to advance to the States moneys held by the Commonwealth in London.

                    <para>The five States in agreement with the Commonwealth require money for the following purposes: - </para>
                    <para>Victoria, - For railway purposes, including the electrification of the metropolitan suburban lines. South Australia requires money for railway works, water works, River Murray weir, irrigation, deepening harbors, advances to settlers, new holdings, school houses, and for completion of public buildings. Queensland requires money for the construction of railway, sugar mills, loans to local bodies, for water and&#34; sewerage works, sanitary services, bridges, &#38;c, State school buildings, and hospitals for the insane. Tasmania - For maturing obligations, actual commitments under contracts placed before the outbreak of war, expenditure necessarily incurred in respect to works already in progress, and loans to local bodies for works. Western Australia - For railways and tramways, railways land resumptions, roads and bridges, abattoirs, cold storage, harbors and rivers, advances to settlers, the development of agriculture, and the development of gold-fields. </para>
                    <para>Many of the men engaged in public works are beyond military age, or are married men with families. It is far better to keep those men employed, so that they may earn sufficient to maintain themselves and their families, than to discharge them, and thus compel them to be the recipients of charity. They and their families cannot be allowed to starve, and if the States do not find them work they are in duty bound to furnish them with charitable assistance. </para>
                    <para>Loans by Imperial Government. As the capacity and willingness of the Australian public to subscribe to Commonwealth War Loans were somewhat of an unknown quantity, the Imperial Government were informed that it was estimated &#163;50,000,000 would be required for war expenditure during the year ending 31st December, 1916, and were asked whether they would lend the Commonwealth Government &#163;25,000,000 in sums of &#163;2,000,000 per mon.th. </para>
                    <para>The Imperial Government readily granted our request, and the Commonwealth has so far drawn &#163;7,000,000. Of this sum &#163;1,850,000 have been advanced to the five Australian States co-operating with the Commonwealth. Parliament will be asked to ratify the action of the Government in borrowing from the Imperial Government the &#163;25,000,000 before mentioned. </para>
                    <para>The Government are of opinion that the time has arrived when Australia should at least furnish the money to pay her own share of war expenditure, if not, indeed, to lend money to the Imperial Government. Parliament will, therefore, be asked to authorize the Government to raise loans for war purposes to the extent of &#163;50,000,000 to 30th June, 1917, and a further &#163;9,000,000 to enable the States to carry on absolutely necessary public works and meet maturing obligations up to 31st December, 1916. </para>
                    <para>Commonwealth War Loans. The total amount subscribed by the Australian public to the first and second war loans was &#163;35,045,020. Honorable members are acquainted with many details concerning both loans, and I do not intend at this stage to do more than refer to the following table showing the amounts applied for by individual subscribers to the second war loan : - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="079331191605094_24_20.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>This table shows that 15,040 persons applied for sums ranging from &#163;10 to  &#163;100, and no less than 24,677 persons applied for sums ranging from &#163;10 to &#163;500. </para>
                    <para>I desire again to express my appreciation of the public spirit shown by investors in the war loan, who, if they so desired, could have obtained a higher rate of interest by investing money in various stocks sold almost daily on the Stock Exchange. </para>
                    <para>Compulsory Loans. A compulsory non-interest bearing loan to be subscribed by those who possess wealth is advocated by some writers and speakers, who appear to be unacquainted with the market value of governmental and other securities. A forced loan without interest means confiscation. A certificate for the sum of &#163;100 invested in Commonwealth War Loan Stock can be sold for a full &#163;100 to-day, because for a period of about ten years it will return &#163;4 10s.. per cent, per annum. A certificate for &#163;100 forced loan repayable without interest ten years hence would, if saleable at all, bring on the market probably not more than &#163;55, so that a forced loan without interest would mean the confiscation of at least &#163;45 out of every &#163;100 so raised. </para>
                    <para>This young and resourceful nation will be in desperate need if ever it finds it necessary to resort to compulsory loans without interest to pay for its share in the expenses of the war. A more just appreciation of the realities of life would show that the man who invests &#163;500 in a Government loan and receives &#163;22 10s. per annum by way of interest is just as much entitled to a return for his money as the man who prefers investing &#163;500 in house property, which will return him net 5 per cent., or &#163;25 per annum; or the more cautious depositor who places his money at call in a Commonwealth or State Savings Bank, where he receives 3 or 3&#189; per cent, interest per annum. </para>
                    <para>An appreciation of these simple facts will prevent much confusion of thought and the spreading of foolish notions. </para>
                    <para>Control of Capital.

                    <para>Commonwealth Bank. The benefits accruing to Australia through the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank are almost incalculable. None can doubt that, in the absence of a Commonwealth-owned bank, the rates of interest charged to the public for borrowed money would now be abnormal, and that at times during the war financial unrest would approach a panic. Our national Bank has continued right throughout the war to conduct business on pre-war lines and at normal charges, the rate being 6 per cent, for overdraft accommodation on advances to the general public, whilst advances to churches, charities, and to societies which do not distribute their profits amongst their shareholders have been kept at 5 per cent., and advances made to municipalities and other Government bodies at from 4i| to 5 per cent. </para>
                    <para>The lending of money at these rates has had a restraining influence upon most of the twenty-two associated private banks of Australia, which would have been impelled by self-interest or by the state of public unrest to increase their charges to abnormal figures. </para>
                    <para>The progress of the Commonwealth Bank has been phenomenal. Commencing on 15th July, 1912, with no paid-up capital, the bank has, within three years, established itself as one of the leading  banks of Australia. Its rapid development is shown by the following comparative half-yearly statement of assets : - </para>

                    <para>Wheat. The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Governments of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia have entered into an agreement to secure to farmers in the States concerned equal individual opportunity for marketing their 1915-1916 wheat harvest at the best possible price. </para>

                    <para>Sugar. In the early part of 1915 it became evident that, owing to the effect of the drought, the Queensland sugarcane crop would produce a greatly diminished quantity of sugar. Oversea freights were rising as well as the values of foreign sugar. Famine prices threatened Australia when the Prime Minister, acting on behalf of the Government, agreed to purchase from the Queensland Government the whole of the Queensland sugar crop for 1915 at &#163;18 per ton. </para>
                    <para>A similar agreement was made for the purchase of the 1916 season&#39;s production. Arrangements were made with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Millaquin Refining Company to refine the raw sugar and sell the product to the public on behalf of the Government; the Colonial Sugar Refining Company also agreeing to purchase, refine, and sell foreign sugars to make up the shortage in Australian sugar. </para>
                    <para>On the 20th July, 1915, it was found necessary to charge the public in the metropolitan cities of Australia 3d. per lb. retail for the best refined sugar. </para>
                    <para>In January, 1916, prices of foreign sugars reached a point that made it necessary to sell sugar wholesale at such a price that the retailers were compelled, in order to make a reasonable profit, to sell sugar at 31/2d. per lb. This retail price was accepted as the standard by most grocers in the capital cities, but some charged the public 4d. per lb for a single pound. The Government met this exorbitant charge by issuing a War Proclamation &#39; fixing the price of sugar at 31/2d. per lb., plus such sum as represents the cost incurred by the retailer in respect of the delivery of the sugar to him.&#39; The public appear to be satisfied to pay31/2d. per lb. The retail price of sugar in London is 41/2d. per lb. </para>
                    <para>There can be no doubt that Government interference in regard to this commodity has proved a great boon both to the public and the sugar-cane farmers. The public have been enabled to obtain sugar at a relatively moderate price, and the &#163;18 per ton paid by the Government for raw sugar should, and does in most cases, I believe, enable the cane farmer to receive a higher price for his cane than when raw sugar was paid for at &#163;14 per ton. </para>
                    <para>The Government desire me to place on record that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Millaquin Refining Company are carrying out their agreements in an honorable manner. </para>
                    <para>There have been statements that the Commonwealth Government are making a huge profit out of the sugar business, but one cannot say whether a large, or any profit will be made until accounts are balanced at the end of the war. It would not be correct to take any particular accounting period for the purpose of estimating profits. As a matter of fact, on the purchase and sale of foreign sugars the Government are at the present time losing about &#163;2 per ton. This loss, which is incurred to enable the public to obtain sugar at a uniform price of 31/2d. per lb., will, I have no doubt, be made up at a Liter date. </para>
                    <para>The Mints. There are three branches of the Royal Mint in Australia, situated at Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth, under the joint control of the Government of the United Kingdom and the Governments of the States. </para>
                    <para>At a Premiers&#39; Conference held in April,1914, a resolution was carried in the following terms : - <inline font-style="italic">&#34;Resolved</inline> - That this Conference approves of taking over the Mint and of gold coinage by the Commonwealth - the States of New South Wales and Victoria to compensate, on an equitable basis, the State of Western Australia.&#34; </para>

                    <para>War-time Profits. The Government have decided to ask Parliament to pass a Bill for the taxation of war-time profits. This Bill is intended to tax, not only the profits of those trades and businesses dealing in munitions of war, but also trades and businesses which are enjoying extra profits during the war period. </para>

The pension to be paid to an incapacitated soldier will be increased in the case of a private from &#163;1 to &#163;110s. per week, and corresponding increases are provided for soldiers holding higher rank. If a soldier who is unmarried, or whose wife is either dead or a permanent invalid, is incapacitated to an extent which necessitates the constant services of a paid attendant, and the member has not the means to pay for such services, he may be granted an additional pension not exceeding10s. a week. </para>

                            <para>- That item should not be in the Bill. There will be no objection to the voting of any sum, within reason, for the purposes of that fund, but the voting of the money is not now urgent, because no expenditure can take place until a measure has been enacted to create the proper authority, to define limitations, and to give guarantees. I suggest that all debatable items should be left out of the Supply Bill that it is now proposed to introduce, so that there need be no discussion of its provisions. It would not be right to ask the Committee to vote &#163;40.000 towards the construction of an arsenal at the Federal Capital, involving, as it would, a complete change of policy, and a complete change of front, if I may say so, from that adopted by the Parliament at the time that we last met. It is not right to include such items in a monthly Supply Bill. The chief urgency of this measure is based upon wages, which must be paid almost immediately. But there is nothing urgent about these other items, and why they should be included in a Bill of this character I am utterly at a loss to understand. I suggest to my honorable friend that he should eliminate them, and, if he does so, I see no reason why the Bill should not be passed without any discussion whatever. We shall probably have another Supply Bill brought down within a few days to tide the Government over a further adjournment of Parliament until the return of the Prime Minister from England, and all these items can be included in that. They will then come under consideration in a proper and regular manner. But I submit that a monthly Supply Bill - an emergency measure - ought not to contain any item which is properly a subject for debate by the Committee. If the Treasurer will undertake to postpone the consideration of these matters for a few days, I see no difficulty in granting him his Bill and in facilitating its passage at the earliest possible moment. </para>

When I suggested that the grant for &#163;250,000, which it is proposed to make in connexion with the Repatriation Fund, should be included in this Bill, I was under the impression that there was not a single honorable member who would raise his voice against it. </para>

                        <para>. - I am somewhat surprised that the Treasurer has given us so little information in regard to these items. It is now a good while since Parliament met, and the end of the financial year is close upon us. Of course, I realize that we must grant Supply in order that we may pay our debts. I am sure that I speak for every honorable member upon this side of the chamber when I say that we are most anxious to grant Supply. At the same time we desire information, and we ought to have it. When my honorable friends opposite sat in Opposition they were always most eager to obtain information. In regard to the proposed grant of &#163;250,000 towards the Repatriation Fund, there is no doubt that it ought not to be included in this Bill. Such a procedure does not conform to the requirements of the Constitution, which provides that any proposed law appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Commonwealth shall deal only with such appropriation. A grant of &#163;250,000 towards a Repatriation Fund does not come within the ordinary annual services of the Commonwealth. I think that we require to deal with the matter by means of a special Act. I do not think that the procedure adopted by the Government in including this grant in a Supply Bill is in accordance with section 54 of the Constitution. The money is to be expended for a special service, and ought, therefore, to be dealt with in a special manner. I would like the Treasurer to tell us how much has already been expended on the items contained in this Bill, and how much will be expended under this authority, which will, I presume, carry us on till the end of the financial year. </para>

                            <para>- I should say that the Treasurer would be almost justified in making the Bill apply to nearly the whole of the money required to the end of the financial year. I believe that it is not customary to cover the whole of the anticipated expenditure in temporary Supply Bills, but rather to leave a little over for the Appropriation Act. It seems to me, however, from what the Treasurer has said, that we shall have to have a Bill covering from the10th to the 30th of the month. </para>

                            <para>- There is something in that contention. I should not like to do anything to prevent this temporary Supply Bill going through, but I must take exception to the &#163;250,000 as something that is out of place, and not, in my opinion, within the Constitution. Further information is certainly necessary in regard, for instance, to the &#163;929,000 for the Navy. Surely that cannot be the expenditure for a month ? Are we spending &#163;10,000,000 per annum on the Navy ? How much has been spent up to the present time on this service, and how much is required for the whole year? What proportion does the vote asked for now bear to the total amount necessary ? If the Treasurer would only give us information, which he could easily obtain from his Secretary within an hour, we should all be satisfied. Then, as to the &#163;295,000 for military defence, how much has been spent already, and what proportion does that sum bear to the whole required for the year? The same questions might be asked in regard to other items, including that of the Post Office, &#163;310,000, which is, however, only a small proportion of the whole expenditure. According to the figures presented it would seem that there are arrears to be made up ; and had it not been for my colleague the Bill would have been passed without a word from the Treasurer. We on this side have no desire to cavil at necessary expenditure, and wish to assist the Government as far as we can. </para>

                        <para>.- I think the Treasurer should supply the House with information in regard to the proposed vote for the Small Arms Factory. This is not a matter to be debated just at present, but we know there are two proposals before us - one to add to the existing buildings at Lithgow, and another to establish a factory at Canberra. The establishment of a factory at the Capital site is a question for future debate, but we are entitled to information showing whether the amount mentioned in the Bill, if passed, will affirm the policy of the Government in this connexion. </para>

                    <para>.- Today I drew the attention of the Acting Leader of the House to a statement which had appeared in one of the Canadian newspapers to the effect that the Prime Minister of Australia was reported to have referred to the possibility of a separate peace between Australia and Germany. The Acting Leader of the Government asked me if I could find the cutting referred to- I have done so, and have furnished it to the Minister. I hope that tomorrow he will be able to assure the House that there is no truth whatever in the statement that the Government has been treating with the enemy in this way. Personally, I have no doubt on the matter, but I think the outside public ought to be assured. </para>

With regard to the matter mentioned by the honorable member for Wentworth, I have to say that he has furnished me with the cutting, and I will consult with the Acting Prime Minister in connexion with the subject. As far as I know, there is absolutely no truth in the statement; hut I think, possibly, there has been a misinterpretation of remarks made by the Prime Minister in Canada. </para>
