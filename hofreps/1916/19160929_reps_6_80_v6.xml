                                <para>- I am glad that the newspapers admit this morning that the circular to which attention was drawn by the honorable member for Wentworth was absolutely innocent. The House must be satisfied that the honorable member bit off more than he could chew. When he rises in this chamber, one is always in doubt as to whether he intends to be cynical, satirical, or funny at the expense of  his  fellow members. However, I intend to take him seriously in this instance. The Prime Minister was very modest yesterday. Perhaps he did not care to read the translation of the circular to which his attention had been drawn on the previous day, because it contained a eulogy of the Administration of which he was a prominent member. He was, therefore, content to move that the document containing it be printed. Fortunately for myself and for the House at large, the translation is available. I wish now to let honorable members and the country know which is the political party that is associated with the Germans in this country. The honorable member for Wentworth tried to make it appear that I have been seeking German support during the war, and I therefore call attention to advertisements which were published in Brisbane, in a German newspaper,  in  May,  1915,  some eighteen months after the war broke out. </para>

                        <para class="block">The State elections were then proceeding, and I have here a photographic reproduction of German advertisements, giving reasons why German citizens should vote for Herr W.

The Crown Prince has a large sack in his hand with the inscription, &#34; Booty stolen in Belgium,&#34; while Herr Denham holds a similar one with the inscription &#34; Votes stolen from the workers.&#34; If anything should cause a right-thinking voter, and especially us Germans, not to give our votes this time to the Labour party, it is this insulting (offensive, scurrilous, or disagreeable) picture! Those signatories expect the Germans to vote for them. </para>

                                <para>- The leaflet to which the honorable member for Wentworth drew attention had no reference to  present  political circumstances. Not a single Labour man has appealed to the Germans for support during the war ; such appeals have come only from Liberals. During the Queensland State elections, in May 1915, the Liberal Government published in German in the <inline font-style="italic">News Budget,</inline> a German edition of the weekly <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> and in the German newspaper, their manifesto for the election. The honorable member for Wide Bay was a member of the party at the time, and, therefore, identified with that publication. Not only that, .but the&#34; leading Liberal organ in Queensland, until March last, published weekly a <inline font-style="italic">News Budget</inline> containing three pages in the German language, giving all the news of the war and other information. I propose to tell honorable members the kind of news that was thus being published weekly for the information of German readers. An advertisement appeared each week inviting contributions, and asking that they be addressed to the German&#34; editor of the <inline font-style="italic">News Budget,</inline> Courier Buildings, Brisbane. I have here a digest of the news that appeared on 22nd January, 1916. There were several poems, in one of which was an appreciative reference to the &#34;Kaiser&#39;s little daughter.&#34; The word &#34;  Kaiserlich  &#34; occurs often in this poem. The reference is not to the present Kaiser, but to some past monarch; but, nevertheless, the appeal to German national sentiment - not Australian or British sentiment - is unmistakable. There is an account of a German wedding, at which a &#34; real German wedding breakfast &#34; was given, and the usual toasts were honoured. Then there is an interesting reference to the confirmation services and other good work done by Pastor Franck, and it is an interesting coincidence that a German pastor of that name, presumably the same man, was one of two interned as &#34; disaffected subjects.&#34; Pastor Franck was one of the most active electioneering agents in the Wide Bay district during the by-election in December last. </para>

                                <para>- It is well known that, during the Wide Bay election, Pastor Franck was one of the busiest electioneering agents there, and the German vote was carefully organized. Indeed, the honorable member for Wide Bay actually owes his present seat to the active participation in that election of Pastor Franck and other Germans. To-day Pastor Franck is behind barbed wire, where he ought to have been many months ago. In this German paper, issued from the office of the Liberal newspaper in Brisbane, there also appeared, during this time of war, a serial story called . &#34; The Green Spy.&#34; It referred to a &#34;spy mirror&#34; hung outside a window of a house where a lovely maiden lived, and by means of which she knew of all that happened in the street. I wish to let the Prime Minister know who are the people with whom he is associated. </para>

Here, in the <inline font-style="italic">Maryborough Chronicle</inline> of 24th November, is a full report of the opening speech, in the Town Hall, of the honorable member for Wide Bay, and I notice that the honorable member for Darling Downs also was present, and addressed the meeting. War news of the most serious character is reported in that issue, and if ever there was a time when men should have spoken openly and fearlessly of our purpose in the war, that was the time. </para>

                        <para>That is another illustration of the attitude towards Germans of the political party opposite. To-day they denounce the Germans; previously they fawned on them, and flattered and cajoled them; and even now, when they are out for votes, Germans are fellow-countrymen and compatriots of theirs. In 1911, two dredges were required for Queensland. Tenders were not called, but seven firms were asked to quote. Messrs. Schichau, of Elbing, Prussia, were the lucky people, and &#163;45,800 went direct to Germany. Tenders were not invited in Australia. Subsequently, a few other firms were asked to tender privately for a dredge for Cairns. The succesful tenderers were again the fortunate Messrs. Schichau, of Elbing, and another &#163;42,000 went to Germany. Yet the men who were responsible for letting those contracts to Germany are those who to-day are most active in the advocacy of conscription and the denunciation of the Germans. </para>

                            <para>The German voters of Queensland, and especially the workers, should not forget this treatment when they go to the polls next Saturday. The Labour party is desirous of obtaining the votes of the Germans to get the reins of government, and at the same time they allow their members to treat the German workers (who for the most part are unionists themselves) in such a manner. Do, then, the leaders believe that the German electors will, in these circumstances, vote for the Labour candidates? If so, they are on the wrong scent. To do so would be equivalent to Germans turning the other cheek. ... If the German voters in Maree, which, as is well known, is the safe refuge of Deutschtum (this word is translated according to Cassell&#39;s Dictionary, &#34; German spirit and manners,&#34; or &#34;ardent patriotism&#34;), in Brisbane, are on this occasion united, and do not split their votes, there can be no other result than the return of Herr Walsh as conqueror. </para>

                        <para>The point of these extracts is that, at election time, the Liberal candidates and the Liberal Governments of Australia are pro-Germans, but when it suits them to advocate conscription they are most emphatically anti-German. In the issue before the war of a leaflet to Germans in the German language there was nothing wrong; there was nothing to which any one could take exception. It was a perfectly legitimate and reasonable thing to do and was done in every State by every party, but since the war began which party was it that published in the German language appeals for German support? It was the honorable members opposite. </para>

                                <para>- If what I have said does not apply to the honorable member for Perth personally, he can take no offence. The actions I have alluded to took place since the war broke out. When the prospects of the allied cause were least hopeful the Liberals in Queensland were appealing in German papers for German support by leaflets published in the German language. I deny that the Labour party did anything of that kind, or that any Labour candidate has adopted other than a loyal and anti-German attitude since the war began. Honorable members opposite are the pro-Germans, yet they produce an electoral leaflet published in 1913, and try to prove that those of us who are anti-conscriptionists are in favour of the Germans. I am satisfied that, this morning, I have been able to let the people of the country know who in this country are the pro-Germans. </para>

                                <para>- He did not give me the leaflet, nor did he give me the date. I hope that I will not be asked any more questions of that character. From the air of self-importance with which the honorable member for Brisbane yesterday announced his intention of taking further proceedings, I anticipated that some veritable deed of frightfulness was to be perpetrated on honorable members of the Opposition. We have hardly heard a Hymn of Hate ; but we have heard a mere recital of a number of advertisements issued in a State election campaign in Queensland by certain members of the Liberal party in that State. </para>

                                <para>- The Queensland Labour party issued a leaflet, in German, signed, I think, but I am not sure, by Al. Holtze and H. T. Von Dege Beasley, and emanating from 223 Adelaide-street, Brisbane, which I think is the office of the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Standard,</inline> in which the honorable member for Brisbane has some interest. I understand that this document was issued practically at the same time as the other documents quoted as having relation to the Queensland State election. But the honorable member who now with his customary appearance of candour, asks us to believe that some iniquity was practised by both political parties in the State of Queensland in seeking the votes of duly enfranchised citizens of Queensland, was one of the loudest supporters of the ex-Prime Minister when he announced the duty of the Federal Government towards Germans in our midst. I think that I may be permitted to refer to that statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, the man with whom the honorable member for Brisbane always obsequiously toured Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was asked by an honorable member in this House whether, with a view to assisting recruiting, he would dismiss persons of enemy origin from the Public Service, and his answer was - </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members will see that I had very good ground for asking for an explanation of any action on the part of the honorable member for Brisbane. Paraphrased, the question I asked the Prime Minister was whether he would permit the reprinting of any document printed in the German language. If any man should see fit to circularize the Australian public in the German language, permission should be given to have it reproduced in English. </para>

I merely asked for permission to reproduce the pamphlet. What was the attitude of the honorable member for Brisbane when I submitted the question?

                                <para>- Then why did not the honorable member take the House and the public into his confidence immediately the pamphlet was mentioned ? Instead of that, when the matter was mentioned, he sat cowering in his seat afraid to open his mouth. That is a fair and true statement of the attitude of the honorable member in the House. But he went beyond the House, and when the press asked him what was in the pamphlet, he refused to give any interview. Is that the attitude of a man of absolute innocence, of one who has nothing to cover up and is afraid of nothing? Why did the &#34;honorable member cower in his seat if he was not afraid that there was something behind this business? </para>

                                <para>- He would get bags of German gold if he would ask for money for such a betrayal. Every honorable member knows that the action which was threatened would cover, not only the honorable member who did it, but also this Parliament, with dishonour that would live through the ages. That men in this House should be so blind to the duty they owe in this war to our own people and to our people over the seas, as to deliberately aim at causing trouble that would help no one but the Germans is beyond comprehension, and when I see men prepared to sink to that depth, I want to know the explanation and interpretation of everything in the German tongue that I see over their signatures. These things, I ask honorable members to recollect, are not published in the newspapers as are the articles from which the - honorable member for Brisbane has quoted to-day, they are not mere public advertisements that any man may see : they are things which are circulated secretly. I ask the honorable member for Brisbane - Has he circulated any more of such&#39; documents since the last election was held ? He is silent. I leave honorable members to draw their own conclusions ! The time has come in Australia when we should prevent the use of the German language utterly, but where the German language has been used in making an&#39; election appeal, it should be permitted to be reproduced in order that the public may know the manner of men who asked for the support of the Germans on other occasions. 1 have told the House frankly, freely, and fairly what has been at the back of my mind, and the only thing that is there. Honorable members will agree with me that if any member of this Parliament were to be so base to his own honour as to betray his country bv betraying his Prime Minister&#39;s confidence, he would be deserving of the very closest scrutiny from every man in the House and in this continent.

That is my opinion of what the honorable member for Wentworth did the other day. At first, I was of opinion that the letter had been issued during the progress of the war. I believe that every honorable member had the same opinion. It is quite evident that the Prime Minister, when he read the translation yesterday, thought that it had been written during the war. </para>

                                <para>- Any one who has been associated with the  honorable  member for Wentworth knows that he is not a simpleton, but the exact opposite. My opinion is that the honorable member read this document before he introduced it, and, if he did not, he did not use his brains in the way to which we are accustomed. It was quite understood that the appeal had been issued during the war, and one cannot but believe that that is the meaning the honorable member intended to convey. Matters are serious enough without this sort of thing occurring, and if honorable members resort to such methods, it is time the House took a hand. </para>

                            <para>.- It is necessary, in the interests of a man who is absent, to deny certain statements that have been made. I refer to the reverend pastor mentioned by the honorable member for Brisbane, and I have to say that, owing to the fact that a large portion of his congregation were Labour, while some of them were Liberal, he never took . any part in politics. The assertion that that gentleman went around  cany assing  and advocating my return is absolutely without any foundation. It ought to be pointed out that for many years past, and, indeed, until the lady died recently, the Labour party in Maryborough employed a Miss  Gehrman  as their organizer, and another, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Gehrman,</inline> in the same  capacity. Then again, in Gayndah, the secretary of the Labour organization was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Schiber,  another German. It has been said that I was returned on the German vote, but if Germans did vote for me, it only shows their common sense in giving me the support they gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> I challenge any honorable member to say that, either on the public platform or by circular, I asked Germans to give me their vote. Such a denial is only just to me as a true and loyal Britisher, who not only has done all he can himself to help the Empire, but has sons, one who fought in Gallipoli and two are now fighting in Prance. Under the circumstances, I have the right to stand up and say that these gross, mean, contemptible insinuations are not worthy of the honorable member for Brisbane. At the last election for Wide Bay I heard from scores of people that the honorable member for Brisbane stood up in front of t&#62;he Royal hotel, Maryborough, arid, before a large audience, declared that this is a capitalists&#39; war. What was the object of that but to keep people from enlisting - 4;o keep people from fighting for the Empire to preserve the liberties that .Labour adherents, as well as others, enjoy? Men like that are the very last who ought to criticise others who have undoubtedly shown their loyalty. I have shown mine in a way that the honorable member does not seem to be able to. Has he sent his sons to the war - those big .strapping fellows? No. He has not helped in the slightest degree. </para>

                            <para>.- Nobody can take any credit for proceedings of this sort, and, had the honorable member for Brisbane introduced the subject himself, I should certainly not have been one to support him. That honorable member, however, is quite entitled to act as he has done under the circumstances. If there are honorable members who can give any credit to the honorable member for Wentworth for what he has done, let them give him credit. I do not think that even honorable members opposite feel that that honorable member has played the game fairly. It is well known that, prior to the war, the Germans here were recognised as good citizens, &#39; and, under the circumstances, the honorable member for Brisbane was quite right in showing that other men have, since the war, done what he did before the war. </para>

                                <para>- I shall leave the matter at that. Every one knows distinctly and clearly what is the object underlying the action of the honorable member for Wentworth - an action in pursuance of a policy not confined to himself, but shared by others. I direct your attention to the fact that on this side there are men just as honorable as men on the other side, and that some of us hold certain opinions which the Prime Minister held only a few months ago. It is useless for honorable members opposite to endeavour to fasten pro-German views on those who take a different view of the situation, for such an attitude can only rebound on themselves. The honorable member for Wentworth made reference to a threat said to have been made by the honorable member for Brisbane in Sydney. I have made no such threat, and I am prepared to respect anything said to me in confidence. There is, however, a limit to this. When I hear gentlemen making statements on the platform that are in direct contradiction to statements&#39; which they have made in secret, what can be done to refute them? Either the statements made on the platform must be untrue or the statements made in secret must be untrue; and they must not be allowed to put those who disagree with them in a cleft stick. They must honorably observe the confidence reposed in them, or it will be no more binding on me than it is on them. </para>

                            <para>. - I have been much associated with Germans in every State, and I am not ashamed of the fact, for it was from Germans that I learnt my Democracy. The men who lived in the rebel year of 1848 were my teachers, and these were the men who, if they had their way, would not allow a kaiser or a king to exist, and who helped to drive the grandfather of the present German Emperor out of Berlin. Their sons and their sons&#39; sons I believe to be as genuine Australians as any born here, and unless they are proved to be guilty of disloyalty, it is only decency on our part to give them credit for loyalty. Their fathers left their country to escape the infamy of conscription, and we ought to treat them as good citizens, unless we find them unworthy of trust. There are guilty Germans who ought to be interned, but who are allowed to walk the streets of Melbourne simply, in my opinion, because they are possessed of wealth. I am now alluding to those connected with the well-known rubber company in Australia, one of whom was so contemptible that when he was naturalized and swore fealty, changing his name in the process, he must have been a spy. He was a major in the Forces, and, as a member of the Automobile Club, was gaining information about our roads ; and yet that swell frill and feathers club, the Army and Navy Club, allowed him to resign. That man ought to have been put in gaol, for internment is too good for him. There were two oaths and two pledges of honour given in this connexion, but his rich colleague in the company is drawing a big salary, and, just because he is a rich man, he can calmly smoke his cigar up Collins-street. The introduction of this subject this morning is most unfortunate, and I do not suppose there are three honorable members opposite who do not regret it. The honorable member for &#34;Wentworth spoke of the self-importance of the honorable member for Brisbane, but  those who heard the former gentleman. in spite of all his advantages of a university education, beating the wind in an endeavour to cover up what he had said, must have thought they were listening to some barnstormer. This document has been printed owing to the abject submission of the Prime Minister, and that gentleman ought to be present to hear the explanation of the man concerned, though I suppose he is hiding somewhere in a corner. </para>

The printing of this document will remain an infamy to the honorable member for Wentworth, and to the Prime Minister, who had the printing done. The Prime Minister was asked the date of the document when it was first produced, but he was conveniently deaf. There is, however, no escape for the right honorable gentleman, for the honorable member for Riverina, passing by him at the time, told him that honorable members had asked for the date of the document. However, neither the honorable member for Wentworth nor the Prime Minister were &#34; game &#34; enough to give the date, although it was on the document, not only in German, but in English. The date is distinctly stated as the 31st May. </para>

                                <para>- No; but the fact that the electors are asked to put a cross opposite the name of the honorable member for Brisbane shows, as plainly as the ten commandments in a church, that it was the election year. Yet the Prime Minister has thought fit to have this document printed, and is not man enough to be present to hear the explanation, and I venture to say that he will never trouble to read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. Is that the way to fight fairly ? Will the Prime Minister permit the explanation to be published in the same way as the document was published? The action of the honorable member for Wentworth is unworthy of him, and I am only sorry he is not here at the present moment. When the honorable member used a word sounding like &#34; coward,&#34; he recalled to my mind a time in the Victorian Parliament when the late William Shiels assailed the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Patterson, and by using the words &#34; cowered in a corner&#34; conveyed a meaning quite different from that of the words themselves. Just as  if the honorable member for Brisbane would tremble at this whipper-snapper! It is laughable to think of such a thing. The honorable member for Wentworth, in the course of his remarks, said that he would do away with the German language if he could. The honorable member, as a university man, ought to know that, at the Melbourne University, no one is allowed to pass in modern languages in the Public Service examination without showing his proficiency in German. I regret that I cannot speak German. Had I been able to do so, I should not have been landed in a police office in Berlin in 1911 because of my friend&#39;s bad accent. The German police were the only civil functionaries that we discovered on that occasion. A great American author has stated that most of the words in the English language are Saxon, which is the pure German tongue of the German race. Our university, some of whose professors are yelping as loudly ,as they can on the public platform, should give students the choice between, say, French, German, Italian, and Russian, instead of compelling them to learn German and French. I resent the compulsion to learn any language. The attitude in regard to modern languages is nearly, as bad as used to be the attitude in regard to ancient languages. God knows how many heads have ached and minds have wearied in the learning of Latin and Greek, which has been of so little use to those who have learned them ! I commend the honorable member for Brisbane for having defended himself, and I am sorry that the honor able member for Wide Bay got into the position in which he was placed. When a stone is thrown from the other side it is sure to rebound. </para>

                                <para>- Was it straight throwing to suppress a date? What has occurred does not tend to increase the good feeling between honorable members. The honorable member for Wentworth loves to cause an outburst, and then to laugh and joke about it. He is never really serious. He made use of a word which sounded like &#34; coward,&#34; but no one would accuse of being afraid, the happy-tempered, pleasant-minded member for Brisbane, who has always a smile on his lips and a laugh in his eyes, and can take the hardest hits good  temperedly.  Is there anything wrong in this appeal - </para>

                        <para class="block">A good many Germans draw pensions as a reward for many years&#39; residence in this country. Old souls in my district have told me that they regret the war, and hope to a man that the Kaiser will be eliminated with the short shrift of a rope. Is it thought that the Liberals would have brought in old-age and invalid pensions, or would have reduced the age limit to sixty years? How many times will it be necessary to make these walls echo with the statement that the honorable member for Flinders reduced the Victorian allowance for old-age pensions from &#163;200,000 to &#163;150,000 ? Have we not the authority of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper for saying that only begrudgingly did he withdraw an inaccurate remark to the effect that he drafted the first Old-age Pensions Bill introduced in this State? </para>

                            <para>.- Like the honorable member for Perth, I very much resent the imputation of the honorable member for Brisbane that Liberal members have cringed to the German vote. I have probably ten German electors in my division for every one in the Brisbane division, but I defy any one to say that either as a candidate or as a member of Parliament I have curried favour with that section of the community. I believe that a number of votes have been cast for me by Germans, and it shows their good sense when they vote for a man who is fearless in regard to them. I regret the sweeping charges which the honorable member for Brisbane has made. He should have been more specific. </para>

                                <para>- I regret the whole proceedings. It has troubled me very much since the beginning of the war that honorable members should consider the effect of their attitude towards the war upon the German vote. No nation can be safe whose representatives consider first the opinions of citizens of enemy origin. Our duty is to go straight ahead regardless of nationality. Roosevelt has said that he despises the man who has to be continually reminded of where he was born. That is my attitude. The honorable member for Melbourne said that the Prime Minister was conveniently deaf when asked to give the date of the circular to which the honorable member for Wentworth drew attention. As a matter of fact, there is no date on it, and the only clue to the date is the appeal to vote for the honorable member for Brisbane on the 31st May. We know that, in 1913, the Federal elections were held on that date. The honorable member for Brisbane has made a rather poor case for himself.  His  action reminded me of that of an innocent-looking fish which I once saw at a sea-side resort near Brisbane. On being touched with a stick, it scuttled away, leaving behind a cloud of inky fluid. The honorable member for Brisbane scuttled away, leaving a mess behind him. He threw out so much dirt in order to cover up something which may come out before the question is settled. </para>

                            <para>- In the local Courts lawyers will not be allowed to appear.. The question will be one of fact and not of law, and each party will plead his own case. There should be no long drawn out litigation. I apprehend that there will be very few appeals. I would not shut the door and say that because a man is poor he should not be allowed the right to bring his case before the final court of appeal, but the question is one to be determined upon the merits of each particular case. As there will be no lawyers and no law, and as only a question of fact will be involved, I apprehend that the proceedings will be very short. The tribunals will be quite impartial and nonmilitary, and will hear both parties without the intervention of those ornaments and pillars of society in the profession to which I have the honour to belong. In those circumstances the decisions will be speedy, economical, and effective. </para>

                                <para>- The power under which the men are to be called up is that of an existing Statute. Under that Statute there is no limit set to the number that may be called up. The number necessary for the purpose of carrying out the Government policy is 32,500, of which, I understand, under 7,000 have voluntarily enlisted; therefore a balance of 25,000 is still required. I shall not commit myself further than to say that in this regard the Government will be governed strictly by what is required to give effect to their policy. It is very evident that if 40,000 men are called up we may not get more than 25,000 effectives. A number of those called up will be rejected because of unfitness, and others will be permitted to return to their homes for one hundred and one reasons. They may, for instance, be persons whom it is undesirable to withdraw from husbandry at this season of the year. The final number to be taken will be the difference between the total of enlistments and the requirement of 32,500. </para>

                            <para>The Australian soldiers are greatly interested in the conscription campaign. As yet the majority of them have not faced the issue, but discussions upon it in the trenches and camps are becoming more frequent. In many cases the men are inclined to oppose it. These say they left their younger brothers to keep the home together. They would not object if a system were devisable requiring equal sacrifice by all families. A small section of the men, and especially the wounded, opposed conscription emphatically. Apparently they dislike legislation affecting the liberties of the subject. </para>

                        <para>- I have never failed to keep those circumstances in mind, but owing to the abnormal increase in the cost of our mail contracts, in some cases to the extent of 300 per cent., it is not possible to give a service of such frequency as was possible when lower prices were obtainable. So much have the prices increased that it is only possible, in some places, to give them one mail a week, where formerly they had two, and to give them two where formerly they had three, and, even so, at a greater cost to the Commonwealth than was involved when the better service was rendered. </para>

Soldiers in camp are in the same position, and have the same rights as electors elsewhere, who have reason to believe that they will be leaving Australia prior to polling day. No complaint has been made to the Electoral Administration of any interference or attempted interference with any soldier in regard to the free exercise of his voting rights. The Registrars dealing with the voting in camps are civilians acting under the direction of the Electoral Administration. </para>

                    <para>. - I also object to the Bill being postponed, and I cannot see why the Government should not proceed with it. If they intend to introduce business of a debatable character inviting discussion, they will then be able to charge us with keeping this Bill back. The Treasurer, it seems, is asking for the postponement of this measure until after some other contentious question has been settled, and if Parliament debates that measure exhaustively, we will then be charged with preventing an amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act from being carried. It is not fair that the House should be put in that position, and I blame the Treasurer for it. </para>

                    <para class="block">This amendment of the Estate Duty Assessment Act, and the two other Bills to follow, are purely machinery measures, and all that honorable members need to satisfy themselves upon is whether it is necessary to appoint an Assistant Commissioner of Taxation. The Government have decided that it is. As the Minister charged with the supervision of the various Departments of taxation, I assure honorable members that the work of the Commissioner of. Taxation is so responsible and arduous that it is necessary to appoint an assistant. The Commissioner is charged with the administration of the Land Tax Act, a measure of far-reaching importance, and difficult to administer; the Income Tax Act, also highly technical, and bringing before the Minister in its operations many deputations of individuals who desire information, or complain of the working of the Act; and the Estate Duty Assessment Act. All three measures affect the whole of Australia. We shall, I hope, pass, when we return, the War-time Profits Taxation Act, the new repatriation levy, and the Entertainments Tax Act, all of which will be under the administration of the Commissioner of Taxation. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister wants to spare the officers in that Department, he needs to appoint another twenty people, although I give him credit for paying overtime and tea money. I wish he could enforce the same arrangement on all his other Departments. I think he would, if he had the power. In answer to my question whether prosecutions for income tax evasions had been enforced in any State other than Victoria, the Minister replied that he was &#34; unable to say at present.&#34; I wanted that information for this Bill. Is the stigma to rest upon Victoria of being the only dishonest State, because I understand that it is only here that prosecutions have been instituted for evasions? </para>

                            <para>- They may have been cases of wrong returns. If the honorable member has information on the subject I shall be pleased to get it from him later on. I cannot get the information asked for in my third question, &#34; What is the estimated number of evasions?&#34; I do not blame the Minister, because he had very short notice, which, however, was not wholly my fault. I have had on another matter a serious difference with the Minister. A wrong done to a man in the Income Tax Department was brought to my notice. I felt I would injure that unfortunate man by trying to get his case before the Minister. I mentioned that to the Minister at an interview, and do not blame him for being a little stormy. Possibly I deserved it. As I did not wish to injure the man, I bowed to the storm. I understand the man was accused of using departmental stationery by men who had got. into trouble in connexion with their income tax returns. The Minister showed me a letter on departmental paper which the man had used, in my opinion, wrongly; but if public servants were to be called to account for using departmental stationery or envelopes, about 95 per cent, of the Commonwealth servants would be in trouble. Later on, the Minister justly said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Nelkin&#39;s  answer should be made in writing, to which I agreed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Nelkin  then left to make out his statement. I understand that a letter was then sent to him requesting that he should put in a sworn statement. That was the first &#39;time I have ever been asked to get a sworn statement from a citizen about a matter of which he had only a hasty knowledge through portions being read to him by the Minister. It is also the first time that. I have ever been asked that a trade unionist and Labour man should make a sworn declaration on charges that had not been put before him. He went to a magistrate, who wrote to the Treasurer <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> a copy of the charges that he was to answer on oath. I do not know whether all the charges were sent to him, for the Minister knows that I handed the case over to a senator in order not to prejudice the man&#39;s cause on account of the difference between the Minister and myself. i </para>

                            <para>- I will wager ten to one that the Minister will not appear on the platform for conscription. That is my answer to that sort of remark. I know the Minister too well for him to talk in that way. I do not object to the proposed appointment, no matter who the man is. If it is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing,</inline> I think he has tried his best to make up for the infamous wrong that he did to the man to whom I have just been referring. If he is the man to be selected, I shall be satisfied. I understand that the Acting Public Service Commissioner will appoint him, and I do not want the Minister to think I am hitting at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewing.</inline> He is a good man, who made an unfortunate mistake, which has helped to ruin a man and his wife and family, and the Minister does not seem disposed to help thai unfortunate individual out of his trouble. He has been stamped with an infamous name simply because a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Graphic</inline> newspaper waited on Ewing, who called him by the vile name of a common informer. That man was employed by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> who recognised the good work that he did. He brought to light many cases that have not appeared before the Court. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that the matter to which I wished to refer can be considered more appropriately under this Bill. In the administration of our income tax law, we are losing vast sums of money every year through the lack of a proper intelligence department to discover those who seek to rob the country by failing to send in income tax returns, and by avoiding the payment of the tax. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> made some provision for an intelligence branch with the help and assistance of a man named Nelkin. He personally expressed to me his satisfaction with the work of this man, though he admitted that he was perhaps a little too abrupt. </para>

Details of administration of a Department might be discussed at length on the Estimates, but to permit such a discussion on the second reading of a Bill would be to consent to a course of procedure which would make it almost impossible to get any Bill through the House. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to state definitely that an intelligence branch of the Taxation Department is urgently required in order that persons trying to rob the community may be prevented from doing so. It is commonly stated that no tax imposed is the cause of so much lying, deceit, and injustice as is an income tax, although, with all its faults, it will be admitted that there is no better means of raising taxation. We have wisely, in our income tax legislation, differentiated more widely than has been done in Great Britain between incomes derived from land and property and incomes derived from personal exertion. I believe that honorable members are in agreement with me when I say that considerable difficulty arises from the fact that we have both Federal and State income taxes. Some procedure should be adopted to avoid the necessity for the making of separate returns for the State and the Commonwealth. I make the suggestion to the Treasurer that, at the earliest opportunity, he should frame regulations under which Federal income tax returns might be based upon returns sent in in connexion with the State income tax. This&#39; would save a very great deal of work. It would prevent the duplication of work by Government Departments. It would save time, paper, and postage. As this is only an amending Bill, I shall say no more at the present stage in reference to the matter. I notice that there is not a quorum present. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline></para>

It would appear that this is so when we consider that it is the only State in which prosecutions have been instituted for evasions of the income tax. I do not think that the Treasurer will contend that the people of Queensland are any more honest than are the people of Victoria. Why are these prosecutions instituted: in Victoria and not in any of the other States ? </para>

                <para>One might be forgiven for making a few remarks on a subject of so much importance as that dealt with by this measure, but, as I am asking honorable members to be brief in their remarks, mine must be extremely brief. In response to applications from honorable members, and from correspondents throughout the Commonwealth, the Government have agreed that elderly people who are now receiving pensions should not be called upon to undergo unnecessary suffering owing to the increase in the cost of living. Ministers, believe that the Commonwealth can pay the increase. It will amount to about &#163;850,000. per annum. Time does not permit me to discuss certain economic considerations attaching to the payment of pensions, but one is the fact that payment of money to individuals by the State may affect the position of wage-earners. For instance, when an allowance was made in Great Britain to cover unemployment, certain employers took advantage of it to decrease the rate of wages. Any Government in establishing a pensions scheme must take into, consideration the possibility of certain individuals in the community taking advantage of the Government grant in order to make people work for lower wages. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bill overlooks one or two matters that I should like to bring under the notice of the Treasurer. Some little time ago I directed the Treasurer&#39;s attention to the case of a boy suffering from a paralyzed leg which prevented him from obtaining work, and to a similar case where the boy had lost the use of an arm. through paralysis. Provision should be made to meet the case of any person who, by reason of paralysis depriving him of the use of a limb, is unable to follow an occupation or earn sufficient to keep him. That person should be entitled to the invalid pension, but cannot obtain one through not being totally incapacitated from following any employment. It is very difficult for those who are incapacitated by paralysis to find employment. Employers will not employ them. Seeing that they have to pay them full wages, they prefer to employ those with the full use of their limbs. </para>

                        <para>- I am mentioning these matters very briefly. I wish also to bring under the notice of the Treasurer the case of a man who has accumulated a little property and made it over to his wife, and who, as the result of a domestic quarrel, is living away from his wife, and has not sufficient funds to secure a judicial separation or, perhaps, divorce. If the man becomes destitute the fact that his wife owns certain property prevents him from obtaining the old-age pension. There are several of these cases, and I hope that the Treasurer will see his way clear to make provision for them. </para>

In my electorate the population is to some extent nomadic, and some cases of hardship have occurred under this provision, and I suggest that the period be increased to at least 100 days. </para>

                        <para>- The 2s. which is thus saved, it has been suggested, should be paid to the pensioner as pocket-money. That suggestion we propose to carry out by means of this Bill. The Government, however, are not prepared to pay this 2s. to other elderly persons similarly circumstanced, but who are not what may be described as our own pensioners. This may cause a little irritation, perhaps, but to pay the allowance to all such elderly people would cost the Commonwealth &#163;30,000. </para>

At present, hospitals are the repository for old-age pensioners just at the very time they require most assistance; and it is proposed to compromise the matter by giving each pensioner 2s., leaving the hospital high and dry. There are many hospitals, for example, in old mining districts that cannot be conducted without assistance. </para>

                        <para>- That is if he has been in a hospital for over a month. Hospitals do not desire to have old-age pensioners, especially when beds are needed for accidents and other emergency cases; and I think that such an institution should receive the full amount of the pension, less the 2s. per week allowed as pocket money. If an amendment is moved to that effect, I shall support it. Nearly all our hospitals are in debt. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. At Warragul they had often to put old-age pensioners into the hospital, when it was not occupied by patients. I hope that the Minister will do as I suggest. As only one pensioner goes into a hospital to every ten that go into a benevolent asylum, the cost will not be much. I do not wish to interfere with the present arrangement, under which the pensioner gets arrears of four weeks&#39; pension on leaving an institution. I speak on behalf of the hospitals, because I do know the splendid work that they do, and the expenses which they have to meet. As soon as a pensioner has been treated in a hospital, and is well enough to be removed, he is taken to a convalescent home or benevolent asylum. </para>

                        <para>- They are not treated as such. Under section 45 of the Act, if a pensioner becomes an inmate of an asylum for the insane, or of a hospital, his pension is suspended. When he is discharged, the payment of the pension is resumed, and he is entitled to four weeks&#39; instalment of pension in respect of the period of suspension, if that period has continued for four weeks. Under another provision, a magistrate may commit a pensioner to an institution, in which case the institution benefits. </para>

                        <para>- It is the provision of the law, for which the honorable gentleman was not responsible. In a country district there are only the hospitals for the old-age pensioners to go to, and the Treasurer, by refusing to amend an anomaly in the law, makes a pensioner a beggar when he knocks at the door of such an institution. But the Commonwealth, having undertaken to provide old-age pensions, should not throw a pensioner back on the State when he becomes ill. The hospitals are willing to take charge of old-age pensioners, and are doing so, but they should be put by the Commonwealth in the same position as other institutions. When a pensioner goes into a public hospital he is deprived of his pension, and nothing is paid to the hospital for his keep. The Government did right in taking over from the State the business of dealing with old-age pensions, and it should not throw pensioners back on the States when they become ill. Our public hospitals are kept going only through the efforts of those who undertake their management without charge, and are supported by public contributions and small State subsidies. What I ask is that hospitals may be placed in the same position as benevolent asylums. Under the present law it is the big centres of population that benefit, because they are able to maintain benevolent asylums in addition to hospitals. Old persons very often hang round poor mining districts because of early associations, and when they become ill they must go to the local hospital for treatment. I propose to amend section 45 by adding the following proviso - </para>

                </continue>
                <para>Provided that out of the amounts so suspended and not paid to the pensioner by this section, a sum equal to 10s. 6d. per week shall be paid to the treasurer of any hospital in which such pensioner was an inmate, for the term during which the pension was not paid to the pensioner. </para>
                <para>Under that provision the pensioner would receive 2s. per week and the balance would go to the hospital. The Commonwealth would thus honour its obligations instead of throwing them on the State. </para>

                    <para>.- The Treasurer should be aware that most of our public hospitals depend entirely upon public subscriptions and Government subsidies. I ask the Treasurer, therefore, to consider carefully their position in regard to old-age pensioners. The donation from the Government depends upon the amount raised by public subscription, and during this time of war, when every one is being taxed heavily, I am afraid that the voluntary contributions to the hospitals will decrease considerably. The consequence will be that the poorer people will suffer. I hope the Treasurer will give this aspect of the question due consideration. </para>

Of course, a person in regular employment, and in receipt of a decent salary, would not be entitled to be on the pension list ; but persons in indigent circumstances ought to be allowed to eke out the small sums they receive from the Commonwealth. </para>

I went into this matter carefully, and I readily obtained the consent of other members of the Government to the payment of an additional 2s. 6d. to each pensioner. The Government have made the Bill as liberal as it is possible to make it. I cannot accept any more amendments to it, and if honorable members succeed in carrying amendments such as that which was agreed to during my absence from the chamber for a few seconds, they will wreck the Bill. </para>

There is not a hospital in Victoria that has not a debit balance. When a man is ill he requires more nourishment than at other times, and how is an institution to supply it to him.? If some amendment such as that suggested is not made, there will be pensioners who will not go into the hospital for fear of losing their pensions, and they will not get the treatment that only a hospital can give them. They will remain outside the hospital and die miserably. I ask the Treasurer what expenditure will be entailed by this amendment. </para>

If we agree to that provision it will mean that the man can earn &#163;52 a year, and his wife can earn &#163;52 a year, and each can receive a pension of 12s. 6d. a week. The proposal would bring within the pension area such a number of people that the Government would not be able to carry the financial burden at the present time. </para>

                    <para>.- By the kindly action of the ex-Prime Minister, an old-age pensioner may live in his own house, even if it be valued at &#163;5,000, so long as he does not let rooms for profit. If a house is valued at &#163;1,000, it is worth, on a 5per cent, basis, &#163;50 a year. If the Treasurer cannot accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Lang that the old-age pensioner should be allowed to earn up to &#163;52 a year, he should also deprive him of the privilege of living in as fine a house as he chooses to own. I am glad that some of the old-age pensioners can save money. I know of instances where they live in valuable houses under very comfortable circumstances by making full use of their gardens. The suggestion of the honorable member for Lang will not add a penny to the amount of pension that is paid. </para>

                <para class="block">If the House carries this motion it will be deprived of the opportunity of discussing the proclamation and the reasons for it. I believe that the Government do not intend to call out the men under the Defence Act. I believe that they intend to use the War Precautions Act for the purpose, and thus avoid submitting to Parliament reasons for their action. They should adhere to the method laid down in the Defence Act, a measure which was passed in times of peace. At any rate, they should be candid enough to tell the House what method they intend to follow. I am raising no factious opposition to the motion, but I feel that Parliament should meet after the proclamation is issued. We have never had anything like this position in the history of Australia. We know that Che peculiar action that is to be taken on Monday is disturbing the minds of the people. The Prime Minister has told us that these men are not to be called up for home defence, but are to be prepared to go to the front if the referendum be in the affirmative. If that be the case, why make any pretence about the proclamation ? In view of the fact that it would be illegal to issue a proclamation with that object under the Defence Act, I am of opinion that the Government intend to resort to the War Precautions Act, and I do not think that is a fair thing to do in a country like this, when the matter might be laid before Parliament. It is a precedent which I should very much regret to see followed on a future occasion. I have approached both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and, while from the latter I could get no definite information, the Prime Minister told me that he did not intend the House to meet next Wednesday. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member, in asking that question, tries to look very innocent; but, while I am not aware of the opinion of individual Ministers, I candidly admit I &#34; hae m&#39; doots.&#34; The Act distinctly says that the Governor-General shall give his reasons, per medium, of course, of the Prime Minister or Minister in charge at the time; and in the drafting and consideration of the Defence Act, both originally and in the several amendments made since, due consideration was given to the seriousness of issuing a proclamation of the kind. I well remember that, when the  Defence Bill was before Parliament, honorable members on both sides were determined that no power should be placed in the hands of any Ministry to do as they thought fit on such occasions, and provision was made for a proper discussion of the matter by Parliament, as is shown by the fact that if Parliament is not sitting at the time it must be called together within ten days. Of course, in other Acts the Ministry very properly have the power to issue proclamations, the time being left to their discretion. This was the case in the amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, when the age of the women pensioners was reduced to sixty, the idea being to allow the Government to issue a proclamation when in their opinion the finances of the country would permit of the change. The same sort of discretion might be left in the case of a Tariff change, it being left to the Government to say when, in their opinion, the inrush of foreign productions was imperilling the industrial life of the country. In the case of the Defence Act, however, that cannot be done, for the reasons I have stated. It would be quite possible for any Government, when the House was not sitting, to issue a proclamation which they knew would result in their overthrow had Parliament been in session. I desire to know from the Government the constitutional reasons they have for their action, for, up to the present, we have had no reasons of the kind. The Prime Minister told us that if, at the end of the month, 32,500 men had not enlisted voluntarily he would act under the sections of the Defence Act relating to home defence ; but as I have already said, he has also told us that the men are being called up, not for home defence, but in order to be trained for foreign service. That is a reason that could not be given according to the Defence Act. It is pretty evident that under the War Precautions Act anything may be done; and there is a case in point in the Government action in fixing prices, which had been declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Griffith and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton. If Parliament has no power to do certain things, it certainly has not the power to delegate others to do them. If the Government may resort to the War Precautions Act to do anything they desire, it will not be long before we have martial law, and Parliament will not be necessary. Under martial law, or even under the War Precautions Act, the Government could deny the right of Parliament to deal with the finances, and take the management into their own hands. If honorable members permit the introduction of the thin edge of the wedge in this way, they, as caretakers of the people&#39;s rights, are running great risks. I, for one, do not intend to take any risks, and, therefore, I voice my objection to the proposal before the House. The Prime Minister ought really to tell the House under what law he intends to make the proclamation on Monday, for it is only just that Parliament and the people should know. It requires no stretch of imagination to believe that, after the proclamation is issued on Monday, there may be great unrest in Australia. Indeed, it has come to my knowledge within the last hour that the unrest has already started, although no information of the fact has been made public in Melbourne. On Monday night, at Broken Hill, forty policemen, armed with batons, made a raid on a meeting. They knocked several men senseless, locked up a number of others, and, in the course of the trouble, batoned several women. </para>

                        <para>- No; but every man and woman in this country has the right to say what he or she likes. When the Government realizes that sane things are not injurious, they will get over their trouble. Those who have studied the history of the world know that Coercion Acts, and the prevention of free speech, so far from stifling any section of the community, have only given them greater strength, numerically and otherwise. The objects of these people may be foolish and ridiculous; they may be faddists, and have an idea of upsetting the Constitution by argument, but so long as they resort to no methods to bring about personal injury they ought to be allowed to voice their opinions. As I have said previously, magistrates who fine men &#163;100, and sentence them to twelve months&#39; imprisonment, instead of inflicting the nominal fine of 1s. for a nominal crime, only show their unfitness for their positions. Every man knows that if you try to suppress public utterance you strengthen instead of weaken those whom you coerce. A Labour Government has no right to allow armed police, forty strong, to attack a body of men and women who are merely talking. If sabotage were being indulged in, if fire-sticks were being carried round, such interference might be justified; but no Government of any sense would use force, as was done in Broken Hill, merely to prevent people from talking. The presence of women at the meeting to which I refer was evidence that there was no intention to commit a riot. All that was intended was to utter the opinion that certain actions of this Government are inimical to the interests of the people. When the proclamation has been issued, and you begin to gather in the young men who will not join the ranks voluntarily, you will create the determination to resist, and no Government would have the right, under such circumstances, to prevent parents and sisters from expressing their objections to the compulsion that was intended. Therepresentatives of the people ought not to hand over the lives and liberties of the community to the sweet mercy of the Prime Minister. </para>

He may resign, or he may ask the Governor-General to close Parliament, as has been done in Greece, allowing him, as dictator, to use the military and the police to compel men to enlist, and to rule the country financially and otherwise on hisown. </para>

                        <para>-I do not wish to say anything nasty of the Prime Minister, but he isa determined man. He maybe right, and I may bewrong;but I am certain that he will,byevery means in his power, try to carry into effect what he believes to be right. Parliament ought not to adjourn over the period which will elapse between the issue of the proclamation and the taking of the referendum.I admit that honorable members generally wish to place their views before the people in the hope of securing the vote that they desire.The Prime Minister has taken on an extraordinarily big job, such as only a man of his calibre could undertake . He is determined to fight this matter out from start to finish, and he needs all the opportunity that he can get. I do not pose asa prophet, but I  warn  honorable members that if. we agree to the proposed adjournment we shall take- a risk that we ought not to &#39;take. I am not able to prevent the carrying of this motion. The Prime Minister has not told us whether the proclamation is to be issued in exercise of the powers conferred by the Defence Act, or of those given under the War Precautions Act. If the Prime Minister is utilizing the War Precautions Act to get his way on this, question, he is capable of doing anything to give effect to his will. However, honorable members must take the responsibility for whatever may be done. </para>

                    <para>. - The House is adjourning, as it has adjourned on several occasions during this session; it is not going into recess. The purpose of the adjournment is a public one, known to every citizen, and I can conceive of no reason which would better justify this adjournment than that which renders it necessary. We are adjourning in order that we may put before the people - the masters of Parliament, whose mouthpieces we are - our views on the greatest question ever submitted to the citizens of any nation in any age. If that cannot be taken to justify the adjournment, this Parliament must be regarded as- an undemocratic institution. A democratic Parliament should always reflect the opinions of the people. That is the essence of Democracy. Although the views of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports differ from mine, he will not deny that the question for the people to decide is one upon whose decision the destiny of the country may turn. No one will deny that the decision is fraught with grave import to the future of the nation. Parliament cannot continue to transact business while its members are addressing the electors upon the referendum. The people must have an opportunity to decide the question on its merits. We intend to dispel the mists of ignorance, prejudice, and misrepresentation that have been spread everywhere throughout the land. We are going- to put the case before the people, so that the humblest and most indifferent citizen may know what it is that he is to be asked to decide. I say, without hesitation or reservation, that we- can best serve the interests of parliamentary- government, and prove ourselves worthy to represent a free people, by adjourning in order to go. before the electors, who have the right to- demand the expression of our views on the great question that is to be referred to them. They are going to hear, those views. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Now let me say a word about the proclamation. It might be thought from the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that the proclamation is being issued without notice, whereas the intention to issue it was announced as part of&#39; the policy of the Government in my statement of the 28th August. It will be issued under powers derived from an Act that has been in force for fifteen years-. We propose to issue a proclamation under a law which for fifteen years, has been  unassailed,  and has, indeed, won the encomiums of every citizen during the- time that it was not necessary to exercise it, but which now, when it is necessary to show that there is some virtue in it beyond a mere doctrinaire assertion of the right to call upon a man to fight for his country, when it is no longer a mere platitude for use on the platform, but- a piece of practicable machinery to be put into- operation, we are told is a violation of the fundamental principles of Democracy. The nature and scope of this proclamation and the authority from which it derives its power are perfectly well known and settled. There remains nothing more to be done, since Parliament has been debating this policy for a month. The intention to issue the proclamation was perfectly well known when the Referendum Bill was before the House, and it was discussed at length. We hear sinister rumours as to what will take place outside. This is a democratic community ; the- majority are going to rule, and rule in a constitutional manner, and they are not going to rule in any other fashion. The laws of the country are to be observed. This law is no new thing that is being shoved down the people&#39;s throats. It is a law approved by the general consent of all parties, and it has to be put into force at the most critical juncture in the history of the nation. If any section, in the community endeavours to snatch from the hands of the constitutional advisers of the Crown and the representative Government of the people the reins of authority, it remains to be seen who shall govern the country. But that is- a question which can be settled when the necessity arises. It is an issue which, perhaps, cannot be evaded. But I hope that common sense and loyalty, not only loyalty to the Empire but loyalty to themselves, will inspire the citizens of the Commonwealth at this moment. I hope that no man, no matter what his private feelings may be, no matter how much he may oppose the proposals of the Government, will endeavour to take the law into his own hands. I appeal to every person in this country to have respect for the laws for which he or she, as the case may be, is responsible. In this Commonwealth the laws are made, not by some dictator, not by some despot, or by some narrow clique who have snatched to themselves by some means the power to govern the country, but the whole body politic. There is no man whose circumstances are so mean but that he has a vote equal to that of the most powerful and wealthy in the community. Therefore, to revolt against the Government in those circumstances is to revolt against themselves. The citizens of a free country make its laws, and if they make them they must abide by them. When they like those laws no longer let them repeal them in a proper and constitutional manner. That is the position, and upon it this Parliament may safely stand. We are not going into recess. We do not propose to enjoy a period of leisured inactivity, but are going to brave the storms of popular criticism and to speak to the people that which we believe to be right. If there is any man in this House who seeks to stop us, who seeks to debar the people from exercising the fundamental rights of citizenship, let him so declare himself, but unless he does so, he is bound by the principles of Democracy to welcome, and not retard, the motion to allow Parliament to get before the people. So I say the Government have nothing to apologize for. We cannot, and we ought not to, deviate from the course we have laid down. It is a course compatible with the gravity of the situation in which we find ourselves and with principles of government to which all parties in the country have given their adherence. I hope that in this coming campaign members on both sides will remember that they are citizens of a free country, and that they will come to the consideration of this, the gravest question that has ever been presented to the citizens of any Democracy, in a spirit of pure reasonableness. I know that I should waste my breath in urging that counsel upon all men, but I do urge it upon those men who are entitled to he called Democrats and who by their acts prove themselves worthy of the privileges of citizenship in a free country. If we do that, whatever the issue may be, we shall have no cause to reproach ourselves. Whether the country assents or dissents upon this question, we at any rate will have done our duty; but if we endeavour to silence reason by abuse, and to cloud the real question by a thousand and one side issues, and to distract public attention and fill the people&#39;s minds with  vague  and misleading ideas, then upon our head will be the responsibility. I, for one, am going to tell the people what I believe to be true and necessary. I have said over and over again that every member of the House has the opportunity to put his views before the public without fear and without favour. There is no restriction upon others, and there is none upon me. When we reassemble the issue will have been settled. Parliament will then have to meet the situation as it exists, and if we fight this battle honestly and fairly I do not think there is any one of us who will need reproach himself with the position as he then finds it, no matter what that position may be. </para>

                <para class="block">Minister has spoken, and will endeavour to reciprocate it. So far as concerns the referendum which is to be taken. on the 28th October, I think the position is quite clear. It is in the highest degree unfortunate that the Prime Minister was ever deluded into initiating a policy of violence in this country, a policy which rests upon the violent seizure of Australian citizens for military service abroad. He has done that, and I intensely regret it. I believe, with other honorable members, that the vast majority of the people in this Commonwealth will repudiate the proposals and reject the referendum by a negative vote. That, however, relates to something which is to occur on the 28th October. What I should like some information upon, and that is a point which the Prime Minister has skilfully evaded, is the proclamation which he says it is proposed to issue at an early date. That proclamation is to be issued under powers which were vested in the Government by a Defence Act for what is well known as home defence. And although there are persons in this chamber now who would have us believe that there is no distinction between home defence carried on in a foreign country and home defence in Australia, there is not one of them but knows well that the Defence Act in its present form would never have been passed if that vital distinction had not been insisted upon. </para>

                        <para>- It was raised and insisted upon by the Prime Minister himself times out of number. If the distinction had not been recognised the principle of compulsion in the Defence Act would never have been accepted. Nay, there is scarcely a public man who would not have been hooted off the platform if he had dared to say that conscription under the Defence Act included compulsion of Australian citizens to go 13,000 miles outside the Commonwealth to fight in a foreign country. I have addressed myself at sufficient length already to that aspect of the question. But I wish to know where the Prime Minister stands in regard to this proclamation. Under the Defence Act he has power to call up the citizens of Australia for home defence, and if Parliament is sitting the reasons for that drastic and extraordinary action must be put before the House immediately. If the House is not sitting, so urgent is the matter that members must be called from the four corners of the Commonwealth within ten days to hear the reasons why the proclamation is issued. The Government are under a legal obligation to put their reasons before the House, and that obligation they propose to evade. </para>

In regard to this vital matter, it is clearly of importance that the intention of the provision in the Act is that Parliament should be informed of the reasons, and have an opportunity of deliberating on them. The Prime Minister is not prepared to give those reasons, because he knows that by divulging them he would be put out of court and stand politically convicted of an illegal act; because the proposal is to call up these men for home service, and not for the defence of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to be disturbed in the least by the violent jingoism of the honorable member. I urge that the importance of this point cannot be over-estimated. The Prime Minister does not wish to submit these reasons to the House, because they will not bear examination. If some special set of circumstances had arisen in Australia, if a state of war within the confines of the Commonwealth of Australia was threatened or impending, or if some special emergency was arising, the Prime Minister would have the right and the. power to exercise this extraordinary authority; but on the platform and in the House he has already stated that the object of exercising this special power, which was given to him for defence within Australia, is to yard men for the purpose of sending them outside Australia if, unfortunately, the people of Australia should give him the authority to do so. My belief is that the proposed proclamation is wholly illegal. It is said that the Governor-General may, in time of war; issue such a proclamation. What is the definition of war? As defined in the Defence Act it is - </para>

                        <para>- If there is to be an apprehended attack on the Commonwealth on a date which has been carefully fixed by the Government a month in advance, namely the 1st October, has there been no attack apprehended within the last two years ? Is our danger of an attack on Australia greater to-day than it was when the legions of the Kaiser were rushing on to Paris; is our danger of attack greater than when the German armies were said to be triumphant on every front; or is it not a fact that the danger, so far as Australia is concerned, will be on this fixed date immeasurably less than it has been on many dates in the last two years? The Prime Minister has left the chamber without giving us any explanation of his proposed illegal act, as I conceive it to be. He has urged the people to a condition of mind of sweet reasonableness in regard to the whole thing, though he has initiated a policy which, as to the referendum, was conceived in violence and is proposed to be carried out in violence, and, as to the proclamation, proposes to throw the whole of the Commonwealth into a condition of chaos and confusion. The Prime Minister proposes to withdraw men from their occupations, and to throw industry and production into confusion. He proposes to bustle into camp a body of men, hundreds of whom will be physically unfit, and hundreds of whom will be exempted in other ways, and allow them to wait there while leisurely tribunals will determine whether they are fit to serve or not. I have never heard a more impracticable policy than that which was put before the House by the Prime Minister this afternoon in so airy a fashion. He asks us to accept it with sweet reasonableness. It is the very antithesis of sweet reasonableness, and, from its nature, will lead to confusion, chaos, and loss, and is bound to end in disaster. </para>

According to the honorable member, every kind of evil under the sun is going to come upon us if we simply ask the young manhood of Australia to stand up to their duty like men in this time of national crisis. The young men of Australia are not the craven things he tries to picture them. They will stand up to their duty. </para>

There will be no chaos and no violence if the honorable member does not encourage it or incite it. The Prime Minister has made a careful and calm appeal to reason in this matter. I hope the debate will be conducted in that spirit. I have risen for one purpose only, and it is to deny utterly - and prove it - that the genesis of our defensive preparations had no reference to trouble overseas. The honorable member made the statement, with all the fervour of which he is capable, that the Bills establishing the Navy and the Australian land Forces would never have passed if there had been any suspicion that the Forces so created were for use overseas.I happen to have in my hand my second-reading speech when Iwasintroducing the Bill for the compulsory training of the young men of Australia; and this is what was said - </para>

It is too late to-day to begin this talk that all our Australian war preparations have been for the defence of our own miserable skins here. That was never the intention of those preparations. On the contrary, the very genius of them, as well as the genesis of them, was for a quite different purpose. The training of the Navy was all to be standardized; the training of the land Forces was all to be standardized - man for man, gun for gun, and organization for organization.The whole of our Forces was prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to be fitted in with the Imperial Army at any time, and in any place, and in any circumstances in which the Army was called for in the defence of the Empire.

                <para>Just now neither law nor Constitution stands in the way. The Prime Minister distinctly told us the other day something which he had previously and repeatedly denied, namely, that the needs of the nation were supreme, and all else subordinate. However, as I say, I shall not discuss the legal points. The question, in my mind, is that, so far as the spirit of the Act is concerned, it was fully intended that Parliament should be able to consider the reasons for any proclamation, and its terms. I shall not raise the question whether the Prime Minister is right or wrong in his interpretation or action ; but no one can read the Act without seeing that what I have said is distinctly its spirit. </para>

                        <para>- It is very evident, irrespective of the merits of the case. If it be that, as the Prime Minister now says, nobody can be sure, the Lord knows, we may be called up ourselves! The Prime Minister told us that no man should take the law into his own hands, but that we ought to appeal to the Democracy. Why not? Why did he not think of it before ? For two years I have been asking that the voice of Democracy should be heard in this country. Before we go out to the fight. I wish to draw attention to the fact that, on the platform of the Government, there was one principle to which they were pledged at the last election. This Government came back from the country, backed by the electors, pledged to give the people an opportunity to vote, by referendum, on a question on which the Government were definitely committed; but the Government refused to allow the people to vote on that question, although now they are driving them to vote on another, which was not then contemplated. We are face to face with the fact that Democracy has no voice now - that Democracy has no power - and that the laws and conditions under which we exist to-day are for the most part laws and conditions of which we had no idea at the last election. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour party did reach its Sedan; but I also prophesied that it would come back with a greater majority than ever, and it did. When the Government did come back, they were free to use the power which the people had given them ; but that power was not used in the manner promised, though it is being used in a manner the people never expected. The Prime Minister came down this afternoon and addressed us in a most excellent manner, cooing in sucking-dove tones, and I shall reciprocate his kindly attitude. But honorable members must have noticed the change in the right honorable gentleman. What Christian influence has been at work to bring about this change in our dear friend? He told us that we are all equal before the law, and that one man&#39;s vote is equal to another man&#39;s vote. That is all right if a man gets a vote. However, I know there is no election for me next year, and I am happy. According to the Prime Minister, there will be no abuse - nothing but argument and appeal to reason; and I hope honorable members note the fact. So far as. I am concerned, no man shall be able to say that, during the campaign, I have uttered one word of personal abuse. There was a time, I admit, when that was part of my vocabulary. Like the honorable member for Balaclava, I was brought up in a school where it was supposed to be an essential part of the curriculum. Now, however, I am beginning to think that such methods do neither oneself nor one&#39;s cause any good. If a man is fighting a righteous cause, he has no need to descend into the gutter of abuse, but may rely upon his arguments and the facts as he sees them. </para>

                <para class="block">At the start of this Parliament, when I, together with the honorable member for Ballarat, was expressing opinions which have since proved to be largely correct, but which were hostile to. the . members on this side, who does not remember how the Prime Minister, when he felt himself strong and buttressed, not only by the support of the Opposition, but by the support of men on this side, spoke? Did the right honorable gentleman not travel up and down the country referring, in the most opprobrious terms, to men who, a little minority, held views identical with mine? Who were the &#34;.parasites&#34; and &#34;devils&#34; to be cast out? The Prime Minister, who now talks of loyalty, with no appeal to violence, and of all men being subject to the law, when he thought he could handle the organizations, urged them to fall with the ferocity of Bengal tigers on men who held views akin to myself. He went to England and came back to find that, in the meantime, rightly or wrongly, and for good or evil, there had grown up in this country a vast opinion which was not prepared to follow him. The Prime Minister was the first man in this campaign to resort to vituperation, and he has brought strong language upon himself. </para>

                        <para>. - Early this week the electrical mechanics of the Postal Department obtained from the Arbitration Court an alteration of their award, but before it can operate it must lie on the table of this House for a certain time. The Postmaster-General assures me, however, that the necessary documents have not come from the Court. This is hard on men who had to wait some time before they could get to the Court. They will not now, be able to benefit by the award until after Parliament has re-assembled. It seems a pity that some effort . was not made to give these men their rights earlier. . Just as the . House was adjourning some time back, papers regarding another award were laid on the table. 1 understand that the original award applying to the . postal mechanics did not sufficiently emphasize the payments to certain sections, who were unable to get what they should . have got. The award has been, altered . to. give them their due, and . it is unfair that they cannot benefit by the -alterations -because -the necessary papers have not been laid on the table. Some of . those who are hurt by this delay maybe &#39;inclined to think that the Ministry is taking -advantage of the adjournment. It is the duty of Ministers to see that awards . are placed on the table as soon as &#39;possible, in order -that those affected -may ; get -their rights. </para>

                    <para>Mr.FINLAYSON(Brisbane) &#91;4,.38&#93;.- I have had a good deal to say of late about the censorship of &#39;the press;but the Prime Minister has now given us a clear, unequivocal, and plain statement of the restrictions that will be enforced during the referendum -campaign. If the campaign is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be conducted with fair arguments, and an appeal is to be made &#34;to reason, nothing should be done -while Parliament is adjourned to impose other restrictions. I am : most anxious to avoid trouble during -the . campaign. . There ; are present all the elements conducive to &#39;.serious strife and division, which may -be provoked of the Prime Minister resorts again to the censorship - . of the press -and the interference with free speech that has been so much , in evidence &#39; of late. &#39; I appeal : to &#39;the Treasurer . on this matter. A large section of : the community looks to him and &#39;to some of his <inline font-style="italic">confreres</inline> in the Cabinet to -see -that those who -are opposing the Government&#39;s proposals get a fair deal during the campaign. If there is a reimposition of restrictions on &#39;free speech and publication, whatever trouble may develop will be at the door of &#39;the.Erime Minister and this &#39;Cabinet. </para>

                        <para>. -&#39;Iagain appeal to the Treasurer -to get the Government to -do their utmost to end &#39;the sugar crisis in Queensland. &#34;The case was ably presented yesterday by the honorable members for Wide Bay and Darling &#39;Downs, both of whom are authorities on the subject about which they spoke. and understand it thoroughly. The honorable member for Wide Bay, to my &#39;knowledge, has ; been associated commercially &#39;with the sugar industry for &#39;forty years, and -to-day represents in this -Parliament the -bulk of the sugar growers of Southern Queensland.&#34; If information beyond that contained in the -speeches of those honorable -members is -required, it is to be . found in -an informative article published in yesterday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> The existence of the sugar industry &#39;is now at stake. I &#39;have here -a telegram from a man who says that -every day that passes means ruinous loss -to &#39;the Commonwealth and to -the community generally, owing to the sugar crop deteriorating. It is hardly fair to put the blame altogether on the &#39;Queensland &#39;Governmeritthat blame must &#39;be shared by it &#39;with the Federal Government. </para>

                            <para>- Had it not -been for the continual interference with the industry by this -Government, &#39;it would -not be in its present -position. All we ask is to -be treated as the Prime Minister has promised to treat the butter industry. The -butter -producers were very much harassed and injured : by the interference of the Commonwealth and State Governments; but yesterday, in reply to a &#39;deputation, the Prime &#39;Minister- &#39;showed that a ray of common sense had penetrated, and promised that the embargo on the export of butter would be removed on the assurance being given to &#39;him &#39;that the &#34;price charged to Australian -consumers would be on a parity with the London price. That -assurance was immediately given. Those interested in the sugar industry desire a &#39;similarly fair deal. This Government is making a profit out of the Queensland -sugar, as the Treasurer -has admitted. He has told us in his financial statement that as it -will be . necessary to again import -foreign sugar to make up a deficiency in the Australian production, a &#39;loss -of even more than &#163;2 -&#39;a -ton may have to be met out of the profits from the- sale -df Australian-grown sugar. I -did -not know that this -&#39;Government  was to play the part :  of the middleman. Honorable &#39;members opposite &#39;have always declared themselves in &#39;favour of the abolition of the middleman and his profits wherever possible. </para>

                            <para>- The Treasurer admits that it is making a profit from Australian sugar which it is using to cover a loss on the importation of foreign sugar, grown mostly with black, labour. The honorable gentleman has expressed the willingness of the Government that the Inter-State Commission should- inquire into the matter, provided that the agreements between the Commonwealth and Queensland Government, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Millaquin Company are not brought under review. Why tie the hands, of the Inter-State Commission? Why not- let the Commissioners inquire into every phase, of the question? They are able men, and can be trusted tq do their work properly. The fate of the sugar industry in Queensland is at stake. It has had a most potent influence on the settlement of the coastal districts of the State, and we need settlers. The Prime Minister said yesterday that the salvation of the country lies in men on the land. As far as my lights go, the Federal Government have the settlement of this question in their own hands, and in the interests of the industry and the people of Australia, it is their duty to deal with it at once. </para>

I notice that those persons are already preparing to evade that taxation, and to pass it on to the masses of the public. Unfortunately, the. great bulk of taxation in this country in the past has been passed on to the masses, and under the new proposals of the, Government, which I admit to be wise and sane,. I am afraid &#39;that the burden will be transferred to the general body of the public. I do not know whether the Treasurer intends to propose means by which this passing on. of taxation can be prevented. This matter has always presented a problem, and it will have to be solved- in some way, because the masses of the people cannot stand further burdens than they are bearing to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I have not a ready-made scheme to propound to-day, but I ask the Treasurer to take into serious- consideration the devising, of means to. prevent the evil of which I am complaining. Otherwise it seems to- me that it will be useless to pass new taxation measures; and, for my own part, unless I am assured that the great body of the people are not to have further burdens placed upon them-, I shall, not support some of the- proposals when the Treasurer introduces them. I hope that the Treasurer will make the meshes of his net so small that- those upon whom the. tax. is intended to fall shall not escape. </para>

                    <para>Another- matter to which I wish to call attention is the peculiar position of some men who are in the service of the Commonwealth. An order was issued by the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisher)</inline> that no promotions or appointments were to be made in the Public Service- during the- term of the- war. On the face of it that instruction appears very fair, because we do- not wish to penalize those public servants who have gone to the front. As far as is possible, the positions and promotions of those men must be protected. But we have a large body of men, particularly among telephone mechanics and others associated with postal work, who, though qualified for permanent appointment, do not know what day their services will be dispensed with. They have gone to considerable expense in qualifying themselves, and are- still attending technical schools, and to-day they are asking whether they are to continue doing this, to be- told later that their services are no longer required. Something should&#39; be done to give them a sense of security and permanence- in regard to their position. They may be preparing themselves for positions that will never be open to them, and then they will be obliged to start life afresh in a new sphere. They are ih an unfortunate position, and ought to be reassured by the Postmaster-General at the earliest possible date. </para>
                    <para>In addressing the Chamber on the Referendum Bill, I expressed the hope that in the coming campaign a fair deal will be meted out to every man who takes the platform. Whether a man is a conscriptionist or an anti-conscriptionist, he should receive the same treatment from the press, in order that the people may arrive at a fair decision on the all-important question of compulsory service. The press will be acting unfairly to the people if they do not report at least some of the chief speakers on the anti-conscription side. Often it is the cutting down of speeches, and the consequent misrepresentation in the press, that irritates a large number of men, and makes them feel that they are not receiving that fair treatment which is essential in dealing, with a question like this. I should have liked to have seen the arguments for and against conscription published at equal length in a manifesto to the people, and if that had been done I doubt very much whether it would have been necessary for members of Parliament to take the platform in order to educate the people on the subject. It would have been a good thing if we could have refrained from platform controversy. Unfortunately, that is not possible, and the duty devolves upon all of us to endeavour to impress our convictions upon the public. In doing that I hope that we shall all so comport ourselves on the platform that, after the decision is given, we may return to our places with the feeling that we have done nothing to be ashamed of. We shall have done our best, and, whatever the verdict is, it will be for us as a Parliament to honour and abide by it. </para>

                        <para>.- I indorse the wish of the honorable member for Maribyrnong that the referendum campaign shall be conducted with that calm deliberation and thorough exposition of both sides of the question that ought to characterize every referendum. I wish to bring under the notice of the Treasurer a matter of much importance to the farmers. Producers have been under a considerable disability of late years owing to the high prices ruling for bags, and it seems to me that steps might be taken to permit of the use of the secondhand article. I believe that it would be possible to treat bags chemically, so as to render their use a second time perfectly safe. If the Treasurer will ask the Minister for Customs to look into this matter, it may be found possible, notwithstanding an answer to the contrary given by the Prime Minister to the honorable member for Calare, to do something in the direction suggested, and so give considerable relief to a number of producers. </para>

                        <para>.- I would urge upon the Treasurer the importance of taking decisive and immediate action with regard to the sugar crisis. The trouble has been dragging on for over five weeks, and the Treasurer must know what a loss is involved to the growers and the Commonwealth as a whole. Only a few days ago I noticed that at one mill 400 tons of cane had absolutely gone to waste. That cane would represent at least &#163;500 to the growers. I urge the Minister to submit the question to the Inter-State Commission. </para>

However, some action must be taken, and if the Treasurer is not prepared to adopt that course, I hope he will decide upon some other immediately. Otherwise we shall have a sugar famine in Australia. -It is beginning to look as if there is some dilatoriness on the part of somebody in dealing with this matter. I do not know what is in the mind of the Minister in stipulating that the present agreements between the Government and the Commonwealth, the Government of Queensland, and the companies shall not come under review; but, whatever the objection is, I hope the Minister will proceed immediately with the reference of this question to the Inter-State Commission. It is useless saying that the Government cannot do anything. They can do something, and they must do it, or Australia will be faced with a crisis that will land it in serious difficulty and financial loss, as well .as in the loss of one of the necessaries of life. Therefore, I urge expedition in regard to the matter. I hope that the Minister will not listen to any side issue, hut will go straight on, even if he does the wrong thing. </para>

                            <para>- That is all I wish to say on the point. &#39;Finally, I offer my protest to conscription as we will have it under the proclamation to be issued on Monday. As the Prime Minister told us to-day, the provision has been on the statute-book for fifteen years, and it could have been utilized for calling up men for the defence of Australia for home service; but the assumption on which they are to be called up on Monday next is that, if the referendum vote is cast in a certain way, they are to be used for service abroad, and there is no essential difference between that method and calling up men for compulsory service outside the Commonwealth. Men will be called up in a way that is quite antagonistic to the democratic principles of the people of this country, and yet it is being done in the name of Democracy. We have had several dissertations from the Prime Minister, in which he used that glorious word &#34;Democracy,&#34; but next month we shall be engaged in a campaign in regard to a matter that violates every principle of Democracy. We are going to ask the people to vote on a matter which affects a section only, and which does not concern a great many of those who will go to the ballot-box. It -will affect the democratic spirit in another way, because if what has taken place so far can be taken as a guide there will be only one side in this great issue that will be able to put its case in an unhampered manner. </para>

                            <para>- As a final word in regard to the proclamation on Monday, I wish to draw attention to the ruin and sadness most disastrous floods have brought to many Victorian, homes during the last few days. Many of the young men whose services will be required in the direction of repairing a great deal of the ruin that has been occasioned will have to present themselves to the military authorities on Monday ; and, owing to the number of Courts,, tribunals, and places of appeal that they will have to pass through, the war will possibly be over before they can get away again; because, if we are to be guided by the prediction of the Prime Minister, the war will be over by June next. I have already received letters asking me whether young fellows will have to present themselves on Monday next, and I know that there, is sadness in some of their homes, because, besides sustaining damage to their property, they have lost relatives through the floods. In addition to the injustice of the matter, their positions will be rendered very much worse by their having to present themselves to the military authorities at this particular time-. As a final word, I protest against this most undemocratic thing which is- being done in the name of Democracy.. </para>

                        <para>&#39;.- I would not have- risen had- it not been for some words that fell from- the- lips&#39; of the Treasurer. There must be some misapprehension. We were given to understand, in the financial statement, that the Treasurer was prepared to grant an inquiry into the sugar industry by the Inter-State Commission,, provided certain matters, would not be insisted on. These matters, will not be insisted on- if the Treasurer, will: only proceed with the inquiry at once. The honorable member has asked the honorable member for Moreton whether the mill-owners and the cane-growers will consent to this arrangement. I have in my possession telegrams from the United Cane-growers Association and the Sugar-millers Association, stating that they are prepared to accept the appointment of the Inter-State Commission to hold this inquiry. There remains the third party - the labour employed. I do not see how the Treasurer can be sincere in asking any honorable member what the labourer wants. It is the cane-grower and the sugar-miller who have to provide the means for paying- for the labour. The labourer need- not work unless he gets the pay that he wants. The two parties who are interested in this question are the sugar-growers and- the mill-owners, and&#39;, as they have given their consent, I hope that the Treasurer will not delay this all-important matter, and that he will allow the crop to be taken off. </para>

                        <para>.- To paraphrase an old saying of the Romans, &#34;We who are about to&#34; die salute you,&#34; I say to the Treasurer, &#34; Those who are now about to die through the closing of the sittings of the House are going to beat you on the 28th October.&#34; In letters written to me, some of the soldiers at the front have discussed the question of the referendum. I know that they will not vote to compel their fellow men to be slaves instead of free men-. I have inquired from twelve mothers who have sons at the front. They have- visited- my office-, and I have not sought to change their opinions; but out of the twelve- of them, eleven intend to vote against conscription. The twelfth one perfectly justly said, &#34;I am going to vote to send- them to help my boy.&#34; Farther I have had a talk- to many soldiers, and I can say confidently that the- Prime Minister will get the surprise of his life when he- sees how some of the soldiers vote. I hardly know whether to congratulate or condole with- the representative of the Government here; but, if reports be true, the Government have- already felt the shadow of defeat in another- place. It has been decided, in the wisdom of the Chamber, as against the Government, to sit next Tuesday.. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I should, like to see, because, by means of a question here, you can get that justice which is impossible, by correspondence or interviews. The treatment of the soldiers in withholding their pay will also cause them to vote, against conscription.. These men are waiting for their money,, because their records have not been sent from the front; and, in the. meantime those who are unable to work have to beg for food in the streets of Melbourne. I must compliment the honorable member for Bourke on the fact that he was quite right when, in the early part of this session, he declared that the- Government, under the War . Precautions <inline font-style="italic">Act;</inline> had full power- to control prices. This was contradicted by the Prime Minister and&#39; other members of the- Government; and. on. their assurance I thought the honorable member for Bourke was wrong; and on that account I now tender the honorable member an apology. The &#39;Government now tell us that, under that Act, they have power to do anything, even to taking any man&#39;s liberty away. I should now like to touch on the infamy and injustice of the censorship.I have -here a number of sketches, which, though not half as bad . as some that appeared an the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> have -been censored in .

                    <para class="block">The freedom of our Australia, and the ease with which we occupy these benches, have caused dry-rot in the great Labour party. There is not the big fighting phalanx in the Commonwealth Labour party in this House that there is in the State House of Victoria, where they know how to fight. But I sincerely hope that an election will come, when we may present ourselves to the people who sent us here. I hope that we shall come back with a number of younger men to take up the work of us veterans, with all the fighting pluck that has been shown in the past. If the split and break comes, as I can see plainly it will, it may damage us for a little while; but we must remember that the man who scored the highest number of votes in Australia at a Commonwealth election, and who sought to break up the Labour party in Victoria, is now in political oblivion. If the path of the Prime Minister be directed to England, he will never come . back, though God knows many hearts would not pray for his happy return. If he does go, I do not know any man who could do more good there. It is possible that he might bring about some reform in the Conservative ranks, so that the 16,000,000 people who, up to the present, are disfranchised, may find themselves in the possession of votes, and cause the abolition of the odious system of entail, so that the . wealth of the country may decently contribute to the common weal of Great Britain and Ireland. But he wants to print the brand of slave upon every Australian, and force him to fight. Even in our school days, a boy who would not fight was not compelled to do so. Others might step into his place. I have every appreciation of the efforts of my fellow countrymen, who were sacrificed like cattle at Gallipoli because of the ineptitude and inability of leaders and generals. For a month or two the fleet was firing at the forts, giving the Turks notice to prepare for an attack, and yet they were not provided with sufficient men when they did attack. That brutal descendant of the traitor Marlborough, who starved his soldiers to put money into his pocket and took bribes from the King of France - Winston Churchill - has dared to say that the winning of the Dardenelles was a sporting chance. Why did not the cur go himself ? I hope to see him impeached for taking a sporting chance with human life. He tried to lull the men of the British Cabinet into a false security, which might have brought about the loss of the British Fleet. My reading of history, the knowledge I have garnered from those older than myself, the lessons I have learned from my teachers, tell me that never in the history of the world has a people put conscription upon itself by popular vote. Does any one think that if they were not compelled by conscription, the Germans would be fighting for l&#163;d. a day ? Would the German Emperor have been able to make this war had not conscription provided him with millions of soldiers ? Would France, which has led the world in the arts and sciences, find men to fight, if it were not for conscription ? Would not they rather be tilling the fields- of their beloved country ? So with Italy and with Russia. It is not men who are wanted at the front. Any one with a knowledge of war will tell you that it is big artillery that is wanted. The war will be won, not by men, but by the blasting power of heavy ordnance. On the word of one who has been in three revolutions, and who has seen two Presidents elected, a consul now living in Melbourne, I say that the Allies could blast their way to Berlin in two months if they had ten heavy pieces of ordnance to every one possessed by the enemy. Any one who says that I wish to buy Russians to fight for Australia is a liar. </para>
