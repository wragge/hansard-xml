Tribunals were also created for the management of such a fund. Is it the intention of the Government to continue to appeal for contributions in addition to the &#163;10,000,000 which is to be provided by direct taxation? </para>

                        <para>- As chairman of the Repatriation Trustees I have made a full statement of my views on this question. Shortly, the position is that donations for the Repatriation Fund, according to the amount, will be regarded as a set-off, or as a payment in full of the levy that is to be provided for. Donations to other patriotic funds may be deducted from incomes upon which income tax is levied. As bo the distribution of the money that has been contributed voluntarily, I am not able to say now to what extent that will be at the discretion of the local trustees, but their recommendations will be considered, and unless there are good and sufficient national reasons why effect should not be given to them, will be regarded as indications of the way in which the money should be dealt with. I cannot now declare more fully the policy of the Government in this matter, but after the referendum campaign the repatriation trustees will have an opportunity to consider the whole matter in the light of the new taxation proposals of the Government, and I shall then be in a position to state publicly the extent to which the local trustees may control and distribute funds raised voluntarily. </para>

Minister whether the attention of the Government has been directed to the two prevalent diseases in cattle in Queensland and Western Australia, namely, tick and nodules, which have resulted in a loss of &#163;250,000 annually to the Commonwealth; and whether he will request the Bureau of Science to investigate those diseases with the view to endeavouring to prevent their spread and ultimately eradicating them? </para>

                                <para>- I withdraw the remark. The document which the House has just ordered to be printed bears the signature of a German citizen of Brisbane, and appeared in the German newspaper printed in Brisbane in May, 1913, during the Federal election campaign of that year. The following is a translation of the article: - </para>

Under  Australian laws they have had every freedom and consideration, and with &#39;the generous assistance so willingly accorded them, many have prospered greatly, and all have been able to make comfortable homes for themselves. The opportunity to become naturalized citizens has been freely offered, and accepted by most Germans, thus giving them a share in the Government, and a voice in the making of the laws under which they have to live. </para>

Finlayson. He has made a splendid record during that time, and has always been ready and willing to assist and advise those who sought his help and counsel.

                            is a true Socialist, not an extremist or a syndicalist, but a genuine reformer, seeking to establish better conditions under these sunny skies than obtain in the older countries of the world. A national insurance scheme, which, in addition to pensions and maternity grant, will include sickness and unemployment benefits, on a taxation rather than a contributory basis, is receiving his earnest support, and in this respect he is right in line with the great and fast-growing socialistic movement in Germany.

I wish to say quite clearly that I make no apology, offer no excuse, and certainly withdraw nothing in regard to my action in distributing this circular in Brisbane during the li)l3 election.- The honorable member for Wentworth tries to make it appear that this circular is of recent issue - tries to make it appear that it is being used at the present time in order to secure German support against conscription. </para>

                        <para>- A little while ago, the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the States combined to make appeals for voluntary contributions throughout Australia for the purpose of the repatriation of our soldiers, and provided machinery for the purpose. Is it intended, in view of the proposal to raise  &#163;10,000,000  by taxation for that purpose, to continue the voluntary system ? Can the two systems run side by side? Further, is any provision intended to be made for the taxation of these men who have no accumulated wealth, but are in receipt of magnificent incomes ? </para>

                        <para>- The policy of the Government is to prevent the foreclosing of mortgages during the war, and this applies to all mortgages without respect to class or kind, legal or equitable. Further, it is our policy to prevent the increase of interest payable under mortgages ; and that, also, applies to all mortgages. As to a moratorium other than that, wherever, under any binding instrument, an obligation is thrown on a person, now or hereafter, who may be a citizen soldier, that binding obligation will be discharged, or, at any, rate, suspended, during the term of his absence from Australia. </para>

A man in a front trench in France cannot be expected to proceed about the business of voting in the orderly and leisured way of an elector who votes in a polling booth in Australia. Subject to that qualification, the ballot will be secret, and conducted in the usual way.

                        <para>- There is no intention of interfering with the voluntary appeal, because, although the Government have stated that it must have &#163;10,000,000 for repatriation purposes, every one who has looked fairly at the circumstances must realize that that amount will be very little should 200,000men come upon the fund. It would be most inexpedient to make a higher levy on wealth than that which we propose, because the effect would be felt by all persons in the community, irrespective of their circumstances. There are many, however, who can afford to give much more than they will be compelled to pay to the Government. For that reason we shall continue to ask the wealthy men of the community to give of their money, and those who have not money to give of their personal services. </para>

                    <para>.- I congratulate the Prime Minister on the introduction of a scheme of taxation which, while it does not suit the extremists of either side, will provide Australia with, the money that it requires, and is, subject to certain analysis, all that could be desired under the circumstances. There are phases of the proposals which will give rise to considerable discussion. To my mind, they require modification or alteration in certain directions. For instance, their incidence needs to be better defined. It is proposed to take all the war profits made by firms or companies which exceed 8 per cent, on their invested capital, an exemption of &#163;200 being allowed. No doubt that is a just proposition in regard to many well-established firms which have large sums safely invested, and which, in many cases, do not make more than 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, on their ordinary trading operations from year to year. But there are what may be called speculative businesses which those concerned in them, having risked money in other ways, will decline to keep going simply to make revenue for the Government. That attitude may be regarded as unpatriotic, but it would be essentially human. Thus we are risking the suspension of enterprise in many directions. </para>

                        <para>- I am not discussing military service; I am speaking of human nature. If some honorable members would read of the experiments that have been tried by other&#39; countries, they would be less desirous of trying them here. The past shows very clearly that anything in the nature of confiscation which makes it undesirable to pursue business leads to men who would otherwise be in business ceasing operations. Not many years ago, when Egypt was in a financial fix, the ruler Mahomet Ali imposed a tax on date palms. What was the result? The Egyptians cut down their date palms. I admit that it was a wrong thing to do, but it was a natural step for the people to take ; it was human nature. We must allow for human nature. We cannot compel a man to carry on his business if he is not inclined to do so. .The honorable member for Wide Bay gave us a case in point yesterday, when he told us that the Government were imposing conditions on the sugar-growers which, they say they cannot bear. </para>

                        <para>- There is no means by which we can compel men to till the land or work. Honorable members who have been loudest in their cries know very well that, when men are disinclined to accept the terms of employment that have been laid down, they do not work. In economic matters men have a perfect right to put a price on their labour, and if they do not wish to work they need not do so,. Many compromise schemes have been devised for the purpose of bringing refractory industrial elements together. My friend has endeavoured to draw me off the track by his reference .to compulsory military service. When the nation is in danger, and when all the conditions which we seek to impose in times of peace are challenged, it is due to every man in the community that he should do all that he can to &#34;down and out&#34; those who are challenging them. The greater includes the less. Some men cannot reason from small things to big things: The fact that those gentlemen who are raising a certain clamour are likely to lose all that they have held dear, and their right to voice their sentiments as freely as they choose, is sufficient reason, if they only had the sense to see it, for impelling them to do all they can to preserve that right, and not wait to be compelled to do it. The issues are so wide apart that there is no parallel between the case with which I was dealing and that of sending men to the war. Reverting now to the proposed taxation, I have no objection to taking war profits, but, as I have few worldly possessions, I am hardly as qualified to speak on the point as older men who have considerably more. It is easy enough to make laws for the other fellow, but what strikes me about the proposal is the fact that it will be self-destructive if it is not tempered in some way, particularly in regard to speculative businesses, such as mining, and more especially gold mining. . In gold mining men hope to secure some tremendous return, altogether out of proportion to the money they have invested - they may have been waiting many years for it - and if the law says that they are to lose that return, then they will not seek to win it. I do not know any law that will compel them to do so, though perhaps the Government could send an army to work the mines. There is one important matter I wish to deal with : Those who are controlling the affairs of this country, in view of the crisis through which we are now passing, should be men of one mind? It is an anomaly that we find them divided, among themselves. Some gentlemen associated with the Cabinet are simply taking cover until the storm blows over, playing the part of camp followers until the battle is done, when, presumably, like other camp followers, they will seek the spoils. I am distinctly opposed to such Conduct. In the present crisis, no persons should shelter behind the situation and stick to the position that happy chance has given them, until the trouble blows over. Their attitude is unmanly; their position is absurd; and, worst of all, their conduct is subversive of good government. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want office. I am not looking for it. If it were offered to me. I would not accept it. The Government know me well enough to know that I would not. I have turned things down before, and I can turn them down now. I repeat that the conduct of these gentlemen is subversive of good government. Those who are charged with tremendous responsibilities should .be unanimous in the interest of the country in seeing that those responsibilities are discharged with the very best possible effect. How it can be done when Ministers are not pulling together, I do not know. Perhaps we shall see something later. I consider that there should be a national Government at such a time as this. If there is to be no party, then let there be no party, and let the affairs of the Commonwealth be in the hands of all parties, with representative men of all parties taking their share, so that, once and for all, factious fighting may cease until the greater enemy is disposed of. Then, if necessary, we can revert to the economic strife which has so distinguished Australia in the past. The proposal of the honorable member for  Hunter  to meet the financial necessities of the times by taking from every man everything he earns above &#163;400 is further evidence of that primitive predatory instinct from which most men suffer more or less, and is but a degree removed from the proposal many advance to take everything in  the  form of accumulated wealth and divide it among the community. Such crude solutions of economic difficulties were exploded years ago. </para>

                        <para>- I refer the honorable member to the history of Paraguay. While the limit of &#163;400 a year seems all right, and will no doubt tickle the ears of some of the constituents of honorable members on this side of the chamber, it will &#34; cut no ice,&#34; because one of its first effects would be that those who are spending considerable accumulations of wealth would cease to spend, and many of those who are dependent entirely on those who have wealth would no longer participate in that wealth - because it would all be gone. Many big business establishments which are maintained by the well-to-do would not longer be able to keep their hands, or sell the finery, and all the rest of the little make-believes of modern life. I realize that what I am saying is liable to gross misconstruction by many of my fellow members. No one more than myself agrees with the dictum that the disproportionate distribution of wealth is unfair and hard, but I fail to see how legislation of this kind will secure a better distribution of it. On the other hand, it will assuredly shut up the channels &#39; through which it flows. For instance, the war-time profits tax which the Government propose will stop people from making profits as much as they can - in fact, in many quarters it will stop profits entirely. Those honorable members who think that they know everything will say, &#34; Let the Government control these sources of wealth, and take full charge.&#34;  I would like to see some of the gentlemen who talk in this way in charge of some of the modern concerns that require years of training, and not only special knowledge, but also certain qualities of character which those who are loudest in their clamour do not possess. In Australia there is more wealth  unproduced  than has ever yet been produced, and only proper combination and intelligent co-operation are needed to produce it. Nothing on earth could stop the malcontents from creating all the wealth that they require. They can clear the land, till their fields, and reap their harvests, and no one will say them nay. But they have not the initiative or capacity to do so. In the circumstances, how can they expect those who have initiative and capacity to act the part of benefactors ? It is more than human nature is capable of, or would consent to, to expect it. If I thought that we could &#34;lick&#34; society into shape by legislation, and give every man the full reward of his labour, I would say, &#34; Do it,&#34; but I know very well that it cannot be done in that way. What is necessary is opportunity more than anything else, and I am all the time with reform that will provide that opportunity. Let us tax the land, so that it will be unprofitable to hold it idle. I believe in providing the freest possible opportunity. But when opportunities do exist, as we know they do in this country, we cannot get men to pull together to work out their own salvation harmoniously, each helping the other. They will not do it. They say, &#34;Make the other fellow fork out.&#34; The accumulation of wealth in the hands of those who have made it by fair means or foul is not nearly as great as that which could be earned by the intelligent co-operation on the part of those who have not any wealth if they would only work together. But at this stage of human development they simply cannot do it; and until individual regeneration takes place, it is useless to seek by legislation to make &#34; everything in the garden lovely.&#34; The confiscation that I have heard spoken of would mean the cessation of industrial, commercial, and many other classes of undertakings. Those gentlemen who propose it say, &#34; Let us substitute our own men to run the concerns.&#34; But where are we to get men with the necessary qualifications? Men in my own constituency have said to me, &#34;You are all right, only you ought to be kicked over the border into the nationalization of the means of production, distribution, and exchange.&#34; But what could I do then? Who would run everything? What man could comprehend all the ramifications of modern social conditions and their economic aspect ? &#34; Oh,&#34; my friends say, &#34; that is for you to do ; &#34; but I reply, &#34; The job is too big for me ; it can&#39;t be done.&#34; The honorable member for Dampier said, amongst other things, that there was no country in which such animosity existed between employer and employed as Australia ; and I am sorry to say there is a great deal of truth in the statement. I attribute this largely to the fact, that the industrial community here is in a transition stage. They have that &#34;little knowledge&#34; which is a &#34;dangerous thing.&#34; They see &#34;as through a glass darkly&#34; - and that is why there is such discontent, such endless striving to extract more and more from those whom they would make their unwilling benefactors and always treat as their natural enemies. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I accepted the platform, and when it is sought to alter that platform I resent the attempt. I made a contract with the people, and I refuse to vary that contract. Those who are now opposed to me have taken, as it were, a cheque from me for &#163;100, and, having added a nought, they tell me that it is my cheque, and that I must honour it. I do not intend to stand that sort of thing. Those who do may bark as much as they like, but I take my stand on another plane, and I shall have nothing to retract when I go before my electors. The honorable member for Maribyrnong dealt particularly with the arsenal question. I have no objection to the establishment of an arsenal, but my point is that more attention should have been paid to the Munitions Factory that already existed. In the past I have dwelt at some length on the unjust conditions imposed on the town of Lithgow, particularly in reference to the Small Arms Factory there. This Government, to its shame, have exacted from that town all the co-operation that the law-abiding citizens could give. Those citizens have been induced to house 500 or 600 more people than the town can naturally accommodate, and then the edict has gone forth from an ill-advised Public Works Committee that the factory is to be removed to Canberra. No effort is made to accommodate those extra hands, which are an incubus on the people, and for whom the people did all they could in the interests of their country. Even to-day the congestion in Lithgow is terrible, and the effect, .in deterring people from building, and in the creation of unhealthy conditions, is very badly felt. Before we talk about an arsenal; and fiddle with new schemes, let us put our house in order. If we are sending extra machinery to Lithgow, let us house properly, not only that machinery, but the people who have to work it. The first (consideration of a Labour Government should be the accommodation of employees; if there is one thing they should be concerned about it is the provision of proper living conditions. The herding together of people, with narrow back yards and other insanitary surroundings, is more fruitful of social evils than anything else. Yet we find such conditions amongst those who, at this vital juncture, are contributing most important aid to ourselves&#39; and our Allies. It is high time the Government woke up. On every occasion that I ask a question about this matter, I am told that it is being inquired into, or that progress is being made; but nothing is done, and the shadow continues to hang over the town, which has done more than its duty by the Government and the country. Nothing can be done, because the Government are going to move the factory. I promised the Government that I would never cease harrying them on this question, and I never shall until something is done; and if for nothing else, I hope to see a change of Government which shall lead to the intellectual guidance of the affairs of the country at this particular time. Nothing could be worse than to threaten an industry that is absolutely essential to us, and at the same time send more machinery, and call upon it for an increased output. It is high time we had a change. The honorable member for Dampier referred to another aspect of the situation when he referred to the company laws now obtaining here. Under the War Precautions Act a limitation has been placed on the promotion of companies, and on the enterprise of the people, to an extent that, in my opinion, is too great. With the honorable member for Dampier, I realize that the Government are on dangerous ground when they undertake to find out whether the venture will be profitable or not. I recognise the difficulty there; but I think the Government, when they get reliable reports from accredited men could, at least, encourage development, more particularly in the production of gold, which is the one commodity we require above all. I have been drawn into some of these matters, and I have been surprised at the attitude of the Treasurer on the question. Amongst other things, when I endeavoured to secure certain rights for certain people, and suggested that the money to be raised should be put into the war loan first of all - allowing the financing to be done on the bonds, and thus giving the Government at least something - I waa told that it was not a question of war&#34; loan, but of protecting the investor. It &#39; waa useless for me to point out that, so far as I knew, the investor was well able to take care of himself. There was no attempt to approach the general public. Those who were participating in certain ventures, finding all the money and supplying the necessary data, were prepared, as moneyed men, to risk the loss themselves, and give the Government the benefit of all the capital that was raised for the ventures; and yet we were told that that could not be done. When the interested parties are prepared to stand any loss, and when all that can be ascertained as to the ventures is of a favorable nature, when they are supported by men of undoubted stability and credentials, the Government, by a teo harsh handling, of the situation, are only losing the chance to increase the circulation of wealth. I hope that something will be done, particularly in regard to gold-mining, for personally I wish to -see the country get all that is required. I Have no hesitation in saying that if the Government and the country require everything I possess they are welcome to it in this hour of trial; and I think that is the view of every decent citizen in Australia to-day. For that reason, I believe the proposals of the Government will be accepted by the people, though, &#39; of course, there would still be dissatisfied extremists. There are those, amongst others, who have been making their own circulation, and, on the other hand, there are, probably, moneybags, who will have their objections. The man who hoards his money, and not the man who spends it, is the menace. The man who is enterprising, who employs and co-operates with others, is doing good in thus keeping the wheels of industry moving ; but the man who, as some have done, locks up his gold in the safe deposits of the country, is a menace, and must needs be dealt with in order that his wealth may be utilized. I do not say that such money should be confiscated, but the owner should, at least, be made to contribute the whole to the loan fund. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened yesterday with a great deal of interest to the statement by the Treasurer. While his figures indicating increased taxation in many directions are simply staggering, I am of opinion that the people of Australia were prepared for a very heavy increase of burdens in order that the war might be prosecuted to a successful issue. They regard that issue as of such vital importance to this country, and indeed to all civilization, that however great the price of success may be, the result will be worth it all. I believe that the people who will be called upon under these proposals to pay a larger portion of war taxation will do so cheerfully, but those burdens are of such a gigantic character that the taxpayers will insist that there should be, on the part of the National and State Governments, a wise, discreet, but nevertheless considerable economy in every direction. I regret to say that there are no evidences of such economy in connexion with either the National Government or any State Government. On the civil side of our activities we are looking  extravagantly  at the future, whereas we ought to be setting our financial house in order; and wherever economy and retrenchment are possible we should recognise the extreme necessity for practising it. I do not advocate such economy as means stopping a great part of the public works of the country, and I do not advocate a retrenchment such as would mean putting men out of work and filling the streets with unemployed; but there is room for considerable economy in connexion with all the Governments of Australia, possibly running into millions of pounds a year, without destroying efficiency and creating an army of unemployed. We should remember that, particularly in big centres, we are experiencing a boom time, because of the expenditure by the Defence Department. Last year upwards of &#163;40,000,000 of loan money was expended for war purposes, a large proportion of it in the Commonwealth. The war provision made by the Treasurer this year represents an increase of 70 or 80 per cent, on last year&#39;s figures.  In  the cities we have had a distribution of millions of &#39;pounds of borrowed money, not only such as we have never known before, but such as was never dreamed of before. Those millions of pounds expended by the Defence Department ought to assist us very considerably in providing work for everybody, and ought to enable us to cut down the civil expenditure from both revenue and loan. Yet we are providing for expenditure on the civil side from revenue and loan money at a rate in excess of any previous expenditure. In my opinion, this Parliament has not the grip on the public expenditure that it ought to have, and what is true of this Parliament is true of all the State Parliaments. </para>

                        <para>- There ought to be a considerable reduction of the expenditure throughout the Commonwealth, but particularly for public works which are not an immediate necessity, and which do not show any real prospect of returning .interest on the money borrowed. For many of these public works the State Governments, through the influence of the National Government, are appealing to the Mother Country for money, and such appeals at this time of supreme crisis for the Empire, simply mean that these Governments are living on the Imperial authorities, whom they should be doing everything in their power to assist, instead of increasing the crushing burdens placed upon them. In Federal expenditure there is room for very considerable economy, because we are not only undertaking expenditure in regard to works which are not immediately necessary, but we are not controlling that expenditure, and securing economy as we ought to_ do it. Several big works are being carried on by the Federal Government, and I desire to refer briefly to the present position of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway. Honorable members know that ever since the commencement) of the construction of that line, I have tried in this House in vain to get a proper business statement placed before us, showing the progress of the work, its cost, whether it was being carried out within the estimate, and if the estimates were being exceeded, how, and to what extent. I have repeatedly asked that Parliament should be informed what the KalgoorliePort Augusta railway would cost when finally completed, but the giving of the information has always been deferred. We have had no&#39; business statement of a tangible character put before us, and it has been very evident that no such statements have been put before the Minister by the officers responsible for the construction of this work, involving the expenditure of many millions of pounds. </para>

                        <para>- One would not think so, when one reads some of the minutes that have been written, and recollects how little information the Ministerial head of the Department from time to time has had.

                <para>I have now to advise that the estimated cost to complete the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway from the 30th June, 1916, up to which date I gave the cost as &#163;4,255,961 17s. lid., is &#163;1,810,879 9s. 9d. The amount is net, after allowing for credit upon completion of the line. </para>
                <para class="block">If those two amounts are added together the total net expenditure on the railway is to be over &#163;6,000,000. To-day, a printed statement from the Engineer-in-Chief was laid on the table of the House by the Minister for Home Affairs. Having had only an hour to peruse it, I am not in a position to deal extensively and accurately with it to-day. I am still very much dissatisfied with the conditions obtaining in regard to the construction of this railway. To begin with, the estimate of over &#163;6,000,000 must be increased by the rolling-stock by the amount of &#163;804,000. That puts a different complexion on it altogether. Some portion of that &#163;804,000 is no doubt involved in rolling-stock on the spot and rolling-stock -ordered. The statement, as a whole, when printed, ought to be scrutinized very carefully by honorable members, because it is the first attempt at big railway construction by the Federal Government, and in spite of reports submitted to this House to-day, I maintain, as I have on many previous occasions, that the general management from beginning to end has been anything but creditable. If this is to be an example of public works construction by the National Government, it will prove one of the most powerful arguments against Unification, which some honorable members of this House appear desirous of consummating. The fact of the matter is, the &#39;Home Affairs Department, as the authority controlling the construction of this line, has been endeavouring through its Engineer-in-Chief and other officers to build, from Melbourne, a railway situated 1,000 miles away. It is utterly impossible to do that, and at the same time expect efficiency. The adoption of the day-labour system, uncontrolled and undisciplined, and its operation so far distant from Melbourne, could only hay e- one possible result, namely, to bleed the taxpayers of Australia to an enormous extent. In the earlier stages of its construction the telegraph lines were kept busily engaged, and the public were pretty well excluded during business hours from telegraphic facilities, because the Railway Department officials monopolized the wires with urgent telegrams between Fort Augusta and Melbourne, and very frequently with regard to the most trivial matters. And they call all this organization and efficiency I As a matter of fact, it has been an awful mistake, leading to confusion and chaos, and I think that at last even the Treasurer is realizing the magnitude of this problem, for he told the House yesterday, what I have preached since the inauguration of this scheme, namely, that this railway should not be regarded as a commercial venture, but rather as a railway chiefly for defence purposes. Having that acknowledgment as a guiding principle, I maintain that the capital, cost of the railway ought to have been kept down to a minimum. While the road should be good and well built to admit of fast traffic - because outside its defence aspect it is intended as a route to shorten the time in the transit of British mails between Great Britain and Australia - all other facilities in a country with a rainfall of from 5 to 6 inches ought to have been of a pioneer character. </para>

                        <para>- Time will prove that, just as it will prove many other things. Bearing in mind the fact that the railway should have been regarded as a line for defence purposes, all facilities other than those I have mentioned should have been of a temporary character. If, in the course of time, traffic increased, further provision could easily have been made. Unfortunately, the whole of the estimates regarding this railway were furnished on very unreliable data. The estimate of probable revenue and working expenses was prepared as far back as 1903. It was revised in 1906, and further revised in 1909. Honorable members who desire to be informed on this subject should obtain all the papers furnished during those years, and study them carefully. If they do that they will find that the basis on which the revenue was calculated related to a time of unbounded prosperity in Western Australia. That State had enjoyed eight of the greatest boom years that it ever experienced. During that time the population increased by two and a half times; the gold production increased by about nine times - the honorable member for Dampier will correct me if I am wrong - and the revenue expanded enormously. Western Australia during those years attracted male population from every part of the Commonwealth, as well as from the Old World. The State at that time was not self-contained, but drew enormous quantities of supplies and merchandize from the other States, particularly from Adelaide and Melbourne. While the boom lasted any vessel that could be utilized for the coastal trade was commandeered, and all the wharfs at Port Adelaide, Melbourne, and, to a certain extent, at Sydney, were crowded with merchandize for Western Australia. It was on the basis of that prosperity that the engineers from the five States framed their estimate of revenue for the first year of the railway, and they declared that if during the ensuing period there should be a corresponding increase in the general prosperity of Western Australia, they could fairly expect that the railway, ten years after the line was opened, would earn double the revenue received during the first year. Unfortunately, Western Australian prosperity did not continue, and instead of her population increasing by 100 per cent, during the second period referred to, it only increased by about 28 per cent. I regret to say also that there has been a decline in the gold output as well as in the population of the gold centres, which were regarded as contributing factors for the revenue of this railway. I make this statement with much regret, because we would all like to see Western Australia progressing into the front rank of the States of Australia. These, however, are the facts, and they demonstrate conclusively that the estimate of revenue for this railway was very much inflated. The other day I was complaining about departmental extravagance in the matter of locomotive rolling-stock, and the provision made for that stock, and, as a result, the Minister for Home Affairs promised that an impartial inquiry should be undertaken at the earliest possible moment. This promise was fulfilled, and the two experts who made the investigation did not themselves estimate the locomotive requirements. They were not asked to do that. They were given by the Department estimates which had been unrevised from the beginning, and based on the days of golden fortunes and enormous successes in Western Australia that are now a matter of memory. They had to take those data as their guide, and on them tell the Minister what the requirements of the line were. Provision had been already approved by the Government to the extent of &#163;269,000 for permanent shops to deal with locomotives and other rolling-stock, or, at least, the first vote was made available, although it was afterwards withdrawn. The two experts reduced that amount to &#163;32,000 for a temporary provision, which would carry the Government over the first five years or, at least, until time had demonstrated the nature of the traffic likely to be handled. The opinion of railway men in South Australia is that that temporary provision will see them over, not only five years, but a good many five years afterwards. </para>

                        <para>- It meant a reduction of &#163;237,000 on the first inflated estimate. They put forward, also, alternative proposals, one - of which I forget the figures - to be used if the expectations of revenue during the second ten years were realized, and the third to be used if the strategic railways suggested for the purpose of linking up the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway with the New South Wales railway system, and covering a longer line than the line now under construction, were built. Even on top of the probable success of the line and of an increasing revenue, and further strategic railways, they recommended an expenditure of only about half of the &#163;269,000 which the Government had approved of on insufficient data - a thing for which we cannot blame the Government. </para>

                        <para>- We can and we cannot; but I will deal with that later. The rolling-stock has to be added. There is a return now in the hands of the printer which, I suppose, honorable members will be able to get in a week or two ; but, speaking from memory, the cost of rolling-stock up to date, delivered and to be delivered within the next few months, represents &#163;804,000. The experts, in order to determine what workshop provision was necessary, had to go into the question of engine power. Taking the excessive data of the probable traffic and mileage to be run, they estimated that forty engines would meet all the requirements of public traffic for the next ten years, and, I think, for the second ten. They also took into consideration the fact that in that dry country there would be available, particularly in some seasons, a supply of worse than indifferent water to play up with the boilers, and that, therefore, individual engines could not be expected to do the mileage that is expected of a similar engine in good country, where the water available for locomotive purposes is perfect. To meet this drawback, they allowed a margin of eight more engines, thus estimating that forty-eight would be required for the present and for years to come. </para>

If the honorable member had had a man of his brains and keenness when he was Minister of that Department he would have had a good deal of information that he ought to have had. I am not blaming the honorable member, because it has been the same ever since the beginning of the construction. </para>

                        <para>- Two or three old engines were bought for a song in Queensland, or some other State, and the navvies said they had not strength enough to pull a clucking hen off a nest. I am not troubling about them, because they cost only a few pounds. I am speaking of heavy locomotives of the highest cost and type that have been constructed in the Commonwealth. Instead of getting seventy-five the Government should have got only as many as were necessary at a time when building was the costliest ever known in the history of engineering, leaving the balance to be obtained under more normal conditions later on. </para>

                        <para>- He is a very competent draftsman- an inside man who has never had any outside experience  or any knowledge of such a country as has to be catered for on&#39; the east-west line. If the various Governments or Ministers had sought from South Australia engineers who were not only highly competent, but were familiar with the conditions of the country, instead of going to a garden State for officers, they would have saved, not tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands of pounds in the expenditure upon that railway. The honorable member for Hindmarsh knows the railway track between Broken Hill and Port Pirie. I wish to tell him that just prior to the outbreak of the war the traffic carried over that section of the line reached 1,266,000 tons both ways. That is the biggest tonnage that is carried over any one set of rails anywhere. </para>

                        <para>- The length of the road does not matter. It is not a factor which enters into the calculation. The honorable member has only just begun to get his eyes even half opened. It is not a question of what is the length of the road, but of the number of trains that is run daily. Over that section of the line from fifteen to eighteen trains each way are run daily. It is a question of train mileage pure and simple, and the honorable member&#39;s experts ought to have made him wise upon these points. I ask him again if forty-five engines are sufficient to do the work on that line, and to cope with a traffic of 1,266,000 tons a year - altogether apart from the passenger express traffic - how in the name of conscience will more engines be required to do the business of the east-west railway for the next twenty, and, possibly, fifty years? Yet, instead of forty-five engines, the Commonwealth has seventy-five. I would also point out that on the Broken Hill line there is not nearly as easy a grade as is to be found on the east-west line, in addition to which 3-ft. 6-in. engines are employed on the former. Seeing that on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway only powerful 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. locomotives will be employed, the </para>

If we have such a wonderful locomotive engineer as the honorable member for Hindmarsh claims, that officer ought certainly to be brought to book for this condition of affairs, whilst the man who is in supreme command of the line must also accept the responsibility which rightly belongs to him. I would like honorable members to know that certain land was resumed at Port Augusta for the purposes of railway workshops. The honorable member for Hindmarsh knows all about the matter. I brought it before the House previously. </para>

                        <para>- No. My trouble has reference to the taxpayer. My trouble is that the people of South Australia know that there has been an awful, reckless, and wicked waste of public money upon this railway, because they have seen it. Railway men and engineers have seen it, and they say that that waste is without a parallel in any part of Australia. Talk about minutes. Here is one which relates to the resumption of land and houses at Port Augusta at a cost, I think, of &#163;25,000. Two experts say that none of it was required. They affirm that, including this land, the Department has about two and a half times as large an area for railway workshops as have the Victorian Government at Newport. The minute reads - </para>

Early in 1915 the land was acquired. A considerable part is below high-water mark, and will require to be reclaimed before use. </para>

                <para>I have never previously heard of such a minute in connexion with any public Department. We could not find an example like that anywhere. It evidences what has been going on, and I do not hesitate to say that such expenditure would be outrageous even in the most prosperous times, but in times of stress and strain, like the present, when everybody, both rich and poor, are submitting to burdens that are almost too grievous to be borne, it is little short of criminal. It is high time that this national Parliament demanded a closer scrutiny of public expenditure, both of revenue and of loan moneys. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Hindmarsh, when he was Minister for Home Affairs, did not know the merest alphabet of the business in hand. That was the trouble, and, as a result, the taxpayers will have to pay, not a few thousands, but some hundreds of thousands, of pounds. I wish to say that the Minister for Home Affairs, or the officer who is responsible for the construction and running of the railways, ought to have a monthly progress report presented to him as surely as the months come round. If the official in charge of construction does not see that his costings, month- by month, pan out as they ought to - in other words, if they come out on the wrong side, and he does not immediately report the fact to his Minister - he is not good enough for his position. He is not worth the salary that is paid to him, and such an official ought not to be made responsible for big undertakings. Further, if the Minister does not demand a monthly progress report from his responsible officer, and if he is not in a position to tell this Parliament how the public expenditure upon the east-west railway stands at any moment, he is not fit for his office. If any business - I do not care whether it is the biggest and most prosperous business in Australia - were conducted on such rotten lines, it would very soon be in the Insolvency Court. </para>

                        <para>- That is the finest statement that the honorable member has made by interjection. If the interests of the taxpayers are to be conserved in the construction of this railway, the most expert general manager in railway construction to be found in Australia should be appointed, and he should not be located in Melbourne, but should live on the line. He should submit monthly progress reports concerning the work to the Engineer-in-Chief. It is utterly impossible for an Engineer-in-Chief, who is responsible for all the undertakings of the Commonwealth which come within the purview of his Department, to pay due attention to such a gigantic work when it is 1,000 miles away. What is required is an officer of the highest type - a man of ability and experience in engineering, and particularly in organizing, because the secret of success is in being able to select the right men for the right positions - moving constantly on the line between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. Then, if officers do not justify his expectations, they should be dismissed, and the process should be continued until suitable officers are found. That is how contractors build railways, and that is how they make money, whilst the Government waste it. If we had an officer of great capacity in the position I have suggested, what would be his influence on the 2,000 men who are engaged upon the east-west line? From the engineers, inspectors, and gangers, down to the rank and file, they would know that they had dealing with them an officer who thoroughly understood every detail of the business. What sort of results would flow from such an appointment, compared with the shocking go-as-you-please, chaotic conditions that have prevailed from the very first day this big undertaking was commenced? Conditions may have improved a bit since then, but they are bad enough in all conscience today.. There has been no organization and no system. This business ought not to rest here. Honorable members will give me credit for sincerity when I say that to speak in this fashion about public officers is exceedingly painful to me. I do so only from a sense of duty. The South Australian people tell me that I know all about this business, and should say what I know about it. If honorable members would look at the South Australian newspapers from day to day they will see innumerable letters published concerning the conduct of this work. The newspapers have been deluged since the railway started with complaints of the shocking mismanagement, wasteful expenditure, and want of efficiency in the conduct of the work, and not 1 per cent, of those writing to the press take the other view of the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I never said anything else. I have no prejudices about me. We have had an estimate of &#163;6,000,000 as the cost of this line, but with the various credits it will mount up to &#163;7,000,000, and the railway is not to be finished for two years more. The ballasting will cost &#163;1,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> has pinned himself down, for the first time, to a price for finishing this work; and, with the credits, the total cost will be &#163;7,000,000- and wait a bit until it is finished. </para>

In regard to discipline and control and the output of work, there is a thing in existence on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, and it has been there from the beginning, which people now politely describe as &#34; slowing down.&#34; It used to be called &#34; loafing.&#34; I do not know why it is not called loafing now. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that that is the right name for it. Imagine men loafing on a job on which there are being paid the highest rates of wages for labour that are paid anywhere in Australia and perhaps in the world. From some of the gangs we do not get more than 10s. worth of work for every &#163;1 spent upon labour. The honorable member for Hindmarsh was reminded in this House by the present Minister for Home Affairs that during his administration there were sixty-one strikes in. the year. The honorable member replied that he knew that that was so, and that they were all organizers&#39; strikes. It is true that they were organizers&#39; strikes, and it is a scandal that such things should be possible in connexion with our public works. We are carrying on our public works by day labour, and our friends opposite scorn the public contractor. Day labour has had a long trial, and while it was pretty bad nearly all the way through, it is awful to-day. </para>

                        <para>- The very first thing which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> the Commonwealth Engineer-in-Chief, did when he was transferred to the Commonwealth service was to supply a report in which he showed that the Queensland railways were not built by day labour, but by the butty-gang or small contract system, and that day labour was employed only where the other systems could not be effectively adopted. Day labour has had its chance, and while I do not ask honorable members opposite to do away with day labour, if they do not wish to do so, I do ask them to see that the day-labour system is made to toe the mark with the public tendering system. The slowing down business has developed in Australia to such an alarming extent that it is crushing industry and crushing the workers with the rest of the community. If honorable members opposite have such faith as they profess in the day-labour system, why do they not let it go to the test of the public tender? </para>

There is overwhelming evidence of the truth of my statements in the books of all the Governments of Australia.

                        <para>- There was the evidence of the eyes of the people. I can refer the honorable member for Fawkner to another instance in support of what I have said. I refer him to the cost of the Commonwealth Offices. The Minister for Home Affairs made an admission in connexion with it by interjection the other day. It was the first time we had got such an admission, and I do not think the honorable gentleman intended to let the secret out. He said that the Commonwealth Offices cost about double the price at which the State Government offered to build them. </para>

                        <para>- I am delighted to hear the honorable member for Hindmarsh say that we never had the day-labour system in the Northern Territory. It is so far away from the political pressure which can be exercised in the big centres of population that evidently the Government could do a little bit with the butty-gang system on the quiet. They are not game to do it in the big centres where political influence and pressure is adding 25, 30, and, in some cases, 50 per cent, to the cost of our public works. </para>

                        <para>- If I had the time I could tell the honorable member for Fawkner all that he wants to know about the contractor. He should remember that there is in the public contractor, as there is in himself, a good deal of human nature. It is always necessary to watch him, and those who do not watch him do not know their business. The excess of expenditure over estimates in the case of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway is not all accounted for by the slowing down business. There are some men on that job who do not slow down. If we had a good man in charge the slow down men would have to go, and I should have no objection to the continuance of the day-labour system so long as it gave satisfactory results. The Minister for Home Affairs asked me whether I can suggest a remedy. I can. It is that an inquiry should be undertaken, not by a Judge of the Supreme Court, but by practical men. Mistakes innumerable have been made on that railway, and are buried up to-day. We shall never know what they were, or what they cost, unless the business is inquired into by two practical men. One should be a keen accountant, and the other a railway engineer. And they should be given the schedules for all the sections of that railway from A to Z, and the costing returns. These should be available, and practical men should be appointed, with the schedules and costing returns before them, to go right through the work. Let them go to the engineers, inspectors, and other responsible officials, armed with costings and schedules, and say to them,  &#39; We wish to have your explanation of these so that we may know where blame attaches.&#34; If that were done, a considerable discrepancy between the expense of the work done by the navvy and the whole cost given to Parliament would be discovered. There is superimposed on the expenditure for navvies&#39; work, engineering, and other charges which amount to an enormous overhead loading. There are 100 clerks between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. </para>

                        <para>- The proportion of clerks to other employees on the transcontinental railway is staggering. When Messrs.  Bavey,  Brooks and Frazer built the railway from Port Augusta to Hergott, through the  Pitchie  Ritchie Pass,  and across very rough country, they employed only six clerks. In addition to the cost of the clerical staff, there is the cost of the Stores Branch and of the Melbourne office. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it would be possible to satisfy the honorable member. The manner in which the Opposition has received these proposals is surprising. Not one man on that side has spoken in disapproval of them. We all know that this is not likely to be the last attempt by the Treasurer to increase taxation, because it is apparent that more money will be needed for the prosecution of the war. We believe that more money is available, and that those who have it wish to hold on to it longer in the hope of getting higher interest. The right honorable member for Swan, who followed the Treasurer, did not criticise the new taxation proposals. He merely dealt with the method suggested by the honorable member for Hunter for the raising of money. The manner in which the Opposition has accepted these proposals justifies the conclusion that additional taxation, when proposed, will be equally acceptable. </para>

                        <para>- The Government would not get sufficient if they were. We have reason to be grateful to those who have subscribed liberally for war purposes, but there are many who have not done what they could have done in this matter. In my opinion, we are only beginning what will have to be done to raise money to meet the obligations imposed by the war. As to the suggestion of the honorable member for Hunter, I do not think that it would be agreeable to many honorable members to live on &#163;400 a year; but our financial obligations can only be met by taxation such as that proposed by the Treasurer. I trust, however, that his estimates of revenue have not been exaggerated. In my opinion, he will not get &#163;1,000,000 from his tax on war profits, although many business houses have done very well during the past twelve or eighteen months. </para>

                        <para>- They may have done so. I am not in their secrets, as the honorable member seems to be. Many of the vessels that used to ply along our coast have been taken away, and although, no doubt, every vessel is making profits for its owners, I do not think that the gross  profits will amount to so much as the honorable member suggests. Nor do I think that the amusement tax will yield &#163;1,000,000 within six months, or &#163;2,000,000 per annum. I am afraid that the estimate&#39; of its yield was made by some one who is hardly acquainted with the facts. The 25 per cent, increase of the income tax will probably give the amount estimated, though, in my opinion, there should not have been an all-round increase in the manner proposed. Some firms in the Commonwealth are making a profit of &#163;100,000 a year. The Brisbane Tramway Company, for instance, made a profit last year of over &#163;150,000, and I think that the increase in the income tax should have been graduated so that a greater amount of revenue could be obtained from those in a position to pay it. However, we can wait, and if the return is not satisfactory, we can re-arrange the tax so as to compel these people to pay a greater proportion of their profits to the Commonwealth. Many honorable members opposite find fault with the Government&#39;s proposals for additional expenditure on new works, but unless the Government are prepared to proceed with new works that are necessary for extending the Commonwealth&#39;s activities in many centres, we can hardly, in face of the proposed taxation, expect the private individual who has money at his disposal, and is anxious to adopt a new calling, to do so. Although honorable members opposite object to the expenditure of &#163;4,000,000 or &#163;5,000,000 in this direction, they are pleased to note that the money is to be spent for the purpose of completing our defence system, which is so inadequate for the requirements of the Commonwealth. Some of the money is to be spent on drill halls, and on completing works at the Federal Capital; and after hearing the honorable member for Maribyrnong last night so eloquently giving full details as to the great necessity for an arsenal, I am sure honorable members will admit that the Government are taking the right course. The absence of an arsenal prevents us from carrying out work of the most primitive character. As the new taxation is likely &#39;to create a feeling of fear in the minds of business people, and as private expenditure is likely to be curtailed in every possible way, the Commonwealth will experience a period of great hardship, and there will be many unemployed, unless the Government set an example by spending money on new works. Unfortunately, further taxation will probably have to be imposed in order to meet the heavy expenditure which will have to be faced within the next year or two. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, the Government have not seen fit to make provision for very many urgent works. They have limited their new expenditure to Naval and Military works, whereas there are many post-offices which are urgently required, and in reference to which many promises have been made by Ministers since the outbreak of the war. When the  Hon.  Agar Wynne was Postmaster-General he purchased sites for post-offices in South Brisbane and Wynnum, and his successors have both visited Brisbane for the purpose of inspecting these sites with a view to proceeding with the buildings, but, so far, no step has been taken to erect them. The suburb of South Brisbane has progressed considerably during the last few years, both from a business and residential point of view, but the people have no post-office, and the telephone service is very inadequate because of the congestion at the Brisbane General Post-office; in fact a new exchange has been promised for a long time. I hope that the Postmaster-General will give some heed to the necessity for this work. I hope also that he will carry out the promise made by the Department to build a post-office at Wynnum. The municipal council has presented several urgent requests for the prosecution of the work, but this rapidly -growing district is still without a post-office, because the Postmaster-General has said that he does not intend to build new offices until the conclusion of the war. I hope that he will not turn a deaf ear to these requests. The Public Works staff at Brisbane is not wholly occupied now that the Government are not proceeding with necessary works, but apart from this aspect of the question, we are likely to have a great army&#39; of unemployed among men over military age in the building trade in Brisbane. Early last season the Queensland Government&#34; felt&#39; that they were unable to handle the &#62; sugar question as satisfactorily as the Commonwealth Government perhaps could, and as the result of the representations that were made, the Commonwealth Government came to a decision to purchase the whole of last season&#39;s crop, as well as that of the approaching season. It was thought that greater benefits would accrue to the farmer as well as to the consumers. At the time the men who were employed in the industry complained that they were not being paid a sufficient wage to enable them to live in decent comfort. The Queensland Government, with the object of meeting the situation, allowed a case to be stated before Acting Judge Dickson, and, having heard the arguments from each side, from the men as well as from the growers and the mill-owners, he came to the conclusion that, owing to the high cost of living occasioned by circumstances over which they had no control, the men should have increased wages. He said that he was not so much concerned with the conditions under which the industry might pay as he was with what it cost the men to live in the areas where they were working. Probably he believed that some adjustment might take place in connexion with the price of sugar, or in some other way quite foreign to his inquiry, and in which he was not concerned in giving his decision. Consequently we have an award with which it is impossible to comply. The honorable member for Wide Bay suggested that the Commonwealth Government should raise the price of sugar to the consumers. </para>

                        <para>- I feel confident that the Federal Parliament would be able to handle the matter in a way that would be satisfactory in every respect; but I am not in the secrets of the Administration, and cannot say what they would do. We have the assurance of the Government that,  if the Queensland Parliament will pass the Commonwealth Powers Bill, they are prepared to meet the situation. That Bill has already been passed by the Legislative Assembly, but it is impossible to say what action the Legislative Council may take. If the Legislative Council should hold up this industry, and the position is as serious as honorable members opposite, and I also, think, we cannot say what is likely to occur. According to the financial statement of the Treasurer, it has been suggested that the Inter-State Commission should make inquiries, in the hope of a solution. </para>

I am hopeful that the atmosphere will be cleared in the near future, for the more land we can induce the cane farmers to put under cultivation the greater benefit will accrue to the community generally. If the Federal Government were to resort to the War Precautions Act, they might have to meet other cases in a similar way elsewhere, in which case the powers of the State Governments would be absolutely destroyed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it would have been advisable for the Government not to interfere under the circumstances. I agree that, not only the cane farmer, but the butter producer, has suffered greatly, the latter from a long and severe drought, and that, immediately he was in a position to put a little of his produce on the market, the Governments of the States practically commandeered it, and paid him what they chose. This practically ruined many farmers, and  it  will take years for them to recover.  I  think it was necessary to have some regulations in the Commonwealth in regard to prices, for otherwise the farmers would not have got as much as they are getting to-day. In the absence of such regulations, there are people in the Commonwealth who would have made immense sums of money by trading in produce during the war period. </para>

                        <para>- The cane-grower was satisfied  with the  price he  was  getting, providing  the  conditions  were the  same, or, perhaps, a  little  better than they  were  at  the time the  agreement  was  entered*  into. We all agree that the award is absolutely ridiculous, having regard to the prices which the grower is to receive for his produce, and I am hopeful that the question will be settled in the near future. Both cane-growers and dairy farmers have declared that they are going out of business j but this they cannot do, and, therefore, more attention should be paid to those industries, and further encouragement given to their promotion. I hope the Queensland Legislative Council will agree to the Commonwealth Powers Bill, so as to enable the Federal Government to take full and absolute control of the sugar industry. We are all delighted, I am sure, at the news that an extra 2s. 6d. is to be paid to old-age pensioners, and, like other honorable members on this side, I am anxious to know when the increase is to be carried into effect. In this connexion the Treasurer has incurred a liability of &#163;875,000, and if he were to agree to pay the full pension to the blind, irrespective of their earnings, it would not have amounted to another &#163;100,000 per annum. Every one will admit, I think, that the blind are as fully entitled to the full pension as are the aged and invalid people. Many of these blind people lost their sight in the development of this country and in following useful occupations. The Government are not doing the right thing by these people in denying them their full pension. Many blind people will not benefit by the increased pensions which the Government have decided, to give to the aged and invalids. A blind man who is in receipt of a full pension of 10s. may be earning an additional 10s., but the increase of 2s. 6d. per week will not be paid to him, because his income at present is &#163;1 per week. </para>

                        <para>- The law is the same throughout the Commonwealth. If a man earns 15s. per week, his pension is limited to 5s., and if he earns 17s. 6d. he receives only 2s. 6d. by way of pension. I had occasion recently to support the application of a man for a pension. The authorities in the Brisbane office said that as he was earning 17s. 6d. per week, he could receive only 2s. 6d. I referred the matter to the Treasurer, and he supported that view ; but as the applicant thought it was not fair, he refused to accept the 2s. 6d. The blind people are not in great numbers throughout the Commonwealth, and I think only &#163;70,000 or &#163;80,000 per annum would be required to pay all of them a full pension, but as many of them are already in receipt of the pension, the additional outlay might be very small indeed. Many of those persons who go to the institutions, or elsewhere, in order to make a livelihood, have to pay a boy a few shillings a week to lead them to and from the scene of their operations. I am sure the Government have not given serious consideration to these proposals, otherwise they would not hesitate&#34; to grant a pension that has been so repeatedly asked -for by honorable members in this Chamber. A vote of honorable members would show that a majority of them are very agreeable that the Government should pay to the blind people a full pension, irrespective of outside earnings. </para>

Another matter with which I wish to deal is the restriction which the Treasurer has placed on the flotation of companies. - I am at a loss to understand how people are to make any money for the purpose of subscribing to the war loan, as the Treasurer desires them to do, if the operations of business are to be prevented in this way. Many applications have been made to the Treasurer for permission to form companies which would create much employment, and afford relief to persons who are now looking for work, but, so far, the Treasurer has not agreed to the flotation of any new companies. </para>

                        <para>- I know a few which the Treasurer has refused, and which, in my opinion, he1 might legitimately have granted. We shall want many of these new companies in operation in&#34; the near future, because many of those which are in existence to-day are likely to restrict their operations on account of the new taxation which the Government propose. We should welcome any new companies that would be likely to increase employment, because, on account of the increased  income tax, and the impost on war profits, and the uncertainty as to what may happen in future, many firms may decide to curtail operations, leading to the creation of a big army of unemployed in the Commonwealth. I hope the Treasurer will give a little more consideration to the desires of people who are ready to invest capita&#93; in new concerns. </para>

                    (Darling Downs) &#91;6.3J. - I think there is a general consensus of opinion that the sugar industry is in such a critical position that there ought to be no delay in dealing with it. Every hour of delay in tackling . the matter must mean very heavy financial losses, both to the growers and to the people of the Commonwealth as a whole. The suggestion made by the honorable member for Oxley is not likely to lead to a quick and practicable solution of the difficulty. He suggested that the Queensland Parliament ought to be asked to transfer to the Commonwealth all the powers asked for under the referendum proposals, in order that the Commonwealth Government might be enabled to deal  with the industry as a. whole. How long would it be before that could be accomplished ? The Treasurer has spoken very sympathetically in regard to this industry, and if there is any man in Australia who knows the necessity for prompt action in this matter it is the Minister. The industry has been hung up for a considerable number of weeks, mills are closed down, cane is not being cut, hundreds of men are out of employment throughout the towns in the sugar-growing districts, and the Queensland Government have had to go to their assistance and grant relief, whilst the merchants in the towns dependent upon the industry are in a state of grave anxiety. Injury to the&#39; sugar industry does not involve only the 20,000 people engaged in the industry itself. That injury affects also towns like Bundaberg, Mackay, Cairns, and Maryborough, and the whole of the coastal shipping trade. Yet neither the State Government nor the Federal Government appear to be expediting a solution of the crisis.

                    <para>- I shall deal with that question. It is essential that something should be done immediately.  It is an utterly hopeless and impracticable suggestion, and one grossly unfair to the sugar industry, that we should mix up the solution of the present difficulty with a big constitutional question involving the surrender of wide powers to the Commonwealth, and involving, also, probably a conflict between the two Houses of the Queensland Legislature. We desire a settlement of the trouble quickly, and the suggestion to throw on the Legislative Council of Queensland the responsibility for the failure of the industry, if it will not consent to transfer the whole of the powers asked for by the Commonwealth, is too patent a political trick to be worthy of consideration. That is not a fair and proper method of dealing with this industry ; I speak in the interests of the workers as well as the growers. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member will look at the report of the interview between the Treasurer of Queensland and the Prime Minister, he will see that the Prime Minister in the course of his remarks said that if those powers were transferred to the Commonwealth, the Federal Government would be willing to consider the question in all its aspects, but he could hold out no hope of an increase in the price of sugar to the consumer. While we are debating this big crisis, the trouble in the industry is intensifying, and loss is being borne by the workers and the growers. I believe the Treasurer is anxious to effect a peaceful solution of the problem, and the last paragraph of his statement regarding the sugar crisis reads - </para>

This &#163;18 is to be divided between the workers, the cane growers, and the sugar manufacturers. The Treasurer is willing that the Inter-State Commission should report upon the present dispute . We are all concerned in getting a speedy solution of the difficulty. Necessarily the award of Acting Judge Dickson must come under review. According to Queensland papers, the Treasurer of the State views investigation by the Inter-State Commission as a possible solution. I wish, therefore, to ascertain whether the Treasurer of the Commonwealth has merely announced his willingness to have this matter submitted to the Commission, or has stated that he intends to take definite action to that end, and has submitted a proposal to the State Government for adoption or rejection. It is most important to all connected with the industry that action should be taken at once, and the Commonwealth Government should, in tne interests of the community at large, try to come to terms with the State Government in the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly cannot speak with authority for the employees, but I have reason to believe that the producers would be satisfied with the arrangement proposed . It is for the Government, which has the responsibility of the administration of the laws of the country for the benefit of the whole community, to take the initiative, when big interests are at stake, to see if justice cannot be done to all parties. If the Government is satisfied that one of the parties would welcome the course proposed, they might approach the other parties to ascertain their views.

                        <para>- The producers are willing, I understand, that there should be this appeal. It has been suggested to the Treasurer of Queensland by a grower. It is practicable to have the award reviewed in this way. In the meantime, our chief object should be to keep the wheels of industry going, and it can be done by suspending the award for the time being, and having the whole matter reviewed from the date of the award until a report is received from the Inter-State Commission. All parties are deeply interested in this matter, so that there can be no political feeling in regard to it. In one portion of his award, Acting Judge Dickson said - </para>

                <para class="block">The State Government own several mills, and that is how their representative regarded the position as it affected the particular interest. Yet, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crawford,</inline> who appeared to conduct the case on behalf of the growers, and who has worked out the schedule carefully, the increase given is from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent. - in several instances it is 30s. a week - and as the price of sugar has been fixed by the Commonwealth Government, and that of cane by the Queensland Cane Boards, the whole of the burden of the increase is placed on the growers. I am sure that the Treasurer thoroughly appreciates the seriousness of the position, and will not permit of any delay, further than is absolutely essential, in securing a fair and equitable rate for all the parties concerned. The Commonwealth cannot afford to allow the industry  to  dis-  appear. When the Prime Minister was in Great Britain he strongly urged the supply of all the sugar required by the Empire from within the Empire itself. </para>

                    <para>In dealing with sugar production, we are really not concerned with one industry alone, but with many. Intertwined about sugar production and sugar consumption are a dozen other industries, which, in their turn, are directly or indirectly concerned with others, so that, like ripples in a pool, they spread outward, until finally they become enveloped in the. great ocean of British industry. </para>

                <para>As far as Australia is concerned, if misfortune befell the sugar industry in </para>
                <para>Queensland, it would be a misfortune to the whole of the Commonwealth, affecting Victoria with its refineries and New South Wales with its refineries, and the whole of the jam-making industry, and the whole of the confectionery industry, which we have built up by means of our protective Tariff until we produce an article the quality of which cannot be surpassed anywhere in the world. All of these industries are dependent on the great sugar industry of Queensland. As to the necessity for encouraging our primary industries, we are all agreed. They are the basis of all of our secondary  industries. We cannot export the produce of our secondary industries ; we have to look for a market for them within the Commonwealth. It is the high prices that are obtained in the markets of the world for the products of the primary industries which we export that furnish us with the means by which we can pay the high wages prevailing in Australia today. Any blow to our primary industries is a serious blow at our secondary industries. The more we expand our primary industries the larger the home market we provide for our secondary industries. It is, therefore, particularly important that </para>
                <para> Parliament should support our primary industries. If an award, such as has been given in connexion with the sugar industry, were imposed on other primary indus tries - assuming they also were subjected to price fixing - they would certainly have a hard struggle to make any progress, or even to exist. The Prime Minister&#39;s sympathetic reference to-day to primary productions expresses, I think, the feeling of the Australian people and this Parliament towards them. &#39; </para>
                <para>I ask the Treasurer to bring under the notice of the Minister for Defence the case of married men who are serving with our Forces whose wives do not happen to be living in Australia. In one case, because the wife happened to be in England temporarily on account of illness when the husband enlisted, she has been deprived of the separation allowance. This is neither right nor just. The Australian soldier, wherever he happens to be fighting, is fighting for Australia, and the wife, wherever she happens to be, should not be deprived of the separation allowance. I have put forward this request on a previous occasion without success, but I find there are many cases which are equally unjust. The wives of our soldiers were not allowed to go to Egypt, but now some are proceeding to the Old Country, and surely it is no crime for them to wish to be near to those who are dear to them, and who are fighting for the liberties that we cherish. I hope that the Treasurer will make strong representations to the Minister, and have justice done in this matter. It will not entail any heavy expenditure, but even if it does it is a question of doing justice. </para>
                <para>I also ask the Treasurer to make representations to the Postmaster-General with a view to his being a little more sympathetic in regard to country districts, and not curtailing postal facilities in outlying places. I am informed that there is a tendency to reduce services, and that there is a difficulty in obtaining telephone facilities. To-day the Prime Minister spoke very pertinently of the necessity for inducing people to settle in country districts. There are plenty of temptations drawing people to the city. We should administer our Departments in such a way as to secure facilities for those people who are doing the pioneering work in our outlying districts. The Treasurer has to keep control of the purse, and is quite right in insisting on economy, and seeing that our expenditure is not unduly inflated; but I ask him not to be too rigid in regard to the postal facilities to which country districts are justly entitled. The Treasurer himself represents a country district, and he knows* of places where people are living miles away in the backblocks. He has, I dare say, been on lonely selections where the one excitement was the arrival of the weekly mail; and I am sure he will view with sympathy people living under such conditions. There is a tendency on the part of those who live in cities, -and who enjoy so many privileges, to underrate the value of postal services, but those services are of the utmost value to the people of the far away places of this country. </para>

I am sure there is no desire on the part of the Minister, or of Parliament, or of the people outside who find the money, to inflict any hardship in this way. I do not know what people the honorable member for Darling Downs has in his mind - whether or not they are members of what is known as the &#34; Government House push &#34;- </para>

                        <para>- The case I have in my mind is that of a young fellow whose wife&#39;s relations in England desire her to live with them, and she is going; thus, under present conditions, depriving herself of a just allowance. We all know that if a member of the &#34; Government House push &#34; goes to the Department, he is politely invited in and attended to, whereas common workers have no such chance. When the honorable member for Darling Downs was speaking on the sugar question, I interjected several times, but, as I confess I have done myself on occasions, he did not choose to hear me. I asked the honorable member what wages he would consent to, and on  whose behalf he was speaking, but he did not answer. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that, if a fair advance were made on the old rates of wages, the honorable member would not object. I must own that the advance under the award is a very large one, as is shown by figures recently published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> In the case of the firemen, the wages are raised from &#163;2 18s. to &#163;4 5s., or 46 per cent., and the greasers&#39; wages from &#163;2 17s. to &#163;4 2s. So far as I can see, the firemen represent the greatest percentage of increase; but I should like to recall to honorable members the time when kanaka labour was in full swing. </para>

                        <para>- But the increase in the case of the firemen represents a greater percentage than that in the case of the cane-cutters. When the kanaka was employed he was paid &#163;6 a year, or not quite 5s. a week, so that 10s. would fully represent the weekly cost of his employment; and the increase to the present wages, as compared with those of the kanakas, represents 480 per cent. I know that the Government of the day assisted the farmers by means of a bonus; and in discussing this matter I can speak a little from personal experience, because, forty-three years ago, I took up a selection in this State. At that time the fool of a Government in power, and an idiotic Lands Office sent me, a miserable little bank clerk, into some of the heaviest timber country in Victoria, where all I acquired was a pretty broad chest. A policy of that kind is hardly the one by which to settle people on the land. As to the sugar trouble, I made personal inquiry on the spot in Queensland, and on one occasion I listened quietly for two hours while a representative of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company placed the case before me. He said he was quite sure &#34;he had proved to me that a white man could not do the work ; that a kanaka could do it better; that the industry was not possible without the kanaka; and that the kanaka&#39;s wages were equal to what a white man&#39;s wages were. In reply, I said that I disagreed with him ; but that, if lie would satisfy me on certain points, I would take the platform in Queensland and advocate the continued employment of the kanaka. The conditions I laid down were that there should be an eight-hours day of six days a week, and the payment of a white man&#39;s wages ; but the representative of the Sugar Company said they could not do that in the case of a kanaka. Subsequently I interviewed a foreigner, who had a 50-acre block outside Bundaberg. I asked him whether, if the kanaka were sent away, he would give up sugar growing; but he replied, in forcible language, &#34;No- fear.&#34; He then pointed out to me a white youth, who appeared about twenty, but who was in reality only sixteen years of age, and told me that he would back him to cut and load cane against any kanaka. This man urged that growers could not be blamed if, for 5s. a week, they could get work nearly equal to that of a white man. they availed themselves of it. I recognise that the representatives of Queensland must necessarily know more about this matter than I do; but I know that if an industry is injured in any one part of Australia, the whole of Australia suffers. My idea is that the Government ought to nationalize this industry, and thus give the growers a fair chance, while preventing the huge profits which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company have made in the past. </para>

                        <para>- It  commences  in July and goes right on to December, and, as in the case of shearing, a delay may cause a loss, but everything is not ruined. Any man who goes into the question will know that cane can be preserved in the stalk for a much longer period than when it is cut. This is the first time in my political experience that a Judge has given&#39; a decision to raise wages to an extent he considers fair under trying climatic conditions, and to such an extent as in this case; and I therefore hope that the Government will seriously consider before they alter his award. I think and hope that assistance will be given to the growers, but I also hope to see the industry nationalized. A medical man, who is one of the greatest authorities on the earth-eating disease, when he tested a gang of white men, Chinese, Japanese, and kanakas cutting cane under -the same conditions in the same field, declared that the white man &#34; came out on top.&#34; That, however, did riot please his employers, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and because of his publication of those results the company made his position so awkward that he had to resign. I know that the company supplies New Zealand with sugar at a price many pounds below that at which it was sold in Australia. That sugar was grown by coloured labour in Fiji, but the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, like any other Trust or Combine, does not care a hang so long as it can draw the last penny from the consumers. </para>

                <para>I regret that there is at present no Minister for Customs to whom I can now address myself. I honour the honorable member for Yarra for the course he has taken, and I know his name is received with cheers through the length and breadth of Australia. In my opinion, the Government financial proposals ought to include a heavy increase in the Excise duty on colonial wines. When the Excise duties were raised on a previous occasion, the wealthy wine makers in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia not only raised their prices to the consumers, but made huge profits in other ways. The income tax returns will prove that they are making very large incomes, and at least half a million a year could be taken from them by means of an extra impost upon their industry. Unless the Government are going to fool the people and throw the Tariff to the dogs, it is their duty to put an increased Excise duty of from 6d. per gallon upwards on colonial wines. The price of wines to the consumer has increased considerably in recent years, and the profits of the wine makers have been enormous. One wine maker has been able to spend from &#163;80,000 to &#163;100,000 a year in advertising, yet these wealthy merchants, like all other Combines, continue to take advantage of the public. A further impost should also be placed on colonial spirits. The head man of one big distillery said, &#34; Give me rectified spirits, and I will give you any spirit you like to name.&#34; By that statement he simply meant that by the use of flavouring essences he could produce from the one foundation brandy, whisky, and many other spirits. The distillers have been receiving a price only a few shillings less than that of the imported spirit, which has to pay a heavy duty. The Excise duty has not been increased in proportion. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the Almighty created anything which is an evil <inline font-style="italic">per se.</inline> It is the abuse of a thing which makes it an evil. Roast beef, weight for weight, is more deadly than beer. I notice that the anticipated increase in income taxation amounts to &#163;680,000. The income tax in England is much higher than that proposed by the Government. The larger incomes ought to pay increased taxation, and I agree with the arguments which have been put forward by the honorable member for Hunter. Applying a very coarse phrase used by the Prime Minister when he said that we should &#34;pool&#34; our manhood, I say that we should &#34;pool&#34; our lucre. Let us adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Hunter, allowing a living rate of &#163;200, &#163;300, or &#163;400 a year - I do not care what it is - and let the balance be paid into the national coffers. Let that apply from the Governor-General downwards. I am afraid, from past experience, however, that Governors and Judges will be spared. One Governor in Queensland was so seised of the infamy of his exemption, that he sent to the Treasury the taxation he would have had to pay as a private citizen. All Governors are not like him; and if the Government were to put a question to the people as to the abolition of State Governors, I am sure they would all be swept away, and good riddance to them. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid his Scotch cautiousness made him too careful, and in finance decision is a great factor leading to success. I proposed, as a condition of that arrangement, that the companies should continue in full operation, so as to keep their men in employment, and that if they failed in that respect, the New South Wales Government, acting on the law of eminent domain, should seize the mines and work them at the risk of the shareholders. There would have been no risk. All the workings and the machinery were there, and the Government would have bought the product at 2s. per ounce, without the companies having the risk of sending it to London. Subsequent to the publication of that suggestion in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu,</inline> on behalf of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, interviewed me, and said that not only would the company be prepared to accept that price, but that they would be willing to accept 30 per cent, less than the market price. Silver was quoted at 2s. on the London market a week before war was declared. If the Government had bought the silver at 30 per cent. below that price, they would have obtained it at1s. 4 4-5d. per ounce, and each ounce would have made 5s. 6d. worth of currency. Thus there would have been a profit of 292 per cent. So that if &#163;1,000,000 worth of Commonwealth notes had been expended in purchasing &#163;1,000,000 worth of Australian silver, the Government would have had, in actual silver currency, &#163;3,900,000, after paying for the cost of minting. Today silver is quoted at 2s. 8 15-16d. ; thus, upon every ounce of silver the Government would have made a profit of 1s. 411-80d. per ounce. When honorable members recollect that the output of Australian silver mines represents hundreds of thousands of ounces per annum, they will understand what a huge profit the Government might have made. Unfortunately, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> could not see his way clear to adopt the suggestion ; but I take this opportunity of thanking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baillieu</inline> and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company for the extremely generous offer they made. </para>

                    <para>- The interjection recalls to my mind that, if the suggestion made by the Minister for Home Affairs had been carried out, namely, that the Government should purchase that huge block in Sydney bounded by George, Pitt, and King streets, which was under offer to the Minister of the day, they would have made, on the basis of the price of the property early this year, a profit of &#163;1,000,000. Another property purchased in Perth, actually made by the honorable member for Darwin, is returning the Commonwealth over 8 per cent. on the money expended, and has provided, free of cost, enough land to build a fine General Post Office. Owing to the Minister&#39;s splendid business capacity, the Commonwealth saved at least &#163;80,000 in Perth, and might have made &#163;1,000,000 in Sydney. </para>

                <para>I am glad that an extra 2s. 6d. a week is to be given to those poor old souls the old-age pensioners. I do not know of anything that gave me more pleasure than the passing of the Old-age Pensions Act, and I cannot remember anything that I regretted more than the reduction by the honorable member for Flinders of the Victorian allowance to the old-aged from &#163;200,000 to &#163;150,000. In those days, a pensioner had to be sixty-five, not sixty, years of age before he could get a pension. I am glad that the burden of those who have grown old and weary in the service of the Commonwealth, and whose hairs have been whitened and shoulders bent by their long years of toil, is now to be lightened a little. </para>
                <para>I regret that a promise made by the Right  Hon.  Andrew Fisher has not been put into effect. When the war commenced, he promised that pensions should be provided for widows and children, and I am sorry that that has not been done. </para>
                <para>I advocate a destitute allowance. I would give an allowance to every human being who was willing to make a statutory declaration that he was absolutely penniless, homeless, hungry, or wanting clothing. I remember the d&#233;b&#226;cle that followed the bursting of the boom in Victoria, when every financial institution in the State either closed its doors or was trembling on the verge of extinction. At that time we, in the Trades Hall, provided over 200,000 meals for the hungry. From the abattoirs three loads of sheeps&#39; heads and two loads of shins and heads of cattle were placed at our disposal every week. They were not of as much value then as now. We had them made into soup, and gave the soup to the mothers of families who were hungry. We provided, also, 30,000 beds. </para>
                <para>The Government propose to obtain &#163;10,000,000, spread over a period of three years- that is &#163;3,333,000 a year- for the repatriation fund; but that will not be enough to meet the needs of over 200,000 returned soldiers. </para>

                <para>As for the proposed taxation of war profits, I think that, as it was found possible to ante-date the measure providing for the holding of the referendum on the 28th October next, it is possible to antedate legislation taking away the profits of the thieves and scoundrels who are raising rents and otherwise robbing the poor. A large firm in this city recently bought a property and raised its rents by from 15 per cent. to 20 per cent., and in one case 16 per cent. I waited upon the managing director, who, I found, was personally known to me, and asked him to put the rents back to the old rates until the war was over ; but he said that he could not consider the suggestion. My reply was, &#34; I am going to speak very strongly on this matter in public, and to give every landlord who raises his rent a free advertisement.&#34; He asked why did not the Government bring in a Bill to prevent the raising of rents, holding that it was wrong, and I told him that we had hopes of having that done, but that things were rather mixed just now. However, he would not do anything; but next morning, I am glad to say, I got a letter from him telling me that, after further consideration, he had granted my request. Loathing and hating the Prussians as I do, I say that they are open enemies, and, vile as they are, the enemies within our gates are equally vile. The shipping companies of Great Britain, have made &#163;200,000,000 in profits since the war began. Lord  Tollemache,  in his <inline font-style="italic">Chats with Gladstone</inline> - a book in the Library - when discussing with that statesman the chances of a war with Germany, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> did not think probable, asked him whether he thought that if the shipping companies of the United Kingdom were asked by the Germans to land an enemy force in Great Britain they would do so, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> replied that <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> believed that the shipping companies would, for the sake of lucre, agree to land enemies in the port of Heaven. They have justified <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone&#39;s</inline> opinion of them, and it is time that the Government seized their profits. Nowhere in the wide world, except on the coast of Western Australia, have rates remained unaltered during the war. Rates have remained steady there because the shipping is owned by the Government of the State. The citizens of Broome, and of other ports south of Perth, told me that passage money and freights were lower on the Government steamers than on the vessels of private companies, and that, but for the Government line, rates would have been increased. </para>

It reminds me of the suggestions put forward by Alfred Russell Wallace, in his <inline font-style="italic">Studies Scientific and Social,</inline> that the State should be heir to certain landed properties, an idea which was enlarged by another social reformer of great renown, who suggested that the State should be heir to not only landed property, but also all wealth.

                <para class="block">We know from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Booth that there are in the city of London at least 1,300,000 people whose wages are below that line which allows a man with a wife and children depending on him to live a healthy life and have healthy food. We have the picture of the agricultural labourer in Oxfordshire endeavouring to bring up a family of five children on a wage of 15s. a week, making three pints of milk do for a week, in six half-pints, by doing without milk on the Sunday. Yet every cup of tea and spoonful of sugar paid a minute fraction of the interest on the debt of the Napoleonic wars. That is why I do not wish to see our indebtedness handed down to future Australians, and as far as my brain can think and my lips utter words, I shall use them on every platform, in private and in Parliament, to prevent it. Do we not recall the glorious words of Thomas Paine, &#34; No king, no tyrant, no Parliament, no dictator, has the right to make the laws that future generations must obey&#34;? No Parliament has the right to insist on laws which cannot be broken by succeeding generations; in other words, no generation has the right to fix on future generations shackles such as I have pictured - unfortunate people endeavouring to bring up families on mere pittances. Let us have the truth. Before the war universal manhood was the suffrage in Germany. What is the franchise in England, Ireland, or Scotland? The vilest in Europe, except in the case of Turkey. </para>

Bos position is contemptible, and only worthy of a mean parasite that would scratch a mangy dog&#39;s tail.- In regard to the last war loan, it was explained in the press that a &#163;10 bond could be purchased by payments of 5s. per week. I endeavoured to get four of those bonds for myself and three other individuals, but I had the greatest difficulty. When I went to a post-office and asked for an application form, I could only get one that applied to the &#163;1 per month instalment system. They could give me no information about the arrangement for the payment of 5s. a week, and it was suggested that I should inquire at the State Savings Bank. It will be agreed that the Savings Bank of Victoria has not received due credit for the splendid work it has done in&#39; assisting the promotion of these loans, for it is not generally known that it has performed duties which many think were performed by the Post Office. I went there and paid <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> and, naturally, thought I could pay 5s. each week; but that was not so. I found that I would have to pay &#163;4 before the first of the next month, and I at first refused; but when a young clerk came and told me that by doing so I would get him out of a difficulty, I consented. There ought to be an arrangement by which these securities can be obtained at any time, as in France, and, as I understand, in New Zealand. I desire that security shall be given&#39; to the poor fellow who has only &#163;10, in spite of the sweater manager of the Commonwealth Bank. There is not a single bank in Aus.tarlia that does not pay its clerks tea money if they are detained for only one minute after half-past 6 o&#39;clock, and certainly not one bank in which there is a notice posted that the hours are from 10 o&#39;clock in the morning until 10 o&#39;clock at night. These bonds ought to be transferable by indorsement, and thus give the subscribers the security they ought to enjoy. There is not a mining company that does riot make its shares transferable, and surely the Commonwealth could do so in the case of those men and women who wish to help their country. I protest against the sweating that is carried on by a so-called Labour Government. It is infamous that, because men volunteer and put on a uniform, they should be taken beyond the scope of the laws of their country as represented by Wages Boards. Under the finding of such Boards, every temporary clerk must be paid overtime, double time on Sundays, and be paid tea money ; but the Defence Department most contemptibly get their clerks into uniform and thus deprive them of their rights of citizenship. This is neither just nor honorable. They are compelled to work night after night, and many of them have to come back three Sundays&#39; out of four without receiving a penny extra. The reply to any protest is that in the Army there are seven days in the week, and that all are supposed to work on Sundays. But clerks who work outside cannot but regard the action of the Department as infamous. In the past the Labour Government did say that no adult in the Public Service should be paid less than &#163;110 a year ; but that was the first great effort here to pay women the same price as men for the same work. There are some honorable members who think that a man should be paid more than a woman, but no one when purchasing clothing or any other goods, ever dreams of asking whether they have been made by men or women&#39;. Every woman, thanks to our law, is a citizen, and I do not see why she should not have equal rates of pay. I am loath to believe that this idea of differential wages was brought home by the Prime Minister from his Conservative friends in England. He certainly would not get such an idea from the Labour party, the Irish party, the Liberal party, or the Radical party, and if it came from England it must be from the accursed Conservative party, which has ever been the enemy of the workers throughout the centuries. The ordinary expenditure, I see from the financial statement, has increased from &#163;24,000,000 to &#163;32,000,000, and I believe that that is not justified by experience. Why has the land tax not gone up to ls., seeing that it is now about 8d. ? If that addition were made we might then get to the &#34; last shilling &#34; that is being hoarded so carefully. But honorable members opposite must not think that the land tax is going to stop where it is, for up to the present we have got only to the thin end of the wedge, whether the Labour party be on this side or the other. As the manhood of the country has been pooled, so we shall have to pool the wealth of the country. What has been the curse of England? </para>
                <para class="block">She has the richest -wheat lands in the world as has been proved over and over again during many consecutive years, and yet she cannot raise enough food to supply her own population. And why did that rich wheat land go out of cultivation? Simply because of the cursed land system. One great economist has said that, perhaps, it would have been better if England had been conquered by Napoleon, because then there would have been no entailed estates, by which means the eldest son gets everything, and no instance of a father being able to leave his wife and children unprovided for. Such things as these could not occur elsewhere, not even in Germany. Then, as to the franchise in England, one lord said that women should not have the vote, because it would increase the number of voters from 8,000,000 to 24,000,000, an argument that showed that some 16,000,000 are being deprived of the franchise. No man in England ever has a vote as a man, for every elector must either own or rent property. </para>

                        <para>- We shall see the result of that fight on the 28th of October. The abuse of a man being able to leave his family unprovided for was possible in Victoria until, at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prendergast,</inline> the law was altered; and I hope and believe that a similar reform will be brought about in New South Wales. We know that black and Chinese labour has been introduced into France, and there is no doubt that the capitalists will endeavour to keep coloured men there, because their wages must be less than what Frenchmen will work for. We found a similar condition of things in South Africa. I was a pro-Boer at the time of the war there, and I see no reason to alter my opinions; but not one of us thought at that time that England would be so just as to give the Boers their present freedom. That kindly act on the part of the Old Country has done more to conquer the Boers than all the arms brought against them. There is little doubt that when we send all our men away we shall have the introduction of coloured labour suggested in Australia ; indeed, one man at the Denton Hat Mills has suggested that after the war we ought to bring Japanese and Chinese workers here. I have said more on this topic publicly and in print than has been said at so-called private gatherings, and I would never insult an ally who has saved our cities from being blown to pieces. Even with the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> and our other vessels we could not have protected our extensive coast from Brisbane to Perth. As I suggested in 1905, Australia should have been made into one huge arsenal for the manufacture of munitions of war, so that we could arm our men in time of need. Every one of us on both sides of the chamber who are too old to volunteer for active service would readily go into the factories to help in the production of munitions of war, and the women who today are knitting so gloriously throughout the Commonwealth for their soldier friends would willingly give their services. How valuable would such a system be at the present moment? Had those arsenals been started years ago, how much Australia could have helped the Mother Country, which has had to go to Canada and America to purchase munitions, just as Russia has had to rely upon Japan. Japan keeps a five-years&#39; stock of munitions always on hand, and a Japanese doctor informed me that when Russia asked Japan to supply her with munitions from those stocks, the Japanese Government answered, &#34;No; we may have to fight you, or to go to war with somebody else.&#34; Russia then offered every assurance that Japan would have no occasion to fear her. Finally, Japan said that Russia could put the proposal before the British Government, and, if Great Britain so recommended, Japan would adopt it. The British Government did recommend that Japan should help Russia in this matter, and Japan immediately emptied her stores. At that time Russia was fighting with one rifle to every three men. If the first man fell, the second took up the rifle, and when the second fell the third took it up. In that way was Russia trying to fight off the Prussian advance last year. The prompt action of Japan has completely altered the situation. Therefore, I say, let us not insult an Ally that has been faithful to us. But Australia has done more than its fair share. The Allies . have 700,000,000 people against the 143,000,000 of the enemy; there are <inline font-style="italic">214,000,000</inline> of white Europeans on our side, and 116,000,000 on the side of our enemies. Therefore, let it be clearly and distinctly known that it is not men, but big artillery, that the Allies want. I have been told by a consul who has fought through three wars, who has seen the election of two Presidents, and has been in Germany doing unofficial work, that the Russians would blast their way to Berlin in two months if they had enough artillery. Do we not know that Russia is sending men to France and to other fighting fronts because she has more men than she can am i ? Some honorable members suggested that I was. advocating that Australia should buy Russians to fight for us. It is an infamy to suggest such a thing; but I do repeat, what I said a few days ago, that we can do more good by applying our energies to the manufacture of warm clothing to assist our Russian friends in the winter campaign. It will be remembered that a few years ago the Kaiser assumed the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of prophet when he published a cartoon which showed the European nations grouped together facing the dark cloud of the Asiatic menace. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and America stood with their weapons unbared. Britannia had not drawn her sword, and Italy, as her most intimate friend at that time, was endeavouring to persuade her to do so. That was the warning of the yellow peril which the Kaiser placed before the world. If it is the fate of Australia to be dominated by an Asiatic race, I hope the domination will be by the Chinese, and not the Japanese. I say that &#34;without any intention of rudeness to our Ally, but from my reading of history I know of no nation so kind and just to tributary nations as China has been. The Chinese have acquired their huge territory more through neighbouring nations requesting to be absorbed than by conquest. I desire to say a few words in regard to conditions of employment in the Commonwealth Bank. The present Government was returned to power by the  vari- <inline font-style="italic">ons</inline> Labour bodies and trade unions of Australia, with the assistance of a huge number of people who, although outside the Labour organizations, are in sympathy with the advance of humanity. Those people did not send us here to sweat anybody, but I accuse the Government of the sweating of Commonwealth Bank employees. &#34;Why is the manager of the Commonwealth Bank permitted to do that? Simply because bank clerks were unjustly excepted by a Liberal Government from a Victorian Act. Are not the present Government strong enough to say that the conditions of employment obtaining in the Commonwealth Bank are unfair, and must be discontinued? If a man works in a private office he is entitled to the benefits of the law, but because he works in a Commonwealth Bank under a sweating manager he can be compelled to work till all hours without extra pay. What kind of retrograde movement is this? I protest as strongly cas I can against the proposal on which the referendum is to be taken, and shall take every opportunity to defeat it. If men are to go to gaol for passive resistance, I shall be proud to be one of them, fighting against the attempt to make Australians slaves under the lash of conscription. By what right is this to be done? Does any one think that if the French had the referendum they would tolerate this system and fight for <inline font-style="italic">lid.</inline> a day? Does any one think that the Germans, similarly endowed with the vote, would fight for that pittance, or that the Italians would fight for Id. a day, or the Russians for fd. per day? This glorious heritage, which has been secured to the men and women of Australia by lovers of freedom, will be exercised on this occasion to sweep into perdition this infamous proposal brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> dominated by the Conservative party of England - a party which never gave the Englishman, Irishman, Scotchman, or Welshman the vote, as we enjoy it in Australia. And yet how few there are in Australia who know that this franchise is in the Constitution only by permission of this Parliament, and that possibly it will be curtailed if we get a retrograde Ministry, such &#39; as Irvine&#39;s, which robbed every policeman, every public servant, and every State employee of Victoria of their votes, and which allowed a prisoner who had completed his sentence to have higher citizenship rights, probably, than the magistrate who had tried him. I honour the man who is a true Conservative. Even the Upper House of the State Legislature threw this legislation on to the dunghill of oblivion, where it deserved to lie. This franchise should be put into the Constitution so that no one but the citizens themselves may remove it. I was anxious to get the referendum and initiative included in the Constitution, so that the people would not have to wait for the kind permission of this Parliament for the exercise of that right. Now, I want to refer to another subject, which I regard as of supreme importance. If an honorable member walks down Collins-street, he will pass some of the most valuable land in Victoria - land that is worth &#163;1,000 and more per foot, and much of it is wasted. Every double wall erected along that street means so much waste of good land, plus the cost of erecting the wall. I suppose a quarter of a million of money represented in good land is wasted between William-street and Russell-street on one side of Collins-street.. The idea that the State is the sole heir, not only of the landed property, but of every other source of wealth, was first planted in my mind by the writings of that great man, Alfred Russell Wallace, whose opinions were indorsed by two other great men of England, but whose names have slipped my memory for the time being. Under a social scheme based on this idea, every child would have equal opportunities, and be able to face the world properly equipped by means of State assistance. Every child would then be educated up to the highest point of its ability, be drafted into secondary schools, tested by examination for what is termed the higher professions, or be able to acquire knowledge concerning the cultivation of the land, so important to the fuller development of this country, which is only embroidered with cities round the edge of the continent. I look further into the future, to the time when every one at the age of, say, twenty-one years would receive money, or money&#39;s worth, and perhaps at twenty- five years or later, an additional sum ; but that would not limit the ability of the money-spinners, whose faculty for gathering wealth would not be interfered with. That would not be inconsistent with such a social scheme, because, after they had gone into the shadows, the money they had acquired would still belong to the State and the community. May I here, looking through the eyes of the scientist, further illustrate what I mean? We are told there are three types of intelligent living tilings on this earth - the ant, the bee, and the human. Never, in the nest of the ant, and never in the hive of the bee, do the young or the worker suffer for want of the necessaries of life. Can we say the same of human beings? We are told that we have been fashioned in God&#39;s likeness, but sometimes I doubt it when I see how the poor and lowly are treated under our infamous laws. We pride ourselves on being the dominant race, but scientists tell us that the greatest of our engineering feats are not to be compared with what the ants have done by the erection of those 24-ft. high mounds in the Northern Territory. We know that countless human lives are being sacrificed from year to year for want of food, shelter, and clothing. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to take the opportunity which the presentation of this Bill offers of bringing under the notice of the Treasurer a matter which, I think, deserves serious consideration. Since the war began, estimable people throughout Australia have taken upon themselves the responsibility of providing, as far as they could, for the comfort of soldiers and the assistance of their dependants, and particularly for the alleviation of the distress of returned men. But since the repatriation scheme of the Government was announced, the instruction has been issued that this work is not to be carried further. The people of Australia could not have shown greater patriotism than in the sympathy, charity, and energy which have characterized these efforts. Women in particular have for more than two years been devoting themselves assiduously to providing comforts for the soldiers, and relieving the immediate necessities of their dependants, and much assistance has been given. As a rule, the mayor of the town or the  president  of the shire has been  chairman  of a committee, of whom the local bank managers and other persons of responsibility have been members. Working bees have been formed, and every mail brings testimonials from the boya at the front as to the good that has been achieved. I had a letter, a day or two ago, from a town in which the sum of &#163;100 or so has been raised to alleviate cases of distress, and I can give many instances in which this and similar funds have proved of great value. Women who have required medical attendance, and perhaps hospital treatment, have been assisted; in some cases food has been provided for children, and much good has been done generally. Occasionally, without this help, the families of soldiers would suffer great hardship through delays in forwarding pay, and it often happens that the allotment money is insufficient for their maintenance. My desire is that the Government shall not interfere with the work of these committees and associations, but that it shall support their philanthropic efforts. It would be well to have every member of the community assisting in this great crisis. Certainly neither Parliament nor the Government should do anything to deter persons from contributing to war funds, or giving their labour to assist in alleviating distress. I trust, therefore, that, before the debate closes, the Treasurer will announce that the Government intend to allow the various committees to continue their splendid work. Their accounts are available for audit if that be desired. They are working in accordance with the best methods, and are doing great good. I fear, however, that charitable effort has already been discouraged. One or two schemes for raising money which promised to be very successful, and should have realized some hundreds of pounds, have been stopped. No doubt the Treasurer is in sympathy with what has been done by the philanthropic, and I ask him to make the position clear. Some honorable members would concentrate all effort in the big centres of population. A fortnight ago I wrote to the War Council in Sydney about a case, and have not yet had a reply. No doubt the State War Councils are doing good work; but delay must occur when there is centralization, and it should be possible to relieve distress more quickly. I am disappointed with the proposals in regard to the old-age and invalid pensioners. I hoped that the Treasurer, who has promised for some time to consider this matter, would have gone further. A good deal of trouble and some friction has occurred from the beginning, because of the disability of local hospitals in regard to destitute aged and invalid persons for whom they provide treatment and nursing. Should these persons die in the hospitals, even after they have been there only a day or two, the institutions are put to the cost of their burial, and they have already more than they can do to meet the demands upon them. I know that the cost of an individual funeral is not large. </para>

                    <para>.- I am profoundly disappointed with the proposals of the Treasurer. I feel that the people have, in a sense, been tricked. We are within an ace of having forced on us, whether we like it or not- and many of us do not like it - what, in the view of a great body of the public, is one of the blackest blots that could be placed on Australia. It is announced in to-night&#39;s Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> that there are two more days of grace. To-morrow it will be one day. I hope, for the sake of Australia, that the people will accept what is proposed in the best spirit; but, if the country be turned upside down, there will be only the present Government to blame for it. Australia will not be grateful for being told that it is going to have foisted upon it one of the worst and most tyrannous systems under which the Old World has ever laboured. That question is done with, but we were informed by the glib politicians of to-day that the sacrifice was to be equal, that there would be equality of sacrifice, that wealth must contribute its share, that everything must be put into the melting-pot. The Leader of the Opposition himself, on the 14th, said- </para>

The Treasurer cannot in any sense claim that he has met the contention of the right honorable member for Parramatta, or that of honorable members on the other side, including the honorable member for Flinders, who seems to be very sincere in regard to the danger in which the Empire in general, and Australia in particular, stands, and the extent to which he is prepared to go to protect the liberty that we to-day call ours. But the honorable member is not on the Government bench conducting these proposals, and no proposition has come from the other side to indicate what they consider to be a fair and equitable way of apportioning their responsibility in the war. The right honorable member for Swan, who has himself been Treasurer, merely voiced the good old Conservative suggestion, &#34; Go to &#39;uncle&#39;&#34; - and the present Government have not got very far away from it. No one on the other side has yet given us a lead as to how far they are prepared to go towards putting everything &#34; unreservedly and unrestrictedly&#34; at the disposal of the nation in this time of stress. </para>

                <para class="block">Beyond the glorious old principle of &#34; going to uncle,&#34; they have made no suggestion as to what we should do. On the other hand, they have applied the epithets &#34; traitorous,&#34; &#34; cold-footed,&#34; and &#34; whitelivered&#34; to the trade unionists who have not volunteered for the front. Those are the terms of which the Prime Minister approved yesterday when I called his attention to them. They say, &#34; You have another day&#39;s grace before you are taken by the scruff of the neck and thrown into the firing line to protect the interests which you call yours, but which are, in reality, ours.&#34; The people who use that  language  have no chance of being- conscripted. They have accepted the referendum proposal only because they could get nothing more drastic - because they could not get conscription by a more rapid method; that is, by putting the iniquitous War Precautions A.ct - made iniquitous by the method in which it has been administered - into operation to force men into the firing line. They are supporting the referendum only because the Prime Minister did not come back and say, &#34; My friends with the coronets at Home - those who have swum in champagne with me, who have staggered home with crooked legs after hiding under the table at the banquets at Home to escape the vials of my wrath when I have been pouring them out; those whose confidence I have won and which I do not want to lose - expect me to take direct action to enforce conscription on Australia.&#34; If he had been prepared to take the course which the honorable member for Brisbane intimated that he should have taken, and brought conscription into force under the War Precautions Act, every man on the Opposition side of the House would have been behind him, together with the whole of the wealthy portion of the community. </para>

If one could collect all the data it would make a very interesting volume as to the management of Australia under Liberal and Conservative Administrations. Next we came to the time in South Australia when we ran a man on the Protectionist ticket. I worked for him for twenty-eight years, and we thought that he would be a good man for us. We were anxious to see South Australia progress under a Protectionist <inline font-style="italic">regime,</inline> and foster its industries. That man was a good voter for the Protectionists, but that is all. </para>

                        <para>- He was the man who so frequently said, &#34; I move that the House do now divide,&#34; and we knew nothing else about him. Then a time came, well within the  memory of the honorable member for Wakefield and men who are not as old as I am, when the great maritime strike was in progress, and it was said that striking was barbarous and inflicted a penalty on the wives and children which the men  did not bear; and it was also said that if we were not satisfied with the laws we should get into Parliament and make them ourselves. It was thought that we did not have the necessary brains. Our opponents said, &#34; The common working man has not the brains to make laws. As for finance, good God ! he never knew the meaning of the word.&#34; We took them at their word, and to-day they would bite out their tongues that gave us that advice, because within twenty-five years, not only did we get control of the Legislative Assembly in South Australia, but, as the honorable member knows, we also had a majority in the &#34; House of Dry Bones,&#34; as they term the Legislative Council in South Australia. The State never saw such progress and development as took place when Tom Price was in power. At one time the honorable member for Wakefield accused him of not having done anything on the west coast, and the reply was that, while the honorable member had talked about a bridge here and a reservoir there, the Premier had not talked, but had done the thing. The Murray River waters question was never in the forefront of practical politics until Tom Price was in power. The development of the lands of South Australia was not taken up until the Labour Government came into office. The honorable member for Wakefield asks me how long it will be before we shall have a Government of my way of thinking that would be prepared to finance the war as an ordinary, honest housekeeper would finance his house, namely, by paying his way as he goes. In view of the wonderful work done by men who &#34; did not understand finance&#34; and &#34;could not make laws,&#34; the common hobnailed variety, or, to come to a later date, and use the words of a Conservative Premier of South Australia, the &#34; unthinking mob &#34;- </para>

                        <para>- I am using language that the honorable member&#39;s crowd used. They have called us the &#34; hobnailed &#34; and &#34;bowyangs&#34; party, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake,</inline> who has been Premier of South Australia, designated us as the &#34; unthinking mob.&#34; We think a bit too deeply for the sophistries of honorable members opposite. When the double dissolution was brought about in reference to the principle of preference to unionists, the cry was, &#34; Do not change horses while crossing the stream. We are the men to clean up this business and run the war .  &#34; But the &#34;unthinking mob &#34; took no notice of the cry, and to-day they have a majority on this side of the House. &#34;Marvellous!&#34; my friend says. It is marvellous. It is not an easy thing for those on this side of the House to get into Parliament. We have not every daily newspaper, and every little country rag in Australia, talking and lying for us. But notwithstanding the lying of the newspapers and the lying of honorable members opposite, they cannot score a win. The honorable member for Wakefield asks, &#34; How long would it take?&#34; I have told him what happened after the maritime strike. If the Labour party could start from nothing, and within a short period capture five out of six State Parliaments, and the Commonwealth Parliament also, is the honorable member bold enough to say what it will do in another twenty-five years ? The people can see the truth that lies behind this financial statement. They can see how they are being tricked by this reduction of the income tax exemption to &#163;100. </para>

I am not speaking on behalf of the honorable member, or those who have pandered to the side that would cut its throat. I am making this speech, and I am giving my opinion of the financial statement that has been put forward by the Treasurer. The honorable member for Macquarie has stated that the Labour movement is possessed of that little knowledge which is a dangerous thing. The very fact that he is here shows that it does possess that little knowledge which is dangerous, otherwise it would have selected to represent Macquarie a man who, in the crucial test, would have been proved pure gold instead of dross. </para>

                        <para>- The red flag is something by which we have stood in times of peace, and we ought not to discard it now. But the real question at issue is, &#34; How are we going to do the fair thing in regard to this war?&#34; In the first place, we are going to conscript soldiers for service overseas. We have been assured by the Prime Minister that when it came to paying for the war the men who stay at home should submit to an &#34; equality of sacrifice.&#34; I confess I do not like the phrase, because I hold that the entire cost of the war should fall upon those who can bear the burden by making the least sacrifice. The working men cannot bear it. Some honorable members are constantly prating about the high wages which workers receive in various avenues of production. But in the majority of cases those wages are the subject of an award either by the Arbitration Court or by a Wages Board, and I do not think it can be said that either the Judge of an Arbitration Court or the  Chairman  of a Wages Board ever exhibits a big leaning towards the working man. </para>

                        <para>- I have not gone into that. The honorable member should put his question to a representative from Queensland. But I do know that Acting Judge Dickson based his award on the cost of living in tropical Queensland. The honorable member for Wakefield knows that one union in South Australia has recently been mulcted in heavy legal fees because of an endeavour to secure better labour conditions for its members. The legal cormorants at that inquiry were paid &#163;2 15s. per hour, or &#163;15 per day. They were engaged upon the task of ascertaining the basic cost of living, and working men&#39;s wives had to go into the witness-box and swear that they paid so much rent weekly, that they spent so much upon groceries, so much upon medicine, and that occasionally they visited a 3d. picture show. Yet we are told that our unions batten upon industry. When Judge Gordon officiated in the brushworkers&#39; case he said that the fixed wage of 7s. was the poverty line - that he found it cost that much to keep the prisoners in the Stockade. This was the remark of a Judge appointed to fix a reasonable living wage, and it is the basis on which all these tribunals start. </para>

                        <para>- I grant that. That case was one of the first under the Arbitration Act in South Australia, seven or eight years ago, when the wages generally were 7s. a day. The workers are accused of ever and always wanting* more; but how can that taunt be thrown out when it is proved that living costs so much, and we consider the value of their skill, knowledge, health, and strength? Certainly the worker is ever and always wanting more, if he can get it. He is in business, and his business is to work, but he has only his labour to sell, and he can never sell it at an exorbitant profit. If there is a dearth of labour, there is a talk of immigration, and if labour is plentiful the worker has to scratch for his living - to subsist on  sheep&#39;s  heads or be fed at a soup kitchen in the manner instanced by the honorable member for Melbourne. This sort of thing took place less than two years ago when there was a drought. I was then instrumental in getting the Minister for Defence to allow the stale bread from the camps, not to be sold, but to be sent to the Trades Hall, and there distributed to those in need. These are some of the hardships that working men have to put up with year in and year out. It is true that when there is a drought the farmer suffers loss, but he can always manage to hang on to his farm until there is a good season, and two goods seasons in succession take him out of the mire. The working man, on the other hand, suffers from a drought just as severely as does the farmer, but he cannot get out of his difficulties so soon or so easily. All this is, perhaps, not very relevant to the financial proposals of the Government, but I had to say it in answer to arguments we have heard from the other side.We are told that the Government requires &#163;85,000,000 odd during the next year, and their first proposal is to raise an extra &#163;1,000,000 from the income tax. Single-taxers religiously hold - and I suppose the honorable member for Lang will agree with this - that it does not matter what the form of taxation may be, other than taxation on land values, it can be passed on. It follows, therefore, that no matter what taxation the Government propose, when the financial schemers get to work they will so juggle and adjust them as to throw the burden on the back of the producer, leaving the wealthy man to make just as much money as before. The extra income tax revenue is to be raised by reducing the exemption and increasing the ratio of the tax already imposed. </para>

                    <para>There are some who suggest that all war expenditure should be met out of loans. I have no doubt whatever that is the ideal of those gentlemen who speak so loudly to-day of economy. What they mean is that there should be imposed on the poorer classes of this country an economy which would reduce them below a fair and reasonable subsistence level, and that all extra expenditure should be provided for out of loans. On the other hand, there is a section of the community who believe that all expenditure should be met out of taxation. The first of these plans is grossly inequitable upon the mass of the people, who are always too heavily taxed, and everywhere contribute more than their fair share of the cost of government; and the second plan is impossible. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid, sir, that you are too inquisitive. I cannot say that. Honorable members will find it stated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that, upon an income of &#163;156 per year, there is absolutely no margin left for taxation. Any honorable member who desires to know the opinion of the Prime Minister as to what is the irreducible minimum income upon which taxation can be levied, has only to look at the extracts which I am not permitted to quote, but which will be found at page 5848 in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> They were made on the occasion when the right honorable gentleman introduced the last income tax proposals. Honorable members will find that the Prime Minister said it was impossible to tax a man on &#163;156 a year without going below the subsistence level ; but to-day he would not only tax a man with an income of &#163;156 a year, but proposes to reduce the exemption to &#163;100 a year. To use his own words, to meet the cost of this war. a working man earning &#163;2 a week is to be called upon to subscribe a fiat rate of &#163;1. As soon as his income reaches&#39; &#163;100, he is to be called upon to pay away &#163;1 of it as a flat rate, although, according to the Prime Minister, if he earned &#163;156 a year, he would have no margin left for taxation. </para>

I say that this proposal is not one whit worse than any the Conservatives could have brought forward. There is only one item of the proposed taxation of wealth that cannot be passed on, and that is the proposed levy of 1&#163; per cent, upon the wealth owned by a person, the payment of which is to be extended over three years, and the revenue from which is to go to the Repatriation Fund. One-half per cent, per annum of wealth is to go to the Repatriation Fund. I like our friends when they say, &#34; Our liberties are being protected.&#34; &#34; Our liberties,&#34; bless the Prince of Wales! When they talk of the protection of their liberties, what they mean is the protection of their dollars, of their broad acres and billy goats. </para>

                        <para>- I have never been a farmer. When I have been in the business and have done some farming, I may be able to answer the honorable member. If he is a farmer, he might let me into the secret. I am prepared to exonerate the farmer from doing anything of the kind, but it is the farmer who farms the farmer, who waxes fat on that kind of thing - the Flinders-lane men, and the King William-street men in Adelaide. They see that the farmers do not have too much when they are done with them. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. I suppose the honorable member is hand-in-glove with them, and knows all about them. I have referred to one method by which the &#163;87,000,000 is going to be raised- With regard to the amount of &#163;10,000,000 to be raised for the Repatriation Fund, I am informed that it will only be a side line, because the States are to provide the land and put the soldiers on it, and to raise the money and control the real repatriation scheme. What we axe considering is merely a proposal to assist the State Governments. We are calmly informed that the State Governments are going to borrow &#163;23,000,000 to do what they are expected to do in connexion with the repatriation of our soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- If the &#34; money-bags &#34; are ready to give it up, they will be able to get it all right. Every man has his price, and you have only to fix the interest high enough and the &#34; Goulburn-street squatters,&#34; to whom the honorable member for Calare referred, will find the money. This scheme is based on a twenty-five years&#39; redemption fund, but I remind honorable members that never, in the history of Australia, have we repaid a loan. We need not worry; we are not going to repay this money. It is all very well to say that, in connexion with this loan, there will be a sinking fund, which in twenty-five .years will repay the loan. At the end of twenty-five years we may all be dead. Other people will be in this Chamber, and representatives of the other side may be in charge of affairs, and they will not be likely to give effect to the intentions of the people who are passing this legislation at this time. </para>

                        <para>- I told them nothing of the sort. But I desire to tell the community how the capitalist is shouldering the expense of this war. The lives of our people are being demanded now. No man of military age who comes within the scope of the Bill that will follow the referendum can say, &#34; I will do my fighting twenty-five years hence, or I will put it on to baby.&#34; A man cannot pledge his youngster to do his fighting; he must give his services now, while the fighting is on. That being so, let us have a financial policy which will make the same immediate demands upon wealth, saying, &#34; This is the cost of the war, and this is the means of paying for it.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- If they pay that amount, and they own the wealth, why do they not go and fight for it? Do honorable members expect a man who has gone to the front, and has nothing, to pay anything towards the cost of the war ? Who should pay for the war if not the 240,000 people mentioned by the Treasurer? We cannot go to an empty well to draw water. I know that the feeling of the people whom I represent is that the cost of this war must not, like so many of the burdens created by Liberal Administrations, be left for posterity to bear. Honorable members are trying to lead the public to understand that the whole cost of the war is. being paid by a certain section. I do not say that the projected additional taxation will not be paid by those people, but they are the persons who have the money with which to pay. The Prime Minister, when speaking on the last Income Tax Bill, said that incomes under &#163;156 a year left no margin for taxation. The Government now propose to reduce that exemption, and that means that the men with an income of less than &#163;156 a year must sacrifice something in order to pay the taxation. Either the Prime Minister wai talking with his tongue in his cheek when he made that statement, or the proposal to reduce the exemption to &#163;100 will fall unfairly upon a section that cannot stand any further burden. I wish to revert to my point that in the conscription oi manhood the Government are taking the men at once. Already 6 per cent, of the fighting population of the Commonwealth has gone to the front, and if effect i&#38; given to the proposal outlined by the Prime Minister, within eight months the whole of the fighting strength of the nation will have been drawn away. But in regard to wealth, the Government propose to take only 1&#163; per cent., and the levy i&#38; to be extended over three years. In other words, they will take only J per cent, each year. If you told a man thai his liberty, his property, and his life were in danger, and that for J per cent, you would protect him, would he not gladly hand over that money ? And if you told him that his only hope of saving his life was to hand over all his wealth, would he not willingly pay that price ? My opposition to the Government proposals is that they are not in accord with the principles and ideals of the party to which T belong. </para>

                        <para>-  I am not concerned with that. I know that the platform today affirms that expenditure ought to be paid for out of revenue. The honorable member would not do that. He would put it on to the babies, but he will not be here when the babies are squealing about it j he will be down, well underneath. The Labour party in Australia, as I have said, stands for the nationalization of banking and insurance, and a similar policy was indorsed by the British Labour Conference at Bristol, reported in one of our papers on 29th January  as  follows : - </para>

I am not bound, to the Government on this question. I have  a  perfect right to oppose their proposals for financing the war if I think they are not within the four corners of the Labour party&#39;s platform.

If the Government had come down with a graduated land tax on the unimproved land values, I would have supported them, even if it had been heavy enough to meet the expenses of the war within five or ten years. If things are so awful as we are given to understand - and I do not want to say that war is not one of the greatest disasters in the world - we shall have to make a lot of sacrifices, and perhaps do a lot of extraordinary things. But if things are so serious as we are led to believe, we should follow the course taken by Great Britain, where the Government have stepped in and taken over control of certain industries. When the present Government came into office after the elections of 1914, the majority of the people were then of opinion that banking and insurance should be a national undertaking, and I now urge the Government to be bold, and go to the banking institutions, and say, &#34; During the time of this war, and until the whole cost has been met, these banks belong to the nation.&#34; Let them tell each depositor that he will not get a penny interest, and let the Government take over all insurance companies. </para>

                        <para>- I would apply it to every banking institution in the Commonwealth. The savings bank depositor ought to make some sacrifice as well as everybody else, but the honorable member for Grey knows that if we tax the earnings of a man getting &#163;2 a week there will be very little left for him to put into the savings bank. If I have &#163;100 in the savings bank, it is money that I have not needed to use. I have been able to put it by, and to increase the sum through some one else&#39;s effort. I make the suggestion that the banks should be taken over by the Government, in the interests of the nation, and that it should be made a penal offence for any one to lend money except through the Government. There should be no other money-lending institution. Thus you will get hold of the profits that are made. The banking magnates of the Commonwealth have told you what takes place, but you will not listen to them. Let me quote again from an article by the banking expert of the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Register -</inline></para>

                <para class="block">There is the trick of the coin made plain to you. So long as money is borrowed and spent locally, it simply circulates. Let the Government take over the control of circulation for the period of the war, or for so long as may be necessary to meet the cost of the war. It can make banking operations pay, and can lend money to industrial concerns, as the banks do now. I do not say that that is not perfectly proper, but the Commonwealth could control the business as well as the banks. What I suggest could be done if the Government had a penn&#39;orth of &#34; punch &#34; in them, and were prepared to do something extraordinary in extraordinary circumstances. They have not proposed anything more than a Liberal Government would have proposed. Indeed, I think that the Liberals, after all that has been said about equality of sacrifice, would have been ashamed to propose a wealth tax of only J per cent, for three years for repatriation purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but we have been paying taxation to meet interest ever since the first loan was floated, and our children&#39;s children will be taxed in the same way. The principal will never be repaid. I do not like that method of finance. The party to which I belong has struggled until now to get from under the heel of capitalism, which grinds down those who produce, and lives on them. I am out to destroy capitalism. But the honorable member for Grey, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Micawber,</inline> thinks that you can pay a debt by giving a promissory note. My opinion is that we should manage public concerns as we do our private concerns. We try to pay as we go along, instead of leaving our children with heavy burdens of debt. It has been the rule of my family to keep out of debt, and 1 thank my guardian angel that I have always been able to pay 20s. in the &#163;1, and to keep out of debt. If our national finance were properly regulated, the country would be in the same position as I am; but we are so obsessed by the financial ideas of big, fat, bloated motor-hogs that no change can be effected. The present financial system is a sort of legerdemain. Wealth is turned over and over, and the individual who turns it over makes* money by doing so. The Commonwealth could take up the business of lending money. The establishment of a State Bank in South Australia was opposed by persons who told the farmers that their industry would be killed; but to-day the State Bank is saving the farmers. It is a good asset to South Australia, and its operations have had a beneficent effect. The National &#34;Bank, too, is a wonderful institution. It has given stability to the private banks, mid honorable members propose to allow them to make&#39; profits out of that stability. I wish the Government to take over the whole business of banking. If they did that they could finance the war. Let me, in connexion with the war profits proposal, read an extract from an article which appeared in the financial columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Register</inline> on the 25th January last - </para>

As the Minister for Home Affairs pointed out on one occasion, if he borrowed &#163;4,000 from a bank, that was shown as &#34; business out,&#34; and if he paid it back again, that was shown as &#34; business in,&#34; the whole transaction appearing as &#163;8,000 worth of business, though not a copper was spent.

                    <para>The proportion of cash to deposits is also the greatest of which there is any record, and the hanks are maintaining a strong position. It is probable that the loans to general customers have not expanded during the year, but loans to and investments with the Governments have certainly done so, and this is a time when the Governments need support, more particularly the Federal Government. Up to last year the cash holdings of the banks were never near the &#163;20,000,000 level, and now they reach &#163;23,130,608 in New South Wales alone. The gold has dropped &#163;3,172,350, but the Government notes held have increased &#163;8,656,611, and the total cash is greater by &#163;5,484,261. That is remarkable. But the increase in the current accounts is still more striking, and it serves to show that the public in these times are doubtful as to the outlets for their surplus funds. For the first time on record the current accounts in 1915 exceeded one-half the total deposits. In 1890 the current accounts were only 29 per cent, of the deposits. In 1905 they reached 40 per cent., and now they are 52i per cent. That means (says the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph)</inline> that a much larger proportion of the banks&#39; resources are drawn from the current business of the country, and the expansion has gone on in the face of a rapid development of the Savings Bank operations. </para>

                <para class="block">There are, therefore, other means of financing the war if the Government so desire. We are not making wealth pay. The Government are not doing what a good Labour Government, who believe in the platform they helped to make, ought to do. All they have done is to go in for fancy forms of taxation which will be passed on. The only one that will not be put on the back of the worker is the tax on wealth. No matter what tax is imposed, these fellows are too cute, and have too big a pull in the community, to bear it themselves. If the Government had grabbed the avenues of wealth, and manipulated them in the interests of the nation, they would have been able to finance the war properly, instead of being &#163;85,000,000 in debt, as we shall be at the end of this year, for war purposes only, and the bill is not likely to stop there. We must go on until the job is finished, and no one can estimate what the actual cost of the war will be to Australia. One thing that can be said with certainty is that, if the Government remain as they are at present, and the same process is adopted, it will be borrowed for and put on to baby, and the man who now says he is prepared to give his last shilling will take the last shilling he can get out of the war, as he is doing at the present, time. He will do anything but come up to &#34; scratch,&#34; like every man has to do in his daily life, and meet his expenses as they occur. A great deal more could be said about the proposals to finance the war, because the whole thing reeks. The amusement tax will be paid by the general community. The worker will have to pay a&#189;d. on his little three-penny picture show. Although, as pointed out by the Prime Minister, with a wage of &#163;156 there is no margin for taxation, the little pleasure the citizen gets by going with his wife and kiddies to a picture show is to be taxed. The time is coming when the mother and kiddies will have to go to the picture show alone, father having gone to the front, and mother and kiddies will have to help to pay to keep father at the front. That is how the money-hogs finance the war. </para>

                        <para>- Some of them may be even that. I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister for Defence, through the Prime Minister, the case of Nurse Stacey, of South Australia. She gave every satisfaction while in Egypt, and assures me that all. the time she was in the hospitals there was not a word of complaint against her service or a mark against her character. She was returned from Egypt, and has a clean discharge from the military authorities. Every one of the questions could not be answered more satisfactorily than they were in her case. She made application to go to the front again, but her request was refused. At her request, I brought the matter before the Defence Department, who informed me by letter that she could not go back on account of unsuitability.  Colonel Fetherston,  when I saw him on the matter, shook his head, and would not tell me the real reason. He was not inclined to define the unsuitability. There are rumours that some nurses have returned from the front who would not like people to know why they cannot go back; but this nurse has nothing of that sort against her. She courts and would welcome an investigation into her abilities as a nurse. I want the Minister to take a note of this case, and see that I am not put off by any allegation of unsuitability. The alleged reason for which she was sent back has nothing to do with her skill or attention to duty or personal character. It is a matter of snobbishness on the part of those in charge. The iron heel of militarism extends even into our hospitals, and this is a case in point. This nurse has, apparently, happened to offend some one just a little above her. The position she is now in is that she cannot go back, and people can think what they like of her. There is another matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the Committee. On 18th August last year, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie asked for a return showing the militia officers who had not volunteered for the front, but were holding paid positions. Among the names for South Australia was that of <inline font-weight="bold">Major W.</inline> S. Hanson, aged 39 years 8 months. He was described as acting as D.A.Q.M.G. He is now holding the same position at the Keswick camp, and he keenly feels his inclusion in that list, believing that it classes him as one of the cold-feet brigade.

The attachment to the letter is as follows :  - (Copy of letter sent to the Minister for Home Affairs on the 2nd December, 1915.) </para>

After this Bill is disposed of I ask honorable members to permit us to deal with certain formal measures having reference to the appointment of an Assistant Commissioner of Taxation. To-morrow, with the permission of honorable members, I wish to put through a Bill for the purpose of amending the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act in order to permit of increased payments to old-age pensioners commencing in October. As honorable members are desirous of an opportunity of discussing matters of urgent public importance, I propose to take Ways and Means as soon as the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill is out of the way. This will provide every opportunity for further discussion. </para>

The Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act will be amended to permit of the increased payment of 2s. 6d. per week, which the blind pensioners will receive in common with other pensioners, but as to the amount that they ought to be allowed to earn, I promise that the Government will take the matter into consideration, and announce their decision to the House when it reassembles. The question cannot be dealt with off-hand, but must be considered in all its aspects. If we permitted blind pensioners to earn 30s. a week whilst receiving a pension of 12s. 6d. per week, we do not know where we might be landed. </para>
