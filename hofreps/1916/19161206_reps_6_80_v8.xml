                            <para>- There would only be a cessation of some of these industries before the holidays. The Department has gone fully into the matter, and no one is more anxious than the Prime Minister and myself to do everything possible to get the industries started, a matter which, of course, depends on everything going right at the collieries. Every ship that we can use is being loaded as fast as possible, and is detailed to the place where its coal is most necessary for the industries. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. Last Thursday I said in the House that the Premier of Queensland had sent a cablegram to the Agent-General of that State in London, advising the Queensland electors there to vote "No." On Saturday the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> reported a message from Brisbane to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> had said that I was under some misapprehension in the matter. It is only fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> and myself that I should now state what that honorable gentleman says of the matter. </para>

                    <para>Mr.Ryan stated that during the month of October he had been requested by the Anti-conscription Campaign Committee to convey a message through the Agent-General in London to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Phillip</inline> Snowden, M.P., asking him to put the other side of the case to the soldiers, in view of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> manifesto to them urging a "Yes" vote. </para>

                        <para>- I am rather inclined to think that the existing moratorium covers such cases. If it does not, I shall look into the matter, and see how far an alteration is called for. I understand the position to be practically that, whereas in normal times a farmer is able to put his produce on the market immediately it is harvested, he is now precluded from doing so owing to the existence of the wheat pool. He is, therefore, dependent absolutely on the operations of the wheat pool for a return for his labour, and is unable to pay his rent. Is that the position? </para>

                                <para>- I am quite aware that considerable inconvenience will, and, according to the honorable member, some loss may arise from the embargo on the shipment of wool, but the Government are not to be held to be directly responsible. The British Government have intimated to us that they are desirous of acquiring the Australian wool clip, and have requested us not to permit export. We have no alternative but to comply with that request; but we have submitted to the British Government as strongly as we could the importance of their settling the matter at the earliest possible moment, thus relieving us of that inconvenience and loss, if the honorable member will have it so, that arises from the embargo on export. Beyond this we cannot go. But I anticipate that, in the course of a few hours, at any rate by to-morrow, we shall be able to lift the embargo, and permit shipments to go forward in the usual way. </para>

                            <para>- The price of the wool clip of Australia is about to be fixed, and it is a fixation of prices on a colossal scale, necessitated by certain circumstances with which we all agree, but I am anxious to know from the Prime Minister if there is any possibility of conflict between the tribunal that he is creating to appraise the value of the wool and the authority vested in the Minister who is handling the matter to fix the price himself, as happened in regard to wheat last year? </para>

                                <para>- As I pointed out last week, in reply to a question arising out of the same matter, submitted by the honorable member, the question of appraising the value of the wool clip has been vested in a Committee which was appointed by the conference of persons called to consider the question. The matter of appraising the price of wool is a highly technical one, and only the opinion of experts can be of any service at all. Of course, the Minister, who will probably be myself, may be technically and actually responsible, but what can any Minister who is not an expert know of the value of wool ? Therefore we must rely on somebody. The Committee which has been appointed is one of highly reputable men of great skill. Every regard will be had for the interests of the individual wool owners. I should like to add that the interests of the small man, no matter how small he may be, will be as carefully considered as those of the great pastoral companies. Subject, of course, to the price at which the whole clip is sold, he will get the full value for his wool as distinct from the wool of some one else which is of inferior or superior quality. </para>

                        <para>- It will not be possible for the farmer to be paid in full immediately for wheat that may not be delivered for six, ten, or eighteen months from the date of the purchase; but, as I have already stated, the matter of paying the farmer a reasonable advance has been, and is, engaging the serious consideration of the Wheat Board. The Board desires to pay the farmer an instalment of 2s. 6d. per bushel. In order to do that, it will be necessary to borrow £18,000,000; of course the difficulty arises in doing this. </para>

On Thursday last I stated in the House that an inflammatory speech had been delivered by a notorious Industrial Worker of the World at Broken Hill, at a gathering of the Licensed Victuallers Association. The Licensed Victuallers Association has assured me that it disowns any connexion with the man, the speech, or the gathering. I unwittingly took the abbreviation L.V.A. to mean Licensed Victuallers Association; but I discovered that L.V.A. now indicates " Labour's Volunteer Army." </para>

If the honorable member desires to know whether the Government are going to deal with these people, I can only say that recruits of the type described in this notice would be rather difficult to deal with. The matter is, however, engaging the attention of the Government, and I shall shortly declare our policy with respect to it. </para>

                    <para>- Bearing on the question just put by the honorable member for Echuca, I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether the advertisement - if it is an advertisement - cannot be traced, since it must have been paid for by somebody? Is there a note showing in what newspaper it appeared? If it is merely a small printed circular, does it not bear an imprint? If it does, the Prime Minister can ascertain who issued it, and if it is a punishable offence, these men can be dealt with. </para>

The honorable member knows that perfectly well. One might just as well look for the name of the Deity on a publication out of Hell as expect to see the name of the printer on such a publication. </para>

                        <para>In regard to members of the Australian Imperial Force enlisted for service abroad, separation allowance may now be drawn up to an amount which, added to the member's pay, does not exceed 10s. per day. The rates remain the same as previously, viz.,1s. 5d. per day for a wife and 4½d. per day for a child, and the result of the new regulation is that better provision is made for the families of soldiers who have a number of children. </para>

A direction in the terms set forth was issued by the Chief Electoral Officer to the Commonwealth Electoral Officers for the several States on Friday, 27th October, at about 3.30 p.m., for transmission to their respective Divisional Returning Officers, in anticipation of the issue of a regulation to that effect. The telegrams were actually despatched from the Telegraph Office at a later hour. Inter-State telegrams were not despatched until about 6 p.m. </para>

As the time in which to issue instructions to electoral officials was very short, it was necessary to anticipate the actual issue of the regulation.

J. C. Watson, and when a similar motion was moved against the Fusion Government by the  Hon.  Andrew Fisher. No person outside the members of the Labour party - except the Prime Minister - knew that the amendment was to be moved. A letter was written to the Prime Minister notifying him of the intention to move the amendment, and it was handed to him by the honorable member for Maranoa on the afternoon when the amendment was moved. No one outside the party was consulted or knew the terms of the amendment. </para>

                    <para>I propose to make a statement on the financial proposals of the Government. On the 27tb September last, just before the adjournment, the former Treasurer, the Honorable W. G. Higgs, made a statement concerning certain taxation proposed by the late Government : T refer to the war-time profits tax, a Bill for which was introduced on the 17th May last; the proposed increased income tax; the levy on wealth for repatriation purposes; and the entertainments tax. </para>
                    <para>Since my appointment to the position I hold in the Hughes Government, it has been part of my duties to examine these instruments of taxation. The war-time profits tax, as proposed by the ex-Treasurer , applied to all businesses - whether continuously carried on or not - of  any  description carried on in Australia, or owned or carried on in any other place by persons ordinarily resident in Australia. The Bill, as originally drafted, provided that 50 per cent, of the war profits should be taken, but at a later date, the 27th September, the ex-Treasurer  announced that it was proposed, in the second year of the operation of the Act, to take 100 per cent. of such profits. In examining this proposal I have taken into consideration the following factors :  - </para>
                    <list type="loweralpha">
                        <item label="(a)">
                            <para>Its effect on new businesses particularly; and </para>

                        <item label="(b)">
                            <para>Its effect on business and industries generally. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>In England there is a similar tax in operation, but there the tax was 50 per cent. in the first year, and 60 , per cent. in the second year. I should like to submit that the operation of such a tax in an old and established country, where businesses, generally speaking, are of long standing, is not a reliable guide to us in a new country, where businesses and industries are springing into existence almost daily - a condition which it should be our policy to encourage. </para>
                    <para>An examination of some 300 balance-sheets of companies discloses the fact that old and established businesses are not affected by war-time profits legislation to nearly the same extent as businesses of recent formation. That is chiefly owing to the war-time profits being based on the actual results of what is known as the pre-war standard of profits. In other words, companies or businesses thoroughly established prior to the war, and then showing large percentage profits, will not be nearly so much affected as new companies, or those companies or businesses which, prior to the war, did not exist or showed small percentage profits, and, in some cases, losses. </para>
                    <para>It is very clear that a very large portion of the revenue that will be derived from this source of taxation will be from businesses recently established, and such businesses as prior to the war showed a small percentage of profits. Unless some alteration is made in the Bill to treat these companies or businesses on a somewhat different basis from that which may be applied to old and established businesses, which in the pre-war period had earned good profits, the result will be inequitable. </para>
                    <para>In the ex-Treasurer's financial statement the £1,000,000 estimated to be received from the war-time profits tax in the first year was based on a percentage standard of profits of 6 and 7 per cent., 6 per cent. being allowed in the case of companies, and 7 per cent. in the case of any other business. In the second year the percentage standard was increased to 7 and 8 per cent. respectively. </para>
                    <para>What Constitute War Profits. The Bill as drafted applied to all mining companies, and while it may be clearly demonstrated that the output of many products of the mines, such as lead, copper, molybdenite, tin, zinc, and other byproducts, has been enhanced very materially as a direct result of the war, it is difficult to find any argument that would justify the inclusion of gold mines amongst the taxable. Gold has not been enhanced in value as a result of the war. As a matter of fact, the war has depreciated the value of the sovereign very materially, if viewed from the stand-point of its purchasing power. The gold-mining industry, instead of deriving a benefit from the war, is being affected in the opposite direction. The prices of all material used in connexion with the industry are far in excess of what they were prior to the war. The Government have, therefore, decided to exempt the profits from the production of gold mines from the imposition of this tax. </para>
                    <para>Another important phase of this question is what is termed wasting or depreciating assets. It must be apparent that some companies and businesses may grow more valuable as they grow older, whereas there are other companies and businesses which have a limited life, and each year their assets are reduced in accordance with the extent of their output, or the term of their lease. This is clearly recognised in the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 17 of which provides that the capital expended by a person carrying on mining operations in necessary plant and development shall be divided by " the estimated number of years during which payable mining operations may be expected to continue under normal conditions, and the quotient thus obtained shall, in addition to any other deductions allowed by the Act, be deducted from the income." </para>
                    <para>A similar provision will need to be made in the War-time Profits Bill. It is quite apparent that, no matter how careful one may be in his endeavour to guard against injustice, there will undoubtedly be many cases of hardship as the result of the passing of the Act, and to meet that contingency it is proposed to establish a Board of Referees, to which, where the Commissioner is satisfied that hardship may be caused, cases shall be referred for decision. </para>
                    <para>Allowance should also be made for the deduction of amounts paid in respect of Commonwealth and State income taxes. </para>
                    <para>In estimating the revenue to be derived from this taxation I have reduced the amount which was originally expected to be received in the first year by £400,000, and in the second year by £1,100,000. </para>
                    <para>The Government do not propose to take 100 per cent. of the profits on the second year's operations, and have decided to limit the tax to 50 per cent. on the first year, and 75 per cent. on the second year. If all profits were taken, there would be clearly no incentive for business people to extend their operations. It is further proposed to exempt fruit-growing from the operation of the Act. The loss of revenue from this will be negligible, and the exemption will save those in the industry the trouble of filling in returns. </para>
                    <para>Levy on Wealth for Repatriation Purposes. In examining this proposed instrument of taxation I have tried to ascertain - </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>Under the proposal of the ex-Treasurer the payment of1½ per cent. was spread over a period of three years, and it was estimated to yield £3,333,000 per year, or a total of £10,000,000 for the three years. Before deciding on the term over which these payments may be made, it is well to consider our necessities in this direction. In other words, there is no justifiable reason why we should impose on the wealth owner, even for this laudable object - the repatriation of our Australian soldiers - more than will be necessary to meet our requirements. On inquiries I have made from the Defence authorities, it is conceded that we shall be unable to expend this amount in the time originally contemplated. Assuming the war to finish by this time next year, it would take well into two years before our troops would return to Australia. I therefore propose to extend the period of payment over five years, collecting one-fifth of the total amount each year. This will lighten the burden, and, instead of raising £3,333,000 per year as originally proposed, the amount expected to be derived under my proposal will approximate £1,835,000 per year, or £1,498,000 less than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs'</inline> proposal. As the result of inquiries now in progress it may be possible to reduce the amount payable in the earlier years. The levy may be paid in five equal yearly instalments, or the contributor may pay cash, in which latter case he will be entitled to a rebate or discount calculated on the basis of war loan interest for the period covered by the prepayment. Donations of £5 and upwards to the Repatriation Fund will be credited as payment or part payment of wealth levy. </para>
                    <para>The proposal already made includes war bonds and inscribed stock as being subject to levy. There are some honorable members who believe that no promise or pledge was given that these bonds should be free from all taxation, and on examination of the War Loan Prospectus that contention can be maintained, as therein it is stated that " all bonds and all transfers of inscribed stock will be free of Commonwealth and State stamp duty, and interest will be free of Commonwealth and State income tax." Clearly they were not to be free from all taxation, but many of the public appear to have been under the impression that the principal would not be taxed in any way, and the announcement that a levy of½ per cent. per. annum for three years on war bonds, as well as on ordinary wealth, was to be imposed, has unsettled the value of these securities, and in some few instances, so I am advised, investments have gone to other countries because of this proposal. The position of the Commonwealth is a dual one. In addition to our intention to increase taxation, we are also a borrower within our territorial limits, and early next year we shall have to raise about £18,000,000 for war purposes. Later on, if the war continues, we will most certainly have to raise a much larger amount. If we insist upon levying½ per. cent. for three years, we may find ourselves in the position of having to give an increased percentage for ten years on the balance of the loans we require, and the result would be that the increased amount to be paid for new loans would far exceed what would be gained by imposing the levy on war bonds. </para>
                    <para>My financial advisers tell me that if the proposed levy be maintained on war bonds and inscribed stock it will seriously interfere with the next issue; but if the public be assured that no taxation will be enforced on war loans it is thought we will be able from time to time to raise all the money we require locally for war purposes. We have, therefore, decided to exempt war bonds and inscribed stock from the operation of the wealth levy. </para>
                    <para>There is another phase of the proposed levy which should receive earnest consideration. That is as to whether some provision should not be made to meet bard cases. Many of those who will have to pay are persons whose income is not great, and there may be others who, while owning considerable property, may yet not have liquid assets to satisfy the levy, and who thus may suffer an injustice if forced to realize on some portion of their property to enable them to pay. </para>
                    <para>To meet this latter contingency, it is proposed to accept a first mortgage on such properties, and to charge interest on the amount of the mortgage. That would mean, instead of having to find the whole of the cash, they would pay interest on the mortgage, and have the right to pay off at any time they desired within the five years. It has also been decided that a Board of Referees shall be appointed. The <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of this body will be the same as that appointed to deal with cases of hardship under the war-time profits tax. The taxpayer who considers himself oppressed will thus be given an opportunity to seek relief. </para>
                    <para>There will be an exemption of £500, but it is not intended to continue this exemption through all gradations. </para>
                    <para>Amendment in Present Income Tax. It is intended to increase the income tax by 25 per cent., and provision will be made so that the exemption will disappear on incomes of £500 and over. It is further proposed to increase the amount allowed to be deducted from taxable income to £26 for each child under sixteen years of age, and in the case of single persons without dependants the exemption will be reduced to £100. The only alteration in this tax, compared with the proposals of my predecessor, is the abolition of the exemption  on incomes of £500 and over. The present exemption of £156 on income from personal exertion is allowed in full on all net taxable incomes not exceeding £500. Over that amount it diminishes by £3 for every £10 increase in the net taxable income, until it disappears entirely, when the net taxable income reaches £1,020. </para>
                    <para>In the case of income from property the exemption is £156 when the net income does not exceed £156. The exemption diminishes by £2 for every £5 by which the net taxable income exceeds £156, until it disappears entirely when the net taxable income reaches £546. </para>
                    <para>In the case of composite incomes, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> a total income derived partly from personal exertion and partly from property, the general exemption of £156 is apportioned between the net taxable income from the two sources, until the income from property reaches £546, and then the diminished deduction, which may still be allowable, is deducted from the income from personal exertion until that reaches £1,020, when it vanishes. </para>
                    <para>To make the general exemption of £156 vanish in all cases when the total net taxable income from all sources reaches £500, it will be necessary to provide that it shall diminish by £5 for each increase of £11 in the total net taxable income above £156. </para>
                    <para>In the case of a single person without dependants, the exemption of £100 will diminish by £1 for every £4 in the total net taxable income above £100, so that it also will vanish when the total net income reaches £500. </para>
                    <para>Entertainments Tax. The Government propose to go on with the entertainments tax, but will not impose tax on tickets of a less value than 6d. The ex-Treasurer estimated to get £1,000,000 in six months of the first year, but on the latest information I can obtain on this subject I have been compelled to reduce this estimate very materially, and do not expect to get more than £700,000 per annum from this source. </para>
                    <para>Economy. One of the first things done by me on assuming office was to summon the heads of the chief spending Departments, with a view of seeing if the Estimates of this year could be reduced, and at these interviews I impressed on the officers that I was not asking them to do anything which would in any way impair the efficiency of the many public services, but stated that the prosecution of the wax was paramount to all other questions, and that to do this" men, money, and munitions were essential. As a soldier at the front has stated, " The internal decorations of our house can well wait until we have made the foundations safe from attack from outside." I am not at all doubtful of the ultimate result of the war, but the hour of peace is not yet at hand. When it is, it will have to be on the terms of our Allies. Anything short of this will leave the whole world in constant dread of a repetition of the dreadful carnage of the past two years. The fact of the war being so far from our shores seems to have dimmed our vision of what our fate would be if by any chance the Allies were defeated. We have passed through a phenomenal decade of prosperity, which is indicated by the following figures : - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="080331191612066_14_4.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>There has been no period in our history that has been more prosperous than the past ten years, and this may account for the revel in public expenditure which is still rampant in both the Commonwealth and the State activities. The time has surely arrived when we should call a halt and prepare for the aftermath that is certain to follow this world-wide war. I am pleased to report that my appeal to the officers and my consultations with Ministers were not in vain, but greater economies will yet, I think, be made. </para>
                    <para>This portion of the Government's policy is  far-reaching,   and will embrace not only a close scrutiny of all departmental proposals for' expenditure, but an early and full consideration in relation to each of the large spending Departments as to whether current expenditure can be reduced without affecting efficiency, and without reducing existing public facilities and conveniences beyond what is fair and reasonable to provide in time of war. </para>
                    <para>Coming into office when nearly half the year has gone, I find that Departments have already put in hand the several schemes of the year, and it is difficult to at once effect the economies which might have been made before the year's work began. I have already found it possible, however, to curtail expenditure in some directions, and am continuing my investigations. </para>
                    <para>I am keeping in view that it is necessary to economize the resources of the Commonwealth in order that the war may be carried on, also that costs are at present so high as to demand the postponement, where possible, of works which, under more favorable circumstances, might be undertaken. As regards the extra costs, it will be useful to quote the following figures, which have been supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician, namely: - </para>

                </para>
                <para>In the above decreases I have included £637,900 for expenditure on Additions, New Works, and Buildings. </para>
                <para>I might, however, have taken credit for a decrease of £730,884, because I found that after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs'</inline> speech of 27th September, 1916, his Estimates were increased at the request of the various Departments to the extent of £92,984. </para>
                <para>According to the amended figures supplied by the Defence Department, and allowing for the improvement shown above, the amount which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> expected to borrow for war during the financial year may be reduced by £5,850,000. </para>
                <para>Sinking Fund. In the financial statement which the late Treasurer made to the House on 27th September last, provision was made during 1916-17 for contributions to sinking funds on all loans for works purposes in accordance with the existing law, and in addition 2¼ per cent. on all war loans. The amount so provided was £2,747,000. </para>
                <para>A sinking fund of 2¼ per cent. per annum accumulated at 4½ per cent. per annum would extinguish the debt in twenty-five years. </para>
                <para>If contributions to the sinking fund during 1916-17 are limited to the requirements of the existing law, namely, 10s. per cent. per annum on Commonwealth Inscribed Stock issued for Works, with 5 per cent. per annum in respect of certain rapidly wasting works, also a 10s. per cent. per annum contribution on war loans raised from the public in Australia, the amount so required would be £423,555, or a saving of £2,323,445 on the amount provided by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs.</inline></para>
                <para>A sinking fund of 10s. per cent. per annum accumulated at 4½ per cent. per annum would extinguish the debt in fifty-three years. </para>
                <para>If a 1 per cent. contribution to the sinking fund were made on all loans raised by the Commonwealth, excepting the loans raised in London for the States, the amount required would be £1,301,778, or a saving of £1,445,222 on the amount provided by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs.</inline></para>
                <para>A sinking fund of 1 per cent. per annum accumulated at 4½ per cent. per annum would extinguish the debt in thirty-nine years. </para>
                <para>The question of the proper disposal of Commonwealth Sinking Funds is important. </para>
                <para>At present, we have at the credit of Commonwealth Sinking Funds the amount of £388,313. Of this, £158,380 has been invested in Commonwealth Treasury-bills, and £140,630 in Commonwealth Inscribed Stock. The balance, £89,303, is held in cash, and is now awaiting investment. Following the usual practice, the investment would probably be made in the War Loan. Thus our Sinking Funds are not held for the redemption of our loans, but have always been used for subscribing to fresh Commonwealth loans, and the money has been expended for the Commonwealth's current needs. The position created is equivalent to the direct expenditure of that money on Commonwealth present requirements. </para>
                <para>It is right that taxation should be arranged so that, in addition to an amount sufficient to meet ordinary expenditure, there shall be raised an amount to be taken in reduction of loans. Assuming that the returns from taxation can be kept up to about the same level, it is clear that at the end of the war there will be a margin above current needs which can then be paid into a sinking fund. During the war, however, it does not seem wise that the amount raised by taxation in excess of ordinary requirements should be paid into a sinking fund. As the law stands, such sinking fund could be used for the purchase of new Commonwealth securities, and be expended on works or other services. Assuming that such investment were prohibited by law, it seems that the sinking funds could be used only in one of two ways, namely: - </para>

                    <item label="(a)">

                    <item label="(b)">
                        <para>To place the funds in the hands of the Treasurer or trustees with directions to invest them in short-dated securities other than those of the Commonwealth, so that the money will be available at the dates of maturity of Commonwealth loan. </para>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <para>As regards the first course, it may be said that no advantage would be gained at present. Indeed, we might pay in the re-purchase a price higher than the subscription price, especially when we consider that certain commissions have to be paid on the raising of loans. </para>
                <para>As regards the second course, it must be pointed out that it is not possible to place funds beyond control of the Parliament of the day. Even if the Constitution were altered, it could be again altered. Particularly during the present crisis does it seem unwise to create a large sinking fund, because, should the war last much longer, every resource of the Commonwealth will be used for existing requirements, and it is not likely that sinking funds would be left intact. </para>
                <para>I suggest the wisest course is to arrange taxation so that, above other requirements to be met out of taxation, there shall be raised an amount equal to 1 per cent. of the whole amount of war indebtedness. The additional amount of 1 per cent. would be used to meet war expenditure, and thus the raising of so much of war loans would be avoided. </para>
                <para class="block">The effect of such a course would be practically the same as if the 1 per cent, were placed at the credit of the sinking fund and used immediately for the re-purchase of Commonwealth War Loan securities. The proposed method will be an effective way of insuring that the extra taxation shall go to the relief of War Loans, and arrangements will be made so that, immediately on the cessation of war, the amount of 1 per cent, on all loans shall be paid into the credit of a sinking fund, and definitely ear-marked for the sole purpose of paying off the loans. </para>
                <para>Questions are frequently asked as to the number of years required to pay off a debt by means of a sinking fund, and the following particulars may be found useful by honorable members. It is assumed that the sinking fund will earn interest at the rate of 4^ per cent, per annum. </para>

                <para>Treasurer's Advance. In the first Supply Bill of the current financial year there was granted as advance to the  Treasurer  the sum of £600,000, and in the second Supply Bill the sum of £1,100,000, or £1,700,000 in all. </para>
                <para>On taking charge at the Treasury I found that the Treasurer had authorized for expenditure since 1st July last the whole amount of his advance, namely, £1,700,000. Now it seems to me that a change is required. That was a very large sum of money for the Parliament to grant to the Administration. </para>
                <para>It must be remembered that there is really no restriction upon the Treasurer as to the purposes on which he can expend the moneys granted from his advance. The amount is voted in a lump sum, which is described in the Supply Bill merely as " Advance to the Treasurer." </para>
                <para>I am not criticising any particular Minister in bringing this matter under the notice of Parliament. All my predecessors have been intrusted with large sums, hut there has been a tendency to increase the amount intrusted, and I think the time has come when Parliament should reconsider the position. It can scarcely be contended that the practice which has sprung up tends towards economy. It is necessary, in my opinion, that, as far as possible, Parliament should indicate the purposes for which it grants public funds. </para>
                <para>It is not contended that some amount of advance should not be given, because all Governments find that, in spite of most carefully estimating the proposed expenditure, circumstances arise which could not have been foreseen, but the amount given to the Treasurer for purposes to be decided upon by himself should be kept as low as possible. </para>
                <para>No amount has been included in the present Supply Bill for Treasurer's advance. The Bill includes provision for works which, during last financial year, were paid for out of Loan Funds. These works include construction of Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, railway in the Northern Territory, placing telephone wires underground, erection of Commonwealth Offices in London, machinery at Cockatoo Island, and purchase of postal lands and lands in the Federal Capital Territory. For some years prior to 1st July last, it was the practice to provide for these works by loans from the Notes Fund. The notes in circulation having now reached the large amount of £46,000,000, it is not thought wise to make any further issue for works purposes. Also it seems inadvisable, while the necessity for raising such heavy loans for war purposes exists, that any attempt should be made to raise a loan from the public for works. </para>
                <para>It seems a necessity, therefore, that works shall be provided for out of current revenue. The money for these works should be provided for in the Supply Bill. I have included not only provision to carry us on during the next three months, but have included also the amounts paid out of revenue since 1st July last, and charged to Treasurer's advance. This seems necessary, because the whole amount required for the eight months of the financial year should be brought for appropriation by Parliament. </para>
                <para>The following table shows the amounts included in the Supply Bill for works paid for in previous year from Loan Fund:- </para>

                </para>
                <para>When the Supply Bill has been passed, the expenditure on these works will be cleared from Treasurer's Advance and charged finally to the votes in Supply. This will leave the Treasurer with a balance in Treasurer's Advance, which will be available to meet the unforeseen requirements of the Government, and thus it has become unnecessary to ask for any amount of Treasurer's Advance at present. </para>

                <para>Large Treasury Balances. Another matter to which I desire to draw the attention of the Committee is the very large accumulation of Treasury balances which are not earning interest. On 31st October last there was in the Commonwealth Bank in Australia at the credit of current account a total of £20,275,570; there was on fixed deposit in the Commonwealth Bank, bearing interest at 2 per cent. per annum, £2,000,000; current account in English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, Darwin, £1,186; total, £22,276,756. In addition, there was in London, on the same date, £4,155,095; a grand total of £26,431,851. </para>
                <para>Included in the foregoing are moneys borrowed for war purposes, amounting to £20,468,771. </para>
                <para>The amount of £4,155,095 in London was nearly all lent to the market at current rates of interest. </para>
                <para>I am looking into the matter in an endeavour either to obtain interest on larger portions of these funds, or to provide that moneys lent to the Commonwealth shall be paid into the Treasury at dates more nearly corresponding with the dates on which moneys have to be expended. </para>
                <para>Supply Bills. For this financial year Parliament has already passed two Supply Bills for ordinary services, and two for new works. The third Bills now submitted are to cover expenditure for three months, and will provide for the needs of the Commonwealth up to 28th February. 1917. </para>
                <para>First ordinary Supply Bill, without Treasurer's Advance and refunds of revenue, £2,082,388; second ordinary Supply Bill, without Treasurer's Advance and refunds of revenue, £3,823,580 ; third ordinary Supply Bill, without refunds of revenue (no Treasurer's Advance), £3,143,290. </para>
                <para>New Works Supply Bills - First, £662,085; second, £918,000; third, £2,702,760. </para>
                <para>The third new Works Supply Bill includes £1,776,500 for works which last year were paid for from loan, and which up to the present, in this financial year, have been charged to Treasurer's Advance. Deducting that amount, the present new Works Supply Bill provides for £926,260 for ordinary new works. </para>
                <para>The Supply Bills do not contain expenditure for any new propositions. They contain provision for only the usual requirements of the Commonwealth, including the continuance of works authorized by Parliament in last financial year. </para>

                        <para>.- At the request of the Leader of the Opposition, I propose to open the debate upon the financial statement. First of all, I congratulate our old friend on his appointment to the position of Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I am sure that every honorable member will recognise that he has come into his estate very recently, and that we must be generous in dealing with him. The financial figures were placed before us in September last by his predecessor in office, but action was not taken in regard to many matters, and the duty of bringing them before us again has devolved on him. The alterations that he has submitted are, in the main, in the right direction, but I disapprove altogether of some of the. methods of taxation proposed by the late Government, and adopted, with modifications, by the present Government. In criticising the financial statement, the views I express are my own, though I dope that my friends on the Opposition side will be found to a large extent in accord with them, and I am not actuated by any political motives, and am anxious to assist the Government. Money must be found for the war and for other purposes, but some of the methods by which the Government propose to raise it do not meet with my approval, nor do they follow any principle. We ought to adopt the easiest and best means of obtaining funds, and follow some principle in regard to financing the war, and adhere to it as far as possible. The principle that we should follow is that on which we have acted for the most part so far, though not altogether, namely, meeting the main expenditure out of loan funds, and providing interest and sinking fund "from revenue. It is a sound principle, especially in a new country, where there is so much to be done, and where our greatest duty is to increase the means of productivity. To talk of the country having millions of acres, without making those acres productive, is useless. The obligation rests on the Commonwealth to use all the money it can spare in the direction of increasing production. I quite agree with the Treasurer in regard to the exclusion of the Commonwealth war bonds from the proposed wealth levy. Their inclusion would have had a very disastrous effect, apart from the point of honour concerned. It was thoroughly understood that these bonds were to be free of taxation, and the proposal to put them in, the category of wealth liable to be levied on would mean that they might be rendered of little value if the process were continued, while it would act disastrously in regard to the securing of further loans. Therefore, I consider that the Treasurer has acted wisely and justly, and also in the interests of the Commonwealth, in proposing to exempt them. </para>

We should adopt the principle of paying for the war from loan funds, and providing interest and sinking fund from revenue. All the nations at war, including Great Britain, are in the main, and in some cases wholly, financing the war from loan funds. </para>

                            <para>- The proportion is small in comparison with the total expenditure. To a large extent Australia has been doing as the belligerent nations have been doing. I wish that it had done so to the full extent, because there are plenty of means of spending all that we can raise in wealth-producing works and industries. All that is necessary, and all that is advisable, is the annual provision of interest and sinking fund from revenue. The taxation methods of Australia are foolish, serious, and dangerous. In this new country, with a young, energetic population, desirous of reclaiming the wilderness and building up a great and virile nation, who would believe that there are two taxing machines in operation - the Federal Parliament and the State Parliaments - with plenary and equal powers of taxation, both engaged independently, and without much regard to what the other is doing, in taxing the same people and the same property ? </para>

                            <para>- I am not here to advocate a scheme just now. I am merely pointing out the fact. I do not think that such a system ought to exist, and I feel sure that it cannot exist for any length of time. It was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution. We talked around the subject, but it was said that there would never be a Commonwealth tax upon land and incomes except in times of great financial difficulty and emergency. We therefore left the Commonwealth and the States with complete co-ordinate powers of taxation. </para>

                    <para>Some one has suggested that we must have Unification. I do not know about that, but I do know that if this system of double taxation goes on it must destroy the Federation, because the people cannot and will not for long endure these two taxing machines operating upon £hem. I hope that the Treasurer will not think that I am altogether blaming him for this policy, although he is now seeking to give further effect to it. I put the whole blame on the Labour party. The taxation of land and incomes was not proposed in the Commonwealth Parliament by the Liberal party, and never would have been proposed by them. It was brought forward only when the Labour party came into power in 1910. </para>

For ten years, and until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and his party came into power, about the time when the Braddon blot terminated, the finances of this country were carefully administered. The law was observed. The Treasurer's advances were carefully controlled, and everything was done with the strictest regard for legality. Can any one say that this is so to-day, or that such a policy has been adopted since the Labour party came into power in 1910?  No. All is now changed. Recklessness and illegality have been rampant. Parliament has been ignored. The solidarity of the Caucus has defied attack. </para>

                            <para>- But the Government to which the honorable member belonged had no authority to take it. They acted without the authority, and even without the knowledge, of Parliament. No explanation of the transaction has ever been given to Parliament, no attempt has been made to secure the necessary authority for it. No one, however, seems to care. Such illegalities, a few years ago, would have sounded the deathknell of the Government responsible for them. Nowadays they are passed by because the solid Labour Caucus majority has defied every attack. For all practical purposes during the last six years, in regard to finance, there might just as well have been no Parliament. </para>

On the other hand, the Labour party have been in office with a large majority, and we might as well have had no Parliament at all as a Parliament controlled by their Caucus.  I  repeat that they have defied attack. They have been absolutely irresponsible, and have had no regard for our protests. There is on these Estimates a proposed vote of £500,000 in respect of certain sugar transactions. The little  I  know of the matter leads me to say that this expenditure is due to* bad administration on the part of State and Commonwealth Governments. Some one has blundered, and the people, in consequence, have to pay £500,000. But no one seems to care. And this is what we call parliamentary control of finance! </para>

The primary industries are already subject to taxation. The land is taxed twice over by two different taxing masters, and any income derived from it is also levied upon by two different taxing authorities. </para>

The primary industries are already subject to two land taxes and two income taxes, and this further levy is now proposed on the same assets. It will kill the goose that is laying the golden egg. I am very glad that the present Treasurer has* exempted gold mining, which I regard as a primary industry, from his war profits proposals; but, as one who knows something of the subject and who is anxious to be fair. I must say that I see no more reason for exempting gold mining than there is for exempting coal, copper, tin, and lead mining, as well as the other mineral industries. </para>

                            <para>- Even if they are making a profit, these particular taxation proposals will not apply to them unless their returns are greater than they were in pre-war times. The copper, tin, lead, and other mining industries will not produce much revenue under this scheme, but the effect of the war profits taxation will be to do a great deal of injury to them, by restricting and discouraging enterprise. Gold, copper, tin, lead, and other mineral industries do much good to other industries. They are not in competition with any other enterprise, and no industry is affected by them except in a beneficial way. This wealth, which comes out of the bowels of the earth, has an influence for good on every other industry, and should not* be levied upon, except by means of the ordinary land and income taxes. Such industries, on the contrary, require additional encouragement and assistance at the hands of the Legislatures of this country. I am therefore altogether against this proposal. It has already injured and retarded mining enterprise throughout Australia. The result is that no one will now ''look at a mining investment because of these war profits taxation proposals. In their effect they are very like the action of the late Government in interfering with the flotation of mining companies, because, forsooth, some one might possibly be taken in. Is not that danger always going on1! <inline font-style="italic">Caveat emptor! "</inline> Let the buyer beware." He has always had to be careful, and why should he be exempted now from the necessity of taking reasonable precautions? Why should enterprise be stopped and the flotation and development of mining  undertakings be interfered with at the present time, when capital is so hard to secure ? It is difficult for me to understand how it could have entered any one's mind to interfere with mining enterprise at a time like the present, when our desire should be to encourage every one to launch out and invest capital, so as to increase employment and produce more wealth. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but there are not so many company flotations in connexion with agricultural pursuits as there are in regard to mining operations. Mining, as most of us know, is very risky and precarious, and, as a rule, the profits derived from it are not very large. In some cases splendid returns are obtained, I am told, but it is not so in respect of every mining, venture. We must not cease to remember that already mining enterprises have to pay income and land taxation, and now, for no reason at all, this additional burden is cast upon them. I refuse to believe that any one will invest his money in mining ventures when, at the most, a profit of only 7 per cent, or 8 per cent, can be secured. The chances are, in many cases, that the mining investor will lose his money; at all events, he has always to take the risk. To say, therefore, in such circumstances, that when he does strike a good thing, he will be satisfied to get 7 per cent, out of it, is to say that which no one will believe. If <inline font-style="italic">7</inline> per cent, is to be the full extent of his good fortune, he will leave mining investments alone. Another point worthy of consideration is that some of the old and flourishing companies which have been paying high dividends for many years will not be affected in any way by this war profits taxation. On the other hand, a new enterprise which, since the outbreak of the war, has been fortunate enough to strike a rich patch, will have from 50 to 75 per cent, of its profits taken by the Government, while the shareholders will receive only 7 per cent, on their invested capital. Such interference with the industry must rebound upon those responsible for it, and end in disaster. It will do no good, but, on the contrary, will result in a great deal of harm. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the proposal. I am dealing with what was really the honorable member's own proposal when he held office as Treasurer. This legislation, which I believe emanated from the fertile brain of the honorable member for Capricornia, in so far as it refers to the primary industries, should be entitled, " A Bill to destroy enterprise in the development of the primary industries of Australia." I have made these observations with a view of showing the Government how far I disapprove of certain of their proposals, and I appeal to them and to the Treasurer not to proceed in such a suicidal course. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the levy on wealth proposals of the Government. I am glad that the Treasurer has decided to extend the payments over five instead of three years; but I should like to see this levy wiped out altogether, and the necessary revenue obtained annually in the same way as other war expenditure, the revenue bearing only interest, and sinking fund. The proposed levy is as unnecessary as it is unjustifiable. The income from land and that from other sources are already taxed twice over, by the Commonwealth, and by the Governments of the States. Are the savings of the people to be taxed out of existence?  capital  is what we most want in this country, and it is practically being all taxed away. My objections to this proposal are that it is bad in principle, and that this method of obtaining the money is not required. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I would borrow it in the same way as we will have borrowed by the end of this year the  £141,000,000  for the war. The honorable member supported a Government that borrowed largely. Wealth in land and in other investments is already taxed both by the Commonwealth Government and by the Governments of the States, and it must continue to bear the burden of taxation. I am not advocating that those who possess wealth shall not be taxed. The wealthy must be taxed, and I believe that they are willing to pay the necessary taxes, but the taxation should be made as easy as possible, so that the country may not be injured by it. We do not want spoliation and confiscation, which is what some honorable members have been preaching. They would take by force from the people their possessions. No doubt the honorable member for Capricornia is not personally responsible for this proposal. I think that he would not have made it could he have helped himself. But he was forced to pander to a clamour for the conscription of wealth, which was ungenerous, and without just foundation. The majority of the people of this country have not unduly suffered by the war. That 'is shown by the fact that last year the deposits in the savings banks were increased by  £5,000,000,  and those in the other banks by  £20,000,000-  a very satisfactory state of affairs. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the expenditure" proposed by the Treasurer. The normal expenditure of the year immediately preceding that in which war broke out  - 1913-14 -  was  £23,161,000,  and the normal expenditure for this year  - 1916-17 -  is to be  £32,586,000,  an increase of  £9,425,000.  Had the honorable member for Grey been long in office I should have felt justified in very adversely criticising; this immense increase. The expenditure in the year before the war was almost the largest on record, and it should not have been greatly exceeded in following years in which war was raging. There will, of course, be the increases caused by interest on war loans and contributions to sinking funds, but the large in creases that we have had have been the result of want of reasonable caution and of reckless expenditure. It seems to be the rule with Governments ridden by Labour Caucuses to be extravagant and to waste money. I hope that this Government - now that it is no longer Caucus ridden - will break away from that tradition. The Labour Governments which preceded it had the note issue fund to draw on, but this Government will not be able to get money from that source, and will, therefore, be brought up with a round turn. Unfortunately, however, it is proposed to continue out of ordinary revenue the spendthrift policy which has prevailed during the last six years. The normal expenditure for this year is  £8,521,000  more than that of last year. Here are some of the increases - Old-age pensions,  £800,000;  war pensions,  £870,000;  Home Affairs,  £230,000;  new works and works hitherto paid for from loans,  £3,778,000;  and other items which make the total increase that I have named. It must be borne in mind that those are the increases over the corresponding expenditures of last year and not the total sums to be expended. Although the Treasurer has told us in his financial statement that " The Supply Bills do not contain an expenditure for any new propositions," there is an increase of  £3,778,000  from revenue in the expenditure on public works. The total expenditure on public works payable from revenue is to be  £6,664,974,  including  £2,270,790  expended on works hitherto constructed out of loan money. The loan money was obtained from the note issue fund, but the Treasurer tells us that the note issue is now as large as he thinks it wise to make it. Therefore, no money is available from that source. We are paying,  as I have said, out of revenue this year a sum of  £2,270,790  for works which previously were paid for from loans, viz.,  £1,400,000  for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway,  £392,790  for conduits,  £100,000  for Federal Capital land,  £173,000  for the construction of offices in London,  £70,000  for post and telegraph buildings,  £70,000  for the Katherine River railway, and  £65,000  for the Cockatoo dock. Already, on the seven items that I have enumerated, nearly  £8,000,000  has been provided out of loan funds. About  £9,000,000 has been provided for public works out of the note issue fund; about £20,000,000 more being accounted for in advances to the States, and in other ways. The balance of the £6,664,974, amounting to £4,394,184, goes to provide for the ordinary new works of the year. That money has also to be obtained out of revenue. The increase in the expenditure on new works this year over the expenditure of last year is £1,527,573. The amount of £4,394,184 to be expended on new works is made up of £1,140,000 for naval and military works, £150,000 for Federal Capital works, and expenditure, amounting to £3,104,184, on miscellaneous services. The sum of £856,618 has already been spent on Federal Capital new works. </para>

                    <para>I now come to the cost of the war. The estimated cost of the war this year is £78,956,001 from loan, and £6,343,499 from revenue, making a total of £85,299,500. We had loan moneys in hand on 30th June, 1916, £17,074,192. We have, therefore, to raise the balance of £68,225,308, and it is proposed to obtain it in the following way: - From revenue, £6,343,499; from British Government, £13,000,000; repayment of advance by States, £2,950,000; and by loan, £45,931,809; a total of £68,225,308. The estimated total cost of the war up to 30th June next, according to the published figures, will be £141,500,000; and of this, £131,000,000 will be raised by loan and £10,500,000 by revenue. </para>
                    <para>I should like to say a word about what I may describe as the financial orgy which has been going on, not only in the States, but in the Commonwealth, during the past two years. On 30th June, 1914, before the war, the indebtedness of the States amounted to £325,500,000. In one year, by 30th June, 1915, this indebtedness had increased to £350,500,000, an increase of £25,000,000 in one year, the largest increase on record. I am sorry I cannot give the exact figures, because I could not get them in accurate form from the Statistician or the Government for the year ended 30th June last. Australia must be a great country to stand this reckless exploitation. </para>

                            <para>- The ex-Treasurer  will allow me to say that the money for the railway up to the present time has not been obtained from borrowing, but from the Note Fund, which has cost next to nothing. I do not propose to say anything more. I should have been better pleased had I had something more agreeable to say to the Treasurer, who, of course, has not had time to deal with all these difficult matters. I hope, however that the honorable gentleman will take into consideration what I have said as an expression of opinion from one who has looked into the matter, and who thoroughly believes in the arguments he has put forward. I also hope that the Treasurer will reconsider the matter of the taxation of profits  on the primary industries, because such taxation I regard as mischievous. I should further like the Government not to think of levying on wealth or capital for repatriation or other purposes, but to obtain the money in the same way as it obtains the money required for the war. Such revenue as is required can be raised in the ordinary way, and not by taxing that which is doubly taxed already, and by means which would prove an interference with, and would reduce, the wealth-producing power of the people. Under all the circumstances, I hope and trust that the Treasurer will take the usual means for raising the necessary money. We ought to make each year finance itself - that is the basic principle of our public finance. We ought to raise enough money for each year, and, if possible, at the end of each year, have a small balance in hand. I feel sure, from what the Treasurer has said in the course of his statement, that he will economize wherever he can, and that what he terms " the revel in public expenditure which is still rampant in both the Commonwealth and the States ' ' will cease. The note issue is not now available for any continuance of reckless expenditure; and I can only hope that a saner system of finance will be established, and that the financial orgy of the past few years has now come to an end. </para>

Copies had been given to the press also, and the Treasurer was busy until midnight withdrawing them. Yet no member of the party which I have the honour to lead could obtain one. I remind the Treasurer that that is not the way in which to get business conducted pleasantly. </para>

The right honorable member for Parramatta stated that he was not prepared to proceed with the debate on that statement, and I sent word to the Prime Minister that I would be ready to proceed with the debate. In my opinion, it would have been better to have debated the statement which the Prime Minister made with regard to recruiting, the conduct of the referendum campaign, and other matters. </para>

It is known to most honorable members that an outline of the late Treasurer's financial proposals, namely, that the Government should tax 50 per cent, of the war-time profits for the year ending the 30th June last, and 100 per cent, of such profits for the year ending 30th June, 1917, was agreed to by a meeting of the then Ministerial party. </para>

                            <para>- I am not sorry for that. But the present position is that the Government must ascertain from the Leader of the Opposition what their taxation proposals are to be. The war profits tax is to be reduced, and we are told that other exemptions are to be made. I was not in favour of some of the exemptions which had been promised by the late Treasurer, but I notice that additional exemptions are to be given, notably to fruit-growers. Those people are obtaining to-day from jam factories prices for their fruit which they would not be able to get if there had been no war. The War Office has ordered from Australia many million pounds of jam - one order alone comprised 25,000,000 lbs. - and everybody knows that but for these enormous jam orders fruit would not be fetching anything like the price which is being obtained to-day. </para>

This portion of the financial statement deals with the mining industry. Will the board consist of men connected with the mining industry, or will it be composed of public servants ? I was dealing with that point when the honorable member for Parramatta, by way of interjection, stated that if the present Government were like the late Government, they would fill the positions with members of their own party, or, to use the elegant phrase of the honorable member for Wakefield, with " men of their own kidney." </para><interjection>

                            <para>- We should learn something from the Government as to the type of men to be appointed as referees, because the selection of industries to be exempted will have a most important effect upon the whole of our taxation proposals. The war time profits tax, as originally proposed, may have affected many Australian industries and interests adversely, particularly those companies drawing all their income from abroad. For example, there are many tin-dredging companies operating in the East that have their head-quarters in Australia. I read in the press the other day that, on account of the foreshadowing of this taxation, one of these companies had already made arrangements to transfer its head-quarters from Sydney to Penang, or some other place in the East, in order to escape the tax. We may be able to prevent Australian mining companies carrying on operations in Australia from transferring their  head-quarters to a spot outside the Commonwealth in order to escape taxation, but I cannot imagine that we can have any opportunity by means of a war time profits tax of dealing with companies which, though they may have Australian money in them - which money we get at through the income taxation - draw their income from outside Australia, and choose to transfer their head-quarters to some spot outside. There are half-a-dozen or more tin and gold-dredging companies operating in the Philippines and elsewhere with their headquarters in Australia, and we should be careful in our financial proposals to avoid doing anything to cause them to transfer their head-quarters from here to elsewhere, because they have been the means of finding employment for many Australians, not only in the actual dredging operations, but also in the manufacture of the dredges ana other equipment, which has been secured here. Mining and dredging companies occupy a unique position. As the Treasurer has pointed out in his financial statement, every year they operate their assets decline. </para>

                            <para>- Other metals have not enhanced in price. I commend the Treasurer for having placed in his financial statement a table showing the average wholesale price of certain manufactured metals used in building, but it would have been well if he had added another table showing the average price of the raw metals, such as tin, lead, copper, and zinc. We would have been in a far better position to deal with this matter. If copper has increased 40 per cent. owing to the war, we are entitled to tax copper-producing companies proportionately, and what applies to copper applies to every other metal whose price has been enhanced because of the war. I understand that the original War Time Profits Bill proposed to exempt certain industries. I am not sure whether the pastoral industry was exempted. </para>

                            <para>- No; the price of butter in December, 1916, is 4d. per lb. higher than that ruling in December, 1914, and 4d. per lb., if not 5d. per lb., more than was paid in December, 1913. The honorable member for Richmond will bear me out in saying that the wholesale price of1s. 4d. per lb. in Australia is about 4d. per lb. in excess of what was the average December price for at least five or six years preceding the war. </para>

                            <para>- There has certainly been none for the last two or three months, but as to. that I have no complaint to make. The point that I wish to emphasize is that all these people, on account of the war, are receiving increased prices. The ship-owner has doubled or trebled his freights because of the war. It cannot be said that that increase is due to the submarine menace. In making my estimate I have allowed for the insurance rates. The insurance paid to-day in respect of war risks is probably about 5 per cent., whereas prior to the war it may not have been J per cent. That 5 per cent., however, is nothing compared with the enormous profits that ship-owners are reaping to-day. My complaint is that when any body of workmen make a demand which will even up conditions, having regard to the increase in the cost of living, they are told that they are holding a pistol at the head of the community. I object to that being said of the worker? when it is not said of the squatter, who is getting 100 per cent, more for his wool, or of the butter producer, the meat producer, and others, who are all reaping enhanced prices. They are entitled to those increased prices if they can secure them, and at the same time the working man has a right to his increased wage if he can obtain it. 'I should have been glad if an opportunity had been given us to digest this financial statement before being called upon to discuss it. As it is, it has been sprung upon us to-day. Apart from the forecast which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> about a week ago, no honorable member of our party knew what the proposals would be. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> announced that the war profits taxation would be decreased from 100 per cent, to 75 per cent., and that the payment of the wealth tax would be spread over five years instead of three years. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> made a very good guess. </para>

                            <para>- He says that, if 100 per cent, were taken, there would be no incentive to any man to make large profits. I am reminded of the fact that a gentleman in a large way of business told me the other day that, in view of this taxation, the making of large profits was of no advantage to him - that he would not increase his business, as the late Government proposed to take the whole of his war profits. He was setting out to play golf when I met him, and I could not help thinking that the adoption of such an attitude by him would give his competitors a better chance to make a living. It is the big businesses that are making the large profits. I do not desire to mention the names of any large firms in Melbourne' - such, for instance, as a firm which has sixty or seventy grocery stores, or the owner of huge stores who conducts, in association with them, large manufactories, and probably employs 2,000 or 3,000 hands. What applies to Melbourne in that regard would no doubt apply to other State capitals. If exorbitant charges are imposed on the people, we have a right to take cognisance of those charges, and to take as much as we can of the additional profits, in order to pay for the cost of the war. People in a large way of business have as much to&gt; lose as have any other members of the community. I give way to no one in my desire that the Allies should be successful; but if they were unsuccessful, with the result that the enemy landed in Australia, these people would find out that they had as much to lose as any one in the community. Those who are building up huge profits should be taxed to the uttermost. </para>

                            <para>- No. There is an exemption of £200 in the case of the small man. These people are to be allowed to make 7 or 8 per cent, on their investments, and an exemption of £200 is allowed. While the big man is growing bigger, the small man is being crushed. That, apparently, is inevitable in our present state of civilization. The grocer who is able to carry on a number of shops can buy at a lower rate than his smaller competitors. In some cases the whole profits of a grocer in a big way of business have been gained by way of special discounts obtained from other companies, from whom they have been able to make large purchases. I am not prepared to say now what action I shall personally take when the proposal comes before us to reduce the war profits tax from 100 per cent, to 75 per cent. With regard to the levy on wealth for repatriation purposes, the only alteration proposed is that the payments shall extend over five instead of three years, so that this year the Government will take only one-fifth of the levy. </para>

I should have liked to have from the Government a statement as to their intentions with regard to the immediate future. A Supply Bill has been thrown on the table, and instead of discussing it, we are proceeding to debate the financial statement that has been submitted by the Treasurer. I should like to know when it is proposed to adjourn for the Christmas vacation. The Government apparently hope - I say " hope " advisedly - to secure three months' Supply, but I give the Treasurer notice that we do not desire that he should obtain more than two months' Supply. We have not been told when the general election is to take place. An extension of the life of the 'Senate, so as to make the Senate elections concurrent with those of the House of Representatives, has been mooted for some time. </para>

When the Tariff was under discussion in the first session, we resumed our sittings early in February, I think, after a vacation of less than two months. I understand from the electoral officials that, to enable honorable senators to be sworn in on 1st July, an election must take place not later than May, so that it is time that we heard from the Government on the subject. </para>

                            <para>- I have urged the inadvisability of granting any Supply until we have a statement from the Government as to their intentions regarding next general election. I am well aware that these are abnormal times, and that in other countries within the Empire the life of Parliaments have been extended. It must not be forgotten, however, that we have a written Constitution, and that it is impossible to extend the life of Parliament without an amendment of that Constitution. Before any amendment of this kind can be made, the question must be submitted to the people; and we cannot contemplate any amendment by means of the Imperial Parliament without some reference to the electors. If this Parliament, or any section of it,  refused  to pass a Bill of the kind suggested, we should be faced with an election for, at least, one House at the latter end of May next year. </para>

                            <para>- Up to the present, the super-parliament has not said anything on this particular matter. At the present time, my only anxiety is to know the intentions of the Government in regard to  the  next general election, and 'I shall be glad to hear something from- the Prime Minister, who, I see, is now present. In the statement we had this afternoon, the Treasurer points to a decrease in the expenditure out of revenue on Home Affairs, military and naval matters, amounting in round figures to £760,000; and I should like to know whether that means that works have been cut down to that extent. This, of course, is a time when we are all anxious to economize; but when our soldiers come back they will not all be able to resume their former trades and avocations, and this reduction on public works for the remaining six or seven months of this year is a serious matter. I cannot read anything into the statement except that there will be this much less expenditure than that proposed by the ex-Treasurer. I should like to know in what directions the cutting-down is to be -done? Is it intended to curtail on the East-West railway, or on the work at Canberra ? I am sure we should be obliged if the Treasurer would supply us with a schedule of the works that it is proposed to proceed with, and, of course, those with which it is proposed not to proceed. There is a feeling abroad that advantage has been taken of the coal strike to shut down factories long enough to throw men out of employment, so that they would be compelled to enlist. The statement that coal will not be available until the end of January has caused many people to say that this is due to a desire to put a kind of compulsion on men to which they ought not to be subjected. </para>

                            <para>- No, I do not; and I have already said I am pleased to hear the Minister for the Navy say that it is the intention of the Government to so facilitate matters that the factories, in the majority of instances, can be started on Monday next; indeed, I hope that all the industries may be started on that date. However that may be, if there is to be the decrease in public works indicated by the Treasurer's figures, we have a right to know in what directions the expenditure is to be cut. The Treasurer talks of economy, but the printed statement he read to-day is sent out in an expensive cover, although we all know there is a shortage of paper all over the world at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- Thank you. When the ex-Treasurer's statement was before the House, we were told of a sinking fund that would wipe out the debt in, I think, twenty-five years; whereas now we have suggested a sinking fund of 1 per cent. which shall have that effect in thirty-nine years. Where is the sinking fund to come from at the present time? I take it that the only way in which an individual or a Government can pay off a debt is by having a larger revenue than expenditure; but, apparently, we are to provide a sinking fund by borrowing more money. </para>

Further, this is the first financial statement, in the history of this Commonwealth Parliament, on which an adjournment has not been granted., I know it will be urged that there is a shortage of time. </para>

The Prime Minister refused to recognise my amendment as a vote of want of confidence ; and if I am so treated as a private member, I shall use the forms of the House in any way I feel to be perfectly legitimate. We have had a statement from the Minister that the Chief Electoral Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham,</inline> did issue instructions anticipating the regulations; and every member of the Liberal party is aware of the fact, though the honorable member for Lang was conveniently absent, knowing that something had been perpetrated that could not be defended. Honorable members of the Liberal party will find it difficult to defend their position on the hustings. </para>

                            <para>- I would not be surprised if that were so. The Liberals live on the Government, and the Government live on the Liberals. Like Siamese twins, united they stand, divided they fall. While the Liberal party supports the Government, the Ministry are absolutely safe. But, as I told the Treasurer earlier, I do not think one penny of Supply should be granted until we have a statement from the Government as to what they propose to do in regard to the elections. Even when the House has received that information, I shall not be prepared to grant Supply for more than two months. That would enable the Government to carry on until the middle of February, when Parliament would re-assemble, and honorable members would have an opportunity of dealing with the various taxation proposals in a proper way, -instead of rushing through them, as the Treasurer asks us to do. Bills to impose this taxation will be brought down, and the Standing Orders suspended so that the measures may be rushed through with a minimum of delay. I again tell the Treasurer that time should not be made an excuse for hurrying such legislation through the House, without allowing opportunity for due consideration by honorable members.  £4, 000, 000; an increase of 25 per cent, on that amount would represent, roughly, another £1,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- In this instance he , has economized to the extent of a couple of lines of print. We are principally discussing the proposed new taxation, which is mainly for lie purpose of paying the interest on our abnormal war expenditure. I contend that the total indebtedness of the Commonwealth and the interest thereon should be stated, together with the aggregate new taxation, in order that honorable members might see at a glance whether the proposed additional impost will meet the interest bill. It is not fair that honorable members should not know the exact financial position. The previous Treasurer estimated to receive £2,000,000 from the levy on war profits for the year, and the present Treasurer estimates the receipts to be short of that in the second year by £1,100,000, making his receipts from this source £900,000. From the tax on entertainments he anticipates £700,000, as compared with his predecessor's estimate of £2,000,000. From income tax, the previous Treasurer estimated to receive £4,000,000 plus 25 per cent. The present Treasurer proposes an increase of 25 per cent., which may be estimated to produce another £1,000,000. If the Treasurer obtains a further £150,000 from that source by wiping out exemptions, the total receipts from new taxation will be £6,750,000. But what is the debt of the Commonwealth? Again we have to refer back to a statement of the former Treasurer, and we find that at the 30th June, 1916, the public debt of the Commonwealth was £101,252,949, whilst at the end of this financial year it was estimated to reach £175,597,000. If that is to be our indebtedness, it is fair that this Parliament should raise sufficient money by additional taxation to at least pay the interest on that amount. Are we doing that? The interest on that indebtedness, at 4£ per cent., will be £7,900,000, and the total receipts from new taxation are estimated to be only £6,750,000, leaving a deficit of £1,150,000. It is just as essential that the war should be regarded from the financial point of view as from the point of view of man-power. We cannot prosecute the war to a successful finish unless we have the necessary money. We have to provide the money, and the Government have set before us proposals estimated to raise an amount of additional taxation considerably less than is required to pay the interest on our borrowing. Parliament should at least be able to show the public how it is proposed to pay interest on this large indebtedness. Even though the Treasurer estimates to receive £6,750,000, it is quite possible that his anticipations will not be realized. Although he is expecting £700,000 from the tax on amusements, he may not get it. In regard to war profits, in order to give an incentive to those who are making as much as possible out of their businesses, the  Government propose  to levy only 75 per cent, of the profits, instead of 100 per cent., as proposed by the previous Treasurer. It may be thought by many people that it is hardly worth while increasing their profits to any extent if they are to receive only 25 per cent, of the total. Profits may thus decrease, and if that happens, from what source are we to obtain the interest on all this money which we are obliged to borrow? I venture to say that we are not to get it under the proposals of the Treasurer. I am probably alone in this House in saying that there should be one tax only. I do not consider that the method of taxing different things is in the interests of the great masses of the people. I am aware that the masses of the people would say that the proper thing is to tax wealth, but I claim that all taxation of wealth falls back on the masses. It is certainly well known that if wealth is taxed to any great extent - that is wealth as we know it in Australia - it means taxation on industries, and that must be passed on to the workers, and the workers have to pay it. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I have argued in that way for years past. It is misleading the people to say, " We are putting this tax on the rich." The poorer people pay all the taxation that is imposed on the rich. In a time of national stress, when it is necessary to raise money in order to prosecute a war, the only legitimate way in which we can prevent the passing on of the taxation to the great masses of the people is to have nothing but an income tax, and to say to those people who have incomes over a certain amount, "In a time of national stress, when men are going to the front to fight in the interests of the country, and in order to protect the property of the country, you should hand over your income to the Treasury for the purpose of prosecuting the war." If we take all incomes over a given amount, the taxation cannot be passed on to the poor man. My suggestion is that all incomes over an amount sufficient for the domestic life of the individual should be made available to the Commonwealth Treasury. </para>

                            <para>- They can pay it in whichever way they like, but that would be an infinitesimal contribution compared with giving over a definite portion of their incomes for the purpose of carrying on the war. We cannot advocate sending away every man we can possibly secure, and at the same time heap up a very large debt, and tell these men when they come back that, though they went away to risk their lives for the country, while we remained at home and imposed certain taxation, which even failed to pay interest and sinking fund on that debt, they must take up the debt incurred to pay for their services at the front, and continue paying interest on it as long as they remain in Australia. The time has arrived when we should face the position. It is just as necessary to get money from the people who possess it as it is to get men to go to the front. But we are not facing the issue. Every man with an income over an amount sufficient to keep his domestic arrangements going should place the surplus into the Treasury during the continuance of the war. </para>

                            <para>- At a time like this, taking into consideration the differences in our daily occupations, all income over £400 a year should go into the Commonwealth Treasury. It would provide nearly sufficient to carry the war right through. If we raise £4,000,000 from the income tax, the tax is less on the average than1s. in the £1. If we base our estimate on twenty times the amount derived from the income tax, we should derive £80,000,000 in the direction that I have suggested. </para>

                    <para class="block">One can be patriotic in other ways than by going to the front, and it will be patriotism to find the money for the prosecution of the war. Something will have to be done to find the necessary money. If the war should continue for a couple of years the Allies will find great difficulty in financing it. There are very few honorable members who wish to see any compromise in regard to the war. We all wish to thrash the enemy at least, and to make reasonable terms so fax as the Allies are concerned, but we are not making provision for doing so. It is my duty as a public man to point out how necessary it is to make this provision. In my opinion the taxation proposals do not go far enough. We should have one tax only, and that an income tax. A wealth tax will inflict many -hardships. There are many widows with two or three houses valued at, say, £1,500 who are receiving from them just sufficient income to keep themselves and their families. To take a wealth tax from them is to take from them something which they do not possess. The Treasurer has endeavoured to meet their case by providing that they can defer the payment of the levy, and pay interest on the money; but that is really in the nature of a mortgage on their property. Many of them have had a hard fight in the past to get clear of mortgages, and they will not be anxious to renew them in this way. I see clearly that the wealth tax will have an effect quite different from what was expected of it. Therefore I Urge that there should be one tax only. </para>

                            <para>- When we are at war the States should endeavour to live Without taxing incomes. Income taxation should be a field for the Commonwealth during the war. I do not hold with so much State taxation. Immediately the war broke out, the State of New South Wales, without justification, increased its income taxation. </para>

                    <para>The proposed recruiting scheme is a step in the right direction. Something should be done to popularize recruiting as much as possible. As one who opposed conscription, believing that the voluntary system should be continued, I consider that we should endeavour to do the best we can with it, and I am prepared to use my best efforts towards making a success of any recruiting scheme. I have received a letter from the Director of Recruiting, in which the following passage occurred : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The Federal member will invite the cooperation of the State members within his division, of the local governing bodies and their organizations. The Military Registrar appointed under the recent Proclamation in each Federal division will be the District Recruiting Officer. He will be supplied with such clerical assistance as may be necessary, and, under the direction of the State Committee, will make all arrangements for meetings, recruiting arrangements, medical examinations, and the forwarding of recruits. </para>

                    <para class="block">I want to know what the district committees will, have to do. Power is to be given to recruiting officers to employ all labour, conduct all meetings, and' appoint speakers. All that the Federal member has to do is to call the representative bodies in his electorate together, lay the scheme before them, and set the organization in motion. The Director of Recruiting will regulate all meetings. This is a weak spot in the scheme, and if it is intended to continue on those lines there are very few honorable members but will soon be coming into conflict with the Director of Recruiting, however much they are inclined to render assistance. The last recruiting campaign failed largely because men were appointed to address meetings who were not suitable. They were offensive, and insulted the people. By allowing the military authorities to send along speakers there will be a repetition of this. If I take any part in the scheme I shall make it clear that each man who goes out shall be courteous to all, and shall not be offensive, but shall state the position fairly. If he does so, he will be doing his duty. In .New South Wales and in Victoria I have heard men engaged in recruiting work making statements of which they should have been ashamed. That method does not secure recruits, and it does not help the cause. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; because people resent such language. Whoever is at the head of the scheme will need to be careful in the selection of those who are to address meetings. Men should be chosen who can put the position fairly without giving offence to their hearers, and men who are appointed as house-to-house canvassers should be men specially adapted to the work. I believe we can get sufficient suitable men from the returned soldiers, but let the selection be wise. If any one and every one is put on the recruiting business the scheme will be doomed to failure. Once we take in the mayors, and shire presidents, and leading men in connexion with the other movements in an electorate we should give them some power and permit them to have some control in their own electorates. We should not permit any one either in Sydney or Melbourne to have power over the local committees. Under the proposed scheme there is an appeal by the Military Registrar direct to the State Council, and if the State Council agrees to certain proposals, the local body is not considered, and has no say in the matter. How long will such a scheme last? About a fortnight. The Director of Recruiting will do well to take the matter thoroughly into consideration. The Defence Department is to blame to a very large extent for the falling off of recruiting. They went to Kurri Kurri and Weston, in the Newcastle district, for 128 men for reinforcements for the Miners' Battalion, and they immediately got the full number required. The men were taken to camp at Broadmeadow, in the Newcastle district, and then they had their final leave. After this they were sent to Seymour in the middle of winter, and when they arrived there was no meal provided for them. The weather was extremely cold, and rain fell for the first few weeks. </para>

                    <para>Their tents were like sieves, the water running through them, and their food was badly cooked. These men while in the Newcastle Camp had never a complaint to make. They were perfectly satisfied, but under these conditions they naturally began to complain. They wrote to their parents or friends, and, as the result of inquiries, it was found that their statements were correct. The Department had to send them 100 new tents. It was admitted also, that while the food was good, it was badly cooked, and that it was true that when they arrived in camp there was no dinner for them. Experiences such as these have done much to kill recruiting in my electorate.' Many men say, "If this is the sort of treatment one gets on enlisting we will not volunteer." Then, again, these men were brought over to Melbourne ostensibly to undergo a short course of special instruction, the understanding being that they were to leave for the front at an early date. They were granted final leave be- fore they left Newcastle, but on arrival here they were kept at Seymour for fifteen or sixteen weeks, hundreds of miles away from their friends. Some of their friends came over here to see them. They expressed a desire to be allowed to go over to Newcastle to see those who were near and dear to them, and after battling' for some weeks we received from the Department an intimation that as these men had been granted final leave while in Newcastle, there was no power under the regulations to grant a second final leave, but that it had been decided that they should be permitted to go over to Newcastle for a week-end to see their wives and families. I thought that was a fair thing, and I told the men so. But what happened? The Department actually stopped their pay for the ten days that they spent in visiting their friends,, and made them pay their own fares to and from New South Wales. Is it any wonder that men in my district should be opposed to recruiting? After these men had embarked, I received a letter on the 24th of last month from the wives of four of their number stating that although they had been away for a month no pay had been received by their women folk, who were waiting for the money with which to pay their household bills. These complaints are circulated all over my district. How can one expect recruits to be coming forward in such circumstances? I have been stating actual facts. I received a letter a fortnight ago from four me» who volunteered in New South Wales to join an aviation corps. They were told that they would have to come to Victoria. They willingly volunteered, came' to Victoria, and, they tell me, were asked by the officer here from what State they came. An examination was then held, with the result that not one man from New South Wales was successful. These men  were t  then transferred to the infantry, although they had enlisted for the purpose of joining the aviation corps. They were transferred to the infantry in victoria, although they could have joined an infantry regiment in their own State. Upon receiving their complaint, I made representations to the. authorities, with the result that they were transferred to another camp, and I was informed yesterday that they were to be sent back to New South Wales. Stories, of these experiences are circulated all over New South Wales, with the result that-. many will not enlist, because they believe that they will not receive fair treatment. Incidents of this kind do more to injure recruiting than anything of which I know. If we are to have a recruiting campaign let us do the best that we can for these men. They are certainly worthy of the very best we can do for them, and should receive every consideration. I do not know who is responsible for these happenings. I do know that the Minister is not at fault. He is not conversant with all that is going on. </para>

I contend that action should be taken to prevent the recurrence of these things. Men taken from New South Wales, where the climate is warmer than in the south, and put into camp near Melbourne, where the weather is constantly changing, are more liable to sickness than they would be if they remained in their own State. Why cannot they be allowed to remain in their own State, where they are thoroughly acclimatized ? </para>

                            <para>- There is only one other matter to which I desire to refer. It relates to the Postal Department. Notwithstanding that the cost of living has considerably increased during the last few years, no provision has been made to meet the altered conditions of those who keep allowance post-offices. There is a rule under which the salaries of those in charge of allowance post-offices are regulated by the revenue derived from those offices. There are many cases of hardship in my electorate; I shall cite only one. It is that of a lady who has been keeping an allowance office for years, and has been in receipt of £23 per annum. She has to be at the beck and call of the public all day long. She must always be about the office to attend to the duties attaching to it. But as the revenue has fallen off slightly, the Department are reducing her allowance from £23 to something like £21 10s. per annum. The lady has refused to take this reduced amount, and the Postmaster-General states in a letter I have received from him that an effort is being made to get some one else to take up the work. I hold that it is. unfair to constantly cut down the salaries of these low-paid officers. If such reductions are necessary, then we are not justified in introducing penny postage. </para>

                            <para>- In this case, the revenue apparently has fallen slightly, and the pay has been reduced by 30s. per annum. The Department ignores the fact that the mail porter who delivers letters in the district also collects letters from House to house in order to save the residents the trouble of walking to the post-office. It does not credit the office with the revenue received in respect of those letters. </para>

In return for this, they get a miserable pittance, which is cut down from time to time. I urge the Postmaster-General to give consideration to the question of these allowances, and to try to devise a scheme whereby the pay of these officers, even if it cannot be increased, will not, at all events, be reduced. </para>

                        <para>.- Referring to the closing remarks made by the honorable member for Hunter, I would remind the Committee that the Postmaster-General has been exceptionally busy in recent times, and has been laying claim through the newspapers to having made immense savings in his Department. It is an easy task for any Postmaster-General to save money by curtailing postal facilities. The fact is that the revenue has increased during his term of office, because the charges have been raised, and that he effects savings either because he is cutting down poorly-paid officers or is lopping off long-enjoyed services. That is particularly so in respect of the back-block postal services. The honorable gentleman, as the representative of a country electorate, should be more generous in his treatment of those who are pioneering in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That reply is quite on a par with the wonderful " cramograms " that the honorable member despatched during the referendum campaign, I represent the outskirts of a goodly part of Melbourne, and I find that the telephone charges have gone up, while postal facilities have been cut down to the bone. I repeat that any Postmaster-General can save money by lopping off postal facilities in various parts of the country. In whatever other qualities he might be lacking, I always thought the Postmaster-General would not be wanting in those qualities which tend to increase the telephonic and postal facilities enjoyed by people in the back-blocks. Before the honorable member took office, I often heard him speak in this House of the fine work of our pioneers, and I remind him now of some of the disabilities which country people are suffering at his hands. </para>

                    <para>The right honorable member for Swan asked this afternoon how much longer the long-suffering public of Australia were to submit to the heavy burdens of taxation imposed upon them. He complained very bitterly about those burdens. There is one very fine avenue open for the cutting down of expenditure; but I do not think that the Parliaments of Australia will avail themselves of it unless the people take a hand in the matter. We have, all of us, to contribute to the taxation of the country, but I hear complaints from persons of all shades of political opinion to the effect that they have to pay double, treble, and sometimes quadruple taxation. In my judgment, the only remedy for that is - to use a word which to some has an ugly sound - Unification. We have too many Governments and too many Parliaments. </para>

Some of us  have advocated Unification for a number of years. In my opinion, it alone will bring about the reduction of expenditure. In the interests of true economy we should get rid of the salaries of State Governors and Agents-General, and abolish many excrescences in the Constitutions of the States. </para>

When Canada federated, it did not copy that Constitution. She saw its defects, and therefore made her National Parliament supreme. General Smuts, one of the brainiest  men in the Botha Cabinet, has stated that South Africa has avoided the mistakes of the Australian Constitution by making her National Parliament supreme. We should try to make our National Parliament supreme, and to bring about reforms which will lead to the reduction of the heavy financial burdens of the country. Australia is at present the laughing-stock of other countries because of the number of Parliaments and Governors that she has to maintain. The taxpayers cannot get proper relief until the Constitutions of the States and of the Commonwealth have been thrown into the melting pot. </para>

They see that it has worked against the interests of the community. This Parliament can exercise only powers delegated to it by the States, and is therefore under an influence to which it should not be submitted. The right honorable member for Swan is a great Statesrighter, but I tell him that so long as we continue the present system we shall have large expenditure and heavy taxation. </para>

                    <para>I join with the honorable member for Hunter in saying that the financial statement might have been much more lucid. It would have been better if the Treasurer had given us tables comparing the effect of his proposals with those of the honorable member for Capricornia. He might also have given us other information. As for the proposal to exempt the gold-mining industry from the operation of the war profits tax, the Ministers would have found themselves without a supporter had any other proposal been made. Had the honorable member for Capricornia remained in the Treasury, he would have listened to the representations which would have been made to him from all quarters as to the advisableness of exempting gold-mining from war profits taxation. We are all glad that this is to be done. The right honorable member for Swan asked, " Why not exempt all other forms of mining." In reply I would point out that the prices of some metals have risen very high because of the war. According to to-day's <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> electrolytic copper is now quoted at £168 10s. a ton. In the pre-war days it was about one-third of that price. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that the British Government has an arrangement with this Government, on its own behalf and on behalf of the French Government, for taking a proportion of the Australian output of copper at £100 a ton. This arrangement, of course, may have been varied, but the figure was £100 or thereabouts. Manufacturers and the Government, who are turning out munitions of war, use a considerable amount of copper, and it stands to reason that they must be paying more now for their raw material than they did when the price was between £50 and £60. The price of copper, we know, is practically fixed in America, which is a large producer of the commodity; but when the War Precautions Act is used, as it has been, against the interests of the people, why should it not be used in order to prevent the ' ' copper kings ' ' from fleecing the Government and the people? </para>

                            <para>- I know that the price of copper is exorbitantly high - higher than ever known before - and those who have to manufacture munitions should not be fleeced, but should be protected by the Government. It might, perhaps, be permissible to allow the price to go to £70 or £80, but double that is too much. When the right honorable member for Swan suggests that ordinary mining propositions ought to be brought under the same rules as gold-mining, he talks in a manner which would indicate that he has not carefully considered the question. Only a few months ago the British Government were dealing with a, German firm which was robbing the British people of hundreds of thousands of pounds on this line alone. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Yarra touched on a very important question when he asked what the Government intended to do in regard to the 'elections for the Senate in the coming year. There is no doubt that we ought to have a concrete proposal in this regard. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times,</inline> in a piece of news published on Sunday, and dated from Melbourne, gives some information in which the honorable member for Parramatta, and those who support him, ought to be much interested.

                        <para>Whatever the future may hold for the diminutive Ministerial party in the Federal Parliament and its diminutive Leader, no chances are to be taken. Even now arrangements are well in hand for the electioneering campaign, which before long will have to be started, and, in order to reduce the chances to a minimum, the arrangements include an understanding under which the present Ministerial party and the Liberal party will not come into conflict. </para>
                        <para>Most of the arrangements are in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> A. Watt, M.H.R., who throughout the referendum campaign was in close touch with the Prime Minister. Negotiations so far mean that where a member of the Ministerial -party is contesting a particular electorate, the Liberal party will not put up a candidate against him, and the same arrangements will apply to candidates of the Liberal party. . . . It would be almost impossible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to return from an election with a party sufficiently strong to enable him to do anything except on the present basis of support from the Liberal party, and he is not likely to go to the country suggesting that the people should support either his own or the Liberal party, in order that he might get in again. </para>
                        <para>Both he and the members of the Liberal party are showing their wisdom by getting their arrangements well in hand before the Labour party has a chance of splitting the alliance which seems to be working so well at present. Whether the present session of Parliament will continue beyond Christmas is not known. Even the Prime Minister does not know. Talking of such a possibility this morning, he said he would be very much obliged if any one could enlighten him on the point. " If you ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> and his party," he added, " perhaps you might get to know. Anyhow, I hope it's going to end before the festive season." </para>

Here I may say that the honorable member for Henty seems to be always in the counsels of the honorable member for Balaclava. I remember once, when these two gentlemen were members of the State Parliament of Victoria, meeting them at some country show, and the honorable member for Henty introduced the honorable member for Balaclava as the leader of "our party." To this introduction, however, the honorable member for Balaclava demurred, and asked to be allowed to say that if he were a leader of a party, it was a party of' two. However that may be, the honorable member for Henty, speaking at Mordialloc, said - </para>

They know that to go to the country as a fusion would only mean their doom. No doubt, this information is leaking out a bit too soon; but what is given by the newspapers is very correct. I am only endeavouring to let Liberals and honorable members opposite know that we, as well as they, know a little bit. </para>

This financial column is supposed to be written by one of the best financial journalists in Australia, and we know that if anything is written in a financial column which is not strictly in accordance with fact, the paper concerned is laughed at by the commercial community.

The results of the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are not included, although the profits of the company are known to have been high. Many other important companies are not included in the list. At the time this statement was published the companies mentioned had just held their annual meetings, and announced in their balance-sheets the results of the year's operations. In almost every case the profits for 1916 compare very favorably with those for 1914. </para>

The companies mentioned are some of those which will be affected by the tax on war profits, and the figures were published for the three years, 1914, 1915, and 1916, in order to enlighten the public as to the profits being made during war time. The right honorable member for Swan endeavoured to make the Committee believe that no profits are being made at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member referred to the primary industries being subjected to imposts by two different land-taxing authorities. Every other industry in the Commonwealth is subjected to double taxation. Of course, the right honorable member will argue that the primary producer very often is unable to pass on his taxation. I am prepared to admit that that is so to a large extent. There are a few industries, in which, through co-operative action, the primary producer is able to control the disposal of his produce, and to have a voice in fixing the selling price. It is an unfortunate thing that the producer has not gone in more extensively for cooperative action. If the producer will continue to support the middleman in the cities, it is his own fault that he has to carry that burden. He can become the marketer of his own produce and thus save thousands of pounds. </para>

                    <para>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the encouragement of Australian industries. I do not say that this is a matter which ought to have been referred to by the Treasurer, but I think the Prime Minister ought to have made reference to it in his Ministerial statement a few days ago. I have been expecting action by the Prime Minister in regard to this matter, for, although some of his colleagues are different from those who sat in his Cabinet a few weeks ago, he is still Prime Minister of Australia, he is still a gentleman of unbounded energy, and a person who can do much for the people of this country. I realize that he is an exceptionally busy man, and I believe that many of his recent mistakes are due to his having taken too much upon his own shoulders. I say, however, that it is his duty to carry out. the promise made to Parliament over eighteen months ago, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> when Prime Minister. In October, 1914, I asked the then Prime Minister what the Government intended to do to encourage, not only industries already established in Australia, but also the establishment of new industries. With the exception of the creation of a bureau of science, little or nothing has been done in that direction up to date. The honorable member for Parramatta and other honorable members argue that we should devote the whole of our energies to the conduct of the war, and only when it is over turn our attention to domestic affairs. The day is coming when many of those men who went to the war will be returning, and when this part of the world will be put to a greater test in the finding of employment than it is undergoing at the present time. It behoves every far-seeing Government to make some provision for that time. It does not appear as if we may expect the cessation of hostilities in the near future. Nevertheless, this great war may end suddenly, and if we make no effort now at organization in Australia, we shall be, when the war is over, one of the most backward portions of the British Empire. In Canada they are organizing, not only for the equipment and despatch of troops to the front, but also for the establishment of new industries and the revival of old ones. In Australia we are doing practically nothing. It is stated by historians that, great though the losses were, the Civil War did more than anything else to establish American industries, of course in conjunction with a protective Tariff. I shall quote figures, comparing the years 1860 and 1870, and it must be remembered that for nearly half of the period covered by those dates the American Civil War was in progress. </para>

                    <para>Old-fashioned machinery and slip-shod methods are disappearing rapidly under the stress of war, and whatever there may have been of contempt for science in this country, it does not exist now. There is a new spirit in every department of industry, which, I feel certain, is not destined to disappear when we are at liberty to divert it from its present supreme purpose of beating the Central Powers. When that is done, can we not apply to peaceful uses the form of organization represented by the Ministry of Munitions? I am not thinking so much of the great buildings which constitute new centres of industry, planned with the utmost ingenuity so as to economize effort, filled with machines of incredible efficiency and exactitude. I wish rather to, emphasize the extent to which all concerned - and each section is vital to our objects - are co-operating to obtain the best results from the material in our hands. We. have the leaders of all the essential industries now working for us or co-operating with us in the Ministry. The great unions render us constant assistance in the discussion and solution of difficulties, whether with our officers or within their own body. On technical questions of the most varied character we have the advantage of the best expert advice in the country. </para>
                    <para>We have in being, now that British industry is organized for war, the general staff of British industry. I am sure that we should sacrifice much if we did not avail ourselves of that staff to consider bow far all this moral and material energy can be turned to peaceful account. </para>

A perusal of the British House of Commons debates or British periodicals will show that in Great Britain, where the task of carrying on the war is so heavy, and where they are doing all they possibly can to keep faith with the demands made by an immense war, there is an organization of scientists, chemists, engineers, workers, and employers concentrating its efforts not only on the manufacture of munitions, but also on the building up of future industry. Where thousands to-day are employed on the manufacture of munitions of war, they will at once be in a position when the war is over to conduct those industries so essential to the welfare of a country in times of peace. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir W.</inline> Essex speaking in the House of Commons said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Our Ministers may say that their hands are full at the present time, but I see no reason why we in Australia should not make more use of the brains of our country. Of what use is it to have certain materials practically lying idle? The other day a young inventor was introduced to one of our Ministers, who was pleased to inspect the model of a submarine submitted, and was so taken with it that, after consultation with his officers, he found it worth while to give that young man a trial in the Commonwealth workshops. I believe that in a few days the young man will probably be placed in the dockyard at Cockatoo Island and given the opportunity to prosecute his work with the best tools available, and the best machinery and advice at his disposal. The Minister has taken the right step. Our young men should be encouraged more. Many a young Australian inventor has been turned down. Some time prior to the war two young engineers who had in collaboration worked on two ideas for a number of years, submitted their proposals to a number of engineering firms in Australia, but were turned down. They proceeded to Great Britain, and interviewed some of the big engineering firms there, but were also turned down. They then said to themselves, " If our own kinsmen will turn us down, let us go to Germany." They did so, and submitted their designs to engineering firms there. The German firms seized the opportunity, and gave the young men every facility to complete their invention, and get their machines going, and they were a great success. This happened prior to the war. I asked a friend of these young fellows how they were getting on at the present time, and he said that so far as he knew they had been interned. This is only one case in which Australian ideas have been turned down by our own people, and the inventors have had to seek in foreign countries the opportunity to complete their ideas. If I had my way, I would give every young man whose invention is shown ' by a preliminary investigation likely to be of use to the community the opportunity of going into some firm or Government establishment where he could carry out all his experiments and complete his invention. Over and over again, inventions have revolutionized industry. We should do all we can to get the brains of Australian chemists, engineers, and others to work together to do something for Australia, so that at the close of the war we may be ready to take our place in competition with other parts of the world. Otherwise, we shall be all behind. Canada has organization of industrial matters side by side with its organization for the carrying on of the war. It is the same in Great Britain, and if Australia is to be in a proper position after the war, we must do something. I regret that the Prime Minister is not prosecuting with greater energy the ideas on which he started eighteen months ago. All that has been done is the appointment of a number of university professors and a few others supposed to be captains of industry. They have met from time to time, but no results have been achieved. </para>
                    <para>We are told that there are some difficulties with regard to proceeding with the consideration of the Tariff. We have nothing but a mongrel Tariff now. It is of little or no good. Every year millions of pounds' worth of goods are flowing into Australia, a large portion of which could be made by our own workmen. One of the increases shown in the Treasurer's Estimates over those of his predecessor is £250,000 in Customs duties, showing that even in war time, when there is supposed to be very little money in circulation, and when there is supposed to be lack of employment, our imports are mounting up. If they are to continue, it will mean that </para>
                    <para class="block">Australian artisans will be put out of employment. If we cannot stop it by Tariff regulation, it is time we had the genius, energy and will to put into operation something that will afford us equal protection against those who are manufacturing in low-wage countries. There are a hundred-and-one ways of doing it. Side by side with doing the best we can in regard to sending men to the war - and Australia has done splendidly in sending men, money and materials to the other side of the world; I know of no other part of the Empire that has done so well in proportion to population - we should encourage Australian industry. The increase in the cost of raw materials has made a great deal of difference in the employment of labour. Some industries are dependent upon raw material and are practically idle at the present time, because that material is unobtainable, or is too costly. The figures as to the average prices for the last four years are given by the Treasurer in re gard to a number of items. I shall refer to one only - one that is under consideration in another quarter. I speak of cement, which is used in most of our public buildings, and is, therefore, of great importance to the Government. If we could produce cement to-day at 13s. lid. per cask - the price ruling in 1913 - instead of having to pay 18s. per cask, which is now the market price, we should be in a much better position. </para>

                            <para>- We have here all the materials for the manufacture of cement, and I hope the Minister will induce his colleagues to take action to carry out the recommendation of the Public Works Committee that a Commonwealth cement works should be established. We have mountains of material, one might almost say, in a splendid position, and if, instead of paying 13s. lid. a cask, as we did in 1913, we could manufacture it here, and supply it at the Federal Capital, as has been estimated, for 9s. or 10s. a cask, or one-half the present ruling price, the Government would effect a very substantial saving. That is one of the many industries that ought to be pushed ahead in Australia. I have referred to these items merely to indicate what ought to be done. Had the Government been alive to the true interests of the Commonwealth, the recommendation I have mentioned would have been at once adopted, and by this time a cement works would be in full operation, turning out cement at half the cost which we have to bear to-day. </para>

                            <para>- And also in several other parts' of Australia, but the local production is not sufficient to meet more than half the demand. It is time these works were established. Why should wo go on importing millions of pounds' worth of material that we can manufacture here? When the war is over, we shall be in Queer Street unless we organize our industries better than we have been doing. I have quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montagu,</inline> the Minister for Munitions in Great Britain, as well as leading industrialists, and have also pointed out the wonderful revolutions in industry that took place in America even during the Civil War. Historians and others have declared that the American Civil War, notwithstanding its terrible calamities and its sacrifice of at least a million lives, led to America setting up her own industries. Let it be said to the credit of Lincoln and others that they took care that America was well protected. With a good Tariff, and the proper 'encouragement of industry in other ways, there is no reason why we should not rapidly enter upon the manufacture of many goods that we are now' importing from other parts of the world. We are also in an unfortunate position from a defence point of view. I understand that if a steel plate were required for one of our war ships, we have not in Australia a machine to roll out one. </para>

There was some talk of the establishment of an arsenal in Australia many months ago, but I do not know that a single peg has yet been put in. In connexion with that arsenal, it was proposed that steel works should be established. Such works are sadly needed in Australia.

                    <para class="block">Company are  sufficient  to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth. I would tell them, ho'wever, that, in respect of steel rails and a few other materials, those works are already unable to supply the orders that are being sent in. Unless Australia is to lag far behind all progressive countries in the matter of industry, she will have to establish, not merely one steel works, but, in all probability, half-a-dozen. Cement and steel will continue to play a very important part in all construction work, and when the war is over, it will be impossible for some years to obtain various "classes of steel from the outside world. In that case, where will Australia be unless she is capable of supplying her own requirements in this respect? I hope that the Assistant Minister, who knows how essential it is that we should have in Australia an arsenal and a steel works in conjunction with it, will use his influence with the Cabinet in order that such an enterprise may at once be entered upon,- It is essential to the defence of this country, as well as to the multifarious works that we have to carry out. </para>

Their proposals have been somewhat watered down as compared with those submitted by the ex-Treasurer. And it is because they have been so watered down, I presume, that they are more acceptable to the Liberal Opposition. I do not know whether they conferred with the Government, but I do know that the Leader of the Liberal party, in the course of a press interview, laid very considerable emphasis on the point that&gt; the financial proposals of the ex-Treasurer would need to be considerably amended in order to be acceptable to his party. That was a hint to the Treasurer. Whether it was taken without any more pressure on the part of the Leader of the Liberal Opposition, I do not know, but the fact remains that the financial proposals of the late Government have been amended, and amended in a direction that will not meet with the unanimous approval of the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- They have been altered, perhaps, under the influence of the warmth of a Cook. Had the .Labour party remained as it was a few months ago, there is not the slightest doubt that, with the exception of the exemption of the mining industry from the war profits proposals, no change would have been made in the taxation scheme of the Government. There would, at least, have been no reduction. Rather would there have been an increase* but subject to the excellent safeguard which some of us -would like to see introduced to prevent taxation being passed on. Some scheme should be evolved whereby those who can well afford to pay taxation should be compelled to bear it. Most of our taxation is passed on. That is not a mere clap-trap statement. A fairly high financial authority - the honorable member for Balaclava - when dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> Budget proposals in this House, said he knew that the whole community would have to bear the taxation then proposed. He said, " They filter down through various human activities to the bedrock, that is, to the unskilled worker. It is he who nearly always pays taxes." This being so, it is the bounden duty of every member of the Labour party, inside and outside of Parliament </para>

                            <para>- There is only one Labour party, and it has gone straight on. Naturally we do not look for support from the Liberal ranks. But, so far as we can, we must provide against the passing on of taxation, so that the financial load may no longer be borne by the masses instead of by the wealthy. The people cannot bear this burden for ever. Education is spreading, and the community is beginning to realize that the workers have been imposed upon too long. The day will come when they will demand some reform, and it is for us to endeavour to see that those who have fewest of the comforts of life, and who are least remunerated, are freed from unfair taxation. I have spoken of Unification, and the remodelling of the Constitution of Australia as a means to reducing expenditure and taxation. I shall do my best, in conjunction with any party, for the lightening of the burden of the masses by shifting it on to the shoulders of those who can better carry it. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to bring certain matters before the Minister, and to enter an emphatic protest against the action of officials in the Defence Department in sending military police to arrest those whom they term deserters. About 1 . 15 last Thursday morning, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Anderson, of Murphy-street, Port Melbourne, with his wife and seven children, were awakened by loud knocking at their door, and a demand for admission. When he asked who was there, he was told, " Military police." He naturally concluded that something had happened to his son, who was absent on active service. As he walked towards the door, he heard persons running past the side of the house, and when he opened it, two military police rushed in. They immediately went through the front room, the main bedroom, and the children's room, and, having made a thorough search of those apartments, returned to the front room. On <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> asking whom they wanted, they replied, " Your son." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> said, "You must take a long journey to get him, because the last information I received was that, over two months ago, he was at Salisbury Plain, and was to leave for France on the following day." A photograph of the son was hanging on the wall, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> had a number of his letters from England. He having satisfied the police that the son was actually at the front, the man in charge said that he accepted no responsibility for the visit, having been instructed by head-quarters to make it. He added that he had nine other visits to pay in that district that morning, and said that the next place to which he was going was that of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gibbons,</inline> whose son Frank had deserted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Anderson</inline> immediately said, " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gibbons,</inline> like myself, is a family man, who has his work to go to in the morning. Do not wake him.  His  son sailed in the same steamer with mine, on the 3rd July last." Private Anderson has been listed as a deserter for some time, although his parents have been drawing _ part of his pay from the Defence Department ever since he left on active service. No visit was paid by the military police to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gibbons</inline> that morning, but, two days later, a man, who represented himself as an old employer of the lad, who wished to make certain inquiries concerning him, knocked at the door, and was admitted by Miss Gibbons. She showed him a photograph of her brother, which was hanging on the wall, and he, after one or two casual questions, left. The Gibbons family were at a loss to account for this visit, until, two days later, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson</inline> told them of the visit which had been paid to his house. The Gibbons family then found that the supposed employer was really a member of the Defence Department, who had called to verify <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anderson's</inline> story. Personally, I think it is a scandal that the homes of men who have been on active service for months should be raided in this way in the middle of . the night; and something should be done to prevent the recurrence of such, events. I am satisfied that the departmental list of deserters, judging from what has occurred recently, could he reduced by 30 per cent., if the so-called deserters, who are on active service, were deducted. The whole circumstances show that there is some person or persons in the Department responsible for serious blunders, and they ought to be brought at once to book. Much personal suffering and alarm is occasioned by these ill-timed visits; and surely the parents of boys who have gone to the front are worth more consideration than has been shown them in this regard by the Department. I trust that the Minister for <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Navy <inline font-style="italic">will make</inline> a note of the cases I have cited, and see that these military regulations and duties are carried out more carefully. I should now like to refer briefly to the financial proposals of the Treasurer. As one who occasionally goes to a football match,  a  theatre, or a picture show, I take strong exception to the proposed tax on amusements. Of course, there is a certain class of people who do not smoke, never visit football matches, or places of amusement, but who are very keen on advocating that people who so indulge shall be subject to some form of taxation. I feel certain that a greater portion of the £700,000, which is estimated to be thus raised, will come out of the pockets of the working classes, for we may safely conclude that at any picture show in Melbourne, four-fifths of the audience is composed of wage-earners. We may be told, and probably will Be told, that no extra charge for admission will be made in consequence of this taxation, but judging from what one hears from people who have recently visited the Old Land, the person entering the theatre pays the ½ on the 6d., the Id. on the ls., or whatever the tax may be, to the person who sells the ticket. It is very probable that those connected with our theatres and picture shows in Australia will adopt the same method. Surely there are other ways of raising money for the purposes of the war. I have no objection to -taxation, but I do object to this form of it. I now ask the Treasurer how he can possibly take credit for any large saving by means of his sinking fund. We are told in the Treasurer's statement that the previous Government were making provision for the establishment of a sinking fund with a view to paying back loan moneys in a certain number of years, and that by an alteration of the system, and a reduction of the amount to go into the sinking fund, there is to be a saving of practically £1,445,222 per annum. I fail to see where any saving comes in, and I do not know that the Treasurer himself could point to any actual result in that direction. </para>

Compared with the proposals of the honorable member for Capricornia, the Treasurer is claiming a saving of over £1,000,000, which I say he is not entitled to claim. Such a statement, if allowed to go out to the public, will be absolutely misleading. </para>

                            <para>- It is a saving to  a  section of the community, but it is not  a  saving so far as the Commonwealth finances are concerned. It .would appear from the statement that the Government wish to take credit for a saving in comparison with the proposal submitted by the late Treasurer. I dispute their right to do that. </para>

                    <para>I recognise the difficulties which confront the Government in meeting their financial responsibilities. Probably the imposition of too heavy a form of taxation might be injurious to those who are responsible for the carrying on of our industries, and that to the extent of the injury thus done unemployment would be created in our midst. No doubt, when framing their proposals, the Government had in mind the desirability of  imposing a certain form of taxation, which, while producing the necessary revenue to enable them to carry out their obligations, would not discourage those to whom we look for the conduct of our commercial and industrial activities. </para>
                    <para>I propose to refer to one or two matters that have received a great deal of prominence during recent weeks. A statement was made by a Minister of the Crown in another place that the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World was in operation in Australia, and that the gospel of slowing down preached by that organization is having its effect on the workers of the Commonwealth. I have come out of the workshop more recently than any member of the present Government, and I have not seen any indication whatever of the operation of that policy, . which is so much talked about by a certain section of the community. I have heard statements made by the Prime Minister that the Labour party to-day is advocating sabotage'. I have seen no indication of that. That there are people in Australia who believe in that policy I will not deny, .but to any one who says that the principles of slowing down and of sabotage are in operation in the recognised industrial movement of Australia, or are believed in or advocated by those connected with that movement, I give the lie direct. I have fought the Industrial Workers of the World in Trades Hall Councils and political conferences whenever I have had the opportunity. There is in every English-speaking community a branch of the Industrial Workers of the World, who comprise men who believe in what they term direct action, and not in political action. Their methods of bringing about social and industrial reform are the exact opposite of the methods of the recognised political and industrial movement in Australia. We believe in securing our political and social reforms through the medium of the ballot-box, by sending men to Parliament to effect reforms in a constitutional manner. The Industrial Workers of the World do not believe in parliamentary representation, but only in industrial organization. That body believes in the strike and in sabotage, and its members advocate those methods from platforms throughout the world. Not one of the men who assert that the genuine Labour movement is abandoning the policy which it has fol- </para>

                        lowed for years, and, instead, is advocating slowing down and sabotage, has produced one tittle of evidence to support the allegation. I have never had any sympathy with the Industrial Workers of the World or their policy, but for years that organization has been established in New South Wales. There are certain classes of men and women who, believing in the doctrines of the Industrial Workers of the World, formed a branch in that State. Other individuals have joined the branch, and we are told that they came from other parts of the world, and have used the organization as a cloak to carry on quite another class of work.  I have never had any sympathy with these people. A number of them have been sent to gaol, but one of them upon being sentenced gave expression to a sentiment which I heartily indorse. I stated here the other evening that I have no sympathy with some of these men, but that accused persons on their trial, even for 'murder, were at least entitled to fair play, and that these men had not received it. I say that fearlessly. It is not a popular thing to say, and there are electorates in this country in which to say it would mean one's political death. But when men are fighting a just cause they need not attack others who are within the shadow of death in order to bolster up their own case. According to the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>
                        of the other evening, one of these men, upon being convicted in Sydney, said that the Prime Minister of Australia had practically sentenced him and his companions before they had obtained a hearing. I indorse that sentiment expressed from the dock. With their crimes I have nothing in common. They have been adjudged guilty, and I am not going to question the decision or the sentences which have been imposed on them. But I do question the right of certain individuals in our midst to make political capital out of the crimes of these men, and to seek to attach opprobrium to the Labour movement with which I am identified.

There are men and women in the Industrial Workers of the World in Sydney who have been connected with that organization for years, and who do not believe in political action. They have only one idea of bettering their social and industrial conditions, viz., by direct action by means of strikes. But they do not lend themselves to the policy of burning down buildings and taking human life. If a number of clever men from another part of the world get into an organization like that and utilize it to give effect to their improper methods, would the honorable member for Parramatta blame every man and woman in the organization ? </para>

                            <para>- At the corner of Goulburn-street and Bathurst-street, in Sydney, meetings have been held of a Saturday and Sunday night for the past three years, and I have never heard one member of the Industrial Workers of the World say -a word against the Leader of the Opposition. I have never heard them attack <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> but I have frequently heard them attack the Labour party and the Trades Hall. They have called both State and Federal Labour members parasites, and have applied the same epithet to every organizer and officer connected with the Labour movement. The conscription question arose, and for once the leading man in the Industrial Workers of the World saw eye to eye with the majority of members of the Labour movement in Australia. The Industrial Workers of the World were opposed to conscription, not - as was explained by Tom Barker - because they believed, as the majority of Labour men believe, in the voluntary system. They were opposed to militarism, and to a single man in Australia having to take part in the war. But the Labour Government are responsible for having sent hundreds of thousands of Australians to participate in it. There is the cleavage between the two parties. My complaint is that the Prime Minister, in conducting his campaign, went from end to end of the country exclaiming, " Here is your Labour movement under the control of the Industrial Workers of the World, under the influence of Germany, and in receipt of German gold." He tried to flog our movement by attaching to it responsibility for the doings of the Industrial Workers of the World in Sydney. I strongly resent his action, because his charges were unfair and untruthful. </para>

                            <para>- Probably there  is  no one in the House who knows more about the methods of the Industrial Workers of the World than the Prime Minister. If I wished to know how to create a strike or how to get my union into the Arbitration Court, perhaps to the disadvantage of another union that had been waiting for two years to have its case heard, I would go to the Prime Minister for advice. Yet when the fight in regard to the conscription issue came round, when all other arguments failed, this question of the Industrial Workers of the World was the trump card played throughout Australia. During the last two weeks it was given more prominence than all other arguments except the inspired messages from other parts of the world, and some of the literature that was put into circulation by those who were conducting the conscription campaign deliberately linked up the official industrial and labour movement of Australia with the crimes of certain men with a view to misleading the people. On the top of all this we are told now that there was no harm meant. </para>
