<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Community Services and Health to his comments on 3 September 1990, which included his advocacy of massive increases in public spending on hospitals and that the current stance on fiscal policy is intellectually lazy and reveals a fetish when there are strong arguments for massively increasing our investment in public infrastructure. I ask the Minister whether he therefore agrees with these statements made last night by a leading member of the New South Wales Left, the honourable member for Robertson:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would take a very strong memory indeed to recall the quotations that the Acting Leader of the Opposition has managed to find for Question Time today. Let me address quite clearly the central thrust of the question, which is to refer to a speech I made on the question of infrastructure. In that speech I referred to the possibility of the development of a federation infrastructure plan, clearly indicating that the direction of my thinking was long term rather than short term. I indicated in the course of that speech that I thought there were some concerns in the area of priorities in terms of capital, repeating what I had said on a number of occasions before: that I believed that in the 1990s, as opposed to the 1980s, there would occur a significant debate about the whole issue of capital priorities within this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the audience to which I was speaking on that occasion, which was very much concerned with the built environment, I wanted to indicate that it was consistent with this Government's environmental priorities. That is, we should concern ourselves particularly with urban transport and the need to achieve greater energy efficiency, particularly as related to transport; that it was, secondly, consistent with the Government's social justice objectives that we ought to give attention in the 1990s to giving greater priority to social expenditure in relation to capital. In terms of my current portfolio, there is work currently being commissioned at the Australian National University to look at the needs for capital through the 1990s in relation to hospital expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important in the 1990s that we correct the imbalance in public expenditure to ensure that greater capital expenditure goes into, for example, the hospital system. That is a clear social justice priority that I identified in that speech.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, as regards the micro-economic agenda, I indicated that capital expenditure would be important in achieving greater efficiencies. For those lazy minds who no doubt are not--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is anyone I would identify with the concept of a lazy mind, an intellectually slothful mind, it is the Acting Leader of the Opposition. For those lazy minds who have been unprepared in their discussion on micro-economic reform to talk about capital as opposed to labour, I say that they would be interested, as I was on that occasion, to refer to Cliff Walsh, a fairly conservative authority, who suggested that there were significant gains to be achieved out of capital expenditure in terms of priority as, indeed, there are significant gains in other areas of micro-economic reconstruction that might go to the question of labour. From my point of view, that was an important speech, particularly in terms of laying out what I thought was a longer term agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, that is the difference, if I might say in conclusion, between the Government and the Opposition. We have consistently been able to marry a tight short term fiscal policy with a consideration of longer term restructuring of the Australian economy. The reason that we have been so poorly served in the past by conservative governments is their inability to either come to terms with resource allocation decisions in the short term or certainly to think and plan long and deal with large issues that governments need to deal with.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. What is the Government doing to ensure that Australians are adequately educated and trained to benefit from the dramatic economic opportunities that exist or are developing in Asia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The importance of our region and Australia's place in it has often been mentioned by business men and women, journalists and even politicians. It has also been observed that Australia has been rather slow to wake up to what we have to do to be a full participant within the Asia-Pacific region. One of the areas to which we have to devote more attention is the whole question of having a better understanding of Asian languages and cultures and, indeed, the way Asian countries do business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was for that reason that we established the Asian Studies Council and for that reason that the Asian Studies Council gave us a report on how Australia might become more Asia-literate. I am sure that some honourable members opposite who are chattering away at the moment went through their school education learning more about European geography and languages than they ever learnt about Asian geography, history or languages. I suspect that continues to be the orientation of their thinking now.</PARA>
<PARA> On this side of the House we are concerned to ensure that within our school system there are more opportunities for our young people to learn about Asia and Asian languages. That means that we first have to develop the appropriate curriculum to be taught in the schools and provide an appropriate number of teachers to teach those courses.</PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that I am very pleased to report progress on where the Government and, indeed, Australia are on this question. By the end of 1991 we will have developed school curricula and materials in Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese and Thai, and will be continuing that work in Korean, Vietnamese and Hindi. In addition, we are proceeding with developing curriculum in Asian studies generally. All these projects have cost the Commonwealth something like $3m.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not just a question of developing the curriculum; it is a matter of ensuring that we have enough teachers of Asian studies and languages. That is why the Government has developed a special program to encourage Australian scholars to study in Asian countries-some 50 of them in 1990 and 70 in 1991. As well as that we have, through the growth in our higher education system, identified Asian studies and Asian languages as a key priority area, with the result that some 5,000 new places in Asian studies and Asian languages will be created in our universities in this triennium. In addition, we will be providing $2,500,000 to be allocated this year for developing new teaching programs in Asian studies and languages.</PARA>
<PARA> Also, through the programs of the Australian Research Council, we are establishing two new study centres, one in Korean studies and another in Thai studies, at a cost of nearly $1m in one case and about $500,000 in the other case. All of these initiatives are important if Australia is to realise its great potential in this region and be able to share in the enormous dynamism that exists in this fastest growing region of the world. We are not going to be able to achieve that by sitting on the sidelines; rather, by developing an appropriate national strategy to ensure that more in Australia understand about our region, are able to participate in it and therefore able to win benefits for Australia from the growth within this region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the fact that on previous occasions on which the immigration status of Imam Al Hilaly has been dealt with the Government has made ministerial announcements concerning that issue. Has the Government determined as a matter of practice that in future, where decisions in relation to controversial visitors and permanent residency involve public interest factors, the Government will not be publicly announcing, or giving reasons for, the decisions taken? Noting that the Imam had temporary entry to Australia, and in the words of the former Minister for Immigration, Mr Hurford `had flouted our immigration law by staying on in Australia', will the Acting Prime Minister assure the House that representations from Mr Speaker, the honourable member for St George, the honourable member for Barton, the former member for Banks, Senator Childs and the Acting Prime Minister were not instrumental in obtaining a result in this case which would not have been available to other illegal entrants under the Government's so-called tough regime on illegals?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand this case, this person had been in Australia for a very long time, had been through a number of procedures in terms of the Migration Act and had been reviewed on a number of previous occasions by previous Ministers, and on this occasion by the current Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But I have made representations in the past that were not immediately successful. So I do not know what is to be drawn from the interjection by the honourable member for Bennelong. That in future no Liberal Party member will make representations to the Minister for Immigration on matters he or she regards as important? Is that the point? If the Opposition is arguing that therefore, for instance, something is implied that is out of the ordinary in members representing a constituent's interests to the Minister, I do not think there is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This man is a religious leader of a very large community within my electorate and surrounding electorates, including that of Mr Speaker. What were formerly believed to be objections to him from groups within that community had, over time, dissipated. Views that were attributed to some people about his apparent flouting of community interests were such that when the matter was last reviewed the person concerned was told that his behaviour would be monitored and examined. Upon the monitoring and examination of that behaviour there was no cause why he could not be dealt with as an applicant for migration, given the fact as well that he had a number of children who had been born in this country.</PARA>

If Australia produces enough oil to meet the equivalent of 90 per cent of our domestic needs, why are our oil prices linked to international prices or, to put it another way, why should Australian consumers be paying higher prices for petrol if Australia produces enough of its own oil to meet 90 per cent of our needs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is obviously a very important question for Australian consumers. It is true that Australia produces enough oil to meet about 90 per cent of our demands. Indeed, in the first quarter of this year Australia produced almost 100 per cent of our requirement for oil-a level, I might add, which is vastly superior to the 65 per cent self-sufficiency which we inherited on taking government in 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is clearly an important matter for Australian consumers and in the absence of any Opposition policy touching upon this issue, all we have, is the guffawing of the ignorant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his question the honourable member for Banks asked why, if we are 90 per cent self-sufficient, our oil prices are linked to international prices. Firstly, in a free market environment it would be both illogical and counter-productive to have a domestic price for oil which was below the international price. If members of the Opposition want to take issue with that observation I am all ears.</PARA>
<PARA> In such an environment Australian producers would, of course, simply export all of the Australian production in order to pursue the higher international price. Nothing would be left for Australia; so we would be forced, by definition, to import all of our oil needs and, at the same time, to pay the international price. Thus, while there are some superficial attractions in believing that we could have lower oil prices in Australia, the net benefit to Australian consumers would amount to zero.</PARA>
<PARA> The second reason for linking our oil prices to the international price relates to the very important issue of oil exploration. If we have a lower oil price in Australia international oil companies simply would not be interested in exploring in this country. Why would they? If an oil company knew it could obtain, for example, $30 per barrel from producing oil in, say, Indonesia, why would it be interested in exploring in Australia and receiving, for example, $10 per barrel? The answer is quite clear-it would not.</PARA>
<PARA> The third reason for linking our oil prices to international prices is that oil is a non-renewable and scarce resource. Realistic prices are necessary so as not to encourage excessive use of oil. Moreover, higher prices, although unpopular, encourage lower consumption and increase energy efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the issue of petrol prices, and the Opposition would be well counselled to listen very closely to this. First of all, I want to put to rest the myth that we are paying higher prices for petrol here in Australia than in the rest of the world. I know this myth is peddled all across the countryside by the Opposition, but let me put to rest the scuttlebutt that emanates from the Opposition that the reason we have high petrol prices in Australia is because of a high tax grab by the Federal Government. That is the assertion.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right; so we take it that the Opposition's position is that the reason we have high petrol prices is because of a large tax grab by the Federal Government. Just let me put a few facts before the House rather than an assertion. In relation to petrol prices, we have the third cheapest petrol of the 20 International Energy Agency countries. At the end of the June quarter this year, Japanese consumers were paying 99c per litre; in Norway, consumers were paying $1.30; in the United Kingdom (UK), 90c; and in Italy, $1.56. Only Canada and the United States of America (USA) have lower petrol prices than Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to taxes on petrol, we have the second lowest level of taxes on fuel of the 20 International Energy Agency countries. The most recent statistics show that the total Federal and State taxes on fuel in Australia account for around 45 per cent of the total price of petrol. This compares, for example, with Germany, 66 per cent; Italy, 77 per cent; the United Kingdom--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Reid for his question. The high level of recent US export subsidies on wheat sales does appear to be the latest round in the subsidy war between the European Community and the United States. I should note three points. First, there is growing pressure in the United States for more aggressive use of the export enhancement program (EEP) to avoid a build-up of stocks as a result of near record crops, not only in the United States but in many wheat producing countries. Secondly, there have been signs during the last month of increasing US aggression in north African markets, traditionally supplied from Europe, with the size of the export enhancement program subsidies increasing significantly since July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, I note that the high level of export enhancement program subsidies is just one further example of how Australia gets caught in the cross-fire of the European Community-United States agricultural subsidy war. Ministers from this country have raised Australia's concerns over the use of EEP with the US Administration and members of Congress on numerous recent occasions. Most recently, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade took the opportunity to raise the matter of the use of EEP when he met with the US Secretary of State, Mr Baker, in Washington to discuss the crisis in the Middle East.</PARA>
<PARA> When I visited Washington in June I stressed to various American Administration and congressional leaders the damage that the agricultural trade war was causing to Australia. Both Senator Evans and I have forcefully raised with the United States the issue of EEP provisions in the 1990 Farm Bill at present before the Congress. The House Bill requires that at least $US500m be spent each year to subsidise agricultural exports and the Senate Bill on the same subject supports continuation of the EEP to a maximum of $US1 billion per year. Both those Bills have passed their respective Houses and will need to be resolved in a conference committee.</PARA>
<PARA> In a disturbing new development the United States Senate has also passed a Bill which, if enacted, would require the Administration to target EEP sales at the markets of countries which do not have acreage reduction programs, which would, of course, encompass Australia. Our embassy in Washington has made urgent representation on this matter. We have urged the United States to abandon the EEP program and, if that is not possible immediately, to target its use to avoid damage to the markets of fair traders in wheat, such as Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> We have also been pressing hard for the abolition of agricultural export subsidies by all nations in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. This recent escalation of the EEP shows how important it is to get a substantial result for agriculture in the Uruguay Round.</PARA>

The Treasurer will no doubt be aware that on current trends the wool industry now expects that its debt will increase by $2 billion beyond the Budget forecast of $1.9 billion and that, as a result, the 1990-91 public sector borrowing requirement will not be zero, as forecast in the Budget, but will rise to more than one-half of one per cent of gross domestic product. Will the Treasurer explain to the House how his public sector borrowing requirement forecast was so wrong so early in the financial year and what the implications of this change are for the Australian economy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as I know, there is no reliable number as to the likely level of borrowings by the Australian Wool Corporation over the course of this year, though the honourable gentleman relies on a number in his question. It is true that the Government has removed the limit on borrowings because of market speculation about the resolve of the Government and the Corporation in prosecuting a scheme based around a 700c price. That said, it is, I think, early days yet as to how the market will pan out over the course of the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that there has been a very heavy level of in-buying, if you like, by the Corporation. A substantial part of that was figured in the general call on savings by the Wool Corporation in the Treasury's estimates. It is possible that the borrowings could be above the forecast but to what extent and whether or not the public sector borrowing requirement will then in outcome remain in balance will depend upon a number of things, such as the draw-down by the other Commonwealth authorities over the course of the year or the run-down in financial assets by States.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a willingness on the part of some of the States to reduce their borrowing requirement over the course of the year. The Victorian Premier indicated this in recent remarks, as did the Victorian Treasurer. This may also be true of New South Wales. One would be really chancing one's hand to take a view that the public sector borrowing requirement in outcome would go into deficit over the course of the year.</PARA>
<PARA> Wool is certainly a problem in terms of the call that the Corporation might make upon the borrowing arrangement. But the wool industry is an issue which will have to be resolved, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has said quite eloquently in the House. The Minister has been conducting negotiations and discussions with the industry and will again come back to Cabinet on the matter later in the year. One hopes that we will see a bigger level of clearances and less call upon the contingency arrangements which are in place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs inform the House whether there are particular factors which show that there is increasing bipartisanship in Aboriginal affairs? What are the implications of the move to bipartisanship for relations between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the wider community?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Oxley for his question, and I am pleased to be able to tell him and the House that there are many indications of increasing bipartisan support for Aboriginal affairs initiatives. The moves towards bipartisanship started, of course, with the Prime Minister's letter to the Leader of the Opposition following the election. In that letter the Prime Minister essentially put forward a number of points. One was to call on the Opposition to work with the Government to advance a process of reconciliation and to put on the agenda the issue of an instrument of reconciliation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Above all else, that letter sought to establish a better mood of cooperation and goodwill in relation to Aboriginal affairs issues. I am delighted to say that the response by the Leader of the Opposition showed tremendous goodwill. It indicated that the Opposition was prepared to support a process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in the wider community and left open the possibility of some instrument or document giving effect to that process.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made it clear that it will continue to deal with the Opposition in an open and honest manner in relation to these issues. I am confident that we can maintain this spirit of cross-party cooperation in relation to these issues.</PARA>
<PARA> Matters have advanced significantly beyond those preliminary initiatives for bipartisanship. The Queensland National Party Leader responded to the Prime Minister's letter in a most remarkable way. I will quickly and briefly refer to that letter. Mr Russell Cooper went on the public record as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>All Australians can benefit from such an approach with the end result being increased national pride.</PARA>
<PARA> There is much to learn from our indigenous people, in particular their total oneness with the land, its plants and animals-a firmly balanced eco-system to which latter day inhabitants cannot aspire.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to assure the Prime Minister of the Queensland National Party's cooperation in relation to the issues raised by him.</PARA>
<PARA> Matters have progressed even further. To his great credit, the New South Wales Premier, Mr Greiner, has been working out an arrangement with the Aboriginal land councils in that State. Only last week in this Parliament a cross-party Australian Parliament Aboriginal awareness group was established. The aims of that group are to encourage a greater level of awareness and understanding about the history, culture and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as well as promoting cross-party support for addressing Aboriginal disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the second part of the honourable member's question. There are important implications from these developments for the Parliament, the nation and, most importantly, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As a Parliament I believe that these developments can enable us to move forward to implement a process of reconciliation. Secondly, as a nation I believe that we ought to be able to achieve the necessary resource allocation and inter-government cooperation necessary to address the still tragic level of Aboriginal disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA> The Melbourne Age recently concluded in an editorial:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in a country as rich as Australia, no community should be as disadvantaged as Aborigines are. There is also a practical political case for bipartisanship; neither party will gain if the Aboriginal issue is allowed to become an increasing cause of internal division and external embarrassment.</PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, in the course of this Parliament the Government looks forward to working with the Opposition, and indeed the Australian Democrats, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to advance the issues that have been raised by the honourable member in the course of his question.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all I make the threshold observation that, to my knowledge, to date I have not provided any export licence for chipping from private land, although that may have been the case over the past few months. In terms of the Commonwealth's role in providing export licences, clearly we have the constitutional responsibility to provide licences where people seek to export chipping from private land. I recall a number of cases during my short tenure in this portfolio where we have looked at the issue, in part because of suggestions of malpractice relating to some private operators, and most particularly relating to a case in Queensland. I am not sure whether the honourable member's question is directed to that issue. If it is, let me say that as Minister for Resources I have a very strong view that not only areas of publicly owned land but areas of privately owned land ought only to be used for this resource under the strictest possible environmental guidelines. If the honourable member's question is directed towards this instance, there were suggestions that some private land had been cleared without permission and that that consequently resulted, or potentially could result, in damage to what was private property but was important in terms of its environmental attributes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the overriding issue, of course we have a clear role to play, particularly in National Estate areas. Our involvement in forestry issues around the country is primarily driven by the Commonwealth's objective to ensure that there is a proper integration of environmental and developmental objectives. In that context, as the honourable member is aware, we are currently looking at the south-east forests issue. That will be repeated around the country as it has been in the past. We have used that trigger for export licence approval to ensure that the States work with us-I think that is the way it is going now-to ensure that these appropriate balances are arrived at.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tone of the media release is the kind of scaremongering that we sometimes get from the honourable member opposite rather than from an independent body whose charter is supposed to be the rational defence of privacy matters. I remind the Australian Privacy Foundation that governments, not the Health Insurance Commission, make regulations, and regulations are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and approval.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1989 regulations that the Privacy Foundation refers to simply transferred administrative functions from the Department of Community Services and Health to the Commission. They did not give the Commission any powers not already in the National Health Act. For the benefit of the Australian Privacy Foundation I repeat what I said last month in this place:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the PBS, pharmacists are paid by the Health Insurance Commission to recompense them for the difference between the cost of drugs and the amount patients have to pay for them. A pharmacist is entitled to a higher payment from the Commission for a prescription dispensed to a pensioner than a prescription dispensed to a general user, and the Government believes that no subsidy should be paid for non-residents of Australia, such as foreign tourists.</PARA>

<PARA> To run a tight system, it is necessary for the Commission to be able to verify accurately the amount the pharmacist claims. This depends on what drug has been dispensed and in what quantities. It also depends on the status of the patient under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, whether he or she is a resident of Australia, and whether he or she is entitled to a concessional benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> When a patient presents to the pharmacist a claim to be entitled to subsidy to which he or she is not entitled, who should bear the cost-the patient who is not entitled, the pharmacist or the public? The Government believes that the public should not have to bear that cost. Accordingly, the Government has proposed a secure system which allows pharmacists to satisfy themselves of a customer's eligibility for subsidised pharmaceuticals.</PARA>
<PARA> No pharmacist will be required to use the Medicare card system. However, any pharmacist who does use the system will be protected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I will not repeat it, but I would refer honourable members to my answer to a similar question earlier. The Privacy Commissioner has two quite specific concerns. The first is the flow of information from the Department of Social Security, that is, whether people are entitled; and, secondly, the risk of embarrassment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government proposes to deal with these two concerns by legislation to be introduced this sitting which will strictly define the only information the Department of Social Security can provide to the Commission for these purposes-that is, identity information, the status of the person. The Department of Social Security will not be able to provide information about income. Secondly, the legislation will strictly define the information the Commission can provide to pharmacists as being the pharmaceutical benefit scheme status of a patient inquired about.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's position is very clear. On the one hand, the Government wants to run a tight system and to remove, as far as possible, the possibility of fraud. On the other hand, the Government is concerned with the proper issue of privacy as far as the individual client is concerned. The legislation to be introduced is not concerned with broad matching of claims, but with verification of necessary facts in order that the pharmacists can be sure that the person for whom a concession has been provided is, in fact, eligible under the conditions of the Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, there is one concept which runs counter to all that the Liberal and National parties stand for, and that is the concept of monopolisation. The foundation of these parties, in fact the very fibre of our being, is threatened by the existence of monopolies. Monopolies in the areas of banking, telecommunications, airlines and transport, medical care, agriculture, big business or big government run counter to our very existence. We believe that freedom is political power in whatever form divided into small fragments. Our light on the hill is the division of economic power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Contrast that with the stance of the Hawke Government, which fundamentally believes in monopolies. It believes, as the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) indicated last night, in the existence of government banks, government airlines, government communications, amalgamated unions and a monopolised work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes that are currently being considered by the Government in the area of telecommunications do nothing more than tinker at the edges, because the Government remains committed to a policy which believes in some form of monopolisation. The changes are proposed not because the Government has had a change of heart but because they are being forced on it out of economic necessity. The Government has no conviction about small business or the breakdown of monopolies; economic necessity is forcing these changes on it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties' abhorrence of monopolies is fundamental. But there is an area even more dangerous for our national sanity than the Government's tangible marshalling of its resources under monopolies, and that is the Government's belief that it has a monopoly on social justice. For the last two weeks speeches delivered by those opposite during the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)-particularly the speech from the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who spent 20 minutes on it-have focused on the blind conviction that equity is solely the province of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter of public importance is all about social justice-something on which no one of us has a monopoly. As the member proposing this matter of public importance, which is to be supported by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), I happen to represent an electorate made up of rural primary producers, as does the honourable member for Gwydir. But the majority of people on this side of the House have electorates made up of rural primary producers, and our plea is for some social justice for our constituents. Our plea, frankly, to pick up the call yesterday of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), is to allow those in Australia who do something well to do it even better. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular matter of public importance has been prompted by the uncomfortable reality that every primary producer in Australia, regardless of his or her circumstance, is to be denied the family allowance, of all things. If, under the Budget handed down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in August, one happens to be a small businessman, a primary producer or a farmer with an asset that exceeds $300,000-and I would have very few primary producers in my electorate, and so would every other rural representative in this House, whose assets do not exceed $300,000-one will be denied the family allowance. Why? Because he is wealthy? No, he will be denied the family allowance simply because he has an asset deemed to be worth in excess of $300,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, if you think that members on this side of the House are indignant at this proposal, you ought to have listened to some speeches from honourable members on your own side of the House, particularly that from the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), who expressed a good deal of concern at the decision taken by the Government to deny the family allowance to everybody whose assets exceed $300,000. </PARA>
<PARA> This year of 1990, when farm incomes will be at a low unprecedented for three decades, is the year when this Government chooses to deny the family allowance to farming families. There is no question of how many children are in the family and no question of the farmer's cash flow. If the farmer happens to have an asset valued in excess of $300,000, there is no family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I ask you, as one who comes from a party that claims to have a monopoly on social justice: Where is the social justice in that decision? The other side of the House must be dominated by people who have a totally blinkered view of what rural Australia is all about. Does anyone imagine any of my farmers with an asset in excess of $600,000 seeing that asset as $600,000 in cash? Of course they do not. If they did, they might well have liquidated that asset. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees that farm property as an asset, but in some cases properties have been in the family for generations and the farmers intend to farm them so that they can be handed on to future generations. Farmers do not regard that asset as being $600,000 that is available to them, but simply as a capacity to make a living, a living that in 1990 in most instances will be negative. Because they have that asset they will be denied the family allowance, no matter what their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that it is high time the Treasurer moved out of his office and went to the parliamentary staff cafeteria, where the Parliamentary Catering Service has a motto on which the staff would like his opinion: they want to see themselves as others see them. I have some advice for the Treasurer about the way the rural community sees him. But I should like to know also what he knows about the rural community. How does he see it? Frankly, what has the rural task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) been about? Has it been totally mute? Have its members not conveyed anything to the Prime Minister or the Treasurer about the opinion of rural Australia in regard to the assets test?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the Treasurer imagine, as the socialist members opposite are prone to do, that every farmer drives a Mercedes Benz. Let me tell them a truth or two. They will find a Mercedes Benz on the farm, but it is in the shed in the form of a truck or a tractor, purchased simply so that the job can be done more profitably. That vehicle could have been a car, but that would have been unproductive. Instead it is in the shed. As a result, it will be included as part of the asset that denies the farmer and his family access to the family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> Have any members on the Government benches wandered round a farm lately or taken a look at the conditions under which farming families live? I invite honourable members to come to my electorate, where the majority of farmers at best drive Holden Commodores or Falcons, and where most of the farm housewives work in kitchens that were built when they were married 30 years ago, without any of the modern gadgetry taken for granted in urban Australia. But people in urban Australia will get the family allowance, while the farmer is denied it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To pick up the point made effectively by the honourable member for Parkes, is there any social justice in that? I am conscious of the clock, and in the words of the song, I have only just begun. But I must proceed to tell the House that it is not just the family allowance to which farming families will be denied access under the assets test imposed by the Government without any thought to social justice or social equity. This Government, with a plea for a clever country, is to deny those same farming families access to Austudy. Who will be most affected? It will not be the farmer or his or her spouse, but their children. The very children who should be encouraged to take up tertiary education will be, as a result of the decisions handed down in this Parliament in August, denied access to Austudy. I ask the Prime Minister's rural task force: Is there any social justice in that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where once a farm valued at $600,000 would still have allowed its owner access to Austudy, now if a farm is valued at $400,000 or over, Austudy will be cut off, and cut off in the year in which farm incomes are at an all time low, or certainly a low in the period of my lifetime, as calculated by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. Will these proposals in fact be income tested? No, they will not. The income test that applied previously will continue, but instead of anyone asking the farmer what his income is, so that his eligibility for family allowance or Austudy can be assessed, he will be asked about his assets. No longer will the farmer be asked what he earns. No tertiary assistance will be given to that farmer's children, because dad's or mum's property is valued at more than $400,000. It is okay if someone has a house on the foreshore, but it is not okay if that person is part of the farming community of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the honourable member for Moreton to respond to my question: Is that social justice? I could go on and ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether the Government's policy on interest rates, which has impinged directly on every farming family and directly affected every exporter, reflected any concept of social justice. But I will not do so. The honourable member for Gwydir will have a few comments to make in that direction. I could go on and ask whether the Government's policy of an inflated dollar, which also has been a real burden for every exporter, every farming family and every small businessman, is social justice. Of course it is not, for it favours the urban elector at the expense of the rural elector. </PARA>
<PARA> Do the matters which are debated as matters of public importance in this House, such as the telecommunications legislation or the airline legislation-which was referred to yesterday by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull)-reflect any social justice? Of course they do not. The Opposition is in favour of allowing farmers to determine who will install their telephones;-it should not necessarily be the monopoly called Telecom Australia. Is there any justice in an education system which limits the curriculum choice available to rural Australians? Of course there is not. But where is the voice of the Prime Minister's rural task force on this issue? Is there any justice in the infrastructure rundown that has occurred throughout rural Australia at the expense of rural Australians while urban Australians have continued to enjoy modern updated transport systems? Of course there is not. But this has been totally ignored by the Treasurer in his Budget and it has been totally ignored in any subsequent response to the Budget that we have heard over the last two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the House that the workers of Australia are represented by those on this side of the House. Take a look at the background of any of the people who occupy the Government benches. Take a look at where the productive people of Australia happen to be seated in this chamber. One will find that they are seated on the Opposition benches. The voice of the Aussie battler is now the voice of the Liberal and National parties. What do we find on the Government side? We find Volvo-driving socialists who are comfortably insulated from reality and who are protected by their Party's union monopolised preselection system. They make me sick. </PARA>
<PARA> It has taken me 15 minutes to deliver this speech. In those 15 minutes this nation has gone, if you please, $500,000 deeper into trading debt. Australia is going into debt at a rate of $2m an hour, $50m a day, $500m every 10 days and $1.5 billion every month. We cannot defend that sort of absurdity. We need to encourage productive Australians to produce exports. That is what rural Australia is about. That is what we need, yet what do we have? All we have is a government policy that, quite frankly, handicaps the productive people whom we need the most. The people that Australia most needs are the people who have been treated most unjustly. Is there any social justice in that?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that Woody Allen would have had great difficulty competing with the last speech. With regard to social justice, it is rather strange that the Opposition, which wants to give a tax break by abolishing the capital gains tax at the expense of the average family, would have the audacity to talk about social justice. This matter of public importance concerns economic performance and grappling with the economic issues that face this nation. We did not hear about that in the last 15 minutes, and I can understand why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to make a few comments in relation to primary industries and the latest figures released by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE). The figures reveal that 99 per cent of the farms surveyed are operated as family businesses. There has been an increase in the number of farms under multiple ownership-many are owned by a combination of more than one generation. As one would expect, the age distribution of those in the normally managed farms is skewed to the older age groups, but the secondary farm households-that is, those people who share ownership but who are not nominally the managers-are predominantly in the younger age groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The other notable fact to emerge from the survey is that off-farm sources of income for farm operators and their spouses accounted for 27 per cent of total cash income. In the horticulture area the figure is 38 per cent. Over 80 per cent of farm operators and their spouses in the surveyed industries derived income from off-farm investments in 1987-88. Finally, the ABARE report categorically stated that smaller farms may be equally as efficient as larger ones when unmeasured costs and benefits are taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the reduction in farm returns, there has been a decline of 8.4 per cent, which contrasts with the year before when there was a rise of 2.1 per cent, and in the year before that there was a rise of 12.2 per cent. In the past 12 months several outstanding issues have had a large effect. Of course, the biggest of all is the wool industry. Wool receipts are forecast to fall by about $830m and wheat receipts by about $260m. There is an offset increase though in regard to cotton, for which receipts are up by approximately $75m, sugar by about $80m and beef by $75m. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated $600m increase in the wool levy is the significant factor behind the 5 per cent rise forecast in farm costs. Taken into the downturn is a $3 billion depreciation, which certainly has a massive effect. If we are going to talk about the economic effect on rural Australia, we need to understand what economic policy is all about. It is about three arms of policy: fiscal, wages and monetary. </PARA>
<PARA> When we get back to the nitty-gritty and we forget about the rhetoric the Opposition has been ladling out to the farm sector for the past 40 years-the doom and gloom and sympathy-we find that the Opposition has never found it within its capabilities to tell it the way it is. When we get back to economic rationale and economic debate, we need to understand a few fundamental points.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to fiscal policy, during the last election and in the Budget, which contains a surplus of over $8 billion, the Federal Government made some tough decisions. The Liberal Party said we were not tough enough. The National Party ran around the bush saying we were too tough. We have just heard the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) say that the family allowance supplement (FAS) should be extended to everybody who has assets over $250,000 net, plus a home, and that Austudy should be available to people with assets over $600,000. That would require a softening of fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to two other arms of policy, I should like to speak a little about wages policy. The Opposition does not have a wages policy; its view is the law of the jungle. We saw what happened last year with the pilots dispute. The Opposition was tacitly supporting a 30 per cent pay grab by an exclusive group of people. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the rural sector, everybody acknowledges the importance and the need for supporting farmers in this nation. However, the Opposition failed to mention the other people out there in the rural areas-the workers. In regard to the wages policy that the Opposition does not have-in other words, it has no wages policy at all-the very proposition of its collective bargaining, the embracing of voluntary agreements, would impact on those workers. I am referring to the people Opposition members have never met, do not drink with and do not talk to. I mean the sawmill workers, the council workers, the workers in the sugar industry and so on. They do not drive Volvos; they do not mix with the ilk on the other side of the House; but they are the ones who count just as much as anyone else in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> If there was a free-for-all in the wages structure, the workers in craft unions-the unions at the top end of the scale-would certainly be able to get a fair break. As I said, the average worker would not. We would see a massive blow-out in costs and inflation would go through the roof. It would also mean that monetary policy would have to be tightened; in other words, interest rates would be pushed up. </PARA>
<PARA> If one analyses the rhetoric put out by the conservative parties in the bush, one discovers that they want to have a bit of everything. In other words, they want more money spent when it suits the audience but then when it comes to interest rates, they want them to magically come down. At the same time, they never say how. </PARA>
<PARA> The other interesting comment that we often hear in the bush from Opposition members is that the dollar is too high. They forget to say that it took the Labor Government to float the dollar. It took the Labor Government to allow the dollar to float in the first place and it actually was the greatest boost we had in export industries that we have ever seen. They forget to mention that they are still hampered and shackled by the McEwenism in the National Party in regard to protection. Probably one of the saddest things, particularly in my area in Queensland, is the lack of leadership in regard to healthy debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Challenge from both sides of the House is important. It is important that the Opposition challenge our policies. I think it is sad, though, that it does not have any policies of its own. But when it comes to rational debate in the rural community, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Boswell, goes along to beef, sugar, wheat and wool meetings, saying he embraces freer trade. He wants to see Australians fight through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round in the Cairns Group to get fair access to trade for our great export industries. But when the wood is put on him, when he meets with pineapple growers or pork producers, all of a sudden he becomes a protectionist and wants to ban the importation of any of the commodities that are going to compete with those commodities. I guess he fails to understand that dumping provisions are in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that we cannot take seriously the rhetoric from the National Party in regard to this protection in isolation, as it comes from industry to industry, because it does not have the courage to say to its people that we have to fight for freer trade and get a little bit of competition and micro-economic reform into the agricultural sector. What would happen if we took seriously the propositions of people like Senator Ron Boswell? We would sabotage our position overseas in the GATT negotiations. We would lose the great opportunities we have already gained with sugar and beef and the position we are taking now to get better access to those markets-and we will get better access to those markets. What needs to be understood is that while we are a small nation, while we do not have the same clout as other countries, we have more to lose than any other nation if we put up protective barriers. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the Opposition parties are not prepared to say it the way it is to primary producers. They want to be a little bit of everything to everybody, because they believe that will curry votes. It will not curry votes. We need only look to Queensland and the last election to see that. Rightfully, one of the greatest seats since Federation, Kennedy, came back home and we will get Dawson in the next election because the rural community is waking up to the fact that there is no simple solution, that it is tough going out there, and that we are doing it the way it should be done. There is no great panacea or magic wand to wave; if that were the case everybody would have done it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sad that there is a little bit of rhetoric without any substance on the other side of the House. I think it indicates, more than anything else, that on the other side of the House there is a lack of understanding, a lack of leadership, certainly when it comes to the fundamental debates in the agricultural sector. When it came to the sugar industry and the sugar debate the National Party opposed the abolition of the sugar embargo. In fact, Senator Ron Boswell said that abolition of the sugar embargo would mean the loss of something like $300m. We gained a greater access to trade immediately after getting rid of it through GATT. We have an opportunity now to expand in sugar and pick up another half a million dollars if we have the courage to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the wheat debate and deregulation, once again it was the National Party that opposed deregulation. The former Premier of Queensland, Mike Ahern, said 50,000 trucks would go through Queen Street if we deregulated the wheat industry to give wheat producers a free choice. Again, sadly, the National Party played to its own constituency, instead of saying it the way it was. Of course, once again the National Party in particular was absolutely irrelevant to the whole wool debate. It failed to understand the fundamental facts or the challenges that the wool industry faces. As I said earlier in my speech, the wool industry is facing tough times. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is showing the initiative in calling the groups together. We are going to get out there and fight to gain better access for our markets. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important issues that impacts on rural Australia is micro-economic reform. The Government has taken the lead and the initiative there too. We are often accused and criticised by the other side of the House for not doing enough quickly enough-I guess if we climbed Mount Everest members of the Opposition would tell us to go to the moon. But the point is, we had 40 years of lost golden opportunity. It is only the Hawke Government that has taken on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Transport is one of the biggest fundamental changes which is under way and which we have to address. An integrated transport system no doubt will create better economies of scale and more efficiencies. One of the biggest costs that affects primary producers is transportation from farm gate to wharf. Much has been said about the waterfront, and we are addressing those problems, but transportation from farm gate to wharf also needs addressing. The initiative that the Government has taken, in conjunction with the six State governments, in relation to an integrated transport system will move a long way to improving the situation and solving those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry restructuring is another area where the Federal Government is playing a massive role. Industry restructuring has been badly overdue. We are addressing the matter without using a sledge-hammer; we are doing it with cooperation. We also need to look at the area of electricity. Production of electricity seems to stop at State borders. There is a great amount of inefficiency that I believe we can address. There is also, of course, the rail system itself. </PARA>
<PARA> These issues are not one-liners for which the National or Liberal parties can put out press releases. They involve hard work, hard yakka. We have to work through the issues. The benefits do not come overnight, but I believe the farm sector understands that the only way we can improve the economy-not only for farmers and the people who work in rural areas but also for this nation-is to work through the processes that are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Because everything has always come easy to those on the other side of the House, they expect that things will come easy to government. They have to recognise and reflect upon the wasted years and lost opportunities when they were in government-opportunities that, very sadly, we now have to catch up on.</PARA>
<PARA> I would be remiss if I did not make a brief comment about the responsibility of the banking sector. I do not believe that we should take every opportunity to belt the banks. I know that they are often an 'easy out' but I believe that the banks need to take responsibility for the way in which they treat their customers. Over the last few years the lending of some of the banks to some of the cowboys of the corporate sector has left much to be desired. I do not believe that the family paying off a home in Sydney or Brisbane, or the farmer at Emerald or Barcaldine, should have to subsidise the bad mistakes of a few high rollers in the corporate sector and a few leaders in the banking industry who got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the healthy things about the banking industry is that it is now coming into the real world. We are beginning to understand that we cannot be a part of the world unless we are in it. We will have better financial institutions as a consequence of competition and getting rid of the mushrooming that existed for so many years in the financial markets, just as happened with protection in the primary and secondary industries. Banks should take a bigger responsibility and show a bit more compassion than they have in the past. They should start to realise that, while it is important to have the right black dots on the ledger, they are dealing with human beings with hopes and aspirations. Such considerations are often put aside simply to get that extra half per cent for investors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I cannot help making the observation that it seems that those on the other side struggle to try to find relevant issues when it comes to debates about the fortunes of the rural sector. I can think of nothing more irrelevant than talking about off-farm income that farmers are now looking for. When the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) referred to 27 per cent off-farm income in one sector, he was almost utterly irrelevant. For a start, most farm incomes are so low that 27 per cent is quite meaningless; secondly, the figure is simply a pointer to the very real crisis that is occurring as people make enormous sacrifices, in terms of the operation of their farms and the impact on their family lives, in a desperate attempt to stay afloat by earning a few bob off the farm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take very strong exception to the honourable member's loose remarks about the failure of individuals on this side of the House to get out there, mix it and talk with real people, with workers out in the bush. I take every available opportunity to get out there and talk to real Australians, as does everyone else on this side who has the chance to do so. Workers out in the bush are hurting because the industries which they service and in which they participate are being snuffed out by the policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer very briefly to the honourable member's remarks about wheat. Government members were the ones who sold wheat deregulation as being a great positive for farmers on the basis of the increased efficiencies which they promised us would result in handling, storage and the waterfront. I simply respond by asking: Where are those improved efficiencies? Where are the savings and the benefits that were meant to flow to the wheatgrowers?</PARA>
<PARA> If Australians and their elected government in this place really knew what the decline of living standards out there in the bush means-what it means not just for rural Australians but for all Australians-they would want some action and they would want it pretty fast. They might not want it for compassionate or social justice reasons alone; they would want action because those declining living standards tell a story of declining output-declining output which is likely to climb further and faster in the future. It is a story of the increased contraction of the performance of Australia's wealth generating heartland, our export wealth generating heartland. </PARA>
<PARA> The future of all Australians is increasingly threatened by what is happening out there beyond the great urban sprawl in this country. Only five million Australians, out of a total population of around 17 million, live outside our 14 major cities. Yet it is out there that our export industries attempt to carry on in the face of almost intolerable difficulties. Our agricultural and mining industries-that is to say our wool, beef, cotton, wheat, coal and iron ore industries, together with other various assorted agricultural industries-generate some 85 per cent of Australia's export earnings at a time when Australia needs every export dollar it can raise. It is to those industries and the needs of the people involved in them that we must look if we are to pull ourselves out of our own cleverly home grown recession. </PARA>
<PARA> It may interest honourable members to know that in the early 1960s we were eighth in the global trading order. We have slipped to twentieth. That slippage must be addressed. Yet this Government goes on discriminating against the hand that feeds, in literal and economic terms, Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> It is one thing for the farm sector and the community which backs it up to cope with nature's blows and the vagaries of international commodity prices-drought, flood and fire are part of the farmer's lot-but the trading practices engaged in by the European Community and the United States of America, which we heard a bit about during Question Time, are also largely beyond the control of this country. That is accepted. When we add a third part to the equation-a domestic economy seemingly so badly run that people could be forgiven for believing that this Government was anti-small business, anti-farmer and anti-rural-we have real problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Massive interest rates, high dollar levels, high inflation-inflation consistently higher than published consumer price index figures indicate in this country for agriculture-and an alarming run-down in rural infrastructure and services all mean that rural businesses cannot lay down fat in the good times and cannot effectively batten down the hatches when the going gets rough. Graphic evidence of this is provided for in the figures that indicate that the interest component of farm costs has risen from 9 per cent in 1985 to 13 per cent currently. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us turn for a moment to interest rates. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) once referred to monetary policy as a blunt instrument. It certainly is a blunt instrument. It fails to discriminate between good and bad activity in the economy and it seems to have had the effect of wiping out both in Australia. It has effectively failed on one hand to rein in consumer exports and to balance the book by that mechanism, and at the same time it has continued to cripple our rural sector, our export sector, the producers out there. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been playing around with some figures which tell a very interesting little story. Let us assume for a moment that a small businessman or farmer in Australia borrowed $100,000 to upgrade or expand his operation in 1983 when the Labor Government came to power. Let us see how he would have compared with somebody borrowing the same amount of money in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Japan. Assuming he undertook to repay principal at the rate of $10,000 per annum and he was actually able to do so-a very dubious proposition for a small businessman or farmer in Australia in recent years-he would by now in Japan have paid interest on his principal repayments of $26,500. If he was in America, he would have paid $43,362. If he was living in the United Kingdom, he would have repaid $59,273. But in Australia he would have coughed up no less than $84,346. That is a graphic illustration of how we have our hands tied behind our backs in this country, particularly when we want to get out there and produce something or do the very things that everybody tells us we need to try to do. </PARA>
<PARA> That almost $60,000 difference between the repayment of interest levels indicated in Japan and Australia would have gone a long way in the hands of a small businessman or farmer in Australia. It might actually have contributed towards something we hear a lot of about on the other side of the chamber called social justice. That small businessman or farmer might have been able to put his kids through school. He might not need quite such desperate help from the Government in terms of band-aid assistance. He might also have been able to buy a farm, especially at the rate farm values are likely to slip in the foreseeable future in Australia. With the permission of the Minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), I seek leave to have tables incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How in the name of good fortune does this Government ever expect our people to compete with these sorts of disadvantages? We hear all the hype about productivity from honourable members opposite while they talk about mega-unions and streamlining our inflexible and increasingly irrelevant centralised wage fixing system. What about the impact of the cost of money on productivity in Australia? What about the distortion of our currency values resulting from these overheated interest rates?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last 20 years average productivity growth in the farm sector has been of the order of 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 per cent, far ahead of the rest of our moribund economy and better than much of the rest of the world. All that is being stopped dead in its tracks. Let there be no mistake-it will not be just the farm sector that misses out; it will be all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> Our rural sector now faces horrific drops in commodity prices at a time when it is left hopelessly exposed by domestic economic parameters. The dramatic drop in wool prices is bad enough, but the cost squeeze for wheat growers will be infinitely worse. The average wheat grower this year will lose $15,000. That massive loss has huge implications for us all and for the drop-off in national productivity right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the gutting of programs in the bush that goes hand in hand with this has contributed to declining living standards in rural Australia in a way that cannot be ignored by any thinking Australian who has any desire for a safe future for himself or his children. Honourable members opposite will continue to ignore what is happening at the peril not just of themselves but of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the newly elected member for one of the largest rural electorates in this country, it is with pleasure that I speak on this matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be said at the outset that the people of rural and regional Australia, including farmers, have always borne a substantial amount of the adjustment pressures which are shared around this country. Adjustment is not only unavoidable, it is desirable. Without adjustment and change, we will go backwards in all respects. We will become uncompetitive on world markets, we will go without the benefits of technical change, and we will not develop in any desirable ways at all. I make not one ounce of apology for the fact that the policies of this Government have intentionally encouraged and indeed accelerated change. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall that in my maiden speech to this Parliament I stated that the Australian Labor Party had returned to its roots in the bush. I stated then and I firmly believe that the ALP is the natural party for rural Australians. This is no more so than in Queensland, where the ALP holds 15 of the 24 Federal seats, with only three being held by the National Party, the Party that in the past prided itself on representing the interests of country Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as rural Australians are concerned, the bottom line is integrity. Rural Australians will support people, whether or not they belong to a political party, who have integrity, who are fair dinkum. This is the reason for the ALP's ascendancy, particularly in rural Queensland. It is also the reason for the decline of the conservative parties, particularly the lacklustre National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has taken a number of initiatives that have not only improved the living standards of all Australians, but also been widely accepted by members of rural communities. One of the most important initiatives of the Hawke Labor Government was to ensure that people living in rural and remote areas of this country have the same sort of access to information, and indeed services, that are available to other Australians. As a result, the Countrylink program was set up and, under its umbrella, the Australian Country Information Service. This program and service bring information to rural Australia on a face to face basis. They give rural Australians information that previously they had to travel hundreds of miles to obtain. I am sure that honourable members on both sides of this House applaud the Countrylink initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that I speak about access. In rural Australia, and, I guess, speaking parochially, in my electorate of Kennedy, access to resources, access to information and access to equality of opportunity go straight to the heart of living standards and, consequently, I believe, to the heart of this matter of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 this Government established the rural women's access program. This program was set up to fund community projects that are aimed at improving access by women to services and employment in rural areas. The program provides financial assistance for small-scale projects in rural areas, and I am pleased to say that a number of groups in my electorate have applied for grants under the rural women's access program. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988, this Government initiated the rural education access program and the innovative rural education and training program. The rural education access program aims to make relevant education and training more accessible to people in non-metropolitan areas through the provision of financial support to community groups. Funds assist community groups to plan, organise and coordinate education and training activities which meet local needs. The innovative rural education and training program is administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and aims to increase access by people in non-metropolitan Australia to education and training. It is designed to assist education institutions, industry bodies and community groups to develop innovative methods for delivering relevant education and training programs for people in the rural community. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the very important issue of health and health care. These matters directly affect the living standards of all rural Australians. This Labor Government has directed energy and resources towards redressing the overwhelming neglect of previous conservative governments in the rural health arena. Aged care services are crucially important to a disproportionately ageing populace. In the mid-1980s, after recognising that part of the legacy of the coalition Government was a disjointed and uncoordinated aged care system in which rural Australia was virtually forgotten, the Labor Government embarked upon an aged care reform strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> A key plank in the aged care reform strategy is to target care facilities in areas where they are most needed. It is not a coincidence that the overwhelming areas of need as Australia moved into the 1980s were remote rural areas. Today, I am pleased to say, aged care facilities, including facilities for the Aboriginal and ethnic aged, have been established not only in the most remote parts of my electorate but also in the most remote parts of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken about access to services in rural areas because, as I said earlier, living standards in rural areas to a large degree depend on the ability of rural Australians to obtain access to services and programs available to Australians living in the cities. There can be no doubt at all that due to the initiatives I have mentioned, as well as others such as the rural counselling program, which provides funds to assist with the provision of financial advice to rural Australians, and the recently announced fee relief for child-care places in commercial centres, this Government is not only addressing the living standards of rural Australians but is also enhancing such living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the outset that rural Australians require their representatives to have integrity. They demand it and, indeed, deserve it. Integrity comes in a number of forms and one such form is the ability to take hard decisions. I have travelled my electorate extensively since the election and particularly since this Government, through the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), took a hard decision in relation to wool. Many woolgrowers in my electorate have now realised that, had this Government not taken the decision it did in lowering the floor price to 700c, we would not have a viable wool industry heading into the twenty-first century. The decision was taken in the interests of the long term living standards of those involved in the industry. It was a tough but correct decision. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government can take tough decisions in the interests of rural Australians. Its economic package, its micro-economic reform policy, is working and will ultimately further benefit the rural sector. On the point of micro-economic reform, it is fair to say that of real importance to rural people and rural businesses are the efficiency and effectiveness of their communications systems: their telephone system; their ability to receive television and radio; their road, rail and air transport systems; and, as I have said, their access to government services. If I could sum up in one phrase what this Government's micro-economic reform package is all about, it is about dragging our services and infrastructure into the twenty-first century for the benefit of all, including rural Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the comments of the Managing Director of the Westpac Banking Corporation when he addressed the thirteenth annual conference of the New South Wales Farmers Association in July of this year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Monetary policy will remain tight, with the level of interest rates dependent on prevailing levels of economic activity. In view of the impact of inflation on the farm sector, I would also expect farmers to support such an approach, which maintains a firm anti-inflationary stance. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that farmers or the community generally can afford a trade-off between interest rates and inflation at this crucial stage in the restructuring of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Managing Director of the Westpac Banking Corporation backed the Government's micro-economic reforms generally and he urged farmers to do the same. I believe that rural Australians do accept the Government's current economic policies in the knowledge that their long term living standards will be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I must say that I am extremely pleased that the Opposition is at last taking some interest in rural and regional Australia. Nonetheless, I do not believe and I certainly do not hope that this new found interest is in time to save the National Party from further richly deserved decay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleagues have addressed the broad parameters of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and the Budget as a whole. I want in the limited time available to me this afternoon to address some specific sectors of policy and industry. Let me say at the outset that as a nation we must lift our productivity and efficiency performance and reduce inflation. There are no magic solutions to that task, no easy fixes. What is there is a need to develop a more skilful and adept work force; a need to overhaul workplace arrangements; a continuing investment in plant and equipment-an investment program that is already under way; increased emphasis on training-an emphasis which will be assisted by the training guarantee that has been implemented by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to turn to the major issue of award restructuring. At the outset, the words `award restructuring' were just another couple of jargon words. It was a term that was derided by the conservatives of the Liberal and National parties, but let me say that award restructuring is about change. It is about enabling people to carry out a wider range of tasks; about breaking down demarcation barriers; about giving people more interesting and satisfying careers, safer and more satisfying jobs, better paid jobs; and breaking down the barriers to women getting ahead in the workplace. All of those facets of award restructuring have two clear objectives: to enable us to lift our productivity and efficiency and to enable our goods and services to become more competitive at home and abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of award restructuring is a process of change. The mere thought of change generates fear in workers and management alike, but for change to take place in the workplace leadership for that change must come from the top. Enthusiasm and leadership in change, in modernising workplace arrangements, must come from top management, and that lead has to be followed through by middle management. If we were to single out one area in Australia today that is the greatest obstacle to improved performance, the greatest obstacle to change, then that is middle management. It is understandable; I am not critical of it. I want to describe it, focus upon it, and then look to industry and top management and corporate leadership in this country adequately to address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some 600,000 middle managers in this country trained in the old style of controlling, of directing their employees. They have not been trained in how to make the best use of available resources. In other words, they have not been trained in managing resources. The best example I can give comes from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd (BHP) Newcastle. BHP Newcastle will readily say publicly that its policy used to be that as employees came in the gate they were told, 'You're required to leave your brains outside because when you come inside this gate you're here to do as you are told. We want you to understand that. You're not paid to think. You're not paid to ask questions. You're paid to do as you're told'. Then BHP will go on immediately to say, 'That used to be our policy. It is not our policy today because we have discovered that the greatest resources we have in our company are the ideas and knowledge of our employees, and it's a goldmine that we are steadily mining'. That is the change that has occurred in BHP, and in their plants in Newcastle and across Australia that is being reflected in the increased productivity that has occurred. The ideas are coming from the people out on the shop floor-the people who operate the machines and work the tools. </PARA>
<PARA> Those 600,000 middle managers know that we are moving to flatter management structures where fewer middle managers will be required. They, like anybody else, are worried about their jobs, so they need to be involved in the decision making process. They need to be involved in the planning. They need to be able to see where they will fit into the new scheme of things. They need to understand the objectives, to feel secure and to understand what their roles will be. That means they need retraining as well. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget we are providing $11m for workplace reform. That workplace reform program is an essential adjunct to the process of award restructuring. It is an integral part of the Government's overall program of micro-economic reform and industry restructuring. Through the program we are promoting labour market reform and structural adjustment within industry by encouraging more appropriate work and management practices, better forms of work organisation and improved industrial relations. These reforms will benefit individual employees and enterprises by improving productivity and efficiency. The nation will benefit from the program's contribution to labour market reform, industry restructuring and the improved international competitiveness of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four complementary strategies to the workplace reform program. The first is the work change assistance scheme. Under this scheme, funds are available to support more than 50 specific reform projects in a wide range of industries. This funding will accelerate the benefits flowing from award restructuring, better career paths, simpler award structures and broader job classifications. </PARA>
<PARA> The second is the workplace resources scheme. We have established a national network of workplace resource centres to help industries introduce change. These centres provide, on a commercial basis, a comprehensive service of advice and assistance, including industrial strategic planning, new technologies, work organisation and career structures and human resource management. I am proud to say that the Newcastle centre is one of the best performing centres in the nation and reflects the leadership role that Newcastle plays in improving industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the work change training scheme, provision is made for joint training for managers and workers involved in implementing reform projects at the enterprise level. Training is available in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia at various tertiary institutions. The scheme will be extended to other States in 1990-91. Linked to this program is the need for the nation to move to an industry based union structure. In the Budget, some $750,000 is being provided to assist the process of union amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> So often we hear both in this place and out in the community, generally from industry associations, a parroting of the term `increased productivity' and how we ought to have it. But no amount of parroting the term `increased productivity' will achieve the improvement that this country must have to become more competitive in exports and import replacement. That will be achieved only by involving those affected by the changes in the planning for change and in the decisions, as I mentioned earlier. It is happening to an extent, but it is not happening fast enough or in enough places. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, management has to show that leadership, and it must exhibit the enthusiasm required. Government can set the direction through macro-economic policy, the Industrial Relations Commission can help set the environment and put the mechanisms in place, trade unions can cooperate and contribute; but only management can make it happen. It is not enough for industry associations to mouth platitudes about micro-economic reform; they have to implement micro-economic reform. For them, as for the rest of Australia, it is just plain hard slog. </PARA>
<PARA> A major area of micro-economic reform, about which little is heard from industry associations or the Opposition, is occupational health and safety-that is, improving the safety of workplaces and developing safer and more efficient workplace arrangements. The annual cost of work related illnesses and injury is horrendous-some $10,000m-and workers' compensation premiums alone cost $4,000m per year. Ten times as much time is lost through work related illness and injury in this nation as through industrial disputes. Yet do we hear 10 times as much about occupational health and safety as we do about industrial disputes? Of course not! The opposite is the case. The problem is that the vast majority of Australian management see work safety costs and efforts as an expense, not an investment in better performance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that, as I move around Australia and through industry and into plants, I often see that it is the successful, efficient and competitive firms that have sound occupational health and safety policies in place. Occupational health and safety is an area that was neglected and ignored by the conservative parties when in government. In 1985 this Government established the Occupational Health and Safety Commission which operates as WorkSafe Australia. WorkSafe is making an increasingly important contribution to micro-economic reform. The Opposition would have abolished that organisation had it won government last March. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to another area of micro-economic reform, and that is airline services. On 30 October the two-airline agreement will end after 38 years, heralding a new era in the provision of domestic airline services. I am pleased that this resulted from the Independent Review of Economic Regulation of Domestic Aviation, which I commissioned on 7 March 1985. Australia has good cause to thank the Chairman, Mr Tom May, and his colleagues who carried through that review and reported to me, and later to Parliament, in early 1987. Their report led to the Government's decision to give notice of termination of the two-airline agreement which has been in existence since 1952 and which came into existence to protect the private operator. </PARA>
<PARA> One could argue that the agreement over those years and decades did make some contribution to the development of Australia's air services, because back in those early days of the late 1940s and early 1950s the objective of governments was to ensure that there was a network of air services available across Australia. But the two-airline agreement has long passed that developmental role and has operated in recent years to restrict price competition in the provision of air services across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> By world comparisons, we have high quality, relatively high priced air services. Let there be no doubt that deregulation will change all that. I read and listen to some of the comments made from time to time, but there is no doubt in my mind that from 31 October 1990 we will have a totally new environment for the provision of domestic airline services in this country. It will not all happen in the first six weeks or six months; it will probably take four to five years for the new services and regimes to settle into place and for the new players to come into the market. But let there be no doubt that we are entering into a new era of domestic air services, and only benefits can flow to Australians from that new era. </PARA>
<PARA> If we put aside the glamour and razzamatazz of air travel and its marketing, air travel is simply another form of public transport. It is a service that ought to be available to as many Australians as possible, and that is what this Government is committed to providing. In this country we have never been given the choice between high quality, high priced air travel and lower priced, inconvenient air travel. The fact is that people will put up with inconvenience-safety is considered in all this-if the price is right. We have never given people that choice; that choice will be available from 31 October onwards. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it will take four to five years for a full development of the new regimes in the deregulated environment. But critical to giving Australians greater choice in the price and quality of air travel will be adequate access to air terminals. That is now limited under the arrangements that have been entered into, but as a nation we will have to be vigilant to ensure that adequate access is available to both new operators and operators of whom we have not yet heard. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to the related issue of the adequacy of airports for the Sydney region. Both Mascot and Badgerys Creek are designed to serve the Sydney region. I point out that whatever is done at Mascot, additional airport facilities will be required at Badgerys Creek. It is a supplementary airport to Mascot Airport. It is not an alternative or a substitute; it is supplementary. I said in 1986 when we announced the decision to acquire the Badgerys Creek site that Badgerys Creek would be developed stage by stage as the market demanded- for general aviation, domestic or international traffic. My own feeling is that it will be developed as an international airport, if at all, some time in the next century. But it is the last appropriate site in the Sydney region. </PARA>
<PARA> When we link Badgerys Creek and its location to a deregulated aviation environment, Badgerys Creek will offer a level of inconvenience, but I have no doubt that as long as it offers a level of price advantage it will be a goer. I have heard so much said about Badgerys Creek, most of which is wrong and totally misrepresents the situation. Badgerys Creek is a supplementary airport designed to serve the Sydney region. I am reminded of the position at Gatwick and Heathrow airports in London when in 1978 Gatwick was pooh-poohed as being too remote from London. It is now chockers. Gatwick has been extended and is likely to be extended again. In years to come, the same kind of thing will happen with Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter to which I shall refer is waterfront reform. In 1984 when the seminar on waterfront reform kicked off in Sydney our voices were not heard. That was as a result of the States refusing to participate in port coordinating committees. They refused to take part in measures to improve port efficiency. We said we would expose the problem. Following that seminar, conducted in July 1984 at the Hyatt Hotel in Sydney, I appointed the Webber task force, headed by Mr Ian Webber of Mayne Nickless Ltd. The Webber task force recommended in its report that a review be conducted by the Inter-State Commission into waterfront activities. </PARA>
<PARA> However the waterfront is but one leg of a three-leg journey. The total journey is from factory gate, farm gate or mine site to the ultimate destination of the cargo, abroad or domestic. Similar considerations apply to inward bound cargo. We have looked at the blue water leg, getting the cargoes outside the Sydney Heads to wherever they are going across the world, and similarly at the receipt of incoming cargo. We are looking at performance and implementing reform on the waterfront itself and in regard to port activities and port authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we need to move to the area that offers the greatest opportunity of all for improvement. The dividends to be gained on this third leg are greater than those involved in the other two legs. That third leg is the linkage from the wharf to the origin of the cargo at the factory, the farm or the mine, and the destination of the cargo. In that area there has been a wasteful mismatch of working arrangements off the wharf and on the wharf. The arrangements on the wharf can be available 24 hours a day seven days a week; off the wharf arrangements are available perhaps 10 hours a day for five days a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Cargoes are unloaded when they cannot be received off the waterfront. Trucks queue frequently outside ports. All of this is the result of poor management arrangements, not because of the wharfies. No matter how much anyone belts the wharfies, the problem is off the wharf and essentially with private sector arrangements. When cargoes arrive the documentation is not available or, conversely, documents will arrive and the cargo is not there. That all results in waste and costs money. </PARA>
<PARA> The adequacy and efficiency of rail and road linkages in most cases leave a lot to be desired, and in some cases they are totally inadequate. The linkages to and from the wharf, to the land side origin or destination of cargoes, have greater potential for efficiency and productivity improvement than has the waterfront itself. So I want to change the debate and try to focus on the section that is off the waterfront. It is from the waterfront to the destination of the cargo where the vast savings are to be made. It is on those linkages that this nation must concentrate. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason I am pleased that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which I chair, has commenced an inquiry into port linkages and their performance. Members on both sides of the House will have an excellent opportunity to contribute to this important area of micro-economic reform. I have touched on only some segments of industry reform and labour reform which I see as essential to improve this nation's performance. Those issues are important and should be addressed and followed through. I commend the Budget to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an honour to rise as the member for Fairfax and address the Australian Parliament for the first time. I thank my colleagues for their presence and support. When I awoke on 25 March, the morning after the Federal election, I read the Brisbane Sunday newspapers and knew how that great little Australian swimmer Hayley Lewis felt when she returned from the Commonwealth Games with a bagful of medals to see the Australian news headlines `Lisa Curry comes second'. By that statement I mean no insult to Lisa Curry. She and her husband Grant Kenny are two of my more well-known constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not many members of this House can boast the broad range of well-known constituent achievers that I can. Apart from Lisa and Grant, I have as constituents a former State Premier, two Treasurers, the parents of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly)-although I do not think they voted for me-Mr and Mrs Ted Bliss, the parents of my colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), and Professor Kelly, the father-in-law of my colleague the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). I even have as a constituent a former Secretary to the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the other 147 members of this House, I too have the most beautiful electorate in Australia, in terms of both scenic beauty and natural attractions. The 1,370 square kilometres of Fairfax contain Australia's most beautiful surfing beaches, from Caloundra in the south to the north shore of Noosa Heads. The beaches remain relatively unspoilt by incompatible development-or, should I say, ecologically unsustainable development, such as has occurred on the Gold Coast. I know that in saying that I risk the wrath of my colleague the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). However, the shadows on beaches in my electorate are cast by sand dunes at dusk and not high-rise at 2 o'clock. I pray that will not change under the guise of progress. To me, ecologically sustainable development is development today that will become Australia's heritage tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> Our beaches are complemented by the magnificent navigable waterways of the Noosa River, the Maroochy River and the Pumicestone Passage. Mooloolaba harbour, at the mouth of the Mooloolah River, is the home of the Sunshine Coast prawning, commercial fishing, recreational fishing and game fishing fleets which are so vital as a source of income to our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The hinterland or country areas of Fairfax have important rural industries in sugar, with a sugar mill at Nambour, tropical fruits, ginger and other horticultural crops. Australia's only ginger factory is located at Yandina. Interspersed with populated areas and farming areas are a variety of national parks, environmental parks and subtropical rainforests which guarantee the amenity of the area for future generations against urban exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairfax electorate was created by the redistribution in 1984 and was named after Ruth Fairfax, the founding president of the Queensland Country Women's Association. The CWA has 19 branches in my electorate, with more than 500 active members, as a direct legacy of Ruth Fairfax and her co-founding team of country women. Fairfax is one of Australia's highest growth areas. The population has increased from about 50,000 in 1976 to about 130,000 in the 14 short years that I have lived in the electorate. It is significant that only 34 per cent of the population of Fairfax have lived in the same house for five years or longer. In her maiden address my colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas 15 per cent of the population of Australia is over 60, in Hawker it is 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In Fairfax the proportion of the population over 60 is 24 per cent. Nearly one person in four is a senior citizen-not a silly old bugger, but a senior citizen. One can imagine the reaction in my electorate to that recent description of a senior citizen by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). </PARA>
<PARA> I pause for a moment to pay tribute to the senior citizens of Fairfax. Many are pensioners and war veterans; many are living on the proceeds of superannuation or from their savings-the fruits of their labours. They see their savings dwindling under this Government and ask why. They ask why the Treasurer (Mr Keating) robs the poor to pay the rich. Like me, they shake their heads in disbelief at what has happened to this great lucky country in the past seven years. Australia, a great nation, became so on the efforts, toil, sweat and faith of our senior citizens of today. This generation has an obligation to give all Australians the prosperity and future promise that today's senior citizens gave us. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I was invited to chair the annual general meeting of the Noosa Day Care Centre for the Aged and Incapacitated. I am sure the guest speaker, Sister Ellie Buckley from the Noosa Blue Nurses, will not mind if I quote her anecdote on what is a senior citizen. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> A senior citizen is one who was here before the pill, before television, frozen foods, credit cards and ballpoint pens. For us time sharing meant togetherness, not computers; and a chip meant a piece of wood. Hardware was hardware and software was not even a word. Teenagers didn't wear jeans. We were before pantihose, drip-dry clothes, dishwashers, clothesdryers and electric blankets. We got married first and lived together afterwards. We thought cleavage was something butchers did. We were before Batman, disposable nappies, off-road vehicles, pizzas, instant coffee and Kentucky fried wasn't even thought off. In our day, cigarette smoking was fashionable, grass was for mowing, pot was something you cooked in, a gay person was the life of the party, while aids were beauty lotions or help for someone in trouble. We are today's Senior Citizens, a hardy bunch when you think how we have had to adjust to change. </PARA>
<PARA>At the other end of the age scale in Fairfax, 25 per cent of the population are of primary and secondary school age. There are 12 high schools in my electorate, with more planned. That means more than 6,000 school children will reach work force age during the scheduled life of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Fairfax covers the region of Queensland known as the Sunshine Coast. The economy of the Sunshine Coast is mostly dependent on tourism-related small business, the building industry, fashion and leisure industries and light industrial and agricultural industries, as I mentioned previously. Thirty-two per cent of the population are employed in the productive work force. Married women constitute one-third of that work force. Fairfax is a family holiday and tourist destination and, as such, much of the economy revolves around tourism. The latest figures I have available for 1987-88 show that expenditure by visitors staying in commercial accommodation totalled $217m. That is compared with the gross value of agricultural production in the electorate, which totalled $80m. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of the 1990 Budget on the Sunshine Coast cannot be underestimated. The Government's high interest rate policy has seen small business and rural industries in my region devastated. Traditionally, the last dollar earned by a family is the money that is spent on a holiday. As mortgage rates were increased by this Government from 13 per cent to 18 per cent, that translated into a $300 to $400 increase per month in average family mortgage repayments. Obviously, families had less money to spend on annual holidays and leisure-related activities. Stated simply, Australians could no longer afford the traditional annual family holiday which is so important to the economy of Fairfax. Small business not only had to face dramatic reductions in turnover, but also had to face business overdraft interest rates of up to 25 per cent. Many businesses have closed their doors and unemployment has been compounded. People have seen their life savings disintegrate and many people have been forced to sell their family homes to cover their inability to service their borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past four months advertised job vacancies in my electorate have fallen by 18 per cent and the number of registered unemployed has increased by 7 per cent. The building industry in Fairfax is also on its knees, with building contractors and subcontractors laying off workers every day because average Australians can no longer afford a house due to this Government's interest rate policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, areas such as Fairfax have high rates of unemployment. Many people move to Fairfax for the lifestyle and because it is the environment in which they want to raise their children. More people go there to retire. Unfortunately, too many move there first in anticipation of finding work afterwards. Others who are already unemployed are drawn to the surfing beach areas of the Sunshine Coast as a preferred place to be unemployed compared with the urban industrial sprawls of our southern capitals. Given that much of the unemployment in my electorate is imported, many local families ask what will become of the 6,000 children in our local high schools who will reach work force age during the life of this Parliament. Quite simply, not enough jobs can be generated during this Government-induced recession to give locals any prospect of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The philosophy behind this Budget offers no solution to that question. As my Leader and other colleagues have pointed out in this debate, this is a Budget of lost opportunity. The Treasurer must acknowledge that his high interest rate induced recession has failed. It has failed to provide solutions to the problem of our trade imbalance and foreign debt. The policy of high interest rates to reduce consumption expenditure on imports has not worked. The Treasurer should admit it and change the direction of his economic policy. High interest rates have done nothing more than prop up the value of our currency to protect the offshore borrowings of our high flyers and millionaire paper manipulators-the Prime Minister's mates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has once again robbed the poor to pay the rich. High interest rates have led to record bank profits which have been passed on to bank shareholders in the form of dividends. Part of those dividends, as the income of shareholders, is spent on imports. The capacity of householders to spend money on imports has been transferred to the shareholder sector to spend on imports. That is a great policy!</PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to believe that the Treasurer, or the best brains in the Treasury and other sources of advice to the Treasurer, could not come up with a better way of cutting consumption expenditure on imports. The answer, surely, is to have a policy that boosts savings but does not cut consumption. Does the Treasurer believe that householders-Australian families-if given the choice, would have preferred to lose $400 a month in spending power through increased mortgage interest rates, which is, for them, dead money lost forever, or to save $400 a month and keep it? I certainly know that in my electorate, if given the real choice, people would save. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the equation that this Budget ignores is Australia's capacity to increase exports and to tighten our belts so that Australian industry can become lean and mean to increase productivity and aggressively trade our way out of trouble. We must stop saying `What about me?' and start saying, `What about us?'. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) spoke last week about the peoples of Europe tearing down the Berlin Wall. Australia has its own Berlin Wall-it is a wall of disincentive, based on overregulation, industrial relations anarchy, industry protection and taxation lunacy. Brick by brick, successive governments-and we must share the blame on this side of the House-have built this wall of disincentive around our homes, our businesses and our nation. In the last seven years that wall has become higher and stronger. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of government, I have an abhorrence of the word incentive. Bureaucracies, governments and quangos dream up schemes to give people and business a thing called incentives. What they are doing is offering people a ladder with which to climb over our Berlin Wall. Workers sell their labour for wages and business operates for profit. There is no conflict. No-one needs to be offered an incentive to make money and to create wealth. No-one needs an incentive to want to improve living standards. What we do need is not to give incentives but to remove disincentives. When the Government offers incentives to workers, business, unions, exporters, farmers and others it is really offering a temporary ladder to these groups to help them climb over the wall. We should be removing the disincentives and knocking the wall down as the people of Europe have knocked down their wall. Just as the Europeans have demanded democratic freedoms, Australians are demanding their economic freedoms. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason I contested the seat of Fairfax. Only a Liberal government would really understand what I have said. The Labor Party talks about privatisation. It is the right word but for the wrong reason. The Government wants to have a garage sale to make a few bob to satisfy a small group of people who think up new and better ways of spending more of the people's money. The fundamental reason to privatise any government service is to create efficiency through increased productivity which will flow from competition. Communications and transport are a cost to industry-partly a fixed cost and partly an ongoing operating cost. If those costs are higher than those of our trading partners, we cannot be efficient exporters. We cannot compete. Market forces should determine the cost of inputs. The same applies to industrial relations and wage fixing: the answer is enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot be serious about micro-economic reform without applying the same principles to all productive inputs, including the cost of labour. The Government has a guaranteed source of election funding from levies on trade union members' fees. It is the potential loss of that revenue that prevents Labor governments across Australia from even entertaining the thought of enterprise agreements in the wages system. As my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has repeatedly pointed out in this House, the voluntary employment agreement between Power Brewing Co. Ltd and its employees proves conclusively that workers are better off under enterprise agreements. The Government does not care for the worker; it cares for the preservation of the trade union movement because of the election funding revenue it derives from trade union fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The same principle applies to taxation. The present taxation system is a disincentive to save. Only a Liberal government would totally reform Australia's taxation system-the most burdensome, cumbersome and unintelligible system in the world. The Government does not understand the present system, the Australian Taxation Office does not understand it, the accountancy profession does not understand it and the taxpayer does not understand it. When Robin Hood robbed the rich merchants en route through Sherwood Forest to pay the poor in the villages, he did the opposite. Those merchants did not continue to travel through the forest knowing they were going to be robbed. They were not that stupid; they either hired armed guards or travelled around the forest, thus adding to their costs of production. In the final analysis the villagers paid more for their goods through higher prices. Similarly, in Australia businesses hire armed guards in the form of accountants and tax minimisation schemes which add to their costs and which are paid for by the consumer, who finishes up worse off through higher prices. </PARA>
<PARA> I was reminded of this analogy of Robin Hood by the Treasurer's recent foray down south to rescue Victoria's Maid Marion from inside the prison walls of her State Bank of Victoria. I dread that a similar rescue package might be needed in Queensland because I remember that upon election to the State leadership of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland Wayne Goss promised that, `just as business has prospered under the stewardship of John Cain in Victoria, so too will business prosper under a Goss Labor Government in Queensland'. God help us! That is one election promise Queenslanders will not demand be kept. </PARA>
<PARA> As most honourable members know, although I am a new member I am no stranger to Canberra or this great institution of Parliament. As did a number of my colleagues, including the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I served as a ministerial staffer-in my case for the first five years of the Fraser Government. During the election campaign in March I gave the people of Fairfax a commitment: I said I would take their message to Canberra, not Canberra's message to them. That commitment I will keep unequivocally. It was on the basis of strong and honest and local representation that I was elected. It is on that basis I will work in this place and in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> No person with a family can effectively carry out his or her duties without their total support. I thank my wife, Jennifer, daughters Michelle and Vicki and my son Mark for their encouragement and constant criticism, particularly on those occasions when they are constructive. I acknowledge their presence in the gallery today. I thank my hard working dedicated campaign team and supporters who enabled me to do the impossible and become the first Liberal member of parliament to represent the Sunshine Coast in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly thank Glen Elmes, my campaign chairman; my friend, Keith Garthon; my branch chairman, Terry Welch; Ian and Bette Poole; Colin and Joan Butterworth; Peter Hardie; Olive Taylor and the Noosa Branch; Joy Brannelly and her Caloundra team; and my team of dedicated campaign office workers led by Anne and Fred Borlase, Pam and Elizabeth. My sincere thanks go to Lloyd Shemwell, who led my team of scrutineers, who on election night were able to predict the final outcome to within 50 votes. To those of my parliamentary colleagues who dared to help me, I salute you and thank you: the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), Senator Parer, and now Senators John Herron and Ian Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few moments I have left to me I wish to say that there is another person who gave me tremendous help and who has been an inspiration to me: that is Bernie Verwayen. Bernie is an example to all those who take on the impossible. Today Bernie and his wife live in a caravan in Bli Bli. Armed with no more than a Commodore 64 computer, he took on the might of the Australian Government and, for himself and for the other survivors of the Voyager disaster, he won. His crusade took him through Government departments, heartless Ministers and our present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the combined technological might of the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> He mortgaged his home and belongings on his way to the highest court in this land, the High Court of Australia. The Court ruled in his favour-justice was done. Government members should hang their collective heads in collective shame for what they have done to this Australian ex-serviceman and his surviving Voyager colleagues. I want to acknowledge the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) for the help and support they have given Bernie throughout this disgraceful ordeal. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to pay tribute to my father, who emigrated to this country as a refugee in 1949. I thank God for the opportunity he had to see me elected to this House and the happiness it brought him a few short weeks before he passed away on 28 April this year. I thank the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members-Hear, hear!</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Herbert)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.24)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) gave an interesting speech and on a personal basis I wish him well. My only advice to him in the sentiments he echoed is that he should always represent the interests of his electorate in Canberra and he should not concentrate too much on representing Canberra in his electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the eighth Budget of this Labor Government. It provides a Budget surplus of over $8 billion. It is the fourth successive Budget surplus. It is a Budget that will, in the words of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), keep us in the right financial shape as we enter the 1990s. Unquestionably it is a Budget that assures Australia of a bright and optimistic future. It is a Budget that adds new confidence in our destiny as a nation. And it is a Budget that places the public interest first and gives us a solid foundation for national greatness. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, I recall clearly, sometimes painfully, the years between 1975 and 1983, when the Australian economy was devastated under the Liberal-National Party Government. I recall that unemployment had skyrocketed to almost the highest level in the nation's history. I recall that bankruptcies, both corporate and personal, had reached their highest level in decades. I recall that the standard of living of most Australian families was appalling. I know that national production had dropped below the level of that of the Great Depression. In fact, it took seven years of Liberal-National Party Government rule to see a collapse in public morality. </PARA>
<PARA> These were the years of massive tax evasion and avoidance. Organised cheating of the tax laws, with the help of accountants and solicitors, had become a way of life for countless thousands of our fellow citizens. It is a period in our nation's history which I found repugnant and which I know will always be used in contrast to the performance of any future government. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own electorate of Herbert, the election of the Hawke Government in 1983 opened the door to massive investment and commitment in north Queensland. In my electorate of Herbert alone, Federal Government moneys spent and allocated for capital projects and ongoing support purposes since 1983 are rapidly approaching $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget, the Herbert electorate continues to be a major beneficiary of the Hawke Government confidence and faith in the people of north Queensland. The Budget contains provision for a new Commonwealth Government building costing $42m. Major capital works projects at James Cook University, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, Lavarack Barracks and the Townsville College of Technical and Further Education are just a few of the capital works projects funded by the Federal Government in the Herbert electorate this year. In addition, substantial sums of money have been allocated for road reconstruction and road maintenance. In a very real way this Budget will have a dramatic impact on improving the standard of living of people in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of north Queensland know they would be in for a hard time from a Liberal-National Party government, which would target small business, farmers, defence personnel, students, retirees, the unemployed, the sick and other less well-off Australians with draconian cost-cutting measures and, worst of all, with a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall return to the issue of a consumption tax later, but first let me say that if this year's Budget had been brought down by a Liberal-National Party government, millions of Australians would be facing a very bleak future. The theme of this Budget is one of fiscal responsibility, assisting the needy and enforcing the fact that Australia is rapidly building a solid manufacturing base. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's main complaint is not so much about what the Government has done in the Budget, but that the Government has not slashed enough money from its overall expenditure. Before the March election, the Liberal and National parties promised to cut $3 billion in spending if they won office. This included social security and welfare cuts of nearly $1.2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> There is absolutely no doubt that pensioners would have received no sympathy from a Liberal Party Treasurer and, in addition, would be faced with the fearsome prospect of that dreaded consumption tax. Statements by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) just before and since the Budget confirmed that drastic funding cut backs, which the Liberals said they would introduce after the election, would have come to pass. It is the one promise they would have kept. </PARA>
<PARA> The policies of the Hawke Government have produced a growing economy and over a million and a half new jobs. In 1982-83 the unemployment rate was 9 per cent. In 1989-90, it had fallen to 6.2 per cent. Gross domestic product (GDP) in 1982-83 actually declined. It stood at -1.4 per cent. In 1989-90, GDP growth was 3.3 per cent. Australia has opened its doors to competition and prompted industries to look at the world rather than just domestic markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian industry has been encouraged by the Hawke Government to be competitive. A number of measures have been introduced to provide incentive for Australian companies. I refer to measures like the dividend imputation system which removes the double taxation on dividends to resident shareholders. This also acts as an incentive for Australian companies that operate overseas to pay tax in Australia rather than to foreign governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Consensus with the trade unions has resulted in acceptance of moderate wage increases in exchange for further investment and growth in employment. Unlike many other countries, the bulk of Australia's net overseas debt is owed by private or public enterprises. The share of a general government sector has declined markedly in recent years, as the Hawke Government has used almost all of its Budget surpluses to pay overseas foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Financial Review of 14 August 1990 reported that just recently Australia successfully redeemed $194m in Commonwealth debt in the London capital market. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The repurchase offer of three outstanding issues of the Commonwealth's Bulldog bonds, worth #82.7 million, was completed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has reduced its outstanding . . . debt to . . . $300.2 million after retiring $614.8 million in the past two years. </PARA>
<PARA> The redemptions are part of the Government's strategy to use Budget surpluses built up since 1987-88 to repay debt. More than $7.5 billion in foreign debt has been repaid since 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA>Net public borrowing for 1990-91 will be zero and, taking into account official holdings of foreign exchange and gold reserves, the Commonwealth Government has no net overseas debt. This is a remarkable achievement and in sharp contrast to the Fraser Government's abysmal record. As Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, told a gathering of the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 1 August this year:</PARA>
<PARA> One area where very substantial progress has been made is in eliminating the public's dissaving. Fiscal policy during the 1980's has delivered an extraordinary turn-around from a situation where the total public sector dissaving (ie its combined borrowing requirement) peaked at the equivalent of 7 per cent of GDP to the present position where the public sector overall is a small saver. </PARA>
<PARA>By promising that the Federal coalition would introduce a consumption tax if it won government at the next election, the leaders of the Liberal and National parties are effectively ensuring that they and their colleagues can look forward to many long years on the Opposition benches. A consumption tax would score a direct hit on the hip-pocket nerves of every person on low and middle incomes, people living off their savings, and every Australian pensioner. The majority of Australians should be appalled at the apparent lack of regard the Liberal and National parties have for the future living standards of ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only do the Liberal and National parties have contempt for the legitimate economic hopes of millions of Australians, but also they are also conducting a dishonest campaign with their policy of introducing a consumption tax in an attempt to confuse the electorate. Nowhere is this gambit seen more clearly than in the awkward and rather startling attempt by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) to explain what he means by a consumption tax and his confusion is shared by his colleagues, with the exception of you, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> Julie Power, writing in the Financial Review on 27 August this year after her interview with the Leader of the National Party, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The federal National Party's decision to support a goods and services tax-the issue which split the party in 1987-is a calculated political gamble, according to its parliamentary leader, Mr Tim Fischer. </PARA>
<PARA> Explaining the process which swayed him to support the tax, and the conditions he placed upon its endorsement, Mr Fischer said yesterday he would insist that any increase to the goods and services tax would have to be passed by both houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, have you ever heard anything so inane as that statement? Mrs Power went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> And while the Nationals are looking for issues to distinguish themselves from the Liberals, it was decided that in this case coalition unity was more important than a few disaffected National Party members. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax has the support of key members of the parliamentary Nationals including those who acknowledge that Federal Treasury has never come up with an adequate solution on how to compensate the rural community and low-income workers. </PARA>
<PARA>Julie Power went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fischer acknowledges he faces a challenge to sell the package to rural Australia, particularly in Queensland, where the State branch recently voted overwhelmingly against a consumption tax and Federal members are still being convinced. </PARA>
<PARA> He said his original concerns were that the tax could inadvertently undermine export industries, have an add-on impact in remote areas of Australia, and was `too easy a form of taxation' which lent itself to being increased easily. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fischer said some of his concerns had been met by the commitment to provide a rebate from the goods and services tax on all business inputs, the zero rating of exports and the provision of rebates on fuels used in business and farming. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, the tax would be constructed so that any increase would have `to run the gauntlet of both houses of Parliament. And that would act as a sobering safeguard.'</PARA>
<PARA>How he expects an Act of Parliament to pass just one House is beyond the imagination. When questioned on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Country Hour on 16 August, the Leader of the National Party was asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA> If exporters and primary producers are paying $1.1 billion less tax and it is revenue neutral, who is going to be paying more tax?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the National Party replied:</PARA>
<PARA> The tax cheats who in this day largely escape the income tax and other taxation laws. They go about their SP bookmaking operations; and they ring up on the till until 11 am in their corner shops. </PARA>
<PARA>That is his quote-totally confused. As one of the larger groups to be caught by a consumption tax, I am sure Australian pensioners and those in my electorate would be delighted to be thought of as tax cheats and SP bookmakers by the Leader of the National Party. Later in the same program the Leader of the National Party was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Can I just raise this with you-there are two unknowns here which are rather significant-one is the rate of tax that people will be paying on goods and services-that is not identified-and the amount of compensation that would come out of revenue to make up for those people that are disadvantaged-they're two rather important factors aren't they?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the National Party replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, they are and they will be spelt out. </PARA>
<PARA>I gather that the Leader of the National Party was by this time totally confused. He was unable to expand on his answer and he ended in a haze of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has no such uncertainty. He is reported in the Australian of 16 August this year as having refused to guarantee that a Liberal-National government would not raise the level of tax once introduced. In the same report he also could not guarantee that no-one would be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 May this year the Catholic Bishops Committee for Social Welfare registered its concern about the impact of a consumption tax, especially as it affects families with children and people on low or fixed incomes. It is not only the Catholic bishops who have expressed concern about the impact of a consumption tax. On 9 May this year the Treasurer (Mr Keating) expressed serious fears as to what a Liberal-National government would do once a consumption tax had been introduced. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is all too easy to crank up the rate of a consumption tax by a point or two when the pressure mounts to satisfy the spending demands of some groups in society, or the greed of other groups who demand preferential income tax rates. Governments would too readily eschew the hard options of re-ordering spending priorities, were such an easy means of raising revenue readily at hand. </PARA>
<PARA>His remarks received support from the former Secretary of the Treasury and Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Mr John Stone, who had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Nobody would believe that once the tax had been introduced on a limited basis, it would forever remain so limited. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer's legitimate fears and Mr Stone's measured judgment are well-founded. For example, in October 1986 the New Zealand Government introduced a consumption tax which was set at 10 per cent. On 1 July 1989 its consumption tax was increased to 12.5 per cent, while at the same time corporate tax rates were increased. There was no evidence of an increase in national savings; in fact, between 1984 and 1988, savings as a proportion of New Zealand's gross domestic product went down. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall it is the middle-class families, many of which are Liberal supporters, which stand to be the major losers if the Liberal and National parties ever introduce a consumption tax. It stands to reason that if tax rates are cut, farmers achieve tax cuts on fuel and low income groups are compensated from the Budget, taxes on tourists and tax avoiders will not be enough to make up the shortfall. Let there be no doubt that if a consumption tax is introduced by the Liberal and National parties, basic consumption items such as bread, milk, meat and vegetables will be taxed. School fees and children's clothes will be taxed. So, too, will almost every item in everyday use by every Australian family. A consumption tax is a tax on the Australian family. A consumption tax will redistribute income from the less well off to those who are better off. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often argued that those disadvantaged by consumption taxation should be protected by exempting necessities like food and clothing. But a Liberal-National Party government would offer no escape clause. No attempt would be made to draw the line. A consumption tax would have an extremely detrimental effect on all the Australian community. The rate of inflation would increase and the rate of economic growth would surely decline. An increase in unemployment is considered highly likely by authoritative economists. </PARA>
<PARA> A further strong objection to the introduction of a consumption tax is that, because of its substantial revenue raising potential, it would not only make it very easy for the government of the day to increase expenditures but also result in an increase in the size of the public sector. Supporters of consumption tax say that its introduction would lead to substantial reductions in personal tax levels. This line of so-called justification carries no certainties and would depend on the proportion of revenue directed to personal tax cuts. The amount could be very small and not enough to compensate the average wage earner. Whatever it was, it would certainly not benefit Australians no longer in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Options for lower tax rates have already been found without the drastic consequences of introducing a broad based consumption tax on goods and services. As the Treasurer reminded the National Press Club on 9 May:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, substantiation requirement, the prescribed payments system, the foreign tax credit system and increased audit activity by the Tax Office, have all been part of the process of expanding the tax base to provide lower tax rates. </PARA>
<PARA>A Hewson-Fischer consumption tax would be crippling. Its potential operating costs through administrative expenses incurred by the Taxation Office and compliance costs incurred by businesses in meeting requirements placed on them would be forbidding. Australia does not need, nor does it want, a consumption tax. The thought of such a tax has been and will continue to be abhorrent to the majority of Australians. This Budget, the eighth successive Budget of this Labor Government, points as a beacon, a future direction, for all the people of Australia for an increased standard of living. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First and foremost, I would like to place on record my thanks to the people of McMillan who entrusted me with the honour of representing them here in Parliament. I would also like to place on record my thanks to the army of supporters whose work, dedication and enthusiasm over a long campaign were rewarded with the sweet taste of success. To my wife June, who is in the gallery, our three children, Shayne, Sharonn and Michelle, my grandson Cori, my parents Horton and Edna Riggall, I say thank you very much for your patience and assistance. My army of supporters had inspirational leadership from Mr Will McRoberts, my campaign manager, along with other key players in the team, Mrs Melva McRoberts, Brian and Alice O'Reilly and Max Hopper. I thank them, one and all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is with great pleasure that I am here as a member of the Liberal parliamentary team led by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). There has been a fundamental change on our side of politics. While the Government is thinking only of the next election, we are planning for the next generation. In winning McMillan, the swing was 8.8 per cent. Embodied in that swing, the voters of my electorate have demonstrated a clear and massive message to the Government. Put quite simply, they have had enough of high interest rates, poor decision making and a lack of vision. Later I will refer to this aspect in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Over many years it has often been the custom in maiden speeches to describe one's electorate. It is with pride and pleasure that I now follow that custom. The division of McMillan was created in the redistribution of 1948 and named after Angus McMillan, one of Gippsland's great explorers. History records that the drought of 1839 in New South Wales was McMillan's motive to find greener pastures. Travelling over the Great Dividing Range, he first established a cattle station on the Tambo River near Ensay. McMillan prospered in this rich country, building an export trade of fine cattle. He also continued his work as an explorer under the directions of the Government. In 1859 he was southern Gippsland's first representative in the Legislative Assembly. Tragically, an accident cut his life short in 1865 at the age of 55. </PARA>
<PARA> The electorate starts at Officer, 50 kilometres east of Melbourne, and continues 120 kilometres east along the Princes Highway to Flynn Creek, covering the shires of Pakenham, Buln Buln, Narracan and Traralgon, together with the rural city of Warragul and the cities of Moe, Morwell and Traralgon. Broadly speaking, there are four distinct regions within the electorate. To the west is Pakenham, which includes the townships of Garfield, Tynong, Bunyip and Nar Nar Goon. This region is being transformed from a rural area into an outer Melbourne satellite. The huge growth is testament to its natural beauty. It is a place to live, raise children or retire-an address people are proud to call home. </PARA>
<PARA> As the region is one of Victoria's fastest developing areas, local government is under constant pressure to supply the basic services. I applaud the job it is doing and strongly suggest that the Victorian Government revise its planning strategy. Local planning by the shire and water board has a population projection of 35,000. The State Government proposes 70,000. This figure is far too high to maintain the intrinsic value of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The jewel in the crown of Australia's farming district is undoubtedly Warragul, triply blessed by rich deep soils, 35 to 40 inches per annum of regular rainfall and rolling hills, bounded by the Strzeleckis to the south and the Great Dividing Range to the north. Undoubtedly, Australia's sweetest meat, milk, fruit and vegetables are grown in this region-and also honey. If the rest of Australia contributed as much per head per acre to the economy as this district does, we would be not only the lucky country but also the wealthy country. </PARA>
<PARA> The most sparsely populated area of McMillan is the high country, part of the Great Dividing Range. In winter Mount Baw Baw and other slopes turn into a playground for downhill ski enthusiasts and for the more adventurous there is nordic skiing. In summer the area takes on a more leisurely mantle, with bushwalking, hiking, trout fishing and hunting. Cattle and mountain cattlemen adorn the high plains and have become part of our rich folklore. The area over the last 100 years has become renowned for its timber production, a renewable resource which today houses many Victorians. The paper which this speech is written on is also a product of that forest. The people of Melbourne should be grateful to this area for the huge quantities of water diverted into their taps via the Thomson Dam. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the fourth and most unique region in my electorate is the Latrobe Valley, where 95 per cent of Victoria's energy reserves are stored in the form of brown coal. In 1918, the then Premier of Victoria, Mr Harry Lawson, announced his intention of creating Victoria's own electricity supply commission. Three years later Sir John Monash was appointed the first full time Chairman of the State Electricity Commission. I doubt whether seven decades ago Sir John would have had any idea of the huge potential of this area. The daily consumption of coal today is approximately 150,000 tonnes. Yet surprisingly, after seven decades we have only used 2 per cent of the total reserves. There are sufficient resources here to power the south-eastern part of Australia for the next 200 years and longer. </PARA>
<PARA> The great advantage of this brown coal when compared with black and other brown coal deposits around the world is its purity. The sulphur and other mineral substances that contribute to acid rain are not to be found to any great extent in the Latrobe Valley deposits. A 10-year study just completed has given the air of the valley a clean bill of health. The region generates 80 per cent of the base load of Victoria's power requirements. A small exporting company producing coke and barbecue heat beads has found that, because of the purity of its products, export requirements are 40 per cent over and above its capacity to supply them. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the experimental stage of the coal to oil liquefaction project is near completion. This joint Australian-Japanese project has been running for 10 years. When world oil prices rise above $US35 a barrel it is anticipated that a full scale plant will become viable. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst those are the physical aspects of the electorate, McMillan is blessed with a richly diverse people. Two of their outstanding achievements in education are the regional technical and further education college and the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education. Both have become an integral part of the community, not only for supplying the usual range of education services, but also for being in tune with local needs. The recent forced amalgamation of the Institute with Monash University is an unproven change of direction. I take this opportunity to remind the Council of Monash University that the local region expects and demands a high degree of autonomy. The back paddock approach is not acceptable to us today or in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated previously, McMillan was won from a senior member of the Government with a swing of 8.8 per cent. In thus electing me, the electorate has given me a clear mandate to express to this House its concerns. Perhaps one of the low key issues of my campaign-but nevertheless I believe this matter to be Parliament's first responsibility to Australia-was the need to ensure the integrity and security of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1986 government inquiries and White Papers have swamped the Department of Defence with at least nine major reports, the latest being the Wrigley report. During this period the Australian Defence Force has been bled dry of funds, resulting in low morale and high rates of resignation. Whilst I congratulate the Hawke Government for its quick response to the Middle East crisis, it stands condemned for leaving Australia so vulnerable in the light of the instability in the Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> Tragically I must also report that four Australians have been killed this year on the Longwarry section of the Princes Highway. Records show that if the duplication program had been kept to the Government's own schedule this section would have been completed by 1988 or 1989. It is my belief that the lack of funding and poor management have cost these Australians their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Local government has also stated that it has similar problems of underfunding. One example, which is by no means unique, highlights the poor track record that this Government has in road funding. In the last year of the Fraser Government the Warragul Shire constructed 13.5 kilometres of new roads. In 1989-90 only 3.2 kilometres were constructed in that same shire. This appalling example is sadly duplicated right across rural Australia. Many country roads quite simply are unsafe. </PARA>
<PARA> The pharmacists have been targeted for special treatment by this Government. Their shop windows carried the message of condemnation in the run-up to the last election. The united action is unprecedented in the history of their profession. Whilst those messages are no longer there today, honourable members should not be under any delusions that the anger towards this Government's entrenched attitude still exists. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the rhetoric to the contrary, Medicare has not supplied a sufficiently universal health scheme. The tragic ongoing crisis in our public hospitals continues to leave the poor and the indigent at the end of long waiting lists. The Government must give incentives for private health insurance. Medicare alone is a total failure. </PARA>
<PARA> If ever a government was exposed for making a short term political decision of the most cynical nature, this Government was when it stopped the logging in the National Estate areas of East Gippsland. That decision had nothing to do with conservation but was merely a cheap political trick to satisfy the green minority. What a fundamental blunder it was to believe that this decision would impact only on the communities in the safe National Party seat of Gippsland. Within 48 hours the timber industry showed that it had more political nous than the Government. The protesters moved into McMillan, where they were joined by their fellow workers of the pulp and paper industry. On 15 February, 3,000 workers and their families gathered to show their disgust at the Government's decision. Unhappily, their message had to be repeated last week here outside Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, my electorate has revolted against the mismanagement of the economy. Large and small businesses are going under in record numbers due to high interest rates, government regulations and an inflexible labour market. Increasingly, social workers are reporting the tragic breakdown of young marriages. The primary cause is huge financial problems brought about largely by mortgage repayments that have increased by hundreds of dollars each month. They deserve a better deal. Young Australian families are too precious to be abused by this cruel fiscal tool. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time remaining I will discuss the environmental movement and industrial relations as they affect my electorate. Within Australia today there are two clear philosophies about the environment. First, we have the romantic environmentalists. These people seem to have a doomsday perspective of our future. They use computer models that predict the greenhouse effect wreaking damage and mayhem to our coastline, yet at the same time the same high-tech computers they use cannot accurately predict the weather a week in advance. Their solution to the CO2 gases produced when making electricity from coal is a zero growth option which, in practical terms, equates to an ever-declining standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the outspoken, romantic members of the environmental movement to become constructive in their thinking. They have a golden opportunity to ask the power industry in Victoria to become environmentally neutral. This industry could plant a forest of trees which would be sufficient to absorb the CO2 produced. If there is not sufficient land, could not private landholders be encouraged to plant trees by being offered a discount on their power bills? This process lends itself to being developed one step further by encouraging the planting of trees suitable for the timber industry. This type of lateral thinking would reduce our reliance on timber imports, which today are costing $2 billion, or 10 per cent of the national debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe mainstream Australians are, in contrast to the romantic environmentalists, practical environmentalists who believe in a higher standard of living through using resources wisely. We believe that problems can be solved through the skill and ingenuity of man. Our vision is that of a richer, better Australia for the next generation. Practical environmentalists are the doers of this nation. It is high time their efforts and ability to resolve the environmental problems received the acknowledgment that they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier, I would like to explore the subject of industrial relations and demarcation disputes as they affect my electorate. How often does the posturing of entrenched positions from either side of industrial arguments solve this problem? It has been my own experience when talking privately with both management and workers that there is one single common thread repeated time after time-the goodwill and commitment to their jobs. Both groups can see the problems and both have their solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> But industrial relations as it operates today does not appear to take advantage of this goodwill. Too often the adversary system drives the parties apart and often makes a compromise unsatisfactory to everybody. I challenge the union and particularly the management of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria to allow 5 or 10 per cent of the work force chosen at random to observe the negotiations, or alternatively to record the closed-door proceedings on video. This would ensure that the now secretive negotiations would be immediately opened up to the scrutiny of those directly affected. This may just achieve a grassroots jury system, keeping negotiations fair dinkum. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I do not suggest that a grassroots jury system would be a panacea for all our industrial problems, it may eliminate the power games and get down to the real issue-the business of wage increases earned by productivity gains. No longer can the industry in my electorate afford the indulgences of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, during the campaign and in the months following I have been privileged to witness a return to what can be best described as old fashioned Christian values. This is the responsibility for oneself, one's family, the community and the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall) and other honourable members upon their maiden speeches. I understand 33 honourable members have made their maiden speeches in this chamber during this debate. Making a maiden speech is an occasion-one that I vaguely remember. It is an opportunity for a member to set out those issues that he came here to represent and to pay tribute to the people who made that opportunity possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three weeks ago I heard the twenty-fourth speech by a Leader of the Opposition in this place in response to the Budget. Over that time a number of Leaders of the Opposition from both sides of politics have made such speeches, and of course Treasurers have delivered Budget Speeches. When I listened to the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the sense of deja vu was very great. He made a speech the same as the other 23. The words were different but the import was that if I were sitting on the other side of the table and he was on this side, everything would be fixed and there would be no problems. By a magic formula, or by waving a magic wand, the problems with revenues, exports, imports and overseas markets would be immediately and permanently cured- at least until the next Leader of the Opposition made his speech a year later. </PARA>
<PARA> This year we contested a Federal election. The Labor Government was returned. If the Opposition has such indisputable and tangible solutions to our nation's problems-and we have plenty-why was it rejected by the electorate? I think the answer is fairly obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for McMillan mentioned the problems in the health system. Medicare is far from perfect. It has problems. The gap between the cost of services, for instance, and those which people actually have to pay for, particularly specialised services like radiology and pathology, is far too great. It is easy to say that; we all know it. If we do not know it, then we are either blind or we are fooling ourselves. Health is one of the continuing major problems which has existed in this country, at least in the 20-odd years that I have been a member of the Parliament and I believe for a long time before. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's policy? In the last election-we will remember that at that time Opposition members had been in opposition seven years; they had had a bit of time to work it all out-the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) had to cop the can because his leader would not. The honourable member for Tangney had to stand up in the election campaign and tell the electorate that the Opposition, after seven years of trying, had not been able to work out a health policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that that is not unreasonable. Seven years is not long, after all. But Opposition members had seven years in office before that, and they still did not have a health policy after seven or eight tries. We are now told that all they have to do is get into office and that all these problems will be solved forthwith and immediately. I do not agree with that and I do not agree with anyone who suggests that they are going to solve major problems immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak on a matter of concern to me and I think to everyone in this Parliament who thinks seriously about the problems which Australia confronts. Changing the tax system is not going to solve our problems. What is going to solve our problems is the wealth of the nation being increased to a level which will enable the nation to have those things which it believes it is entitled to. That is where the current problem is. We are not generating within Australia an amount of wealth equal to that which the population has grown to believe it is entitled to. If one walks into an Australian supermarket, 50 per cent of the goods in that supermarket will not have been derived from within Australia-they will be imported. We no longer make more than 50 per cent of the goods that we use in our day-to-day lives, and supermarkets tend to sell quick turnover goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Each month Australians spend something like $500m on television sets, videos, stereos and the like. We spend $5m a month on tea, coffee and orange juice and another $5m on spirits, wines and other alcoholic drinks. Australia has a balance of payments problem. I see no evidence that Australian industry is moving to fill the gaps to stock our supermarkets and shops with competitively priced goods to replace the goods we are currently importing, for which we no longer have the wherewithal to pay, and for which we are therefore borrowing and increasing our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA> For 40 years Australians were lucky. The wool market boomed. Meat was a highly saleable product, and we had no problem selling our wheat. None of those things are true today. We are having great difficulty selling our wool crop. We cannot obtain an economic price for our wheat. Periodically, the overseas market for meat and other primary products experiences an ebb and flow. </PARA>
<PARA> According to speeches made in this place in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the saviour of the nation was going to be mineral exports-coal and iron ore, aluminium. Mineral exports were going to save the nation. That did not come to pass. Because vast risk profits were expected from exporting raw materials, no effort was made to go to secondary stages, such as the production of pellets from iron ore. No effort was made to produce a little bit more in Australia to add to the value of those products.</PARA>
<PARA> The result, of course, as I said before, is that Australia has continued to run up debt. I see no evidence at all that Australians are evolving the wherewithal that is necessary to create the goods to reduce our dependence on imports of common, garden variety-type products that we use every day. These days, if we break a cup at home, we cannot buy an Australian made replacement. We have to buy an import, because there is no Australian-made replacement. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of reasons for this, but I believe that one of the reasons is that we have taught those people who were over-protected in the 1950s and 1960s and earlier in Australia that they should not have to take risks; that they should not have to go out and earn the dollars that they are paid; that they should be able to depend on governments to create circumstances and take all the risks for them. Entrepreneurs, real entrepreneurs, in Australia are in short supply. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, in the short time left to me in this debate, I want to make one point. When this Government came to office a wages freeze was in place. In that period executive salaries rose by 14 per cent in a year when everyone else had their wages frozen. In every year since that, executive salaries have risen at a faster rate than the average, a faster rate than wages and salaries in the community. Perhaps someone could examine whether or not executive production has risen or fallen during that period. If that was done, I think we might find a clue to our present problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will return to the valid point made by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) that Australia needs to do much more by way of adding value to our main mineral, material and, perhaps, forest product exports. I stress that one of the principal factors involved is the element that is often involved in micro-economic reform, in particular the high cost of coastal shipping. In fact, the old dream of a major export-based steel industry in Australia foundered, not so much on high labour costs, but on too high transport and power costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1990 Budget reflects the Hawke-Keating Government's unwillingness or inability-and I say that advisedly and with emphasis-to face up to the great national challenge facing Australia, this nation's vast and persistent balance of payments deficit, the largest as a percentage of gross domestic product in member nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and our burgeoning overseas debt. I am thinking about the longer term, but, of course, there is as well the immediate problem of the Government-engineered slide into recession, the Paul Keating high interest rate recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest unemployment figures at the end of August showed that the number unemployed topped 600,000 persons, an increase of nearly 130,000 persons since October last. Nor, unhappily, will it stop there. But the dominating, continuing underlying issue, not unrelated to the Government-induced recession, is the current account deficit and the vast overseas debt. In 1989 the deficit was $21.2 billion, or nearly 6 per cent of total national production. Some people point to the situation of America and the very large balance of payments deficit there, but the American deficit amounts to only 2 per cent of that nation's GDP.</PARA>
<PARA> New borrowing to cover that deficit built up the debt by the order of 16 per cent. We have, then, a foreign debt in gross terms of $156 billion. That figure is growing inexorably. As my colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) said earlier, Australia's foreign debt will increase by an extra $500,000 during my speech, or $2m over the next hour, or $50m from this time yesterday to today, or approximately $1.5 billion a month. Australia's foreign debt is exceeded only by the debts of Mexico and Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA> The interest payable overseas as a proportion of export earnings, the only means of effecting payment, has been increasing by 2 percentage points per annum over recent years, from 10 per cent in 1982-83 to just touching 25 per cent at the latest figure. That is a point at which, typically, the red lights start flashing and the overseas lender begins to get nervous. Australians are indeed very vulnerable, more so than in 1986, when we heard of the banana republic and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) went on television proclaiming that we had `a situation akin to war'. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Budget presented a few weeks ago by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) contains just one passing mention of Australia's foreign debt. For a Government that has spent vast amounts of public money on explaining and providing information or, perhaps more accurately, propaganda, on its policies, and with another $4 million about to be spent to explain the latest social security decisions, this Government has been very reluctant to come clean on the debt build-up under its administration. Of course, the Government would prefer to hide our overseas debt, to play it down.</PARA>
<PARA> If the country is ever to come to grips with the problem, and indeed avert a banana republic slow, downward slide, there needs to be a sense of urgency and concentrated purpose and, in that, public understanding and the support of public opinion is vital. There needs to be an appreciation of the massive dimensions of the challenge, the awful arithmetic of the public debt, as it has been described. What is most abundantly clear is that it will be a long haul, a disciplined long haul. There will be no quick-fix or overnight solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has admitted as much. Although he would not mention, on the very public occasion of the Budget Speech-and he has been chiding business leaders on their lack of leadership; what about himself?-the matter of the foreign debt, on the Friday following the presentation of the Budget the Treasurer did concede to the Collingwood Football Club:</PARA>
<PARA> We can do it --</PARA>
<PARA>that is, avoid the fate of South American countries in the past-</PARA>
<PARA>But we can only do it with discipline and some understanding about how long it is going to take. </PARA>
<PARA> How long is of the order of five years at least of sustained increase in exports at about 6 per cent per annum while we simultaneously restrain our own domestic use of resources, especially private and public consumption. That is the only way the Government can begin to pay back the foreign debt after the profligate borrowing and the excesses of living beyond our means as a nation under this Hawke-Keating Government. That is a very tall order. We have not seen such a sustained performance for more than 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking in broad terms, there are two central policy thrusts to address this overriding issue of the debt. One is to get inflation down, and the other is to get productivity up. So far as this Budget is concerned, as one of the package of measures to address those objectives and the debt problem, it fails on four counts which I shall state baldly as they have been extensively canvassed in debate. Firstly, the Budget unquestionably endorses the accord mark 6 election-driven arrangement with the unions, which inevitably puts a high floor to continuing high inflation. Secondly, it fudges on the size of the surplus that is essential as a vehicle to increase national savings-the public saving part. Thirdly, there is no real cut in the Government's own spending, the Government having relied on high interest rates to cut private spending; and, fourthly, there is no tax reform such as the coalition's proposed goods and services tax to boost incentive and productivity and encourage increased private saving. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Whips have agreed that speeches will be limited to 10 minutes duration, in the short time remaining I want to concentrate on the vital area of so-called micro-economic reform, that is, structural change for increased productivity, freeing up the supply, the producing side of the economy, in the broad as with labour market change, which is absolutely vital-and I notice the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the spokesman on this subject for this side of the House, is present-and freeing up production in individual enterprises, industries and sectors of the economy. This micro-economic change, structural change, is a key factor in achieving the greater national productiveness and export expansion that is so essential. Some might say that that is longer term stuff, and the answer is yes, it is. But the long term begins now or-correction-yesterday, so far as this Government is concerned. It was to devote itself to it in the last period of government, but to very little effect-and it is urgent. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a couple of general points in this regard. Sure, micro-economic reform is hard. We have only to look at the trauma and travail that the Government and the Labor Party have been going through. We all wait with bated breath for next Monday's Labor Party conference. That will determine whether we get even the third best option in telecommunications reform, and that is where we are at in this process. We have the coalition's proposal for full and effective competition in every aspect of Telecom's operations and, ultimately, privatisation. That is the first option. On the admission of the Prime Minister, the next one then would be the Keating Overseas Telecommunications Commission option, and the third is the megacom. Whether we get even that depends on the say so of the conference. For goodness sake, who is running the country?</PARA>
<PARA> The most important point one would make in this context of micro-economic reform is that injecting more competition is of the essence. That is the key point. It is simply a fact of life that exposure to competition is the most certain way of ensuring that production is efficient and that the benefits of improved efficiency are passed on to consumers, users and the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> A third point I would make is that each case, generally speaking, is different. We need a case to case examination of the options from an economy-wide perspective and with public participation. We do not need all this internal stuff that we have been witnessing in the Labor Party, and references to expert internal papers by, for instance, C.S. First Boston Australia and so on that never see the public light of day. It is only with public scrutiny to ensure a wider perspective and public understanding and the support of public opinion that real change will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> It had been my intention to look at a variety of micro-economic situations-in the broad, the wages and industrial relations system and industry protection, and other matters. In the circumstances, I would like to look very briefly at the waterfront and coastal shipping situation as it illustrates a number of key points in this area. So far as the waterfront is concerned, there is not much to be said. Progress has been virtually zero. I quote Mr Ivan Deveson, who is an industrialist and a reasonably evenhanded sort of person. He said recently:</PARA>
<PARA>In my life, I have never ever seen an industry where the customer is so irrelevant as I do in Australia's waterfront. I would describe Australia's waterfront now as the most rampant cost-plus culture I've ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA>Shipping is an area where, on the face of it, something significant has been achieved. The average crew has gone down from the thirties to the low twenties, and so on. However, in point of fact that is against a background where in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1985 there was already an average shipping manning level of 18 and it has improved ever since. In this area of reform we still retain the policy of cabotage-that is, coastal shipping activity confined to Australian shipping. So that virtually rules out the effective competition which would ensure a real spur to efficiency and benefits being passed on to the exporters and importers. </PARA>
<PARA> I just draw from that instance three principles. As the then Minister, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who is sitting opposite at the moment, said when he announced that reform program, `almost all major maritime nations have a cabotage policy'. So what? Only we are the losers if we emulate them. We just go on falling further behind. It is like a unilateral tariff cut. We like to get a concession in a multilateral negotiation if we can, but we still stand to gain from the unilateral action. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I would make is that, while credit is due for what has been achieved-and I have said so-it is very important to point out that it is not relevant how far we have improved on what we did previously. The only measure that matters is how we compare today with our competitors. As I pointed out in a brief reference to the statistics, there is still clearly a long way to go. The third point is that the competitors we measure ourselves against are themselves improving; they are not standing still. As I think Sir Arvi Parbo said at the debt summit earlier this year, it is like climbing up a down elevator. We have to work very hard to stay where we are and make an extra big effort to go any further ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> So I conclude basically on that note, having already overshot the time target. I just make this point: there is OECD and other evidence that outside the high productivity agricultural and mining sectors of the economy there is commonly a gap of between 25 and up to 50 per cent between the level of productivity in Australian enterprise and a comparable good practice enterprise overseas. Moreover, as I have just stressed, while we seek to improve productivity here, performance overseas is also improving. If it were improving overseas at the rate of, say, 5 per cent per annum and we started off here at a level between 50 and 75 per cent of overseas, our rate of productivity growth here would have to be two to three times faster than overseas to catch up. The Australian enterprise would have to, in effect, double its output for the same employment or halve the employees. That is something of a measure of the challenge we confront. It can be a daunting prospect, but the longer we delay the less the prospects are that we will ever really make it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time available to me in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, I want to address the major criticisms which have come from the Opposition in the course of this second reading Budget debate and particularly to stress the failure of the Opposition to make any headway in credibly attacking this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major Opposition criticism has been that the Budget has failed to address our foreign debt and inflation problems. In a number of subsets to that basic criticism, the Opposition says that the Budget does nothing to boost national savings, does not cut Government expenditure enough and does not address micro-economic reform. Of course, another form of Opposition criticism is that the Government is driving the economy into recession. The Opposition wants to have it both ways. It attacks the Budget on the one hand as not being sufficiently anti-inflationary but, on the other hand, as being too deflationary and driving the economy into recession. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the first of the fundamental criticisms-the supposed failure to address our foreign debt and inflation problems. I reject completely that assertion made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and various other speakers on the Opposition side. On the contrary, the two principal objectives of this Budget are to attack the balance of payments current account deficit and thereby the foreign debt problem, and also to reduce the level of inflation, whilst maintaining employment and output growth. </PARA>
<PARA> In both respects, the forecasts are for substantial improvement this year in relation to the balance of payments current account deficit and inflation. On the current account, the forecast is that it will decline by one per cent of gross domestic product, from 5 1/2 per cent of GDP last year to 4 1/2 per cent of GDP this year. In actual money terms, it is a reduction from $20.75 billion to $18 billion. So there is a very large decline of almost $3 billion in the current account deficit this year, brought about by a 7 1/2 per cent increase in the real level of exports and a 3 per cent fall in the real level of imports. We are looking at a year of very substantial progress in the current account, contrary to what the Opposition would have the nation believe. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in regard to inflation, the consumer price index is expected to fall from 8 per cent in 1989-90 to 6 1/2 per cent this year. The forecast is that, through the year, the consumer price index will fall from an annual rate of 7.7 per cent in June of this year to 6 per cent by the end of this financial year. So it is absurd to contend, as the Opposition does, that the Budget fails to address these two very important areas. It clearly does address them-and with the expectation of very substantial improvement in the course of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in the light of the Budget settings, it is not surprising that substantial progress would be made in reducing the current account deficit and inflation this year. The Budget provides for a large surplus of $8.1 billion, the largest surplus on record. It is only the fourth ever Budget surplus. There have been only three others and, of course, they have been in the three previous years. They have all occurred under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, in its decades of government of this country in the post-war period, never once produced a Budget surplus. It could not even produce an $8 Budget surplus, let alone an $8,000m surplus. So let us get the context of this absolutely clear: the criticisms of this Government for not having a large enough surplus come from an Opposition which never could produce a surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> This large Budget surplus also enables the public sector borrowing requirement to be zero. The public sector borrowing requirement is the whole net borrowing requirement by all government in this country-the Commonwealth Government, State governments, the Commonwealth trading enterprises and local government. In total, they will have no net borrowing requirements. There is therefore no claim by the whole of government in this country on domestic savings in this financial year. It is only the third time ever that the public sector borrowing requirement has not been in deficit. When were the previous two times? The last two years under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a tough Budget stance focuses squarely on the current account deficit and inflation. In regard to the current account, by not making any claims on domestic savings, the public sector is giving substantial assistance to the national savings effort-that is, by not detracting from savings, not imposing on domestic savings, as it usually does. Yet the Opposition Leader claims that the Budget does nothing to boost national savings, which is absolute rubbish. With the public sector not laying claim to domestic savings, there is less pressure for resort to overseas savings. Such resort to overseas savings has had to occur because of the substantial excess of investment over domestic savings in past years, which has been a key determinant of the balance of payments current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The complexities of this relationship between the current account deficit and the surplus of investment over domestic savings are spelt out fully in Budget Paper No. 1. Suffice it for me to say that the budgetary stance, through its large Budget surplus and consequent zero public sector borrowing requirement, is squarely and very much focused on the current account problem. That is absolutely undeniable in logic. Yet the Opposition still wants us to believe that white is black - that is, that the Budget does not focus on the current account problem. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at what the Opposition's role in the current account problem has been, one can see that its role, when in government, is not simply one of making false criticisms but of creating the problem. That point is clearly spelt out in Budget Paper No. 1 and the Treasury's comments on this matter, where it stresses the point that Australia entered the 1980s, when the Opposition was the Government of this country, with a significant structural deterioration in its external accounts, which could be attributed to the excessive public sector claims in Australia's savings from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s when the Fraser Government was in office. Page 2.56 of Budget Paper No. 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the marked deterioration in Australia's external accounts, which has its roots in the deterioration in the public sector's financial position between the mid-1970s and early 1980s, has left the Australian economy with a long task of adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA>So, quite clearly, the Treasury is saying that it was in that period from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, when the Fraser Government was running this country, that we saw the marked deterioration in Australia's external accounts, brought about by the deterioration in the public sector's financial position. Budget Paper No. 1 goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>While policies are in place to stabilise our external indebtedness and reduce our vulnerability, they will inevitably take time. What is vital is that those policies-including maintenance of high levels of public sector saving-continue over the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Treasury says that the policies to correct this problem, developed not when this Government was in office but when the previous Government was in office, are now in place but that we must expect that they will take time to correct the problem on the external account. Yet, with all of that, we have the Opposition telling us that we have not focused on the problem. It is just unbelievable humbug. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to inflation, the Budget focuses clearly on inflation by ensuring that 1990-91 will be a year in which our rate of growth slows temporarily-that is, a year in which domestic demand is more restrained than production. Furthermore, monetary policy and wages policy are also set so as to produce a reduction in inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Monetary policy has been quite tight for over a year now, but it has been progressively relaxed in line with the Government's objective to keep domestic demand at a moderate level consistent with reducing inflation and the current account deficit without inducing a serious downturn in activity. Similarly, under the accord mark 6, the Government has set an overall wages growth limit of 7 per cent, which should be compatible with an inflation outcome of 6 1/2 per cent this year, as forecast. </PARA>
<PARA> So with the projected fall in inflation to 6 1/2 per cent, Australia will have considerably narrowed the gap between our inflation rate and that of our major trading partners. I think that everyone appreciates the importance of narrowing that gap and, if possible, eliminating it. In fact, the position of our major trading partners is that their inflation rate this year will move up overall from 4.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent, whereas our inflation rate will go from 8 per cent to 6 1/2 per cent. So the gap narrows from 3 1/4 per cent last year to 1 1/4 per cent this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite those facts, the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech in reply to the Budget that Australia's inflation rate was twice that of our major trading partners. It is nothing like that. The gap has been substantially narrowed in the course of this financial year. Another theme of the Opposition's criticism of this Budget has been that government expenditure has not been cut sufficiently. That is absolute nonsense, especially coming from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already spelled out the record nature of the Budget outcome: the fourth consecutive surplus, the largest ever. That must be viewed against the situation when Labor came to office. At that time the Budget had blown out to a deficit of $9.6 billion. The Labor Government hauled that back to $8 billion in its first year in office, 1983-84. Since then it has turned that around from an $8 billion deficit to an $8 billion surplus. That is a $16 billion turnaround in the Budget outcome. As a percentage of the GDP, that outcome has moved from a deficit equal to 4.1 per cent in our first year in office to a surplus of 2 per cent. That is a 6.1 per cent of GDP turnaround. That has been a tremendous achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Budget outcome were still as it was when this Government came to office, that is a 4.1 per cent deficit, this year there would have been a $16 billion deficit, compared with the $8 billion surplus, which will be the actual outcome-a $24 billion turnaround. All of that has been achieved by cutting outlays, not by increasing taxes. In the Government's first year in office outlays were 29.6 per cent of GDP; in this year they will be 23.5 per cent of GDP, a fall of 6.1 per cent, which exactly accounts for the turnaround in the Budget outcome which I have just been describing. All of the turnaround on the Budget, the whole $24 billion worth, has come about from cuts in outlays, reductions in expenditure, by a government which has faced up to its responsibilities and which, by assiduous work year after year in terms of Budgets and mini-Budgets, brought about a $24,000m cut in outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not where it ends. Further reductions in outlays are still in store, as has been indicated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). The Forward Estimates will show that outlays are declining because of the savings decisions that have been made already and therefore can be projected to have greater effects in future years. In three years outlays will be down to 21.6 per cent of GDP. That will mean an 8 per cent of GDP decline compared with the position a decade earlier. Since the Labor Government came to office there has been an 8 per cent of GDP reduction in outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite that remarkable turnaround, Opposition members still say in the course of their speeches in this House that it is not enough. They could never get within a bull's roar of that result, but they still say that it is not enough. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Government had failed to reduce outlays and that real outlays increased this year. They went up by 0.6 per cent in real terms, but fell as a proportion of GDP, to the lowest level since 1973-74. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition said that further cuts in expenditure were possible and that during the last election campaign his Party proposed a $3 billion package of expenditure cuts. He forgot to say that the Opposition also proposed a package of expenditure increases and tax cuts that would have cost altogether about $9 billion, and would have reduced the surplus by $6 billion. Far from proposing to tighten fiscal policy, at the last election the Opposition went to the people of this country with a policy which involved dramatic loosening of fiscal policy, cutting the surplus by about $6 billion, with all of its tax cuts, family packages, two tier systems and various billions of dollars of expenditure increases which matched its expenditure cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget debate Opposition members have recalled their proposed expenditure cuts but they have entirely forgotten their proposed expenditure increases of a few billion dollars and their massive tax cuts. That accords absolutely with their record when in office. They talked a great deal about expenditure cuts but did not actually get around to making any. When they went out of office, outlays as a percentage of GDP were at a higher level than when they came into office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition really has nothing meaningful to say in this area. Unlike the Opposition when it was in office, this Government has dramatically reduced government outlays by $24 billion and these are on target to be reduced markedly in future years. It is arrant nonsense for Opposition members to argue that the Government has been deficient in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter that I wanted to mention particularly is the criticism by the Opposition that the Government has cut living standards. The argument has been that that has occurred because there have been falls in real wages. In fact, there has been a fall in real wages. Under the accord, because of the circumstances that it faced, the Government has had to negotiate reductions in real wages, which have fallen by about 5 per cent. That does not mean that living standards have fallen. One must have regard to what people actually have to spend, their real disposable income, and the best measure of that is real household disposable income per capita. Under Labor this has increased by 1.8 per cent a year, or 13.5 per cent in the time the Australian Labor Party has been in office. Real income of households per capita in this country has increased by 13.5 per cent since this Government has been in office. How can there be falls in living standards in that situation?</PARA>
<PARA> It is arrant nonsense to claim that that has occurred. If one compares that with what happened when the coalition was in office, one finds that it was able to increase real household disposable income by only 0.6 per cent a year, or 4.5 per cent, in its seven years in government. It is untrue to allege, as the Opposition has done, that living standards have been reduced under Labor; on the contrary, they have increased, and increased three times faster than they did under the coalition Government. The major reason for that has been the tremendous increase in employment. That has occurred under this Government at a rate that is not matched by any other Western developed country. The increase in employment of 1,600,000 new jobs has been at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent per annum, double the rate of increase of major industrial countries.</PARA>
<PARA> The surge of employment has meant that there have been more people in households able to go out and obtain jobs, and therefore boost household income. That is particularly true of women, whose participation rate in the work force has rocketed under this Government to unprecedented levels. The achievement of this Government in the improvement of living standards measured by disposable income undoubtedly is tremendous compared with that of the former coalition Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not end there. One must take into consideration also the way this Government has dealt with government expenditures. Though I have put great emphasis today on the fact that government expenditures as a proportion of GDP have been cut under this Government, we have also reordered priorities substantially and ensured that areas of real need have been adequately addressed. Accordingly, we have increased expenditure substantially in education, welfare, transport and industry assistance. Last night the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in his contribution spelled out very well the way in which this Budget continues the process of reordering priorities and providing substantial increases in the areas of greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should mention the Opposition's claim that this Government is forcing the economy into deep recession. That is absolutely untrue. The forecasts clearly are not for deep recession but for a year of lower growth. It is expected that through the year the level of activity will improve from the lower levels that occurred at the beginning of the year. There will certainly not be the situation that prevailed when the Opposition was in government in the early 1980s, when it produced the worst recession in 50 years. There is no possible chance that this Government will allow that to happen. We stand by our forecast that this year will be one of reduced growth, not one in which there is likely to be any substantial recession or greatly accelerating unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), claimed that there would be no deep recession anywhere in Australia in the next year. I differ from this view most vehemently because if one looks at the bush-at rural and regional Australia-one can see that there is a social and economic tragedy enveloping that area now. Rural and regional Australia is sliding quickly, relentlessly and so far remarkably quietly into the most difficult economic period since World War II. It is more severe than any approaching economic difficulties facing metropolitan Australia because rural and regional Australia is more susceptible to the vagaries and corruptions of world trade. It is export or import competition oriented. It is more susceptible to high interest rates, to the high dollar value and to a high inflation rate. It is not internationally competitive at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In June the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) forecast a 48 per cent reduction in the net value of farm production for this financial year. That figure is on top of a 20 per cent reduction in the previous financial year. So in two years we have had a 68 per cent reduction in the net value of farm production. That reduced purchasing power on our farms, whether it is for consumer goods or for investment back on the farms, quickly flows through to regional business and affects its level of employment very dramatically. The unemployment rate in non-metropolitan Australia is significantly higher than in metropolitan Australia, and that gap will widen. I am thinking not only of retailing and service industries but also of food processing industries, which are a major sector of employment in regional Australia. Processed food costs are increasing by 20 per cent a year-and will reach almost $2 billion. That is happening, firstly, because of the high cost structure in this country and, secondly, because of inappropriate anti-dumping and countervailing duties and the developing country preferences of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau made those projections several months ago. Since then the fall in rural income has accelerated, and the portent of that fall has now become even greater. For example, not only has Russia stopped buying wool from Australia but also it still owes $130m on previous purchases. Eastern European purchases of wool and other agricultural products are also down. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has indicated that there is a need for a further reduction in woolgrowers' income, while still maintaining the 700c per kilogram floor price. The industry is now looking at ways of doing that, such as slowing down the selling system or the payment process. This comes on top of the 35 per cent reduction that resulted from the lowering in the floor price and the increased levy in May. </PARA>
<PARA> That dramatic reduction in woolgrowers' projected income of a few months ago is no longer adequate as a price signal to woolgrowers to diversify. Wheat-the obvious industry for diversification-is suffering to an even greater degree, particularly because of the crisis in the Middle East. Iraq was our best wheat customer. We were hoping to sell that country up to two million tonnes of wheat in the coming year-and that would have been in addition to the $600m in payments from Iraq which are frozen at the present time. This is resulting in the wheat pool payments of the two previous years being stalled also. That $600m is not flowing through to our wheat growers. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Community and the United States have now increased their export subsidies. The Australian Wheat Board has already indicated that the gross return, in the sense of money coming back to the wheat growers, will be down $45 per tonne. That is a more than a 40 per cent reduction in wheat growers' returns since last year, and if one wants to take inflation into account as well-that is, the increase in wheat growers' costs-we are looking at a net reduction in wheat growers' incomes of close to 50 per cent in this financial year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is one of the tragedies of this country; in that respect it is so non-competitive in international terms. It is the same with other grains, such as barley and rice. Due to increased European Community export subsidies, the manufacturing sector of the dairy industry is now writing down its budgets by 20 per cent to 25 per cent. Once again the Gulf crisis and events in Kuwait have meant a dramatic reduction in live sheep exports. Events in the Middle East and Russia have, once again, affected mutton exports. So we have had massive reductions in sales in the sheep meat sector. But that is only half the story-reduced income. The other half of the story concerns the extra costs. Since those ABARE projections of a few months ago, higher fuel costs-and fuel is particularly important to the farming sector and regional Australia-have resulted from the Gulf crisis. Many State and local government charges for farmers and for country townspeople have risen above the consumer price index level. Interest rates, the biggest variable farm cost, have doubled from 10 per cent 10 years ago to about 21 per cent for farmers today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), in an excellent address today during the matter of public importance discussion concerning the problems confronting the rural sector, indicated that since 1985 interest charges, as a proportion of farm costs, have increased from 9 per cent to 13 per cent. If one wants to go back even further to 10 years ago, one can see that they have also doubled from 6 per cent to 13 per cent. We should remember that a one per cent rise in interest rates means a $150m difference in farm costs or, if you like, farm income. To add to the problems of farmers at this time, the banks have chosen to increase the margins on those costs to farmers. According to the Bureau, the result of this is that last year the average farm income per farm worker-that is, for family workers because they do not receive the award wages which were referred to earlier-was $18,500. That is well below average weekly earnings, and it does not allow for any return on capital. The average capital invested per farm in Australia in June 1989 was $1m. That meant a rate of return, including capital appreciation, of just over one per cent. If we use that calculation, including capital appreciation, to get a positive figure, obviously we will have a negative figure from now on. </PARA>
<PARA> With these disasters compounding in rural Australia, and to a lesser degree in Australia generally, one would expect that the Budget would recognise these difficulties and assist where possible. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case. The impact of the Budget will be to exacerbate this downward spiral in net incomes in rural and regional Australia because the Budget is not putting any downward pressure on interest rates. Government expenditure will increase by 12 per cent-that is, 5 per cent ahead of the inflation rate. In spite of what the Minister for Finance said a few minutes ago, if one really looks at the Budget surplus and corrects the fiddles, one can see that the Budget surplus this year will actually be less than last year. That is certainly not a fiscal policy that puts downward pressure on interest rates. The only reduction in interest rates that will occur in this country will come about as a result of the slowing of the economy generally. So farmers and others will certainly derive no joy from this Budget when it comes to this Government's imposed interest rates structure, nor will they derive any joy from the related high dollar value-a value that bears no relationship to its true trade related position. </PARA>
<PARA> A one cent difference in the exchange rate between the Australian dollar and the US dollar means once again about $150m difference in farm incomes. The third point is that the inflation rate in this country will continue to add to our costs in an uncompetitive way. Those are the three major components of farm viability: interest rates, dollar value and inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> If one wants to go even to a specific in the Budget, at a time when we need exports, the Government has imposed a 100 per cent cost recovery at an additional $60m impost on farmers. So we have established with figures produced by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics that average rural incomes are lower than for Australia generally. We know that the average family in rural and regional Australia is larger and that educational opportunities are more limited and expensive. For example, only one-third of rural and regional students receive post-secondary education compared to those in metropolitan areas. There is increasing poverty and there are greater family costs. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Government done in relation to this in the Budget? It has imposed new and more restrictive assets tests for the family allowance, the family allowance supplement and Austudy. It means that farmers and small business people are virtually excluded from welfare assistance available to all other Australian families in similar need. Furthermore, there is no equity, consistency or logic in the application of those assets tests. I point out that an average farm capital of $1m may produce an income below average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> However, with an assets test limit of $300,000 introduced in respect of the family allowance compared to an income test limit of $57,000, there is no way a farm valued at $300,000 can generate $57,000 of income. The assets test also makes no allowance for a family with additional children. There is no consistency because the test for the family allowance supplement is now $200,000-it was $300,000-while the test for Austudy is $400,000 for farmers and business people but with no real recognition of the additional cost that country students must incur in being forced to live away from home. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware of what it is doing with these double standards to country students and country families. I refer to allegations given to me and reported in the Bendigo Advertiser that the Government has tried to suppress a report called Austudy: Rural Inequities prepared by Dr Doug Lloyd, who, I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is no relative of mine. He is Dean of Education at the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. That report was ready in March but was only allowed to be released after the Budget. That details the unfairness of the present Austudy system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to comment on the speech given by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). Like the honourable member, I too am concerned about interest rates, and I shall have more to say about interest rates later. With regard to some of the comments made by the honourable member on the increased tests for welfare payments and the impact on country families, while one might concur with those comments, one would note that they do not sit very well with the general comments made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) after the Budget was brought down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both of those gentlemen attacked the Budget, saying that there ought to have been more welfare cuts and that there should have been tougher welfare provisions. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot argue that the Budget was not tough enough and that it should have contained more cuts in welfare when we now have the sorts of speeches we have had today on the matter of public importance from the Deputy Leader of the National Party arguing that there should have been more consideration given to the welfare needs of farmers. There has to be some consistency. </PARA>
<PARA> We are aware of the inconsistencies between the Liberal and National parties in a number of areas. However, before the National Party or the country representatives of the Liberal Party get up and make these sorts of speeches, they ought first to sort out whether they are going to have a coherent macro-economic strategy. Clearly they do not. It is because they do not have such a coherent strategy, and because they will pull in different directions again at the next election, that the Australian people are very unlikely to be interested in anything that those parties have to say in terms of pretending to be an alternative government. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the issue of interest rates. Some agreement exists on both sides of the House that we all ought to be concerned about what is happening to interest rates at the moment. It is interesting to note that everyone is concerned about micro-economic reform. It appears that in this country we go through fads in economic debate, like everything else. The current fad is micro-economic reform, and no-one appears particularly concerned about the macro situation of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates are a serious matter. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) made a number of important comments on the behaviour of the banks with respect to interest rates. The Treasurer said that interest rates are too high and that the banks ought to be reducing interest rates at the moment. The Treasurer has called on the banks to reduce interest rates; he has told the banks they ought to reduce interest rates. The Treasurer said that the banks have been manipulating the situation by keeping interest rates high. However, there is not much evidence of the banks responding to this request by the Treasurer, especially on home loans, which are a very important matter for the vast majority of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned at the high level of interest rates in relation to both business investment and home loans. I do not see that much will happen as a result of the request by the Treasurer. So the question now arises: should we be looking at other actions to ensure that the banks actually behave responsibly and lower interest rates? The consequences of interest rates remaining high in the current atmosphere are very serious indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the banks are not responding to the request by the Treasurer, I would urge the Treasurer to look at using regulation and, if necessary, legislation to ensure that interest rates are brought down. After all, when we deregulated interest rates, and when we generally deregulated the monetary system, we said we expected that competition between the banks would bring about a responsible result that would benefit the Australian community and consumers generally. What happened?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer himself has noted that the banks have tried to boost their profit margins, which would have fallen as a result of the mistakes which the banks have been making. I shall return to that issue in a minute. The banks have tried to boost those profit margins at the expense of people who have been genuine customers of the banks and at the expense of home owners. </PARA>
<PARA> The banks have been making mistakes. They have been losing money through foolish investments and rather than reduce their profits they have said, `Oh, no. We are going to keep our profit margins; we just won't reduce interest rates.' The Treasurer has said, `Look, we want you to reduce interest rates. You are not justified in putting this burden on the average home owner and on legitimate business. You are not justified in doing that.' What have the banks done in the weeks since the Treasurer made this statement? The banks have ignored that call. </PARA>
<PARA> The banks are simply behaving in an irresponsible way and have ignored the call of the Treasurer. If we really want to get control of the macro economy, if we really want to control the situation in relation to interest rates, we need to do something about this matter. We need to use the existing provisions of the Act or, if the existing provisions are insufficient, to rush legislation through this House and through the Senate to ensure that we can guarantee doing something about bringing down the interest rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should the Australian people have to put up with this irresponsible and selfish behaviour on the part of the banks, especially since, when the banks were making record profits and pushing up interest rates, they were having a wonderful time? Nobody was saying, `Let's control them.' Now we have a situation in which the banks have made a lot of foolish mistakes as a result of deregulation and they are turning around and imposing the burdens of that on the Australian people. There is no doubt that deregulation has been abused. Whilst some level of deregulation was required for the Australian economy-and I think everyone admits that-deregulation has been abused. It has gone too far. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few months in Australia we have had a spectacular series of one after another of the major corporations, especially the ones which had famous names attached to them-I will not name all the names; everyone knows them-collapsing. In their collapse what has happened? Have the individuals who have been running these corporations suffered? Not very much. They have been looked after. But what has happened to the shareholders? What has happened to the people who were owed money by these corporations? What has happened to the other legitimate businesses? What has happened to the individuals who invested funds in these corporations? A lot of things need to be asked and looked at in relation to this process. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that most culpable are those banks which have been prepared to lend to these corporations in an irresponsible fashion, irrespective of the assets, management practices, and productive capacity of these corporations. As a result, we have had spectacular collapses, which have done a lot of damage to Australia's international reputation. If the banks themselves had behaved in a more responsible fashion, we would not be in this situation. In nearly every case, the banks have protected themselves to a certain degree. They are the ones that have to be repaid first by the receivers. So they have looked after themselves to a degree, but all the other people who have lost their money because of the irresponsible activity of the banks have not been in a position to get back their money. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that what has happened with interest rates and the behaviour of the banks in general is a very serious matter. It is time for us to look again at the behaviour of the banks. In particular, if the banks are going to continue to ignore the requests of the Treasurer that they behave in a more responsible fashion and reduce their profit margins-which they deserve to have reduced at present, because of the money they have lost through their own irresponsible actions-there is only one solution. This is critical at the present time in the balance of the macro economy of Australia. Interest rates must come down and they must come down quickly. If that is to happen we ought to consider seriously some legislative mechanism or some regulatory mechanism to force the banks to behave responsibly and to reduce interest rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating tonight Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1990-91, which gives members an opportunity to respond to matters relating to the Budget. Whilst it is not usual to comment on matters that have been raised by the other side in debates such as this, I just have to say to the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) that I think he misses the point completely about the role of the banks and also the demise of some of the entrepreneurs of this country. Having spent so much time looking at the new corporations legislation, insider trading, ramping and warehousing and shareholders' rights, I think I can profess to know a little bit about these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For some seven years the Government did not fund the National Companies and Securities Commission. I have said publicly that people like Lionel Bowen are almost culpably negligent in having avoided having a proper support of the existing law, let alone changing the law. In so doing, the Government has allowed many of these practices to take place. Its admission of failure is seen in its Budget where, at least, there is an increase of quite substantial amounts to the corporate regulators. The honourable member for Calwell missed the point completely. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me move on to other issues relating to the Budget. Honourable members will recall that the response of independent commentators to the Budget was not favourable. The Opposition's response certainly was not favourable. The big gap in the Budget was this whole question of micro-economic reform. Honourable members will recall that micro-economic reform was the issue that the Prime Minister designated as `the issue' for this current term. They will also recall the leaked letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the favoured son in the Australian Labor Party (ALP), the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), saying `I want you, honourable member for Swan, to come forward to the Cabinet with a whole raft of reforms to give effect to this desire of mine to see micro-economic reform.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went away, having been asked to perform a difficult task. What did he come back with? He came back with some proposals that the Cabinet could not decide upon. All the economic Ministers rejected his proposals, but at the end of the day who is going to make the decision? It is not going to be a decision of the Cabinet. It is going to be a decision made on Monday, 24 September, at a special conference where the platform of the ALP is to be reviewed by unelected, faceless men. It is like history being revisited, like being back in the days of Arthur Calwell and Gough Whitlam. Those faceless men are going to make a decision about what is important in terms of the economy of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating), who left this giant gap in his Budget, is now being politically neutered and has not even got up his own option as to what ought to be the micro-economic reform agenda. We have had debates in this place over the last little while and there have been many comments from commentators about where the country is going. I particularly draw the attention of the House to one in the Newcastle Herald, which is not a paper that I read very often. The article is very important because it asks the fundamental question: 'Who runs the country?' It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Not the Federal Government, if Monday's decision on telecommunications competition is a guide. A government which asserted before the March election that it would govern in the interests of all Australians has let a handful of union and political party officials dictate the nature of competition in the rapidly growing telecommunications sphere. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes on in a similar vein. I think the Newcastle Herald would generally be reasonably objective. The point has been picked up by independent commentators all over the country. The whole issue of privatisation has been badly handled by the Government. Indeed, the headline of an article by one of the foremost political commentators in Australia in the Australian newspaper last week, `Hawke's backflip', encapsulated what is happening within the Government. The article says about the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>He has been adept in embracing privatisation but shameless in keeping his old rhetoric. He wants to win praise as an economic reformer by selling the airlines and win praise as a champion of public enterprise by attacking the Coalition's pledge to sell Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to draw two key points out of that. Firstly, the article says that the Prime Minister is shameless. He certainly is. He is opportunistic. He is hypocritical in the approach he has taken to these very fundamental economic issues that face the country. Furthermore, he is trying to win praise. How often have we seen this Prime Minister want to be loved? He wants to be loved and he wants to do the right thing. At a time like this the leader of a country like ours, with our economic problems, does not have time to go out and seek praise; he is asked and employed to make the decisions for all Australians. The newspaper of a regional city like Newcastle says, `What happened to this Government? Why is it not making decisions for all Australians?'. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Treasurer talked about privatisation and said a couple of things which I agree with because they are fundamental. They are in our privatisation policy. The Treasurer said that privatisation may improve efficiency. It certainly does, and I have talked ad infinitum in this place and elsewhere about the benefits to efficiency by privatisation, by subjecting government business enterprises (GBEs) to private sector management. The Treasurer agreed that was one of the benefits of privatisation. He also agreed that it was a better allocation of resources to have privatisation. That is certainly borne out around the rest of the world. Some 83 countries of varying political persuasions, whether they be democratic, autocratic, socialist, communist or whatever, have embraced privatisation. They have had the benefits because of better allocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Treasurer said another thing which I thought was curious. He said that privatisation was no panacea-and certainly we say in our policy that it is no panacea because it is but one leg of the approach to micro-economic reform that ought to be pursued-but he also said that no current account benefit accrues from privatisation. That is simply not true. There is a benefit to the current account by greater efficiency within the micro-economy. I think that the Treasurer is arguing at cross-purposes. His rhetoric has got away from his economic fundamentals. There are benefits to the current account by a far greater micro-economic sector, especially when one looks at the size of the public sector in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> If those opposite look at the size of the public sector in this country, they can see that there are some benefits. If there are benefits there, then all of us will be better off. If I can draw that point out a little further, government ownership in this country has stifled management because public trading enterprises account for about 10 per cent of total gross domestic product. They employ about 7 per cent of the total work force and account for well over half the total public gross fixed capital expenditure. They have allowed featherbedding and privilege to continue. Certainly we have seen over the last couple of days that the unions have been wanting to stake out their position and not let their privileges be in any way diminished. Featherbedding and privileges have resulted in inefficiencies that cost Australians over 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). </PARA>
<PARA> The net rate of return on capital averages is only 3.1 per cent for public trading enterprises compared with 16.4 per cent for the private sector. That is a vast difference. There is a vast gap there. As I keep on saying, our public sector is large and great benefits could be accrued to the overall economy. Because we are much more efficient and get higher productivity levels in the micro sector, that will give us the opportunity to deal also with the current account deficit. For the Treasurer to say that privatisation does not in any way benefit the current account deficit, in my view, is fundamentally wrong. The Treasurer is confusing a macro issue with a micro issue. I think he was being carried away by his own rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has warned that public enterprises as a whole have unacceptably low productivity levels and are uncompetitive in international terms. The Industry Commission has found that structural reform in the transport and communications areas alone could boost GDP by over $6 billion. A key report on GBEs by the Industry Commission titled Measuring the performance of selected government business enterprises has slammed the performance of GBEs. It says GBEs are losing taxpayers more than $3 billion a year because of their failure to match private companies in economic performance. The community would have achieved a better return by investing in conservative Commonwealth bonds than by pouring money into these enterprises. Telecom Australia, Qantas Airways Ltd, Australia Post and the Australian National Line were unable to match the Commission's benchmark of 8 per cent real rate of return on assets, which most private sector companies would regard as low. The relevant figures are Telecom, 5.5 per cent; Qantas, 4 per cent; Australia Post, one per cent; Australian National Line, minus 2.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those rates of return are affecting all of us. People driving home tonight are paying for this poor performance. The Opposition is saying that there is a better way to manage these government business enterprises, that it is far better to subject them to the disciplines of private enterprise management and say to the people of Australia, `You can become shareholders', that it is far better to say to the management and employees of the Australia National Line, `Why don't you take some shares in these enterprises to give you some incentive to improve productivity so the rewards accrue to you above and beyond the salary that you earn so that you have a stake and an interest in your businesses?'. </PARA>
<PARA> We were the first to talk in this place about employer share ownership programs (ESOPs). When we introduced the first Bill in this place under the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), those opposite voted against it. Yet the present Treasurer says, `We believe ESOPs are important'. All of a sudden those opposite have discovered that there are some benefits from privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Two honourable members sitting opposite, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and the honourable member for Calwell, are members of the left wing who are not interested in the future of this country, the proper progress of this country or dealing with these matters that should have been dealt with in the Budget. Because the Treasurer is from the right wing faction, the two honourable members sitting opposite would not let him make the decisions in the Budget. Now you want to interrupt me and interject but have not got the guts to stand up and say where you would go. You want things to stay in place. You are marching against the trend of history and the economic trend. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for reminding me that I should be concentrating my remarks to someone who understands them rather than to those who are living in the past and do not have any vision for the future-unlike the Opposition, which has staked quite clearly a visionary proposal for dealing with the problem of government business enterprises and the very low rate of return that they are giving to Australian taxpayers. We cannot step away from the Industry Commission's inescapable conclusion that the failure of the GBEs to reach this objective directly reduced government revenue and raised taxes. We have talked about the problems of Qantas and Australian Airlines and the problem Telecom will have with its future capital requirements unless it can be subjected to some better management arrangements that we will propose; ultimately there will be privatisation after we get some real competition in the telecommunications area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The key to performance gains is, as the Industry Commission points out, to ensure that GBEs operate in an environment where they can find and remove inefficiency so as to provide customers with the cheapest services possible. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened to putting people first in this place? One of the arguments that I make in favour of privatisation is this: we should be concerned about consumers and taxpayers. Let us put people first for a change. Let us not continue to support vested interests such as unionists. Only 32 per cent of Australians belong to unions now. Unionism is a declining force but unions still have a disproportionate say in the government of this country. It is time we recognised that we are here for all Australians, just as the Newcastle Herald editorial said. Who runs the country and what has happened to the Government, which is supposed to rule for all Australians? That is what was lacking from this Budget, that is why the Treasurer has failed, and that is why on 24 September an amazing event will take place. </PARA>
<PARA> On Monday 101 people who are unelected to this place will make a decision about the very basic economic direction of the micro reform area in this country. It is a tragedy for this country that all of a sudden this Government has failed, that those decisions will be made in secret and will be delivered up to this place by people who are controlled from outside this place and thus no longer controlled by the democratic processes that all Australians hope and believe should be the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations to respond further on the matters of privilege which I raised on 11 and 17 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have referred to Mr Speaker three newspaper articles which could constitute breaches of privilege. While the two earlier articles may have given a false impression to the public of the determinations and decisions of the Committee, the Committee is of the view that they did not constitute substantial interference with the final recommendations which the Committee reached. Nevertheless, the Committee is concerned that such leaks did occur. Under the circumstances the Committee will not persist with the referral of the matters raised on 11 September to the Committee of Privileges. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Committee feels that the article published in the Sunday Herald on 16 September 1990 is of a much more serious nature and has the potential to undermine the Committee's future deliberations, especially in its dealings with third parties. This is particularly so when information either sought or provided is done so on a confidential basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is therefore deeply concerned that a senior journalist, who either knew or ought to have known the serious nature of publishing a document which was forwarded to the Committee on a confidential basis or material which was provided during the course of an in camera hearing to the Committee, should subsequently publish such material or extracts from such material. </PARA>
<PARA> I note Mr Speaker's preparedness to accord precedence to a motion in respect of this matter following the Committee taking whatever steps it could in order to ascertain the source of this latest disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee met this afternoon to ascertain as best it could the source of this latest disclosure. As Chairman, I asked two questions of each member present-Senators Cooney, McKiernan, Olsen and Spindler and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley)-to which responses were received immediately. The questions were: `Have you, on any occasion, provided or assisted or allowed to be provided, to Mr Daly or any other journalist information confidential to the Committee? Have you supplied to Mr Daly or any other journalist material which is confidential to the Committee or material which is covered by parliamentary privilege?'</PARA>
<PARA> All members, including myself, answered no to these two questions. The honourable member for Dundas added the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA>To the best of my knowledge and recollection I have not, but, in my role as Shadow Minister for Immigration, I have spoken to a number of journalists over a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA>The staff of the secretariat had the same two questions put to them and they, too, have responded in the negative. </PARA>
<PARA> The view of the Committee is that the publication has seriously impeded the deliberations and work of the Committee, and I therefore request that a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges be moved on the next sitting day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The aspects of this Budget debate that I wish to address concern the interests of rural and remote Australia. I notice that two of my friends from the Opposition are in the House-the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). Both represent rural electorates. I understand that today the honourable member for Wakefield was the lead speaker in the discussion of the Opposition's matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Braithwaite" NAMEID="0F4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr Braithwaite</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very well done.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He advocated his position extremely well, according to the honourable member for Dawson. I am sure, given his interest in rural affairs, that the honourable member for Wakefield would have applauded the Budget initiatives of this Government in relation to assistance to people in rural areas, particularly those people who live in more remote areas. I make reference in this instance to the review of zonal tax rebates to produce benefits to remote Australia. The town of Nhulunbuy, for example, in my electorate has now been included as a result of this review in special tax zone A. This will add $600 per annum to the rebate claimable by each taxpayer. As well, for those people living in special zone B, which encompasses a very large part of remote Australia, the dependant rebate has been increased to the same level as that in special zone A.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two other matters that are of direct relevance to the concerns of people who live in remote areas which I want to pay brief attention to in the context of this debate. One is the decision that family allowance can be paid concurrently with the isolated children's allowance for children over 16. I am sure that that is something which would be supported by the honourable member for Wakefield. If not, I would want to know why not. An additional issue was a decision to increase the means test free allowance from $989 to $1,500 under the assistance to isolated children scheme. I am sure that he would applaud that decision, as would the honourable member for Dawson. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has done a great deal during the life of its four terms to assist people in remote areas. I would like to enumerate a number of things. We have the remote commercial television services, Telecom Australia's rural and remote area program-the program-and the construction of national highways scheme. We have now established in this present Parliament the position of Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia, and we have established the North Australian Development Unit within the Department of Social Security, which has produced and continues to produce a real gain for the servicing of remote areas by Government departments and agencies. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA> I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for inviting all my colleagues into the chamber to hear this brilliant address. I am sure that what I am about to say will not please him. He was responsible for raising the matter of public importance today concerning living standards for rural Australia. It is that matter that I want to address in my brief contribution to this debate. The Opposition raised a matter of public importance in the House today regarding the kind of living standards in rural Australia. That matter was raised by the honourable member for Wakefield, who called this quorum. </PARA>
<PARA> During that debate Opposition members claimed that they were the true representatives of the productive force in rural Australia. Well, I ask you! The honourable member for Wakefield lives in a pocket handkerchief electorate in the middle of South Australia. He knows nothing of the bush. The only bloke on the Opposition benches with any sizeable electorate is the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). The rest of the major bush electorates in Australia belong to the Australian Labor Party. The honourable member for Dawson was extremely lucky to get back after the last election, and he will be very, very lucky to win next time round. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) so rightly said this afternoon, the Australian Labor Party is strengthening its rural roots. Through the Government's policies, we are helping the bush by way of specific social justice strategies, especially access to services. Most members concur with this view, including members of the Opposition. Opposition members now know that the writing is on the wall. They are very unlikely to ever win back these seats, at least in the foreseeable future. The decade of the 1990s is a decade when rural Australia belongs to the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has consciously gone about alienating the bush voters all the time. Opposition members, and especially those in the National Party of Australia, have all the dated ideology of being the protectors of the bush. Yet their policy is driven by merchant bankers in striped shirts who sell their electorates such immoral and devastating policies as flogging Telecom Australia and introducing a consumption tax. In what way would the flogging of Telecom, the deregulation of the telecommunications industry and the introduction of a consumption tax be a boon to rural Australia? What benefit would there be to anyone in rural Australia from the introduction of a consumption tax or from the Opposition's policy on telecommunications?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look very briefly at the broad-based consumption tax. It has to be levied, as honourable members opposite would well know, at a point of sale and that must include the effect of all freight charges to that point of sale. It is a discriminatory, regressive tax favouring low freight cost items and low freight cost destinations. It disadvantages the bush. The honourable member for Maranoa, who is new to the House, will learn that members of the Opposition, and particularly the National Party, are no friends of his. It is ironic that the Opposition's stated reason for pushing a broad-based consumption tax is to simplify the tax system. Yet the only way it can sell the tax to the National Party is to start introducing exemptions and complications. </PARA>
<PARA> The same can be said of the proposed exemptions for low income earners. By the time it establishes all the exemptions and special clauses, the tax is hardly worth the paper it is written on. Earlier today my good friend, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) quoted the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) who, in an article in the Australian Financial Review, talked about his original reservations concerning the consumption tax. I will just repeat it. The Leader of the National Party said that his original concerns were that the tax could inadvertently undermine export industries, have an add-on impact in remote areas of Australia and would be too easy a form of taxation which lent itself to being increased easily. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the Leader of the National Party. The Opposition is seriously misrepresenting itself when it claims to look after the interests of the bush. There is not one person in rural Australia, least of all in my electorate, who would acknowledge that this is a progressive idea. All of them know what the costs would be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give an example. Honourable members opposite may not know this since some of them very rarely travel out of the confines of urban Australia. They would not be able to find their way into the Northern Territory, let alone around it. In the context of prices, Opposition members ought to be aware how different life is in the bush. I will give one example. In the community of Nhulunbuy, which I noted earlier, this Government has recognised its disadvantage by amending the tax zone rebate system to ensure that it gets the special zone A treatment. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys, Nhulunbuy residents pay 30 per cent above the Australian average for goods. If it is asserted that the Australian average prices would normally be seen as those applying in Sydney and Melbourne, Nhulunbuy would pay 30 per cent above the odds. Now the Opposition wants to impose an additional consumption tax of around 15 per cent. How are the residents expected to pay for it? This is in a regime where this Government has brought down the top marginal tax rate from 60 per cent to 47 per cent and the bottom tax rate from 30 per cent to 21 per cent. Yet the honourable member for Wakefield asserts that he represents the people of the bush. Let me tell him that he does not. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Senate we have the stupefying sight of the National Party Whip, representing the Country Liberal Party (CLP) in the Northern Territory, coming into the Parliament, masquerading as representing the interests of the Northern Territory and, as I understand it, agreeing in the party room to this consumption tax and for the telecommunications policy which the Opposition would have us impose on rural Australia. You all ought to know better. Let us look at telecommunications, albeit very briefly. `We will flog Telecom', you say. There will be no provision for community service organisations. </PARA>

I urge National Party members, and particularly the National Party Leader, to give up this stupid game of lying in bed with the Liberal Party because it is not only pursuing policies which will grossly disadvantage the National Party-we know that it is doing that in any event-but it is also deliberately developing policies which will basically disadvantage rural Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of all the 148 seats in this House that will be contested at the next election, I think that statistically, on this side of politics, the seat of Mallee is the safest and, therefore, on the face of it, the one the Opposition is most likely to win. But I think even Malcolm Mackerras would have to agree that the seat we are most likely to win is the seat of the Northern Territory. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) says that he is going to assist in remote areas. Apparently that is his platform. Perhaps that assistance will be by way of chewing up $18,000 worth of taxpayers' money taking a VIP plane to a dog show.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Dawson quite rightly says, it probably left because it had a bit of pride. Tonight I want to mention a matter which I regard with the greatest seriousness. To some extent, it is a shame that this matter has not formed a bigger part of the debate on the 1990 Budget. I refer to the crisis confronting Australia and the rest of the world in the Persian Gulf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget is glibly built on a foundation of oil prices being somewhat inflated as a result of the Persian Gulf crisis, but inflated only to the extent of $23 a barrel. Without wishing to use too weak a pun, I think it would be fair to say that it is a Budget which is consequently built on a foundation of sand. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members stop for a minute and look at the crisis in the Persian Gulf, they will no doubt be quite alarmed to see the growing level of conflict that exists there. There has, perhaps appropriately, been a rapid build-up of both Western and Arab forces in Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Gulf region. So far, the sanctions that have been imposed have been fairly effective. But the question which the world community will be asking is: How long can this stand-off that now exists in the Persian Gulf last?</PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that public opinion in the West will tolerate the expenditure of vast amounts of money to confront President Hussein for only so long. There is no doubt that the economic costs in terms of trade sanctions will become greater and greater as time goes on and place more and more pressure on Western communities. That is not to say that I think the West should for one moment relent; in fact, quite the contrary. The great challenge for political leaders in Western countries is to maintain that pressure against the totally illegal, totally irresponsible and totally reprehensible behaviour of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the longer the stand-off lasts, the greater will be the pressure for some resolution of the crisis. My view is that we in this country certainly would be unwise to rule out altogether the possibility of military conflict in the Persian Gulf. I do not think enough thought is being given to that possibility in Australia. The media have quickly moved on to a range of other issues, but the fact is that the prospect of military conflict in the Persian Gulf is very great. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 is a debate about the Budget and the state of the Australian economy. Regardless of whether there is a short, sharp military conflict in the Persian Gulf, or whether, alternatively, there is a process extending over several years of continuing to maintain sanctions, the consequences for the Australian economy, as indeed for the global economy, will be deleterious. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is frighteningly vulnerable to any changes in global circumstances. If honourable members contemplate the record breaking balance of payments deficit experienced over the last year, the extraordinarily high rate of inflation compared to our trading partners over the last year and the decline in living standards over the last year, they will remember that all these things have happened at a time of relatively strong commodity prices. What we are seeing now is a decline in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is extremely vulnerable to any decline in commodity prices. This Budget projects an inflation rate of 6 1/2 per cent, whereas the average in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is projected to be 4 per cent. Next year, it is projected that Australia will have an $18 billion balance of payments deficit. The prospect of a changing circumstance in the Persian Gulf, or indeed a continuation of the stand-off in the Persian Gulf, makes those figures all but irrelevant because they are built on the foundation of a $23 a barrel price for oil. Yesterday the price of oil was $33 a barrel. I think most economists would agree that the assumption of a $23 average price over the financial year was far too optimistic. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth reflecting that for almost a month now the price of oil has been above $30 a barrel. The Parliament should reflect on the consequences for Australia if oil prices do remain higher than the Budget projections. First of all, and quite obviously, the higher oil prices will have a very negative effect on the totality of the global economy. Growth in industrial economies will obviously decline, just as it did in 1973 and 1979 following oil price hikes. Illustratively, and I think this is a reasonable figure to take-it is not the figure presented by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) but it is a reasonable figure-a 60 per cent rise in oil prices this financial year will lead to something like a 1.5 per cent decline in the level of global growth which would otherwise have been achieved over the next two years. That 60 per cent rise in oil prices would clearly lead to a significant decline in commodity prices as the global economy ceases to grow at the predicted rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the 1973 and 1979 oil price hikes, both food and metals commodity prices fell very significantly and one could expect exactly the same thing to happen this time. The decline in economic growth, and the prospect of higher inflation-with which I will deal in a minute-will inevitably also lead to higher global interest rates. Again, the consequences of that will be to reduce commodity prices to which Australia is so vulnerable. Maybe one can predict that commodity prices overall will fall in the vicinity of 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia stands to gain a small amount from the probable increase in demand for alternative forms of energy other than oil. For example, we might be able to look forward to higher coal prices and higher gas prices, and if the Government were to abandon its policy on uranium-Senator Richardson says it will not, so I assume that means it will not-we could expect to benefit from higher uranium prices. The Australian Labor Party, locked into what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) describes as illogical policies, will not, apparently, do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The inflationary consequences for the global economy of higher oil prices are worthy of reflection. We in Australia will feel those consequences as we drive around to fill our cars with petrol-and that means all of us, members of parliament and the rest of the community-but, as I said earlier, a 60 per cent increase in oil prices would, according to the International Energy Agency and the International Monetary Fund, add something like 3 per cent to the global inflation rate over the next two years. That will mean higher interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this mean for Australia? First of all, it means a great deal for the accord mark 6. The accord is based on a 6 per cent inflation rate, and if the inflation rate is higher than 6 per cent apparently the accord will need to be renegotiated so that there can be wage increases above the expected level. If we take the inflation rate as a guide to what will happen to wages and to the accord, assuming that oil prices average out at around $30 a barrel we can expect to have an inflation rate not of 6 per cent by June 1991, as the Treasurer predicted, but an inflation rate of a horribly high 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of higher oil prices could be worsened if, as a result of declining global commodity prices, there is a fall in the value of the Australian dollar. I remind the House that a 5 per cent devaluation of the Australian dollar would result in about one-half of one per cent being added to the inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the balance of payments effect for Australia of an increase in oil prices to something like $30 a barrel over the next 12-month period. It will add to our oil deficit by something in the vicinity of $600m. Even though that deficit and the general decline in commodity prices and the effect on Australia from that will be offset to some extent by higher returns from coal, uranium and gold exports, the fact is-and economists generally agree, and I think it is a reasonable assumption-that our projected balance of payments deficit could deteriorate by something like $2 billion beyond what is already projected. Remember, the Government itself is projecting a massive $18 billion loss for the Australian economy over the next year-an $18 billion balance of payments deficit likely to be exacerbated to the extent of $2 billion to $20 billion as a result of higher oil prices flowing from the crisis in the Persian Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, add to that the collapse of our farm trade, the wheat crisis, the overproduction in the Northern Hemisphere, the subsidies in the European Community and the United States, the collapse of our wool market, the overproduction of beef in the European Community to stocks of something like 200,000 tonnes to be dumped onto the global market. Where does that leave us? We are abominably vulnerable as a country, and there is no sense of urgency on the other side of the House, nor indeed any sense of urgency in the community, about the need to try to resolve our economic problems at the heart. </PARA>
<PARA> All I can say is that the next year is going to be another miserable and hard year for Australia because, as a country, we have never had the courage to take the hard decisions to make ourselves more competitive and more effective. We never will with the Labor Party. The sooner we change the government and the direction of policy in order to make ourselves less vulnerable and more competitive, the better for the future of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the key word to describe this year's Budget and its objective is `consistency'. That is something that has been lost on the Opposition, but it has been picked up in the financial communities and by people that I have spoken to. In order to run an economy and run it successfully, the first thing we have to do is actually balance the books. We actually have to produce an outcome in the black, not in the red.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know we constantly refer to the performance of the Opposition when it was in government, but it should not be lost on the House that when this Government came to office in 1983 the Budget deficit was $9 billion-$9 billion in the red. We have now turned in for the fourth successive year a Federal surplus-a surplus this year of a projected $8 billion. That is a $17 billion turnaround, and it has been achieved by a number of very significant measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The first step the Government took to bring about this turnaround was to get the economy back to work. We had a million people unemployed in Australia in 1983. The effect of that kind of unemployment is that people are not in work, they are not earning incomes, they are not paying taxes, so obviously we are on the down side of the Budget. On the other side of the Budget, those people are receiving unemployment benefits, which means that revenue is not only lost on the tax side because people are not working but the Government is actually paying out unemployment benefits. So if we run an economy with a million people unemployed, we are a long way down the road of starting with a deficit. If we then happen to be running an economy where tax evasion and avoidance is rife, where the fastest growing industry in the nation is advice on how to beat the tax man, we are destined for further trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the second major platform that the Government had to address itself to: cleaning up Australia's internal tax system; making it fairer; making sure that people at least made a fair contribution to the tax mix. That, of course, led to the introduction of things such as fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax and, most importantly, it led to giving the Australian Taxation Office the resources to make sure that there was compliance, that people actually did comply through substantiation, that they did not claim their business lunches as tax deductions and all the rest of it. Through that process the Government has been able to bring about compliance, and I am sure the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, will remember fondly the years that we put in the necessary work, through the fringe benefits tax and other areas, to bring about this compliance. That has meant that people who back in 1983-after years of Liberal government-were just choosing to opt out of the tax system are now in the system, and that has been a significant part of the process. </PARA>
<PARA> The other key area of the three-pronged approach was to look at what the Government actually spent money on and how the public sector in Australia could be restrained. A lot of very significant effort has gone into hard decisions to cut back the Government's share of expenditure in this economy. In 1983, when we came to office, the Government's share of the economy was nearly 30 per cent of gross national expenditure. That has been wound back to 23 1/2 per cent-a 6 1/2 point improvement. That has not been through soft options, soft spending cuts. Every year of that last seven years when we have produced a Budget the Opposition has sat over on the other side and said, `You haven't taken the hard decisions; they're not real cuts; the Budget surplus won't be a surplus', and so on and so on. But step by step by step it has been achieved, and it has been achieved with a consistent approach, a sound eye and a tight eye on those objectives. I think that is important for people to understand. Above all, what they expect from the Federal Government is consistency, and they expect the Federal Government to take a fair and tight approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to most commentators, I actually believe there will be two very significant spin-offs from this Budget. I believe that there will be a significant fall in interest rates in the Australian economy during this term of office. I think that fall in interest rates is already coming through. The principal reason for that is that the Government is now not a borrower. I want to pick up a point made by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) before he wandered out of the chamber. He said that the Government had inflicted on the economy a $18 billion loss for the year. What he was talking about, of course, is the fact that because Australia has for one reason or another borrowed profusely off-shore, it will continue to run a current account deficit; that Australia will continue to spend more than it earns, and it will continue to borrow to fund that gap in earnings from exports versus what is spent on imports. </PARA>
<PARA> What the honourable member for Mayo failed to say was that almost all of those spendings now are being conducted by the private sector. They are nothing to do with the Government. The Government now actually is not a borrower in the marketplace. Not only has the Federal Government got its act cleaned up, but it has also now forced upon the States the disciplines that mean that the government sector in Australia, the public sector, is no longer a borrower in the economy. That has taken some very severe disciplines right through our approach to national budgeting. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an important point to make because the Opposition wanders around saying that the economy is running at a loss, without going into the whole process of reinvestment, retooling, a new direction towards value-adding and export incentives and all the rest of it. Simply touching on that untrue statement the honourable member for Mayo made that the Government has caused an $18 billion loss, let it be known to all concerned that it is the private sector that is running the current account deficit in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one point, though, on this question of our continuing to squeeze the public budget, to pull the public sector back in its spending to the point where we now are. The first thing that Australians everywhere need to understand is that we are now the third lowest tax paying nation in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) list. I know that many people find that hard to believe because they see their pay packet every week and they see the tax that they pay on their wages. </PARA>
<PARA> People need to understand that when the taxes they pay to the Federal Government-whether taxes on wages or petrol or sales tax on goods and services-are added to the State government taxes that are paid and local council rates, those are all part of the national tax bill, and it adds up in Australia to about 22.6 per cent of the economy, if I remember the figures correctly. But that total tax bill is the third lowest as a share of the economy of the OECD nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that people's taxes seem higher is that we pay one of the largest shares of pay as you earn (PAYE) tax, of tax on our wages, each fortnight or each month. In Australia we collect a larger share of these taxes from PAYE than other countries which collect much greater amounts of tax via consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that leads to the position that the Opposition is now taking. The Opposition is somehow going to run the line that if we introduce a consumption tax that will, in some way, lead to lower taxes for ordinary people. When we are already the third lowest tax paying nation, and the Opposition comes forward and says, `We are going to reduce taxes further', it cannot come in with the proposition, `We are going to be even lower on the tax scale but we are going to have this new tax on goods and services'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is taxation by stealth, as the Minister says, and it does not add up. That will be exposed, because it really means one kind of tax versus another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In winding up on this point, I believe that the Government has gone about as far as it can in cutting back expenditure in the public sector. When the Minister at the table was Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology which was inquiring into small business and chairman of the Government's country task force, with which I made many visits with the Minister, we were told everywhere we went in Australia-whether to police stations, schools, hospitals or councils talking about road funding-that there is no more fat in the system, no more scope for cuts. Yet the Opposition is saying, `We will cut public expenditure'. (Quorum formed) I had intended to be brief, but members of the Government in particular ought to understand that the reason that the Opposition felt the need to bring honourable members into the House was that it thought that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) took too long at Question Time today over one of his answers. The information that he was giving on road funding and on petrol tax and excise tax in Australia being as low as they are is very germane to the point I was making. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have the opportunity I make the point that Minister Beddall now has the opportunity to implement his report, which means that he now has an even greater role to play. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that there is any more fat in the system, certainly of any substance, and now that we are the third lowest tax paying nation in the OECD any talk about a consumption tax or any other kind of tax is really only saying to people, `We are not going to cut taxes overall. We are not going to contain public spending any further. We are really talking about substituting one kind of tax for another'. That debate will be exposed during the next couple of years, and I know where the people of Australia will be when that point comes forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is that, particularly on the Prime Minister's country task force, as the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), who was making some observations to me, is well aware, everywhere we have gone we have heard groups from hospitals, police stations, schools or councils talking about roads, rail or their various services and saying that there is no more fat in the system. They are in fact terrified by the sorts of propositions being brought by the Opposition that, when and if it is in office, it will cut public expenditure further. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Budget was predicated on one key word-and that is `consistency'. The Budget will lead to gradual but substantial reductions in interest rates. I think that all of us here ought to understand that Australia is working its way through some difficult times and that the strategy set out by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the Budget is not only consistent but comprehensive and is fully supported by all members of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing Appropriation Bill (No. 1). The Budget was delivered in this chamber over three weeks ago. At the time it was seen by most observers as being largely an irrelevant document. It took several days for members of the community to examine the document and ask themselves what major decisions need to be taken which affect this nation. After some time, we became aware that the matters that needed to be addressed were not being addressed in the Budget to the extent that they should, although they might be addressed in legislation at some later point in time and, to an extent, might be considered in forums outside this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the period of some 17 years that I have been a member of this Parliament the Budget has become increasingly irrelevant. The way it is handled by the Government demonstrates that irrelevancy-the way members are debating it now, with set piece speeches which might be able to be sent out to constituents by Government members, with money provided by the taxpayers. Honourable members are asked to consider the Budget and debate it by reducing their comments to a mere 10 minutes, if one happens to be on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 12 members are listed to speak after me in this debate. Though Government members will be paraded through this place tonight, none of their names appear on the list that is before us. The document is irrelevant to them, as is shown by their attendance in this chamber. There is an audience in the public gallery that no doubt is wondering about the relevance of all of this. It is important for honourable members to ask-in a debate that is being conducted on this basis, well after the period in which the Budget was delivered, with a break having been called immediately after its delivery so that any continuity would be lost, the broadcasting of the Parliament largely confined to a radio station that most people cannot find-what purpose the Parliament serves. Questions were asked as to why quorums were being called today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I wanted to do and had planned to do in this Budget debate is to discuss, in the very limited amount of time available to me, some important questions about the area for which I carry responsibility, and that is immigration and ethnic affairs. The observations that I shall make are about the reasons why the Government is losing credibility day after day and why one of the areas in which the Government has held itself out to have some expertise increasingly is brought into question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Budget documents which are before the House-if we were able to consider them in a comprehensive and timely fashion-honourable members would have been interested to make certain observations as to what has been occurring over time. The Government claims that it is allocating additional resources now to deal with particular problems that have emerged in regard to the immigration program. They are problems relating to compliance. Significant numbers of people are remaining in this country illegally. Over many years the Government claimed that the figure was about 50,000 to 60,000 people-significant in itself. Recently, as these matters came under questioning by the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations and also by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of this Parliament, the Government reviewed the available statistics and came to the view that the numbers were of the order of 90,000, and has released certain information as to how it reached that figure. </PARA>
<PARA> The figure furnished by the Government did not include large numbers of people who are in Australia on other bases, which are equally irregular. One of those groups is the number of people who have applied for grant of residence status. There are some 30,000 of those. Another group is the 20,000 Chinese students the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said may now be given, permanently, temporary residency in Australia. Also there are a number of People's Republic of China nationals in Australia, post-Tiananmen Square, again of the order of 25,000, whose bona fides by way of the test that the Government has administered to those seeking to come here now would be brought into question. In other words, the expectation is that those people who were processed as part of the pipeline arrangements for looking at those who had previously applied and paid fees will be processed on much the same basis as they had been processed before. The further expectation is that they will breach the conditions of the visas that had been given to them and would have required them to leave Australia and return to their own countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Those statistics lead me to believe that in the order of 150,000 illegal immigrants are in this country. This is a significant problem. Why does the problem exist? Over time the number of people who have been charged with the task of ensuring compliance with our immigration laws has been reduced. One sees in the Budget documents that statements that have been made by Ministers suggesting that the numbers of people who will be charged with that task will be trebled cannot be verified. The documents that have been made available in another place to explain the Budget indicate that 42 additional staff will be allocated to that task. Yet Ministers' statements suggest that 150 people will be dealing with that effort. </PARA>
<PARA> The prospect of being able to examine these serious matters in any comprehensive way in a discussion on the Budget itself is extraordinarily limited. The opportunity of being able to address, for example, the decision taken on an ad hoc basis by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in relation to the Chinese students and its implications for the Budget cannot be properly availed of. There would have been substantial Budget savings if the Government had decided in relation to the Chinese students in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre that their circumstances would be examined case by case to determine whether they had bona fide claims for protection in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On such an examination many students may well have had claims that would have been upheld. But equally there would have been many students whose circumstances would not lead one to the view that they ought to have been able to remain here as bona fide and genuine refugees. Of the order of $50m or $60m will have to be paid for social security, Medicare, education and training expenses for Chinese students who, having been here at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre, were allowed to stay in Australia on this temporary basis. If the Government had properly allocated additional funds for case by case determination, the amount of money that would have had to be spent would have been insignificant by comparison. I raise these matters in the context of this debate because they are proper questions to be asked of the Minister who is responsible for the formulation of the Budget provisions relating to immigration and ethnic affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am asked to deal with these matters in the space of a mere 10 minutes, in a debate which, as I have commented in my introductory remarks, has little relevance to the matters that are really before this nation. In order to give my colleagues an opportunity to contribute to this debate, I will contain my remarks. I will take these issues up in the discussion of the Estimates when that opportunity arises. But it is pertinent to note that the program we have before us not only constrains discussion of the Budget but also constrains discussion of the Estimates. The expectation is that we will deal with those in the two remaining days left for debate this week, when this matter will then be put to a vote. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not occur in the other chamber, where a good deal more effort is put into dealing with these questions. I must say that I lament the way in which these questions are being dealt with. This Parliament is sitting a mere 37 or so days this year in accordance with the set program. It is the second shortest period of sitting in any one year since this Parliament was formed. There have been many years in which elections have occurred, but they have never constrained the Parliament's sitting in the way in which this Parliament has been constrained. I think there is some purpose behind that. I think that the Government sees the Parliament and the Budget process as being largely irrelevant. As a member of this Parliament for some 17 years, I lament that circumstance. </PARA>

<PARA> Conservative policies that provide and promote a resource mentality with simply some additional value-added products-toss in a bit of tourism-will not provide the economic viability to take this country through to the twenty-first century. We in Australia had the opportunity to begin restructuring in the early 1950s, as did other countries such as West Germany, Japan and, latterly, Korea, Taiwan and now even Thailand. We had the window of opportunity but we muffed it. Only fools get a third chance. To use an example of this, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation invented the transistor in the late 1940s. In 1951 the Menzies Government and the bureaucrats here in Canberra made the amazing statement that it would never replace the electronic valve. We had inventions such as navigation radar and colour wet photocopiers-the list goes on and on. This has been an innovative country. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that it is through this Government's policies that we have a second and, I suspect, last chance. The Budget surplus of $8.107 billion represents the fourth consecutive Budget surplus. This is unprecedented in Australia's history. It is a remarkable turnaround given that we inherited a Budget deficit of $9.6 billion from the previous uncaring and neglectful Government, whose leaders now get up and claim the need for a larger surplus and a smaller government sector. Why did this not occur during the reign of conservative governments? Why has the Opposition's attitude changed now? Nothing has changed except the election of this Government-a Labor government-which has a willingness to tackle the hard problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition says that we need to cut even deeper into government spending. But where would it cut spending? Would it be in the areas of employment, education, health, pensions, child-care or housing, to name just a few? Many people say that the Opposition has no policies but, of course, this is not true. It has one policy and only one: to rip off the weakest members in our community because it believes they are an easy target. How would the Opposition do it? It says it would abolish Medicare. That is an interesting point because only two countries in the developed world do not have a universal health system-South Africa and the United States of America. I understand that committees in the United States Congress are looking very seriously at the introduction of a universal health system for the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition says it would abolish the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, unemployment benefits, pensions and any other scheme that it could get away with; and that is not all. It would also abolish capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, the pensions assets test and introduce a broad-based consumption tax without giving any compensation to workers and pensioners for the extra tax that that would impose. So much for social justice. We should not be surprised. </PARA>
<PARA> That is how the present Opposition would manage the economy. It would create mayhem and chaos so the strong would get stronger and the weak would get weaker. This Labor Government has created order out of the mayhem which is the legacy it inherited from the Opposition as a result of the Opposition's perfunctory and supine mentality. People need the dignity and the purpose of employment. Since 1983 Labor's policies have created nearly 1.7 million jobs. This is four times the growth that occurred under the previous conservative Government and twice the growth of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Household incomes have, in fact, risen by 13 per cent under this Government. Not only has this Government created employment but it has also implemented fundamental changes in our education system to meet the challenge of becoming an internationally highly competitive work force. </PARA>
<PARA> By the end of 1993 this Labor Government will have created an additional 70,000 student places in higher education since 1988. We are now seeing 70 per cent of all students completing year 12. That is a very marked difference from the miserable 35 per cent completing year 12 when we came into office. Language and literacy programs will also receive funding of $145m this year. People want educational opportunities and job training and the Government has recognised that fact in this Budget and during the past seven years. We have more than a million students enrolled in technical and further education colleges-an increase from 800,000 students. We have more than 100,000 apprentices and traineeships in this country compared with the 35,000 that existed when we came to office. This Government also has a credible wages policy. From January 1991 personal tax cuts totalling $1.25 billion, representing an individual tax cut of $7.75, will be received by the average worker. Eighty per cent of workers now have award-based superannuation and, together with an additional 3 per cent to be negotiated next year, this will provide adequate financial security for retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of Port Adelaide prior to 1983 less than a miserable 18 per cent of people had access to superannuation. Although we have not yet reached the 80 per cent figure, we are well over the 70 per cent mark. The agreement in February this year between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions assumes that growth in average earnings will be around 7 per cent in 1990-91, with a consumer price index forecast of 6 per cent over the year ending June 1991. As a result of the accord, we have created a period of industrial stability, unlike the policies-or should I say the lack of policies-of the previous Government in the area of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme the Government has introduced the most far-reaching restructuring since the scheme was brought in. From November this year pensioners will pay a charge of $2.50 for each prescription up to a safety net. This will be offset by an increase in the pension payable on top of the normal pension increase. No pensioner will be worse off under this scheme-in fact, many pensioners will be better off. The introduction of the charge on prescriptions for pensioners will make the pharmaceutical benefits scheme more efficient and encourage more responsible use of medications. As an aside, during the last election campaign I was suffering from asthma and, as I had left my ventolin puffer at home, a local pensioner asked me to go into his house and said he would lend me one of his. He had about 4,000 to choose from; he had a linen cupboard full of them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other stories I heard during a recent stay in hospital-for example, about people who have funded overseas trips on the benefits of expensive drugs they have obtained from doctors. They have obtained money for their trips by selling those expensive drugs in Eastern Europe. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme has been abused and that abuse needs to be stopped because it is the ordinary taxpayer who has been paying for that abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The combination of the prescription charge and the education campaign amongst doctors, pharmacists, pensioners and other beneficiaries of the scheme should significantly reduce the unnecessary use of prescription drugs. This will cut growth in spending on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by about $1 billion in the next two years, ensure the continuity of the scheme for many years to come, and protect decent Australians who do not abuse the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The assessment of a pensioner's deposits over $2,000 at 10 per cent, or at the actual rate if it is higher than 10 per cent, will ensure pensioners will get a higher return on their savings, and about time. From July 1990, all full-rate pensioners were excluded from the taxation system and, with the indexation of the income text threshold from July 1991, there is no reason why pensioners should not maximise their income. It is better that pensioners get the benefit of their savings rather than the banks maximising their profits. All pensioners whose incomes exceed the income test fringe benefits limit directly as a result of this decision will retain their concessions indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> The key figure of the Budget is the reduction in growth of the current account deficit. Budget projections indicate a 7.5 per cent increase in exports and a 3 per cent decrease in imports. This means effectively a reduction in the current account deficit of around $3 billion and the deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio falling by over one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth spending is now at its lowest level as a proportion of GDP since 1974-that is some achievement-and in three years it will be down to the levels of the 1950s. The surplus of over $8 billion, which is slightly higher than last year, will ensure that this country continues its program of debt repayment, which occurred because our conservative friends on the other side of the chamber could not budget their pocket money, let alone the finances of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, over the seven Budgets handed down by this Government, unlike the Opposition we have never walked away from the hard decisions that need to be made for the benefit of ordinary Australians in this country. Might I add that we have done this with decency, credibility and compassion, which the Opposition has always lacked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week we have been debating the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, and the question I want to address tonight is how the Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for 1990-91 dealt with Australia's chronic economic problems-problems that we all face, the problems of foreign debt, high interest rates and inflation. All of these components affect each and every Australian. The simple answer is that it did not address these problems. This comes as little surprise to me, as historically the Treasurer's Budgets have never addressed such fundamentals. The 1990-91 Federal Budget will prove to be another inaccurate forecast reflecting tired, old hack Australian Labor Party policy. To put it simply, it was a fairy floss Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give an example of the inaccuracies of recent Budgets. In 1988-89, the Budget forecast for the current account deficit was an optimistic $9.5 billion, while the actual figure came in at almost double at $17.4 billion. The 1989-90 Budget resulted in another gross inaccuracy with regard to the current account deficit; the forecast $18.5 billion was well below the $20.7 billion actual deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation predictions were equally inaccurate. In 1989-90 the 7.7 per cent increase in the consumer price index, in the year to June, was well above the 7 per cent Budget forecast; while in 1988-89 the 4.5 per cent consumer price index forecast did not even come within a bull's roar of the actual figure of 7.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> With this track record, the 1990-91 Budget forecasts stand little chance of fruition. This year the Treasurer forecasts inflation falling to 6 per cent by the middle of next year, the current account deficit dropping to $18 billion and a predicted gross domestic product growth of 2 per cent. I might add that that 2 per cent will come entirely as forecast in the Budget from the export sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Considering the Budget's lack of innovative policy bought about by such factional disunity in the Labor Party, such predictions will again prove to be wide of the mark. Furthermore, the previous years of gross miscalculations relating to critical economic indicators have not had to contend with a Middle East crisis that now threatens global recession and rising inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, Australia is in no position to contend with such a looming crisis, and our foreign debt is testimony to that fact. The Budget failed to recognise the crucial role that reducing our foreign debt will and must play in Australia's economic recovery. Since 1983, our gross foreign debt has leapfrogged uncontrolled from $44 billion in 1984 to a shameful $156 billion to the end of March 1990. Never before has it been so high in the history of Australia. Members of the Labor Government will be recorded by history as the vandals who wrecked this lucky country. </PARA>
<PARA> Further testimony to Australia's debt crisis that we are all facing is the escalating level of bankruptcies. In the Treasurer's address on 21 August 1990, he stated that the Budget produced:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the kind of outcome the Government was seeking, delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. </PARA>
<PARA>Who is the Treasurer kidding? This statement provides little comfort to those 7,435 businesses that were bankrupted in 1989. In fact, every newspaper in the nation is now experiencing hikes in advertisements for the forced sale of houses and large and small businesses, all hurting because of the economic policies and the high interest rates that we all face. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Small Business Association claims that for every one recorded bankruptcy there are in fact four businesses that go to the wall. The figures, of course, that are not recorded cover those who get out of business and do not go into liquidation through a voluntarily closure of business or selling of their homes. Nevertheless they are hurting and hurting very badly. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of Labor's failed policies, Australia is facing a recession in private sector investment coupled with a slowing down in the world economy. Meanwhile, our good-time Charlie Treasurer is looking to sell off the back paddock to pay the bills. He knows he is in trouble but he will not admit it. Labor is raiding its long time piggy bank to the dismay of its left wing. The Commonwealth Bank, Australian Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd and now Telecom Australia are the Government-owned enterprises to go before the auctioneer's hammer. </PARA>
<PARA> In a blatant attempt to hedge responsibility for gross economic mismanagement, the Treasurer has called for an inquiry into interest rates. This prospect is laughable. He has squandered his chance and now he blames the banks. He blamed the business community today and everyone else but himself. It would be a shameful waste of resources for such an inquiry to be undertaken when the results are so self-evident. The banks, the people and this Government need no inquiry to determine why interest rates remain so high. Until this Government admits its high interest rates policy has failed, the private sector will continue down the path of recession; living standards will fall; the balance of payments and inflation will continue to worsen; and we will all be responsible for passing on to our children a lower standard of living than we have enjoyed ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Treasurer to ask average householders how they cope with their weekly grocery bills and their monthly bills. The Treasurer of this country has a shameful advantage over the treasurer of the family unit. He takes advantage of borrowing from foreign funds week after week, month after month, and year after year, pushing Australia closer to the brink of economic collapse. The householder cannot do as the Treasurer, who would do well to take lessons on how the average family, the average householder in Australia, balances his budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last week we have heard from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). She has accused the Opposition of not addressing the big issues concerning the environment. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and this House that the 1990-91 Federal Budget failed to address adequately these so-called big issues. Let me give an example. The costs of an environmental impact study are still considered capital costs and therefore are not tax deductable. If Labor were really serious about this environment, it would allow such impact studies to be considered legitimate tax deductions, rather than capital costs. </PARA>
<PARA> What incentives do investors have to plan an investment or to produce a comprehensive environmental impact study when they are considered capital costs? Furthermore, another environmental `big issue', the Hawke Government's election promise to support a 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, has fallen by the wayside. Labor's Budgets have sidestepped the environmental `big issues' for seven long years. Furthermore, its failed economic policies are set to continue to impact adversely on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Time tonight does not allow me to address further the issues that the Budget failed to address. There are many that affect the whole of Australia and impact very heavily on my electorate of Maranoa. But I can assure the House that the Budget brought down on 21 August will accelerate the population drift to the major capital cities. People will continue to drift because no incentive has been given to those who live in wealth creating areas of Australia, the provincial bush. The Budget has failed all Australians. The Treasurer lost a golden opportunity. With his first Budget since being re-elected for a term of three years, he had a golden opportunity to address these issues and get it right. The Treasurer said to the press after the Budget that Australia was a poor country. I say that Labor has made Australia a poor country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly tonight on the issue of bipartisanship in Aboriginal affairs. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) spoke in the House today and lauded the new-found feeling between the parties in as much as we were prepared to work for common goals. In this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1990-91, I take the opportunity to expand on how the Opposition sees bipartisanship in Aboriginal affairs and what it means to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To me bipartisanship means being prepared to take some of the heat out of the debate, being prepared to put some honesty into the debate, and looking at ways in which we can focus on what we have in common rather than on what divides us. Quite simply it means working to see where we have common goals and common ground. I am very pleased that the Minister looks forward to working with the Opposition over the life of the coming Parliament in this area, as I can say that I certainly look forward on behalf of the Opposition to working with him. However, there are several things that bipartisanship does not mean. It does not mean that we are simply going to agree to everything that the Government puts up and it does not mean that we are going to lock ourselves into a position that we find we are unable to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had many differences with the Government in the past on Aboriginal affairs, and I would hope that this new found sense of bipartisanship from the Government would mean that it is prepared to address the issues of concern to the Opposition as well as the Opposition being prepared to address the issues of concern to the Government. I would hope it would be sufficiently flexible to accept the fact that, even with the best of will and the best of intentions, there may be times when we simply are not able to support what the Government is doing and we will be doing that out of a belief that perhaps there is a better way of doing something and not because we are simply out to score political points. </PARA>
<PARA> In the letter of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), replying to the Prime Minister's request for a more bipartisan approach, the Leader of the Opposition made the position quite clear when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure you would understand, therefore, that we would not want a more bipartisan approach to limit us from criticising your Government so long as we perceive these issues as being inadequately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>What are those issues? They are the issues that marginalise Aboriginal people in Australian life: issues of education, health, and housing. They are the issues that tonight I am going to talk about in terms of the things that are really needed in the debate in Aboriginal affairs, that of goals, honesty and patience. </PARA>
<PARA> We need realistic goals with achievable outcomes. It sounds very simple, but they simply do not exist in Aboriginal affairs today. We need realistic goals that can be measured, with Aboriginal people having a stake in those goals, and a responsibility for seeing that they are achieved. We need goals set in the medium term-say over three to five years-and not a patchwork quilt of programs to address specific problems because short-term solutions to a long-term problem have consistently failed us in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a measure of honesty that quite simply is not in the present debate on Aboriginal affairs. We need intellectual honesty and political honesty. We need the simple intellectual honesty to have a look at what we are doing and realistically appraise whether we are making things better or worse. Quite frankly, what appals me as a I move around Aboriginal Australia is that it would appear that a lot of what we are doing is making things worse, yet we seem unable to honestly face that possibility. I will give an example. Virtually every report looking at the plight of Aboriginal people that I have been able to find has been very good as a descriptive report, very good at painting what is wrong, but very shallow when it comes to trying to offer some solution, save the usual grab bag of cliches, the foremost of which is land rights. </PARA>
<PARA> In all the debate on land rights, I have never once found any honest assessment as to whether what we are doing is making things better or worse. If we are to promote land rights, let us at least be honest as to why we are doing it and the reasons behind it and not pretend that it is going to solve a lot of problems that it is not. In the Northern Territory I have been moved to meet people who shifted to the Northern Territory with the express purpose of gaining land for Aborigines and who are now so disillusioned after seeing what that process has meant in terms of health and education, self-respect and dignity within those communities. </PARA>
<PARA> When I looked today for some serial health statistics on Aboriginal Australians to see what was happening over a period of time, I had great difficulty. A note came back to me from the Parliamentary Library today saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Regarding Aboriginal health statistics, unfortunately, as noted by some of the authors of the attached material, there is not a lot of trend data of the sort that would be useful to your purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>It is 1990 and we are not even able to say where we are coming from and where we hope to go. The only data I could find were for the Pitjantjatjara lands where, over a five-year period from 1981 to 1986, health statistics were examined. Over that period everything that had been done made not a jot of difference to the health of that community. It may be depressing but at least it allows us to realistically assess what we are doing to judge whether what we are doing is right, and perhaps we should then be honest enough with ourselves to admit that what we are doing might be making things worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The second type of honesty we need is political honesty. Aboriginal affairs is one of the most highly politicised areas in Australia today. It is pathetic to see the way Aboriginal people are manipulated by non-Aboriginal activists, whether they are conservationists trying to limit mining or development or community advisers trying to stop a breakaway land council because it seemed to be playing too much the tune of one political party. Today I received a letter from an Aboriginal man at Port Augusta. I will not mention his name because I do not think he wants it to be mentioned. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Michael,</PARA>
<PARA>Please find enclosed copies of letters that have been sent regarding a tourist resort in the Flinders Ranges. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the best opportunity the Aboriginal people of the Flinders Ranges have ever received. I hope that your parliamentary colleagues will support the development to proceed without any further unnecessary delays caused by the conservation groups. </PARA>
<PARA>We need some political honesty to reveal the real reasons for what we are doing. Is what we are doing benefiting Aboriginal people or are we merely playing to other people's agendas?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we need some patience. As I move around Australia meeting with Aboriginal people and Aboriginal communities there are beacons of hope on the horizon-places like Daly River, a community moving forward with hope and optimism, a community that would have to be one of the best Aboriginal communities in Australia in terms of providing services and opportunities to its people; and people like Herman and Mavis at Ipolera, a small outstation west of Hermannsburg. Herman is a traditional Aboriginal landowner whose land is the Gosse's Bluff area and whose vision of the future for his children, for his community, is education, opening up his land to all Australians and for tourism to provide a secure future for his people. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to places like Kakadu, where traditional landowners are training as park rangers, and Port Lincoln, a community that has gone through a process of reconciliation by identifying and overcoming the impediments to allowing Aboriginal people to take full part in community life. Another example is Moree, a town that has had a very bad name in race relations, but it does not deserve that reputation today. The shire council and the Aboriginal community have worked together and, over a number of years, resolved many of the problems that the community has faced. So there are great beacons of hope. They just require some patience. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of these aims of goal setting, intellectual and political honesty and patience I want to look at two recent events that are of particular concern to me. The first is the attempt by the people of south-east Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt to break away from the Northern Land Council. These people were offered the opportunity of determining their own future through a plebiscite. They voted two to one to break away from the Northern Land Council. I would have thought that any mug would have known that two to one was a majority. Yet they have been denied their own self-determination and the direction in which they want to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that the Minister can come up with all sorts of reasons and excuses. I am even prepared to give some of them credence. But if we are going to be honest both intellectually and politically and if we are going to have a sense of moving forward together between the parties, I would like to be convinced that the Minister is as determined as I am to see a group of people who voted two to one take account of their own affairs given the opportunity to do so. I would like to see the Minister being as outraged as I am that white advisers are running around collecting signatures and that a Labor Party senator from the Northern Territory, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), seems to have his grubby fingerprints everywhere over this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> A second issue is the national Aboriginal health strategy. Too often in Aboriginal affairs we paint rosy pictures, have great press releases and pretend we are going to fix the problem. Then nothing happens. Aboriginal health is just too serious to let this happen once again. At the time I complimented the Minister on a press release that he and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) put out on 10 June which said:</PARA>
<PARA>A meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and Health in Brisbane today agreed to implement the broad-based program to address the serious health problems afflicting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities. </PARA>
<PARA>This health strategy will represent the first time the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments and Aboriginal communities have joined forces to develop and target services for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. . . . . This strategy provides the framework to address these concerns and produce significant and long-term improvements for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>That is laudable. I looked for some funding in the Budget to set it up. There is nothing. The Budget is quiet. Once again we have hopes being raised but no practical help or rearranging of priorities to address what must be the most serious concern facing Australia today as far as Aboriginal affairs goes. We will judge the Minister and his commitment to bipartisanship by addressing these concerns and seeing something fair dinkum, something other than words, some practical program, to indicate that the lot of Aboriginal people will be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal people cannot continue to be marginalised in Australian society. They are a small part of our community and the community can choose to ignore their concerns. However, if we do that, then across Australia more and more communities will become like Walgett in New South Wales, where today the shops in the main streets have heavy cast iron grills facing the streets-like Northern Ireland-to protect the windows from being broken. That is what happens when there is anger that is not being addressed by the broader community. That is what happens when we raise expectations for a short term fix, knowing the problems can never be addressed without a long term commitment to change. </PARA>
<PARA> In our approach to Aboriginal affairs we will keep the Government up to the mark. We will expect our concerns to be addressed and we will seriously address the Government's concerns. We will judge the Government by how well it sets realistic and achievable goals, by how honest it is, both intellectually and politically, and by whether it has the patience to go forward and try to solve some of the problems facing Australia's Aboriginal people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) tonight, I want to say that the Federal Budget cannot ignore the financial activities of State governments. Two momentous events occurred in Western Australia earlier this month, September 1990. First, the well-known business tycoon Robert Holmes a Court died, and I take this opportunity to offer my condolences to the Holmes a Court family for the loss of a loved one. The second event was when the Chairman of the State Government Insurance Commission (SGIC) of Western Australia, Wyvern-or, as he is better known, Ollie-Rees announced that the Western Australian Government institution which he controlled had been obliged to write off approximately $250m worth of bad debts and bad investments, and consequently had a $117m trading loss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Wyvern, or Ollie, Rees was previously the failed manager of Cliffs Western Australia Mining Co. Pty Ltd at Robe River and was sacked as part of the program to reinstate that company to economic health. He was the manager who condoned the most outrageous work practices that ever existed throughout the Pilbara iron ore province-for example, giving as a crib to a train driver a week's supply of food for a family. Honourable members need not wonder how he became chairman of such a large government organisation as the SGIC. The Trades and Labour Council was determined to reward such an unfortunate ally and the Burke Government obliged. </PARA>
<PARA> To make sure that the influence of government in that new institution, the SGIC, was complete it then appointed another apparatchik in Mr Kevin Edwards, a now disgraced public servant who has been charged with certain offences in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the links between Holmes a Court, Rees, the SGIC and the Western Australian Labor Government that I wish to pursue tonight. Since his death Holmes a Court has been lauded throughout the media as an astute and able businessman of impeccable business morals. The Hawke Government sent a Minister to his funeral. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Holmes a Court was not in a general sense an astute business practitioner. He demonstrated remarkable skills in manipulating and ramping the stock market during a bull run. He clearly understood the lengths to which incumbent directors would go to defend their own power and influence and turned that to a profit. He well understood the financial markets and how to borrow money against the value of the shares whose value he had inflated by his on-market activities. It is interesting to note that his companies are still a debtor of Tricontinental Ltd. I am advised that during his heyday he owed that merchant bank in excess of $1,000m unsecured. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Holmes a Court failed on two fundamentals of business-his attention to management detail and, more importantly, the prudent business policy of balancing cash flow as well as assets against debt. He held huge holdings in such companies as BHP and Texaco but of course he failed in his attempts to take over those companies and control their cash flow. He was a shareholder, not a proprietor and, as such, very vulnerable to the inevitable downturn in the market. Consequently, the minute that that inevitability occurred and the bull run on the stock market converted to a bear run in October 1987, Holmes a Court's cash flow ceased, he had assets of declining value and insufficient money to pay the interest. As we all know, dividends do not equate to the interest. The financial wolves were at his door. Even his substantial non-performing property assets were subject to the value of a market where no business had the money to buy. Holmes a Court was technically insolvent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there was one investment that Holmes a Court made that stood him in good stead. Probably that investment alone earned him the reputation of being astute. That investment was his constant donations and support for the Australian Labor Party. It was $20,000 last year and I would estimate throughout his business career more like $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> In Holmes a Court's darkest hour the Labor Party activated in Western Australia its sleeper, Wyvern Rees, at the SGIC. In the next few months that institution paid Holmes a Court approximately $800m for assets that were either worthless or could have been purchased at much lower values at mortgagee auctions. The losses announced by the SGIC this month equate almost exactly to the Commission's purchase of worthless Bell shares and, even worse, convertible bonds from Holmes a Court. The value of these purchases alone was $160m for the shares plus $140m for the bonds. Added to this was the payment it made to him to buy $285m worth of BHP shares and $206m of city property in Perth which it later sold to Packer and Anderson for a greater sum but on 2 1/2-year terms. I doubt that it profited from that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also no coincidence that on his death Holmes a Court was reported to have a net worth of $800m-exactly the amount of money paid to him by the State Government Insurance Commission. Put simply, at the time of the October 1987 share market crash Holmes a Court called up his credits and the ALP delivered. He left with the money and the Western Australian public were left lamenting. Quite clearly, it is the Western Australian public who, through increased car insurance and workers compensation charges, will repay this debt. If the market in those commodities manages to control this sector they will pay through higher taxes as the State Government forgoes its dividends from this public investment. It has even suggested it may have to sell it. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Western Australia have nothing to thank Mr Holmes a Court for. His smooth extraction of almost $1 billion from the SGIC could be equated to the efforts of those celebrated cat burglars of the movies, with one exception. In this case the caretaker of the premises, Wyvern Rees, its Chairman, handed him the key, and the custodians of the wealth, namely, the then Premier, Brian Burke, and his senior Ministers, Parker, Berinson, Hill and Dowding, not only identified the masterpiece behind which the safe was hidden but handed over the combination and held the torch. It is beyond comprehension that this particular situation could have developed without the assistance of the Government and at the insistence of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter is worse. By the complaint of the Auditor-General these deals were badly documented. They represented a complete departure from the long-standing investment practices of the SGIC, even during the bull investment run. Up until the point that the SGIC commenced doing business with Holmes a Court it had held 70 per cent of its assets in fixed interest securities. It is amazing at the time when it found it good business to spend over $800m buying the assets of a single businessman in Perth that its net value was $60m. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparison, the deals the SGIC did with Connell and Bond paled into insignificance. Yet those two gentlemen attract the media focus. Today the SGIC is in conflict with Bond over the sale of those Bell shares. Bond did not buy the Bell shares from Holmes a Court-the SGIC did. It was only through decisions later of the Securities Commission that Bond was forced to make an offer for those shares. The SGIC was locked in; it had nowhere to go when Bond was forced to buy. He has been unable to pay and the shares have become worthless. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a simple means by which the Holmes a Court family could redeem Robert's reputation from that which more enlightened historians of the future will decree. They can give the money back. I am not talking about the entire $800m, just the true amount of the SGIC losses, which clearly are greater than those presently admitted. The opulent lifestyle of the Holmes a Courts, their race horses and their financial security have been guaranteed by the citizens of Western Australia. Surely now they could return, say, $300m, thus retaining $500m and relieving the financial burden of struggling low income families in our State. </PARA>
<PARA> But what of the Chairman of the SGIC-that Labor Party stool pigeon who presided over this disaster of bad management, if not corruption? Considering his management track record he should never have been appointed to the job. But now, as demanded in the editorials of both major Western Australian newspapers, he should be sacked. Ollie should not worry; his job is secure. He knows too much. As long as Carmen Lawrence continues her premiership of deceit and disavowal, just as long as the ALP remains in office in Western Australia and Canberra, just as long as there is no judicial inquiry into the machinations of WA Inc.-which I might add this Government here in Canberra could institute in the interests of discovering what happened to Western Australian voters' money-then he is safe. </PARA>
<PARA> I further add that inquiries were made in this Parliament of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) long before this disaster grew to this size. We asked the Treasurer what he might do about it. He did not want to know about it. Of course, he did know about it. After all, he is a mate of Warren Anderson. No one can tell me that Warren did not know what was going on. As long as all those situations occur Wyvern Rees is safe, and the financial affairs of the SGIC will continue a mystery that is protecting the careers of those corrupt Labor Ministers who participated. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say something else about this whole miserable affair. Joan Kirner in Victoria, at least having taken over from the disaster that was Cain, has decided on having a royal commission. She is going to let the people know how it all happened. Honourable members can rest assured that the name Holmes a Court and a few others will come up during that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia that will not happen. Having regard to the great amount of political experience that exists in this Parliament, is anyone prepared to tell me that, taking into account the huge pressure that this last representative of Labor in Western Australia, Dr Carmen Lawrence, is under, and who is as disgraceful and deceitful as the rest of them--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, or the Budget Bill as it is more commonly known, I think that my colleagues have more than adequately covered the shortcomings of the 1990-91 Budget. In fact, the terminology that has been used, `steady as she sinks', probably sums up the whole approach that the Government has taken to economic management. It shows that after seven years it really has run out of ideas and that, more seriously for all Australians, we are all paying a very high price. I suggest that that price is going to get even more horrific as the next 12 months pass. I dare say that many Australians are going to be very disillusioned as the failure of this 1990-91 Budget becomes apparent to all as it unfolds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will confine my remarks tonight to areas relating to the land transport portfolio. I start by raising a very simple question: After 7 1/2 years has there been an improvement? After 7 1/2 years are our roads any better than they were when this Government first came to power?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Dawson for his response. After 7 1/2 years have our railways improved? After 7 1/2 years are our motorists more satisfied and are our truckies feeling more confident about what is being done? By any measure, whatever one looks at, one will find that after 7 1/2 years this Government stands judged by its own record, and that is a very sorry record when it comes to the question of land transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems that the Government is being wracked by confusion. If we look at the comments that have been made by various Ministers and senior members of the Australian Labor Party in the last few weeks, we find that the confusion comes in so many different ways. We have the left wing calling for more funds for infrastructure from privatisation. It seems that to the left wing privatisation means getting a nice new source of money, a great big bag of money, to be spent on whatever pet project it has. It seems that infrastructure happens to be a concern that has suddenly come to the attention of members of the left wing. Therefore, they feel that that should be the way to do it. It seems that that is not a universal view. In fact, the chairman of the Caucus transport and communications committee, who is a member of the Centre Left, believes that certainly when it comes to road funding the Commonwealth spends too much money. He has made that statement publicly on a number of occasions. He would not want to say that to too many road users; I think they would find it rather difficult to live with that sort of approach. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, after seven years the need to tackle the problems of land transport is more urgent than has it has ever been before. In fact, the situation is desperate, and that is obvious when we look at the problems that are facing land transport-the inefficiencies, and the cost that this is imposing on so many people. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has finally realised after seven years that something needs to be done urgently. He wrote a confidential letter to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Our fourth term offers opportunities and carries an obligation to quicken the pace of reform. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We must create a rail system which offers effective competition to road transport, and which is more productive, integrated and reliable than at present. Pursuit of the national freight initiative should be a priority in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems that after seven years even the Prime Minister has suddenly woken up to the fact that all is not well. When we look at the matter, after seven years what really has been done? It is a lamentable case. Let us look first at what has been done for rail. I have here some figures which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. It shows how much concern the present Government has had for railways when it comes to capital investment. If we look at what occurred under the Fraser Government, we find that during its last three years it was allocating over $60m a year to rail investment. As soon as the Hawke Government came in, in its first year that was cut to $11m, in the following two years to $7m, then $5m, $3m and, in 1988-89 and 1989-90, it was cut to zero. It is a lamentable record and it is remarkable to think that the Prime Minister, after having cut right back in this area, has suddenly woken up to the fact that something is not right. He is now jumping up and down, writing to the Minister and saying that there should be some action. Many of the problems were more than obvious seven years ago and have only been exacerbated by the neglect of the current Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a push to set up a national rail freight corporation. The Opposition is very keen to see a move towards a national approach on rail freight and would see this move as a step in the right direction. However, it would seem that even in this tentative step, the Government is experiencing difficulties. At the Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting with his State counterparts the week before last, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) found that all he could do was to set up yet another committee. This really sums up the whole approach of this Government to land transport and to the reform which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) now seems to think is suddenly so urgent. This Government has spent less on rail transport than any government in the last 20 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The figures show that the present Government has cut back dramatically on the level of road funding. One measure of funding, that of public gross fixed capital expenditure, reveals that as a percentage of non-farm gross domestic product, the amount of funding going to roads is the lowest it has been in 10 years. The real, adjusted figures reveal that road transport expenditure, as a percentage of the fuel excise, has fallen from nearly 70 per cent in the last year of the Fraser Government to 26.8 per cent in the coming year. That is a drop to nearly one-third. It shows just how much the Government is now taking away from the motorist and how much it is putting into Consolidated Revenue compared with when it first came to office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A comparison of expenditure on roads reveals that, until 1990, the amount of money provided for road funding has fallen every year for the last six years. While the Government was increasing the amount of money it was taking through the fuel excise, it was reducing the amount of money going into roads. As I say, it is little wonder that, in terms of public gross fixed capital expenditure, the amount of money going back into roads is at the lowest level it has been for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's approach has been to await reports of committees. Yet another committee has been formed to investigate the subject of rail transport. There has been committee after committee on roads. We had one such committee in 1984 and in 1985 the Government pledged to do something. Nothing happened. Another committee was appointed. The Inter-State Commission reported in 1986, 1987 and again in 1990. The Inter-State Commission no longer exists, but a month ago the Commission reported yet again. Basically, what we are seeing is report after report after report. It almost sounds like school, which might be appropriate, considering the previous experiences of the Minister. Maybe he thinks he is going back to school. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent joint study by the Business Council of Australia and the Industry Commission revealed potential savings of more than $3 billion in transport costs for the nation. In terms of the consequent lift in output, that amount could be doubled. These are very significant figures. They show that rather than just talking, the Government needs to act. Reform of the transport system would result in an additional $2,000 in income for every household in Australia. The Government has delayed that reform for years with the repeated excuse that it has had to wait for reports from the various committees that have been set up to consider the matter. Put another way, the rise in real consumption would be three times as great as the benefits accruing from abolition of tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of this Government in the area of land transport is disappointing. The allocation in this Budget, although it is a small increase over last year, is still miserable. In the last seven years, the Government's attitude to railways has been bitterly disappointing. To date, its approach to reform has been to do nothing more than to appoint committee after committee and to continue to look at reports. At this stage the Government is on notice to show that it can, in fact, do something more than continue to talk about reform without ever actually delivering. If the Government's past record is any indication, regrettably, for the whole of Australia, rhetoric will not be matched by action. In the Australian Rural Times this week, transport expert Dr Peter Barnard of the National Farmers Federation said:</PARA>
<PARA>With few exceptions, Australia's transport system today is no better than it was eight years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>What more damning indictment could there be of the Government's performance than that comment by an expert in the field? This 1990-91 Budget will do remarkably little to address the problems that have been so obvious for all these years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I always enjoy speaking in the Budget debate. I was delighted to see the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) taking some of the medicine that he was delivering earlier. All honourable members know that the honourable member for the Northern Territory has his head in the clouds and his feet off the ground. He is one of the high fliers and big spenders of the Parliament. In fact, the last time I checked, the cost of a flight from Townsville to Tennant Creek had increased to $18,000. It is great to have the honourable member here-but then again it is not!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget that was presented three weeks ago is supposed to set the framework for a recovery in the Australian economy for the next 12 months. It seems to me that all Government members who have spoken in this debate have been prompted by the same person with the same message, that is, that everything is steady as she goes and this is a great Budget for recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> The underlying statistics and the record of the past have been inappropriately dealt with, with a severe disregard for the facts. I refer to one aspect. While I have been in the chamber three Government speakers have indicated that the Australian Labor Party, when it came to government, inherited a $9 billion deficit. Of course, that is not the truth. The 1983-84 Budget, which was presented by the present Treasurer (Mr Keating), projected a deficit of some $7.8 billion. I want to tell the people of Australia that that was the Treasurer's Budget. There was nothing inherited. It was the Treasurer's Budget to do with as he liked, and that was the result. This theme becomes a little repetitious, particularly when the facts are ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that this is a Budget of growth. Some of the growth is negative. There will be a growth in taxation in real terms. There will be a growth in expenditure in real terms, not of 0.6 per cent as the Treasurer indicates, but of 3.9 per cent. There will been a growth in the number of liquidations and bankruptcies. Recently I heard that this year the number of liquidations and bankruptcies increased by 36 per cent last year. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a growth in unemployment-a 24 per cent increase in unemployment benefits. When anybody tells us it is a growth Budget, we can agree in those respects. The Budget will produce outcomes which are not positive. They are very negative and they will produce current account deficits. We have had one member of the Government go to great lengths to say that the current account deficit is not the Government's responsibility, that the expanding foreign debt has nothing to do with it. I want to suggest that it has everything to do with the Government, given the fact that we are so uncompetitive in foreign markets and that we are faced with grave costs as far as the producers in this land are concerned. The burdens under which the producers of resources and manufactured goods labour are indeed Labor's responsibility, and the current account deficit has everything to do with it. The gross foreign debt increase has everything to do with the Budgets that have been the responsibility of the current Treasurer for the last eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> The products of this Budget would indicate that inflation rates, interest rates and our current account deficits are all going to be massively in excess of those of our trading competitors internationally. That is a major minus as far as Australian producers are concerned. This Budget continues the growth that I mentioned earlier; it continues these outcomes which leave us with an uncompetitive edge. Of course, we have only to look at the figures on net foreign debt. These facts have been repeated already in this debate. It took Australia 83 years from Federation to get to a net foreign debt of $22 billion. In the eight Budgets produced by this Treasurer, that debt had blown out to $125 billion as at 30 June 1990-an increase of almost six times just in that period of eight Budgets. Nobody can take any particular satisfaction from those figures. We in the Opposition certainly do not and neither do the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this Budget indicates that the Treasurer has finally failed his test. The framework that the Budget should have provided for will not allow this economy to recover during the next 12 months. Already some of the factors that it was built on are coming apart. As evidence that the Budget is coming apart we see the Treasurer's more recent attack on the bankers, blaming them for the interest rates. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said here today that the banks should take heed of what the Treasurer is asking them on bended knee to do: Reduce your interest rates. Everybody in Australia knows that the interest rates are a direct reflection of what the Treasurer has imposed through the Reserve Bank of Australia. It is certainly a very regulated interest rate. Foreign exchange is also regulated through the interest rate. For that we can only blame the Treasurer and this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw the headline in the Australian today: `Keating scorns bosses lack of leadership'. Again, it was an attack on the Business Council of Australia for its failure to show leadership when it has been crucified by eight Budgets from Treasurer Keating. We have also had within the last month the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions threatening to break the accord by going out on strike if he does not get his own way. More recently, he has said that he is not going to accept the proposed merger or sale or privatisation of Telecom. We also see that oil prices have risen right through the barrier that the Treasurer set for the inflation price. When we look at the whole picture, the Treasurer has failed the test and the Business Council knows it, the bankers of Australia know it and the people of Australia know it. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget will bring into account the fourth successive Budget surplus, which on my figures will amount to $24.1 billion. Again, a great deal of play is made of this being the first time such a surplus has been shown. The people of Australia ought to go back and look at the first four Keating Budgets in which he provided a record-never referred to-of a $23 billion deficit and a national debt that is only now being repaid. If this Budget comes in on target, the Treasurer can take credit for accumulating $1 billion net in surplus over eight Budgets. I do not think that is anything to crow about, but those are the facts as presented by the Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a suggestion right throughout this debate that there is no alternative. I would like to say that, just a couple of days after the Budget presentation, we heard from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) an alternative Budget based very much on positive policies that would return the economy of Australia to its proper footing. Government members should appreciate that it is part of a package. I think it is very important that this blueprint be part of a package, and I want to mention some of these factors. </PARA>
<PARA> A decision has been made-I would say a courageous decision-to adopt a goods and services tax and at the same time to ensure the elimination of the wholesale sales tax, to provide for some reduction in the petrol excises, and to reduce personal income taxes. Quite contrary to the untruth put by the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), there is built into the package a compensation for low income earners and pensioners. When we talk about guts, there was one Treasurer of this country who did not have the guts to proceed with what he thought should have happened five years ago. We have taken that decision. Privatisation of Commonwealth businesses and exposure of those businesses to competition are peculiar only to the coalition. Everything else that has been done in the meantime in relation to privatisation and the State Bank of Victoria, the Commonwealth Bank and so on does not measure up in any way to the positive policy we have in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> We can talk about reduction of Commonwealth expenditure. During the last election we said we were prepared to take off the Forward Estimates the figure of $2.7 billion. This Budget provides only $350m scaling down, an insignificant amount compared with the way the issue should be treated. Reform of the centralised wage fixing system, the factor that more than anything else makes Australians uncompetitive on the foreign market, has been part of our policy for the last two elections. There will be reform of the transport and waterfront industries that will reduce the costs to exporters by some billions of dollars, and that will be a boost to the exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> The other policy adopted within the last three weeks is the virtual elimination of tariffs by the year 2000. There is an alternative; it is a pity we have to wait so long to get that alternative introduced. When one talks about a mandate from the last election, it is interesting to note that the coalition won 43 per cent of the vote as against 38 per cent by Labor. On a two-party preferred basis, we were 60,000 votes ahead of Labor, and yet we languished under what is probably a Federal gerrymander very much in favour of Labor. </PARA>
<PARA> There are positive policies and I speak in support of those positive policies. I ask that when the Labor Party needles its parliamentarians in the future, it put a bit of truth serum in the elixir. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) will go down in history as a Budget of lost opportunities. The beginning of a new parliamentary term and the beginning of a new decade have presented the Treasurer with a golden opportunity to undertake the sweeping reforms which our economy so desperately needs. By ignoring this opportunity the Treasurer has failed. Not only has he failed, but he has also shown neither leadership nor initiative. He looked tired and bored. His Budget set no agenda for the Government, neither for the coming year nor for his term in office. Indeed, the key issues were relegated to the sidelines or were not given any consideration at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The media comment on the Budget ranged from the boring to the critical. The editorial in the Melbourne Age was headed `Hanging in with hope'. The Courier-Mail said it was `a Budget short on inspiration'. `Keating falls short of his own standards' led the Australian Financial Review. `A Budget that delivers more of the same' was the West Australian editorial. `It's grit your teeth and hang in there for commerce', according to the Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget does nothing to increase productivity, offers no solution to our balance of payments problems and does not address the issue of micro-economic reform. The Budget makes a brief reference to the ramshackle wholesale sales tax system but offers no solution. Most importantly, it does not offer any hope for a sustainable fall in interest rates. Indeed, this Budget does not make any hard decisions at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely our economic situation demands substantial reform; yet, as the economy slides further into recession, as more businesses move into bankruptcy and as more farmers struggle to make a living, the Government has not had the courage to make the decisions to put our economy back on the right track. </PARA>
<PARA> Budget outlays for 1990-91 will be around $93 billion. This will rise to around $97 billion in 1991-92. Treasurer Keating expects the Budget surplus to come in at around $8.1 billion. However, his record on predictions is not all that good. In last year's Budget, the Treasurer predicted a surplus of $9.1 billion while the actual figure was $8.4 billion-some $700m lower than predicted. The Treasurer accounted for the lower than expected figure by pointing to reductions in provisional and sales tax revenues-the result of a slowing economy, deliberately brought about by his own policies. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Treasurer, this year's surplus has been achieved by a combination of high tax revenues and expenditure restraint. However, this expenditure restraint is largely illusory and comes from a shuffling of debt between the Commonwealth and the States. This movement of debt onto the States could in fact be inflationary if the States increase charges rather than cut expenditure and services. </PARA>
<PARA> Other savings measures, including social security and pharmaceutical benefits reform, generally do not come into effect until midway through next year. If the proceeds from the sale of assets, the Commonwealth-State fiddle and the additional profit from government instrumentalities are excluded, the surplus is little more than $6 billion. Even this could be optimistic. As the economy slides further into recession, revenue will decline and associated expenditure in the social security area will increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's forecast for inflation for this financial year is 6 per cent. With inflation currently running at over 8 per cent, the Treasurer is predicting a reduction of 2 per cent over the financial year. However, given the Treasurer's record on predicting inflation rates, I have my doubts about whether we will ever see 7 per cent, much less actually reach the 6 per cent he has forecast. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer also predicts a growth in gross domestic product of about 2 per cent. Once again, I doubt whether this will be achievable. As we slide further into recession, the productive capacity of the private sector will continue to weaken. Business investment will also continue to decline. Indeed, over the last financial year business investment declined by a massive 16.6 per cent. The world economy is also flattening, which will impact on our exports and, in particular, our commodity exports. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to my own portfolio, there were two main changes. In the housing area, the first home owners scheme was abolished and funding and responsibility for the administration of the scheme was devolved to the States. I have no problem with the principle of this initiative as the scheme had not been working successfully for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been consistently tightening eligibility, the threshold levels were unrealistic and expenditure has dropped over a number of years. In addition, the scheme offered uniform grants to home buyers and, as such, did not take the regional variation in the supply and cost of homes into account. However, I am concerned that only half the funding currently allocated to the first home owners scheme will be given to the States. The rest will go into Consolidated Revenue. The money that would otherwise be going to low income first home buyers, to families purchasing their own homes, will now be going straight into the Treasurer's coffers. </PARA>
<PARA> Examination of the Budget Papers reveals that savings resulting from the abolition of the first home owners scheme will be $33.4m in 1990-91 and $6l.8m in 1991-92. Funding to be given to the States for home purchase assistance will be $14m in 1990-91 and $30m in 1991-92. Guidelines for administering the scheme have not yet been formulated, much less distributed to the States. In addition, there is no formula in place for determining how the funding is to be allocated between the States. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is small business which I consider was most hard done by in the Budget, although, to be fair, it did receive some relief. Small businesses with a sales tax bill of less than $50,000 will be able to remit their sales tax quarterly instead of monthly. There is, of course, a catch. Small businesses must wait until 1 August 1991-a full 12 months away-before they can take advantage of this token gesture. What happens in the meantime to those struggling small businesses who fall outside the threshold?</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the growing number of business bankruptcies indicates just how critical the situation is. In the April to June quarter, small business bankruptcies increased nationally by a huge 26 per cent, from 2,260 to 2,719. In my home State of Western Australia, the situation was even worse, with the number of bankruptcies increasing a massive 56 per cent over the same period. In the 1989-90 financial year, national bankruptcies increased 11 per cent, from 8,230 to 9,131. In Western Australia, bankruptcies were up 34 per cent on the previous financial year. It must be remembered that these figures do not tell the full story as they do not include the significant number of small business proprietors who just close up and walk away. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just run through a few of the burdens facing small business. Firstly, as regards interest rates, in spite of the one percentage point reduction in cash rates recently announced by the Reserve Bank of Australia, small business is still paying a prime rate of between 17 per cent and 18 per cent. Additional charges and loadings can take this up to 22 per cent depending on the bank. To compound this, there have been some concerns that, given the high number of corporate failures, banks are becoming stringent in their lending and in providing overdraft and credit facilities to small business. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards the training levy, as from 1 July 1990 all businesses with payrolls over $200,000 or around five employees must spend one per cent of their payroll on training. What they do not spend on training must be paid to the Government as a levy-effectively, an additional tax. The training levy will rise to 1 per cent of payrolls next year. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated in a Westpac Banking Corporation discussion paper that the collective cost of business regulation is between $23 billion and $47 billion per annum, or between 9 and 19 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of company tax, from 1 July 1990 companies have had to pay 85 per cent of their tax bill by 28 July with the remaining 15 per cent due by 15 March the following year. In doing this, the Government has effectively brought forward the payment of income tax by nine months. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many problems facing the small business sector that in the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on small business in Australia, known as the Beddall report, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) made 66 recommendations to help small business. His report was considered a most damning criticisms of Government policy. But have we seen any changes in Government policy? No, we have not. This year's Budget included only one of the recommendations outlined in the Beddall report. Of the 66 recommendations contained in the report, the Government adopted only one. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this token gesture to small business, the Government has undermined the contribution that small business makes to our economy and has completely disregarded the increasing number of small businesses forced into bankruptcy. The Government has sent a clear message to small business saying, `We do not care'. The failure of the Government to adequately address the recommendations made in the Minister's report also represents a huge failure of the Minister and leaves his credibility in shreds. </PARA>
<PARA> Only the coalition is concerned about the plight of small business. We will remove the barriers to small business growth and let them get out and make a quid. We will overhaul the tax system to give small business the incentive to work and invest. We will allow small business employers and employees to enter into enterprise agreements that suit both parties. These initiatives, along with other micro-economic reforms, including deregulation and privatisation, will remove the shackles that presently inhibit the success of the small business sector. Because we do not have to pander to the looney Left and to the trade unions, small business knows that we have the capacity to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this was a nothing Budget. It was yet another lost opportunity for a government which has clearly lost its way. </PARA>

I rise tonight to support the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) in his call for a joint select committee to be known as the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. I have a great respect for my learned colleague and fully support his call for that Joint Select Committee. There are some who would even say that possibly his motion calling for the establishment of the committee is not sufficiently far-reaching to echo community concerns about the present system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset I should say that I have no wish to return to the days of the Matrimonial Causes Act, which was biased in its philosophies and draconian in its implementation. The Family Law Act, however, must deliver in two areas, the first and foremost being the continuation of the premise that the welfare of children is of paramount concern. The second important area in which the Family Law Act must deliver, and this is really the basis on which it should operate, is the strengthening of the family as the single most important social and economic unit in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent years there has been considerable community concern over various amendments to the Family Law Act. I am sure they were not intentionally designed to do so, but potentially they threaten the survival of the family unit. Some 99 per cent of married couples readily admit that at some time during their married life there have been arguments and strains have been placed on their relationship. I suspect that the one per cent who deny it probably spend little time at home. </PARA>
<PARA> It causes me great concern that if a couple have a serious argument at 10 o'clock at night, one or other party can be at the office of the solicitor by 8.30 the next morning and, depending on the efficiency of the solicitor, an application for property settlement can be filed with the Family Court by 10 o'clock that morning. That is not giving the family unit a chance to stay together. </PARA>
<PARA> The ability of the system to deliver appropriate resolution and counselling services is all but destroyed by that stage because money has entered the scenario, and unfortunately yet another family has then lurched into the custody, cum maintenance, cum property settlement, cum divorce cycle. Provided that there are adequate maintenance proceedings, I can envisage only very few situations where any couple or partner would require an urgent property settlement within that time frame. However, the present law potentially can deliver a property settlement before the question of final custody has been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> A large number of people are very much in favour of the previous law whereby a property settlement application could not be issued inside 12 months of separation. They would like to see the Act amended to revert to that situation, with a further proviso that property proceedings could be issued prior to this time, but only with the leave of the Family Court and in the most urgent circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this extra proviso would safeguard those situations where an early property settlement was imperative. Once money and property division become the focus of the separation, in my view the chances of reconciliation are virtually defunct and the marriage could not be saved by even the most effective counselling. I congratulate the Government on its moves in relation to counselling services. </PARA>
<PARA> This Act must provide a system that implements a family justice system, with justice being available to both the protagonists and the children. Also, there is considerable community concern that the present Child Support Act is failing to deliver. In some cases it is a system that discourages maintenance support, as opposed to encouraging it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not advocate a return to the misery that occurred under the Matrimonial Causes Act but I am concerned that certain elements in this country are anti-family and treat with contempt the importance of its survival for this country. There is no doubt that the significant drains at present on the public purse are in no small part due to the so-called visions of 1975. I fully agree with the comments made last week by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), and I hope I do not misinterpret his comments. Effectively he said that the vision of 1975 does not reflect the realities of 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I drew the attention of the House to the fact that Brisbane senior citizens who are part pensioners are getting a raw deal from the Brisbane City Council in that they are not being provided with the same rate rebate that is afforded to their counterparts in other major cities throughout Australia. That is happening in spite of the fact that the Brisbane City Council has the largest municipality in the country and a budget equal to that of the State of Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mentioned also the propensity of the Lord Mayor of Brisbane to travel overseas. In fact she has travelled overseas more often than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the past 12 months. Therefore it was not a total surprise to me this morning to walk into my office and see on the front page of the Australian a photograph of the Brisbane Lord Mayor in Tokyo, evidently as part of Australia's bid for the Olympic Games. I then looked at the Courier-Mail and found a similar photograph on page 2. Evidently the Brisbane Lord Mayor felt it necessary to leave the country as part of that national delegation to Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister made clear in this place earlier in the week, the Government is committed to the bid for the Olympics, which I understand from the late news was unsuccessful. Nonetheless the Government, and the Opposition also, were committed to that task. </PARA>
<PARA> In no way do I cast aspersions on the efforts of Melbourne, Victoria and the nation to secure the 1996 Olympics. However, I do object strongly to a lord mayor and an administration of the Brisbane City Council that punishes ratepayers who are part pensioners and hold benefit cards but receive not 1c of consideration from the Brisbane City Council which has a lord mayor with a propensity to travel more often than the Prime Minister of this country. That position is simply untenable. It is high time the Brisbane City Council gave priority to providing services to those who pay the rates and that those who are part pensioners in Brisbane received the same consideration in regard to rate payments as do their counterparts in Sydney, Melbourne and elsewhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough for the Lord Mayor of Brisbane to travel the world as an advocate of various other causes. That view is not mine alone. In fact it is a view that she herself was reported to have expressed at the time when Brisbane lost its bid to be the Australian host for the Olympic Games. The Melbourne Herald of 18 November 1988, speaking of Alderman Atkinson, reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>The . . . Lord Mayor said she was reluctant to offer Melbourne advice on taking its case to the International Selection Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA>But, `I will be quite happy to talk to Melbourne organisers about their bid, as long as they come up here and I don't have to go to Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>At that stage she was not about to travel to Melbourne, but since then she has seen her way clear to travel to Japan. The Brisbane Courier-Mail had this to say on the same day:</PARA>
<PARA>And let it be known now that if Melbourne has any thoughts of exploiting her siren-like hold on the affections of International Olympic Committee members by enlisting her as its roving Olympic ambassador, it should immediately forget them. </PARA>
<PARA> `We'll get behind Melbourne, but there is no way I'll be used like that. I have a city to run and a family to look after. </PARA>
<PARA>I concur with the views and statements made in November 1988 by the Lord Mayor. I call upon her and her council to ensure that those commitments she made in 1988 are in fact honoured and that the people of Brisbane, particularly the pensioners who are suffering because of unreasonable determinations on rates, are given some priority in the immediate future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter with the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), which he might refer to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). I refer to an article, which appeared on page 28 of the Melbourne Sun of Monday, 17 September regarding the Federal Government's attempts to purchase the V-Line rail operations in Victoria. Apparently the Federal Government has been carrying out secret negotiations to hand over the country passenger and freight services to the federally controlled Australian National Railways. I believe that this would be detrimental, for it could cause a reduction of services and line closures in country Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These secret negotiations have been going on for some time. I understand that they are well advanced and the Federal Government looks as though it is going to acquire billions of dollars of State-owned assets in the form of land, buildings and rolling stock which will become the property of the Commonwealth Government under this deal. It will also mean that the Public Transport Corporation, the ministry officials and the national railways are close to reaching an agreement on this deal without any public consultation of any kind. It is all happening behind closed doors. </PARA>
<PARA> This handover of V-Line could occur at about the same time as the National Rail Freight Corporation is expected to start operations. I ask the Minister at the table to refer this matter to the Minister for Land Transport and urge him to have consultations with Victorian transport users before a final decision is reached on this matter. Perhaps the Minister for Land Transport could relay to me what price is to be paid for those assets of the line, which entails quite an amount of land in stock in Victoria and particularly throughout country areas of Victoria. I really question the motivation of this move as to whether it is, in fact, another matter of bailing out the bankrupt Victorian Labor Government, as was the case in the Commonwealth-State Bank deal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As 9,800 of my constituents were born in the Middle East and a further 7,100 of them have parents who were born there, it is perhaps understandable that I would rise to express concern about the growth of racism which is particularly ill-informed in relation to the Arabic speaking community in Australia as a result of Australia's intervention in the Middle East. I say that it is ill-informed because many of the newspaper proprietors and radio commentators initially singled out the Iraqi community, little knowing that most Iraqis in Australia tend to come from groups that would be dissident groups in Iraq. These groups include the Assyrians, who were subject to a series of massacres, including the infamous 1933 situation in Simel where 300 men, women and children were killed. This group also had close associations with British mandate authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is perhaps ironic that these people have been singled out because their two claims to fame in the Sydney newspapers over the last decade have concerned intense religious conflict over property and the fact that their main club, the Nineveh club, a few years ago actually banned people who had the audacity to wear pro-Hussein badges in the club. That is one group that has been singled out by an ill-informed and screeching media. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major source of Iraqi residents in Australia is, of course, the Kurdish community. Of the eight to 10 million Kurds living in Turkey, Syria and Iraq, two million reside in Iraq. Once again this group has not been a source of particular support for the Hussein regime. In fact, the most active role of those on the far left of Iraqi politics who identified with the Kurdish cause has been to use this crisis to call for the overthrow of that Government and for elections in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, another very large Iraqi component in Australia comprises a number of people who served in the armed forces in the British levies in the mandate period and who, once nationalisation of the oil industry occurred in 1961, moved to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There are forces within the Arabic community in this country who, for a variety of reasons, have sympathy with Hussein's move into Kuwait. There are those people who adhere to the Baathist party ideology of a Pan-Arab state and who believe that the variety of kingdoms, dictatorships and military juntas in the Middle East do not have a concept of Arabism. There are the supporters of General Aoun and the Maronite forces in Lebanon who have been aided militarily by Iraq for a number of years. There are a number of people who believe that, until his opportunist move to become the No.1 Islamic extremist, Hussein was one of the more secular leaders in the Middle East, as he represented an alternative to fundamentalism. Of course, there is a group of people concerned with Israel's role in the Middle East and who see Hussein, and Iraq, as a major force against Israel. So a variety of people in Australia, admittedly for very different reasons, have come together to say that they have some respect for Iraq's role in that region. </PARA>
<PARA> I must express concern at those elements in the media who have used the situation to arouse ill-informed attacks on Iraqi people in this country. School children have been attacked in school grounds. Radio commentators are saying that people should go back overseas. I respect the right of these people to dissent. I respect the right of these people to differ with this Government's views because if we do not respect that right we have a precedent for the Stalinist type forced movement of large numbers of Crimean Tartars, Volga Germans and others on racial grounds. We have seen the situation where Japanese people in California during the Second World War were interned while their sons fought in the United States armed forces. In our own country there were internments and discrimination during the war. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that, whilst no parallel can be drawn at this stage, we must be on our guard to ensure that this current situation is not used to fan those sorts of flames. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity to record in Hansard one of the most remarkable stories ever told to me. It is a story that I can verify as being true. To ensure its accuracy I made a point of meeting with and hearing it first hand from Roy McLean, one of the main participants in the incident which I will describe shortly. I also had Roy document the events and send this to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Roy McLean will be familiar to a number of honourable members in this chamber for his fine exploits back in the 1950s as a No. 4 or 5 batsman for South Africa. I believe he played in 40 tests and had an average of over 30, including five test centuries. The incident to which I refer took place in November 1952 after the South African cricket team had arrived in Perth to start its tour of Australia. As with most tours, the first match consisted of a warm-up game against the Governor-General's XI at the University of Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> Roy McLean and Ken Viljoen, who was the manager of the Springbok cricket team, were walking through the grounds of the local university. Quite nearby a student was accompanying a horse-drawn wagon or cart and shovelling manure from the cart onto the rose gardens. Apparently he was doing this to earn some extra money in order to go to Oxford University. Suddenly, the horse started forward, jamming the student's leg between a wagon wheel and a fence post. As Roy McLean told the story to me, it appeared from where they were that the student was in considerable pain and difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> Both Roy McLean and Ken Viljoen ran across the field to offer assistance to the student, who had suffered a deep wound on the inside of his left leg between his thigh and his knee. The bone was showing and the wound was bleeding profusely. To stem the flow of blood, Roy McLean tore off his shirt and tied it around the student's upper leg while waiting for the ambulance which they had summoned to take the student to hospital. At the time a number of people thought the situation was touch and go. </PARA>
<PARA> The following day both Roy McLean and Ken Viljoen visited this student in hospital to inquire after his state of health which, at that stage, was clearly improving. Although it is almost 38 years since this incident took place, no doubt a sizeable scar would still be visible today. As I have indicated, the student survived, ended up winning a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, and, as fate would have it, was at the university some three years later in June 1955 when the South African cricket team was next touring Britain. </PARA>
<PARA> During their match at Oxford University, this Australian student made a point of contacting Roy McLean to thank him for the efforts which had apparently saved his life. Although I did not hear it from Roy McLean himself, it was relayed to me by a prominent Australian that Roy and the student kept in touch or at least exchanged Christmas cards until some years ago. I can believe this to be the case as I know that the student himself was a keen cricketer and would no doubt have been an ardent admirer of the considerable cricketing talents of someone like Roy McLean. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular relevance of this story takes on a sharper focus, I believe you will agree, Mr Speaker, when I tell you that the student to whom I am referring went on to become the twenty-fourth Prime Minister of Australia in March 1983. When that event occurred, Roy McLean told me he wrote a letter to Bob Hawke congratulating him on the momentous occasion. Regrettably, that letter never received a response, which was a matter of great disappointment to Roy McLean. </PARA>

It would, of course, negate much of the intended impact of the Prime Minister's affected stance on this matter for his followers to learn that he owes his life to the swift action and kindness of two white South Africans all those years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Understandable. Mr Speaker, the Commonwealth Department of Finance is regarded with fear and awe by most departments and their Ministers. The Department has a reputation for rigour and absolute thoroughness and a capacity for finding even the most minute fudging in estimates of departments it examines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The events of the last week, concluding with the appalling decision by Cabinet to locate the headquarters of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) in Canberra-an absolute reversal of the decision of November 1989 and a total breach of faith with the people of Newcastle-have given me very strong reasons to examine in some detail the performance of this much vaunted Department. </PARA>
<PARA> This was necessary because the Department of Transport and Communications maintains that the Department of Finance has validated its estimates, which show the cost of establishing AMSA in Newcastle growing from $7.3m in November 1989, to $11m in April 1990, to $15.7m in August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the estimates for establishing in Canberra have increased from $1.32m in late 1989 to $2.136m now. The Department of Finance advised its Minister and the Cabinet that it had greater confidence in the accuracy of these latter figures than the earlier ones. The fact is that the Department of Finance is either as incompetent or as deliberately misleading as I am certain the Department of Transport and Communications is. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a pretty serious conclusion but it is based on the following: the Department of Transport and Communications now concedes that it is at least 33 persons understaffed for the formation of AMSA. The recruitment cost to fill this deficiency, the Department now estimates, would cost AMSA $450,000-a figure which I suggest could more than double. This cost has not been incorporated in the estimates for the establishment of AMSA in Canberra that were provided to Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures provided by the Departments of Transport and Communications and Finance surprised me because they appeared to incorporate a double rental component. The Department of Transport and Communications in discussions last week conceded that this is correct and that it had known about it for some weeks. Both that Department and the Department of Finance made a simple error of $700,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport and Communications based some of its estimates on the compulsory and voluntary transfer of staff, 70 of whom would not be compulsory. The Department applied the full Public Service mobility allowance against the whole 70, while knowing that the allowance was available only for those promoted unless there were special grounds in the public interest. I do not believe such grounds exist and there are not sufficient positions for all of them to be promoted. </PARA>
<PARA> The value of the fit-out of the existing offices used by the Department at Belconnen I understand cost $500,000 last year and they are Government property at this point in time. At the vesting of AMSA the fit-out would become the property of the tenant, apparently at no cost. Also, the expenditure for expanding the fit-out to incorporate the corporate section and the board section has not been costed. I suggest the cost is probably close to another $500,000. </PARA>
<PARA> So the establishment costs of AMSA, supposedly reliable, in Canberra at $2.136m is out by at least $1.5m-probably more but at least by 70 per cent. A similar exaggeration occurs in the cost to Newcastle of between $2m and $6m. All of these figures have been validated by the Department of Finance and its view wrongly accepted by Cabinet Ministers as objective, thorough and totally professional. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members can draw their own conclusions on whether the Department of Finance is incompetent or part of a campaign of collaboration, which includes the Opposition, which has had more information than the Cabinet has had on this issue for the past 10 months. The Government must support the call by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) for an independent inquiry and, until that is held, there is a great shadow over both those departments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the House tonight on the matter of the United Nations World Summit for Children. Our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made much of his claim that no child shall live in poverty but has declared himself unavailable to attend such an important summit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This historic summit has been sponsored by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as an historic opportunity for world leaders to make children's well-being a priority on each of their country's political, economic and social agendas. Yet it would appear that the Prime Minister of Australia is too occupied with key domestic issues around the time of the summit to join the other world leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are the Prime Minister's priorities? Is it really just a coincidence that the Australian Football League's grand final was due to be played on that day? Now that the grand final has been postponed to the weekend of 6 October, will the Prime Minister find time in his busy schedule to fly to New York for those few days of the world summit?</PARA>
<PARA> The summit is the first of its kind-a two-day, one-off international event that will see many heads of state and government come together to discuss the plight of the world's children. The latest United Nations figures indicate that some 38 presidents, 20 prime ministers and two kings have confirmed that they will participate in what will be a perfect opportunity to show real and genuine concern for the future of children throughout the world. I should have thought that Mr Bush, Mrs Thatcher and Mr Gorbachev all have rather pressing domestic issues at the moment. Perhaps they are more in touch or is it just that their concerns are more than just empty words?</PARA>
<PARA> Millions of children die each year, not just because of malnutrition but because of preventable diseases. We take the immunisation of our own children so much for granted. There are no maternal child-care centres in many countries, let alone the immunisation programs which we in this country accept as normal. </PARA>
<PARA> If the current trend continues, more than 100 million children will die from illness and malnutrition in the 1990s. They will not be victims of any unexpected natural disaster. They will die little noticed by the world. These children will die of diseases which were once common place in the industrialised nations-dehydration, pneumonia, polio, tetanus, measles and whooping cough, names we know so well and all so relatively easy and inexpensive to prevent or treat. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that the cost of delivering the prevention programs is not to be sneezed at but I find it extremely difficult to accept that the world cannot afford to prevent the deaths and malnutrition of so many of its young children. It is within our power to inoculate all the children in the world against the six killer diseases that smite young lives for the cost of what the developing world pays in one week to service its debts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate here to reply to those sceptics who would have us believe that there are already too many children in the world and that infant mortality is natural population control. This argument lacks credence. There is evidence to show that assuring child survival is a certain way to lower population growth. Contradictory you say? Not really. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 23 August 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Will the progeny of the sheep and goats imported from the US in 1984 be released from quarantine; if so, (a) when, (b) approximately how many of each breed are likely to be released and (c) if the date is not the original release date, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) With respect to goat embryos from Zimbabwe now in quarantine in New Zealand, (a) when did they leave Zimbabwe, (b) where did they go, (c) when will the progeny of the embryos be released from New Zealand quarantine, (d) will any further quarantine in New Zealand or Australia be necessary before their release in Australia and (e) approximately how many goats are expected to enter Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is there any difference in the quarantine period between the US and Zimbabwe embryos; if so, why.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) What would be the estimated quarantine period of any goat embryos or other genetic material from South Africa, imported via the Cocos Islands quarantine station.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2128" SPEAKER="Griffiths The Hon A.G." NAMEID="0H4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="MURRAY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr Griffiths</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, providing they are free from scrapie</PARA>
<PARA> (a) It is expected the quarantine requirements will be satisfied by August 1992.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Current numbers of each breed are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Angora goats ... 12289</PARA>
<PARA> Finnish landrace sheep ... 392</PARA>
<PARA> Karakul sheep ... 605</PARA>
<PARA> Suffolk sheep ... 59</PARA>
<PARA> Rambouillet merino sheep ... 1227</PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that a total of 10000 animals will be released at the end of the quarantine period, depending upon breeding performance. In addition there are approximately 54000 doses of semen and 179 embryos currently in quarantine.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The anticipated release date is not the original release date as many of the imported animals were unable to satisfy the propagation requirements of the original scrapie freedom assurance program prior to 1986. Subsequent extensive research identified alternative methods of providing equivalent or better assurance of freedom from scrapie. This research involved inoculation of tissues biopsied from imports into sentinel Australian origin goats followed by observation of the sentinels for a period of at least 3.5 years and, finally, laboratory examination of the sentinels. These bioassay procedures were undertaken in December 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (2)-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) There are several quarantine programs for goats in New Zealand derived from embryos imported from Zimbabwe. Three of these programs are derived from embryos which were collected to Australian requirements under Australian veterinary supervision and would be eligible for re-export to Australia at the completion of the program. Two consignments left Zimbabwe in July 1987 and a third departed May 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The three consignments of embryos arrived in Perth, transited to the Cocos Islands Animal Quarantine Station and were later transported to New Zealand via Perth.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The progeny of the goat embryos subjected to New Zealand quarantine requirements may be eligible for release in 1991 to the New Zealand domestic goat population only. The progeny of the Australian supervised embryos, which are subject to specific Australian requirements, may be eligible for export to Australia in late 1993. Animals released under a New Zealand quarantine program may not be eligible to enter Australia until the late l990s.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) No. However, animals in New Zealand undergoing quarantine to Australian requirements may be exported to Australia for completion of the remainder of the quarantine program under direct Australian supervision.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) It is expected that several thousand goats would be eligible to enter Australia on completion of all the programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (3)Yes. The reasons for the difference in quarantine periods include:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Scrapie is endemic in the USA, but has never been recorded in Zimbabwe.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) USA animals have been imported as live animals whereas Zimbabwe animals may only originate from embryo imports.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Advances in the application of bioassay for scrapie detection have been incorporated into the quarantine programs since the USA consignment was imported.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Six years to six years and six months for goat embryos, depending on test results and reproductive performance of the animals.</PARA>
