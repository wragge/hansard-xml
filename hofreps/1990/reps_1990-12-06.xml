<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian citizens shows:</PARA>
<PARA>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>
<PARA> - gives wide rights to children in Articles 12 to 16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association;</PARA>
<PARA> - gives only qualified rights to parents in Article 5;</PARA>
<PARA> - fails to recognise the prior right of parents to determine the education of their children;</PARA>
<PARA> - could, if ratified by Australia, result in government-assisted rebellion against parents who want to set limits for their children in their children's best interests.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will:</PARA>
<PARA> - request the Federal Government not to ratify this potentially damaging Convention.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Natural Therapy</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The charges levied at manufacturers will increase the cost of supplements and constitute an indirect taxation on users of Natural Therapies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt Homoeopaths and Herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine and are an abomination.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a Public Enquiry into the question of registration of the natural healing professions and the supervision and regulation of natural therapeutic goods.</PARA>

<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>1. that ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles;</PARA>
<PARA>2. that the Convention's philosophy of parent/child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children;</PARA>
<PARA>3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation;</PARA>
<PARA>4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent;</PARA>
<PARA>5. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers;</PARA>
<PARA>6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles;</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain residents of the State of South Australia, draws to the attention of the House-</PARA>
<PARA>fuel crisis</PARA>
<PARA>1) Goods are transported from the City to Country towns-this incurs freight rates. With the high rise of fuel, freight rates are on the increase. This means the cost of goods are much higher in the country areas, than in the City.</PARA>
<PARA>2) Some business houses are reluctant to keep increasing their prices every week. Therefore, they will run at a loss.</PARA>
<PARA>3) Country wage earners are paid on the same awards as City wage earners.</PARA>
<PARA>4) Goods in the Country areas cost more. Therefore the Country wage earner pays more.</PARA>
<PARA>5) Employment in the Country is not plentiful. Therefore quite a few Country people travel to the City on a daily basis. This costs more.</PARA>
<PARA>6) Country people living a distance from their closest town, have to travel to and from to do their shopping. This costs more.</PARA>
<PARA>7) People on Unemployment Benefits are unable to travel the distances to seek employment. This would reduce their benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> All in all, due to the fuel increases, the country people have a very high cost of living to cope with.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the House stop this continuous fuel increasing and reduce fuel prices back to a reasonable level. Also, a subsidy on fuel and freight would greatly benefit Country people.</PARA>

<PARA> ``I'm not holding an inquiry and never intended to hold an inquiry into Oxley Airlines but it seems to me that there is such a lot of evidence regarding allegations about breaches of A.N.O. 48 and the operations of Oxley Airlines that it would be remiss of me if I did not recommend to the Federal Minister for Transport and Communications that some inquiry should be held into Oxley, the running, operations of Oxley Airlines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I present the Committee's report entitled Responses to Petitions, together with the minutes of the proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5J4">Mr SCHOLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second report of the Standing Committee on Procedure in the Thirty-sixth Parliament. The Committee resolved to inquire into the adequacy of the provisions for responding to petitions, as it was aware that many members were dissatisfied with the current follow-up procedures and were taking their own steps to ensure that petitions were provided with some sort of response by the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As all honourable members would appreciate, many of their constituents spend considerable time and effort preparing and circulating petitions to gather signatures. We have seen petitions presented in this House with many thousands of signatures, and yet it is rare for any further action to be taken once the petition had been presented in the House. The Committee feels that this situation is unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> As an aside, I draw honourable members' attention to a table on page 3 of the report which sets out the numbers of petitions which have been presented to this House in blocks of 10 years since Federation. Honourable members will note from that that between 1901 and 1910 in the first fluster of Federation over 800 petitions were presented. </PARA>
<PARA> In the next 40 years only 200 petitions were presented. That number doubled in the following 10 years. But in the last two 10-year periods, 15,500 petitions were presented between 1970 and 1980, and 25,000 between 1980 and 1990. Thus, an enormous amount of effort went into presenting material to this House for virtually no response. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of follow-up on petitions has been recognised by the House in the past. The Procedure Committee addressed this problem in 1986 in its report on the days and hours of sitting and the effective use of the time of the House. Following that report, sessional orders were adopted giving Ministers the option of responding to petitions that had been referred to them. Under the present arrangements, Ministers may lodge a response with the Clerk and that response will be announced at the end of petitions being announced. </PARA>
<PARA> That provision has been in the sessional orders for nearly three years and, at this time, not one Minister has taken the opportunity to respond to a petition in this way. The failure of Ministers to respond has been very disappointing. The Committee feels that the failure of Ministers to provide responses points to the need to direct Ministers to do so within a specified time. The Committee proposes therefore that Ministers be required to respond to petitions in the area in which they have responsibility. These responses should be lodged with the Clerk within 21 sitting days of the petition being referred formally by the House, and that the responses be printed in Hansard, along with answers to Questions on Notice. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommending that Ministers be required to respond to petitions, the Committee feels that it is not placing an unreasonable demand on Ministers. In many other comparable legislatures, follow-up procedures on petitions are far more positive than in the House of Representatives. For example, in the New Zealand House of Representatives, and the Lok Sabha in India, petitions are referred to committees, while in the Canadian House of Commons, a response must be provided by the Government within a specified time. Even in the United Kingdom House of Commons, where Ministers are not obliged to respond to petitions, approximately 70 per cent of petitions actually receive a response.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is aware that many members, although they are not obliged to, acknowledge petitions they have lodged for their constituents, either in writing to one or more petitioners to advise that a petition has been presented to the House, or perhaps by forwarding a copy of the Hansard report. We would like to encourage all members to acknowledge petitions in this way and feel that it is an important means by which citizens are provided with some immediate response to their grievance. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure all members will agree that petitions can form an important link between the parliament and the people and that the changes proposed in this report can strengthen this link by making the process a two-way one by ensuring the grievances of petitioners receive consideration. I commend the report to the House. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the European parliamentary institutions, Switzerland and France, September and October, 1990. I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for your assistance this morning. I am pleased to present this report on behalf on my colleagues in the delegation. It was a very opportune time to be visiting Europe, and my colleagues the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron) will also speak in this debate and make some comments about their viewpoints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank those honourable members and also my colleague the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), who took over the delegation in its time in France. I would also like to thank Senators McLean and Tambling. Senator Tambling was the deputy leader of the delegation and at all times was very helpful and cooperative. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a very successful delegation from a number of viewpoints, and it was successful with respect to the cooperation we received from our posts overseas and certainly from the support we received from the secretary to the delegation, Mr Michael Ong, and the secretary to the leader of the delegation, Mrs Albertha Williamson, and I would thank them very much. I would also like to thank people in posts overseas, particularly our Ambassador in Brussels, Mr Curtis, and the team who work with him; our Ambassador in Berne in Switzerland, Mr Brook; and our Ambassador, Mr Pocock, in France. I would also like to acknowledge people such as Mr Ferdinand Rammelt and Mr Luciano Cao, who acted as liaison agents for us and helped us in our various visits. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, I think, at this stage to emphasise to this Parliament that this report is very timely from a number of points of view. It is timely in particular because, right at the moment, we have the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round-I suppose one could say-proceeding in a very uncertain fashion in Brussels. There is great interest in this Parliament, certainly by our rural community and by the community at large, with regard to the significant outcome of those GATT talks-that is, about the reduction of tariffs on trade generally but, in particular, our interest happens to be in agricultural as well as services and manufacturing trade. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a concern, I think, of the delegation that the Europeans were reluctant to bring about changes in terms of their attitude towards border protection, which is basically tariffs on entry to products but, secondly, in terms of subsidies to third markets. So we have a situation where the Europeans are not only making it virtually impossible for Australian products to get into the European market but, secondly, making it very difficult for Australia's unsubsidised rural products to compete in third markets. That is very unsatisfactory from the point of view of Australia and the point of view of the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will portray an image which I am sure will help to illustrate this point. When in Switzerland, I decided to take the prices of some basic commodities and compare them with what price one would pay in Australia. If people recognise that one Swiss franc is equal to one Australian dollar, one will begin to understand. I decided to buy some emmentaler cheese: 22 Swiss francs a kilo; in Australia, one can buy emmentaler for 9 Swiss francs or $9. Wine, a vin ordinaire, costs 15 Swiss francs for a bottle; in Australia, one could buy a similar bottle for five Swiss francs or $5. Veal bought for a meal that night cost 32 Swiss francs per kilo; in Australia, one could buy similar veal for nine Swiss francs. Milk, which is basically a commodity the Europeans produce in great quantity, costs 1.8 Swiss francs a litre; in Australia, one can get milk for 0.8 or 80c a litre. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A loaf of bread costs 2 Swiss francs; in Australia, one can buy a similar loaf of bread for $1 or one Swiss franc. That analogy I could continue on to illustrate the difference in prices. I acknowledge that incomes are a bit higher in Europe but when we look, as my colleague suggests, at the relationship between those prices that people pay and the prices at which we could put Australian products on to European markets, one understands the significance of what the Common Agricultural Policy is about. It is about European consumers paying very high prices, and Australian producers being denied access. So it is a very serious issue and one that we ought to, in my view, use these sorts of analogies to illustrate the differences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the question of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Clearly there has been a significant change in Europe, and the significant relationships in Europe are something that we would all welcome. We were very encouraged as a delegation by the attitude of the North Atlantic assembly in NATO to see itself as having an out-of-area role: that is, to have a responsibility for maintaining piece and security in other regions. It is interesting that we now have in the Persian Gulf this first test of the Europeans as well as the United States of America and other countries in a wider setting. </PARA>
<PARA> I was encouraged, and I am sure my colleagues were encouraged, by the attitude of the Europeans at NATO, the North Atlantic Assembly, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Council of Europe to have Australia play a wider role-and that is something we are very keen to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of the environment. It is very clear that the Europeans regard Australia as a significant country in terms of environmental protection and policy. The delegation at large was encouraged by that attitude. It is important that we recognise that the Europeans are looking to Australia in many respects for environmental management. We can provide a lead on a number of issues. The Europeans would be keen to talk with us on those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn further to our visit to Switzerland. We were very encouraged by the bilateral relationships that were established there. It should be pointed out that clearly the corporate collapses in Australia have created a crisis of confidence amongst the Swiss banking community. We found it necessary to try to reassure the Swiss bankers that Australia was a good place to do business. We all have a responsibility in this Parliament, and in the parliaments in all the States, to ensure that. We need an Australian Securities Commission regulation in Western Australia to give overseas investors security in knowing that their money will be safe within Australia. That is very important. I say that very clearly, not in a partisan way, but to assure overseas investors of our position. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by noting that we were very pleased that the visit to France went so well. I am sure my colleagues can add further to that. I close by saying that we felt it was important to get this report to the Parliament immediately. It is very timely, given the events in Europe. My colleagues found it a very valuable visit. We appreciated the support we got from the overseas embassies here before we went. We appreciate the opportunity we had to conduct those visits and we certainly appreciate the support we got whilst we were there. Like my colleagues, I am pleased to commend this report to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a great honour to be included in the parliamentary delegation to the European parliamentary institutions so ably led by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). I will briefly comment on a few areas and try to keep away from the areas that the honourable member for Stirling spoke about. Our visit to Switzerland was most interesting. We were the first Australian parliamentary delegation to visit the Swiss Parliament. It was quite an honour and a unique experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An area I was particularly interested in was the Swiss system of constitutional initiatives and referenda, whereby citizens can exercise ultimate control over government and certain types of legislation. In Switzerland if 40,000 citizens sign a petition requesting a referendum on a specific issue it is compulsory for the Government to conduct that referendum. That is on all issues other than issues which would affect the Constitution. A petition requires 100,000 signatures if the issue affects the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Having these numbers so low-the Swiss parliamentarians told us that those numbers had been even lower and had only recently been raised-there are many requests for referenda. I felt the politicians were rather hesitant about the number they have. They felt that the legislators were inclined to water down legislation to make the legislation soft enough so that they would not have to face up to a referendum. It was very interesting to look at this aspect because there is such a movement throughout Australia for citizen initiated referenda. </PARA>
<PARA> After visiting Switzerland we went by bus to Brussels and spent 11 days there. It was very interesting. We talked to officials from the European Commission and the Council of Ministers of the European Communities. All the executive and administration of the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the European Community are based in Brussels. This is unique because the Council of Europe and the European Parliament meet in Strasbourg. </PARA>
<PARA> We also visited the Belgium Parliament and we had a meeting with the Belgian-Australian parliamentary friendship group. It is expected that a delegation from the Belgium Parliament should visit Australia next year. </PARA>
<PARA> We spoke to executive members of the North Atlantic Assembly, the European Trade Union Conference and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. A very special part of our visit to Belgium was to Ypres and the Menin Gate. So many Australians who lost their lives during the First World War are buried there. It was a very moving experience. The Belgians are very aware of the Australian contribution to the First World War. </PARA>
<PARA> After Brussels, we travelled by bus to Strasbourg where we attended a meeting of the Council of Europe and took part in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development debate. Our leader, the honourable member for Stirling, addressed the Council of Europe in that debate very effectively, I thought, and I congratulate him. There was certainly enormous interest in the fact that there was Australian participation in and attendance at that debate.</PARA>
<PARA> The following week we attended the European Parliament. There was enormous interest in the fact that Australia was interested in the European Parliament. We had some quite intensive discussions, revolving particularly around the European Community agricultural policy. As the honourable member for Stirling has already pointed out, there is enormous political resistance from certain areas in Europe to change in that policy, mainly for political reasons. The politicians are under heavy pressure from their rural constituents who very much enjoy the protection given to them by that policy. That is why there is difficulty with the Uruguay Round talks at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> After Strasbourg, we moved on to Paris as guests of the French Assembly. That was a most interesting period. We spent six days in France. Ambassador Pocock and Mrs Pocock accompanied us virtually everywhere. We were very well looked after. Ms Alice Gay from the Embassy accompanied us. Mr Nicolas Milosevic, the Secretary of the National Assembly of France Friendship Group, accompanied us everywhere and without him we would have been lost because when one moves around France one is surprised by the number of people who do not speak our language, and I must admit we could not speak their language. As I said, we were well looked after. </PARA>
<PARA> It was very interesting to ride on the TGV, which is the French very fast train. We travelled from Paris to Tours, in the south of France, on this very fast train. We were taken up to the forward control area and I sat next to the driver. We were travelling at 300 kilometres an hour straight down the track. It was like flying in a jet; it was just so smooth; it was fantastic. We were going through sets of points at 250 kilometres an hour. It was a unique experience. </PARA>
<PARA> I was particularly interested, because the proposed very fast train in Australia would pass through my electorate, in the noise factor. I would look out the window and see some cows in a cow yard who had just been milked, chewing away at some hay. We would go slipping past and they would not even look up to say, `How do you do', because they could not speak English anyway. An important aspect which was pointed out to me with regard to the noise factor is that, whilst going through the towns, the big buffer walls are put in, while out in the countryside there are no walls. It was explained to me that there is a one second approach noise, one second passing noise and one second going away. One, two, three, and it has gone. It is not like aeroplane noise. So the noise factor is not as great as people who have not experienced the situation might think. </PARA>
<PARA> There is very strong consideration given to the environment. Tunnels were even put underneath the line for the frogs to travel through. The environmentalists were very concerned about squashed frogs on the railway line. They were concerned not only about the effect on the train, travelling at 300 kilometres an hour, but also the effect on the frog. Anyway, it was a magical experience. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter I want to mention is the visit to the Chinon power station, which was of great interest. Some members of the delegation were a little concerned about being in a nuclear power station. However, it was very well run and we had the unique experience of seeing the top of one of the reactors off when people were extracting the spent rods-all done underwater and very efficiently. It was a most interesting experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we went down to Marseilles, where-hold your breath!-we examined a very modern sewage treatment plant. We did hold our breath! It is unique. It has been built under the city, a sports ground has been built on top of it and it has the capacity to handle a vast amount-270,000 cubic metres-of liquid waste every day. Formerly this was sent right out into the Mediterranean, causing enormous pollution. These matters are related to some of the problems we are having in Australia today. Sewage is now treated under the city in a very modern, unique piece of French engineering. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to go into all of the vast number of interesting things we saw in France, but I want to mention our visit to the multifunction centre called Sophia-Antipolis. It is an enormous success. The founder of the Sophia-Antipolis, Senator Pierre Laffitte, advised that in the Australian multifunction polis the emphasis should be on a research and high technology centre and not a manufacturing centre. </PARA>
<PARA> I have run out of time, Mr Deputy Speaker, and thank you very much. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to start my contribution this morning by thanking you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the leader of the parliamentary delegation to the European parliamentary institutions, for your leadership and support and for your ability to make the delegation an outstanding success. I also thank Senator Tambling, the deputy leader, and Madame le Presidente, who led the delegation during part of our period in Strasbourg and France. Of course, as other people have pointed out, the delegation was able to visit Switzerland. You yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, have mentioned how important the bankers in Switzerland believe it is for Australia to have improved, adequate and tough corporate legislation. That is something we all hope can be achieved nationally in all parliaments, including that of Western Australia, in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While we were in Switzerland, the Swiss were conducting a referendum on the future of nuclear power. A proposal to phase out the use of nuclear power was defeated; however, an alternative referendum to prohibit the construction of any new nuclear power stations for the next 10 years was carried. Many people in Australia who support these citizen initiated referenda would be wise to look at the experience of Switzerland. Switzerland is not a member of the United Nations (UN) because, while the government supports Switzerland's joining the UN, it cannot convince the majority of the Swiss people to vote in a referendum to join the United Nations. In one of the states making up the federation of Switzerland, women still do not have the vote in state elections or state referendums because the males, who have the vote in that state, have not seen fit to grant women the vote for state elections. So people who support citizen initiated referendums might look at the experience in Switzerland as to whether that is the way they wish to go. </PARA>
<PARA> We also had the great honour to be able to join you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in laying a wreath at Menin Gate in Ypres. We had many discussions with members of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe on human rights, the future of the common agricultural policy and the future of eastern Europe. Some of the previous speakers have already touched on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Common agricultural policies seemed to dominate our discussions everywhere we went. Given the fact that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations are now coming to a climax-hopefully, a successful outcome-it was quite natural that many of our debates, arguments and discussions were about these issues. In particular, Australia is very concerned that the Andriessen accords which were given to our country by the European Commission may be breached. The European Community has in the past assured Australia that it will not dump its products on third markets, and Australia is very determined to make sure that those assurances are met. </PARA>
<PARA> During our visit to France we were very fortunate to be looked after by Nicolas Milosevic from the French Assembly, and the Chairman of the France-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Group, Jean-Jack Queyranne, and Robert Le Foll went to great lengths to make sure that our visit was successful. Despite past difficulties in our relationship with France, the French went to great lengths to emphasise to us that they believe our common work on areas such as Antarctica and New Caledonia means that the Australia-France relationship has grown and improved greatly. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I thank Michael Ong, the delegation's secretary, and Ms Albertha Williamson for the help that they gave us. I also pay tribute to all the embassies and overseas missions that assisted us, particularly to Peter Curtis in Brussels and Hugh Borrowman who made sure that our delegation was able to successfully represent Australia overseas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I stated when I introduced the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 12 months ago, one of the responsibilities of this Parliament-in fact its first responsibility-is the protection of the life and rights of the citizens of Australia. It is usually accepted on both sides that there is a particular obligation upon us to safeguard the life and rights of those in our community who are too weak to protect themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For many years now, for both ethical and political reasons, members of the House of Representatives and senators have been asked to make their own judgment as to what rights are held by unborn individuals-that is, individuals in the antenatal stage of their human development. We have been obliged to assess what rights exist and to what extent we will protect and affirm those rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is time that we made our position on the questions of the rights of the unborn, abortion and our responsibilities clear to ourselves and to the electorate. I believe-and here I echo the Senate Select Committee on Human Embryo Experimentation-that from conception what we call an embryo and then a foetus is a new human life with a status and set of rights which command respect. I believe that scientific and metaphysical logic suggests that an individual human's antenatal and postnatal development constitutes a single process of becoming what she or he already is-a human being. We are consequently obliged, I believe, to protect the basic right of unborn human beings to life. I therefore submit this Bill for the consideration of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's main involvement with abortion is through Medicare subsidisation of abortion procedures. The Bill therefore addresses Medicare subsidisation of abortion and seeks to allow Medicare funding only for abortions performed to avert the death of a mother or in cases where the procedure is for a different purpose and where the doctor was unaware an abortion would occur. The Bill also requires the doctor to certify that the reason for an abortion was, in his opinion, to avert the death of the mother. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members may not be aware that approximately 85,000 abortions are performed in Australia annually; that is, for every three live births, there is one aborted life. Since 1975, approximately 800,000 abortions have been subsidised by Medicare with the current subsidy to the abortion industry running at over $8m per annum. That is the background to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written to all members asking for their consideration of the Bill and the basic issues that it addresses. I respectfully suggest that we do not have the right as members of parliament to ignore this issue or to refuse to make our own position on the matter clear to the electorate. I challenge the House and the Government to allow this Bill time for full debate and resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of detailed arguments about the Bill and a number of misgivings and misperceptions which are widespread about this issue. I intend to deal with these issues in the Bill's second reading speech and subsequent debate. In the meantime, given time restrictions, I commend the Bill to the House, table an explanatory memorandum and challenge honourable members to come to grips with this important ethical and urgent political issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In February 1987 the Committee for the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, chaired by a former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Harry Gibbs, was established. The Committee has produced four interim reports which seek to consolidate and rationalise the criminal laws of the Commonwealth. The work of the Committee has been outstanding. All too often this Government has been too slow to respond to law reform proposals, much to the detriment of Australian society. The reports of the Committee are good reports, and I urge the Government, with all the resources at its disposal, to respond promptly to the Committee's recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill I have introduced seeks to implement the recommendations made by the Committee in its most recent report of November 1990. In its report, the Committee has produced draft legislation. This Bill picks up those parts of the draft legislation which deal with offences relating to the administration of justice and bribery and corruption. I have selected and concentrated on those parts for a very good reason. If Australians are to have faith in our system of government, they must know that our law makers and administrators are subject to the full rigour of the law should they engage in corrupt conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, amongst other things, modernises the criminal laws of the Commonwealth relating to the bribery and corruption of judicial officers, parliamentarians and public servants. Time does not permit me to go into these changes in any detail, and for those interested in the background to the Bill, I refer them to the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> Organised crime only flourishes when it can corrupt public officials. In the short time that I have had the responsibility of being shadow Attorney-General, I have heard many allegations of links between organised crime and the corruption of public officials. Furthermore, and this causes me the greatest concern, I have seen this Government turn a blind eye to such allegations. Two notable examples include the Government's refusal to ensure that allegations by a journalist that a Cabinet Minister is somehow involved in a grubby murder have been promptly investigated, and its refusal to establish a joint Federal-New South Wales royal commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the murder of Colin Winchester. </PARA>
<PARA> So updating the law relating to bribery and corruption is only part of what is needed. We also need a government which has the will and the determination to tackle effectively, at the administrative level, the problems of institutionalised corruption. This Government simply does not have the resolve to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the next year I will be examining a number of measures designed to combat official corruption. These include what is referred to as whistle blowing legislation to protect public officials who report colleagues suspected of corruption. I will also be looking at the desirability of reforming the present law and practice dealing with the disclosure of pecuniary and other interests of public officials which affect their ability to perform their duties of office impartially. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the New South Wales Independent Committee Against Corruption exposed a mysterious network of financiers, developers, Australian Labor Party figures and Federal public servants operating with respect to land developments. Indeed, one former senior adviser to a Federal Minister, riddled with conflicts of interest, formed the subject of a secret, separate report for his abuse of office. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again we have to ask: what has the Government done about these allegations? Have they conveniently been swept under the carpet because of the connections this former ministerial adviser has with senior Australian Labor Party figures?</PARA>
<PARA> Australians are entitled to expect public officials to perform the duties of office according to the highest standards of integrity and probity. If they fail to meet those standards, the law should, without fear or favour, expose and punish them for what they are: criminals who undermine the very essence of open and responsible government. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The objects of this Bill are to ensure that employers are free to belong to, or not to belong to, representative bodies of employers; to ensure that employees are free to belong to, or not to belong to, representative bodies of employees; to ensure that independent contractors are free to belong to, or not to belong to, representative bodies of employers, or representative bodies of employees; and to make provision incidental to the operation of the Industrial Relations Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In democratic societies we have long held sacrosanct the rights and responsibilities of the individual. Foremost of the rights that we hold dear are the right of free speech and the right of freedom of association. I have dealt in part with the first of these-the right of free speech-in a minor way in an earlier Bill which seeks to amend the Industrial Relations Act to remove a provision which in my view is a violation of our right of free speech, including freedom of the press. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill addresses a major inequity which has existed in practice if not in law since Federation. That inequity is the right of individuals to make a choice of whether or not to join a union or representative organisation. States and Federal law and the courts have always upheld the rights of employers to form organisations and the rights of employees to form and join unions. For a long time both State and Federal governments have countenanced the concept of the closed shop in industrial relations. The closed shop requires all employees of an industry or an organisation to belong to a trade union. </PARA>
<PARA> In some instances employers are required to belong to an employer organisation in order to participate in practical, day to day business activities. Such provisions deny individual employees and individual employers their basic right of association, which is not to belong to such an organisation if they so choose. I remind honourable members that public opinion poll after public opinion poll in this last decade has indicated overwhelmingly that membership of unions and membership of employer organisations should be voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA> Compulsory union membership is objectionable. But trade unions themselves and the right of individual workers to form and join unions are clearly supported by the majority. If for no other reason trade unions have an historical right to exist. In times past unions have won many victories against oppression by unprincipled employers and have helped raise standards of living for many if not all of their members. But this is 1990, not 1890, and it is now past time that we ensured the removal of reverse oppression that describes the closed shop. </PARA>
<PARA> It is largely the high degree of unionism in the public sector of our country which props up the whole system. A research poll by the Roy Morgan Research Centre published on 8 November 1989 indicated that 87 per cent of the general population believes that union membership should be voluntary and that 82 per cent of union members held the same view. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill in its several parts is designed to ensure that membership or non-membership of an organisation is not to affect employment; that is, it gives full effect to the concept of voluntary union membership and voluntary membership of associations. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to thank the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), on whose earlier work this Bill is to a large extent based, and Mr Ian Harris, First Clerk Assistant, for his substantial and invaluable drafting assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House expresses grave concern at the rate of global population growth because of its economic, social and environmental implications and therefore (a) supports the moderate growth in the funds allocated for population programs within the 1990 Australian aid budget and (b) calls for such funding to be further substantially increased. </PARA>
<PARA>Rapid population growth inhibits the development of human potential through restrictions to education, health and productive labour. It also threatens the destruction of our fragile ecosystem through resource depletion, environmental degradation, and disruption of global climate. </PARA>
<PARA> The world's population passed 5 billion in 1987. In the year 2000 the world's population will be more than 6 billion, increasing by 90 million to 100 million each year. About 95 per cent of future demographic growth will take place in developing countries. Even if women worldwide were to have only two children each year by the year 2025, world population would not stabilise until it was about 10 billion-twice the current population. Any delay in fertility reduction will mean an even greater increase in ultimate population size. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of school age children is projected to rise from 940 million in 1980 to 1,280 million by the year 2000. Despite dramatic increases in school enrolment, the actual number of illiterates in the world continues to increase because population growth outstrips the current capacity to provide education. Under current labour force growth projections in developing countries, around 1.6 billion new jobs-that is, billion new jobs-will have to be created between 1980 and 2025, with nearly one billion, that is 1,000 million, of them in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> Population increase is often higher than agricultural growth. Food production per capita has declined in 70 developing countries, and techniques of increasing yields are often dependent on oil resources and/or have negative long term environmental implications. Much of the projected population increase will take place in environmentally fragile regions of the developing world. Population pressures contribute to deforestation, desertification, and scarcity of clean water supply. </PARA>
<PARA> The burden of high fertility is felt especially by the women of the developing world, whose health, education, productivity and autonomy would be enhanced by providing them with the ability to choose the number and timing of their children. Currently couples in many parts of the world bear more children than they want or can afford because they lack access to efficient methods of contraception appropriate to their needs, or lack the knowledge, confidence or personal freedom needed to control their fertility. </PARA>
<PARA> The world fertility survey indicated a large unmet demand for family planning. The United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) has estimated that in Asia over 43 per cent of women not using family planning would in fact like to postpone, delay or limit their childbearing. </PARA>
<PARA> World fertility survey results indicate that, among married women who say they want no more children, fully one-half are not currently using any contraception. A recent analysis of world fertility survey data examining women who stated their last birth was unwanted found that, if they had had the means to prevent birth, the rate of natural increase in the countries represented would have been reduced on average from 2.2 per cent a year to 1.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Surveys have identified lack of information and fear of side effects, also related to poor understanding of methods, as key reasons for non-use of contraception. Programs designed to provide a wide range of contraceptive choices and to empower people to make personal family planning choices achieve significant effects on both a macro and a micro level. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of couples using contraception has increased rapidly in the past decade. Over half of the world's couples of reproductive age are now using contraception. Numerous studies have shown that the provision of family planning services can reduce fertility levels, even in the absence of other socioeconomic changes. Without the population policy and family planning services to date, it is estimated that China's population would now be 110 million larger and India's 80 million larger than has actually occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Effective fertility control provides the extra bonus of reducing infant, childhood and maternal mortality. Infants born at short intervals after the previous birth have higher mortality rates than those born after longer spacing. Effective birth spacing depends on prolonged breast feeding and the use of appropriate contraception. </PARA>
<PARA> Both infant and maternal mortality rates are higher when childbirth takes place when the mother is aged under 20 or over 35. Family planning to postpone the first birth and to eliminate late child bearing would reduce both child loss and maternal illness and death. Both infant and maternal mortality are greater with higher order births, for example, fourth, fifth, sixth and later births. Reducing average family size is an effective way of reducing infant and maternal mortality. </PARA>
<PARA> Various forms of development assistance are crucial to population programs, particularly in poor nations facing debt burdens and shortages of trained personnel and equipment. Despite a significant increase in the commitment of Third World governments to population and family planning programs, in most countries these programs receive less than half of one per cent of national budgets. Many developing countries are cutting back budgets for social services, including health and family planning, because of the current economic crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the World Bank, foreign aid now supports about 25 per cent of all family planning costs in developing countries. Official development assistance in population and family planning currently constitutes between one per cent and 2 per cent of total overseas development assistance by all donor countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The UNFPA estimates that international donors contribute a total of half a billion dollars annually to those programs. About two-thirds of such assistance goes directly to family planning and related maternal child health programs. Donors also contribute to data collection, operations research, policy and institutional development, and information and education activities-providing training and technical assistance in support of family planning and health programs. About $150m is spent annually on basic research on reproductive biology and contraceptive technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The two largest organisations in population assistance are the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation-the IPPF. The UNFPA assists about 100 developing countries. It receives requests for assistance that far exceed the budget available. The IPPF is a non-governmental body with over 100 national family planning associations as members. The World Bank has given a high priority to population assistance, with large programs in Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA> Among bilateral donors, the United States and Japan have the largest programs. Despite the dominance of the US program, its contribution has been falling in real terms since the early 1970s. In terms of dollars disbursed as a percentage of gross national product, the most committed donors by far are Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. A recent report of donor assistance for population by 13 countries put the US at the top with nearly $200m. The two smallest contributors were Finland and Australia. Non-government organisations (NGOs) play an active role in population programs. About one-quarter of US population aid is administered through non-government organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia currently provides a relatively low level of support to population and family planning programs. Assistance provided in the population field by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) totalled about $4.5m in 1989-90 and is expected to be about $6m during this financial year. I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) for his commitment to this area in arranging that increase. That total, by the way, includes contributions through multilateral, bilateral, NGO and other channels. </PARA>
<PARA> The inclusion of $1.4m through a development import finance facility application for ultrasound equipment for China's state family planning program this year is the principal reason for the increase in funding for this year. But that total represents only about half of one per cent of our total development assistance-considerably lower than the one per cent to 2 per cent average proportion reported for other national donors. By significantly increasing assistance to international family planning efforts, Australia would both enhance the effectiveness of its development assistance through reducing population growth rates and help to improve the welfare of millions of families. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Bank has estimated that, to achieve the levels of contraceptive use necessary for further improvements in maternal health as well as for continued rapid declines in population growth, total family planning expenditure in the developing world would have to reach at least $8 billion annually, through both domestic and external contributions. Assuming donors maintain a constant proportion of contributions at the current level, an $8 billion family planning budget would require population assistance globally to quadruple-that is, to be multiplied four times-to a level of $2 billion annually. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia should increase the proportion of its development assistance budget devoted to programs of assistance in population and family planning, and I suggest that an increase to 2 per cent, or to around $20m, in line with other major donors, could be achieved initially mainly through multilateral or multilateral-bilateral channels, with a gradual build-up of assistance through bilateral, regional and non-governmental organisational channels over time. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a large increase in commitment to population and family planning contribution offers great challenges and opportunities to AIDAB and the community. AIDAB will need to allocate sufficient staff to assist in the development of a cohesive program of long term support which is integrated with country, regional and NGO programs as well as current health, women in development and environment strategies. The large network of Australian trained demographers, medical trainers, policy makers and social scientists in Asia and the Pacific promises great opportunities for effective collaborative work. </PARA>
<PARA> The time to act is now. The encouraging fertility declines in Asia in the early 1980s have stalled due to shortages of funds and declining commitment to family planning. Large cohorts entering child bearing years in Asia and the Pacific lack effective access to contraceptives. Australia has the opportunity to take a regional, and even global, leadership role in population assistance, which will help to improve the health and welfare of individuals and reinforce progress towards wider economic development and environmental protection goals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue that we are addressing today is one of grave importance to the people of Australia and indeed to the people of the world. I believe it is imperative that we should endeavour to understand the issue of world population growth as a sociological phenomenon that spans many different cultures of the world. The mistake that is being made is the terms of reference that we as legislators of the developed world adopt. Policy makers have made a number of inferences about the increase in the world's population that warrant further investigation. Those conclusions have considerable policy implications for the human rights of a considerable section of the world's population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Foreign aid finance from Australia for 1990 to 1991 has been directed away from agricultural research and volunteer programs towards population control groups. In the 1990-91 aid budget, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) received from the Australian Government an extra 44.2 per cent in funding, while the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) received an additional 92 per cent in funding. </PARA>
<PARA> On 11 October, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) gave notice of his motion:</PARA>
<PARA> That this House expresses grave concern at the rate of global population growth because of its economic, social and environmental implications and therefore: (a) supports the moderate growth in the funds allocated for population programs within the 1990 Australian aid budget; and (b) calls for such funding to be further substantially increased. </PARA>
<PARA> With reference to the honourable member's motion, we must ask ourselves to assess the validity of some of the assumptions being made. We must address the methods and conclusions that advocates of population control have put forward, and ask ourselves the following fundamental questions: is population growth undesirable and inherently bad? Is population growth the root cause of environmental decay, economic decline and social disintegration? Is the money that is being spent on population control programs actually having an effect on population growth? By slowing down the population growth rate will economic, social and environmental progress be made? By enforcing the aims of lower population on Third World countries, are we truly acting in the interests of their people and, indeed, for that matter, the interests of all societies of the world?</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of disturbing counter arguments against aspects of population control, and these are as follows: Population control can be exercised as an oppressive tool by authoritarian governments who are not acting in the best interests of their own citizens. Population control has enabled governments to detract attention away from the failures of their economic, social and environmental policies. Population control facilitates the lack of attention given to corruption that is so much a part of the world's economic, social and environmental problems. Population control is a violation of human rights. Governments are given the power and international support to enforce rules on the people pertaining to the size of their families. In at least one instance, it has been used as a prerequisite for political candidature in a local election. Population control is the enforcement of Western values on people who do not share these values. </PARA>
<PARA> Enormous pressure has been applied to African governments to adopt policies of population control as a solution to hunger and poverty in their countries. However, it is claimed by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) that even Zaire could feed the whole of Africa if enough attention was paid to agriculture reform. Many arguments advanced in support of population control are racialist and sexist in their sentiment and they mitigate against the human rights of the poor and poorly educated in Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Population control is not the cause of environmental decay. Within a world of unequal resources, of corrupt and exploitative Third World governments, and of an increasing demand on developing countries to satisfy the desires of Western people, it has been the procedure to blame environmental problems on the fertility of poor women in lesser developed countries, who, with their families, are minimal per capita users of the world's resources. </PARA>
<PARA> One good example against the environmental proposition is the area formerly known as East Germany, where the birth rate has dwindled over recent years, but enormous environmental damage has been wreaked on its landscape by the former corrupt totalitarian regime. </PARA>
<PARA> One country that supports a birth control program that facilitated the achievement of a low birth rate in the 1970s is the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China is used by advocates of population control as an example for other developing countries to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> The President of the Population Institute, an organisation with close ties to the People's Republic of China's State Family Planning Commission, has repeatedly defended China's program during visits to that country. In November of 1984 he was reported to have said that China has shown the world what can be done when people conscientiously tackle the problem, adding that he had not detected any coercion during his tour. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chinese population control program has also received the praise of the head of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, whose charter explicitly condemns the use of coercion. However, evidence supports a frightening violation of human rights in the People's Republic of China. In that country a woman is strongly encouraged to conceive only after the age of 24 and is penalised if she has a child at a younger age. A couple is allowed to have only one child and a wife who is unwilling to abort a child may be compelled by the State to do so if her husband agrees. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been alleged that between one and two million unborn children are removed prematurely from the womb and put to death annually. There have even been suggestions of scientific experimentation on these babies. </PARA>
<PARA> A Dutch governmental adviser on population issues, Edit Sizoo, states:</PARA>
<PARA>It has always been assumed population growth blocks development, and birth control was seen as a means to solve many problems from education to food shortages, but this has turned out to be a myth. At its best, population control may have some positive effects, but it doesn't address the many development problems people have. </PARA>
<PARA> Biologist Paula Bradish of West Germany, who has lectured for years on nutrition problems and reproductive technology, has pointed out that the expenditure of $US3 billion on population programs in the 1980s compared with $US2m in the 1960s has yielded meagre results. </PARA>
<PARA> Farida Akhter, who works with Ubinig, a research institute on development alternatives in Bangladesh, points to a sinister by-product of birth control projects in that country. Birth control programs funded by the Ford Foundation in the United States and the World Bank, among others, have become an important source of income for Bangladesh's military government. </PARA>
<PARA> We must address the implications of donating funds to organisations which advocate population control. The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) funds the following organisations which have been suggested as recipients for further funding increases. The United Nations Population Fund, an organisation which the honourable member for Fraser believes should receive more funding from Australia, is involved in the development and testing of new abortion drugs to be used in population programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States of America has refused to support UNFPA since 1985 because it `participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilisation in the People's Republic of China'. Australia's funding arrangement with the IPPF should also be analysed. This organisation is a major international lobbyist for the repeal of abortion laws and no longer receives United States overseas aid funding because it has refused to sign a declaration that it will not promote abortion in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> AIDAB has been criticised for its support for a project to send 100 ultrasound machines to the Shanghai section of the State Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China, despite evidence that suggests that such machines most likely will be used to ensure that Chinese women, in accordance with population control regulations, have not illegally removed their compulsory IUD, and for the detection of unauthorised pregnancies and subsequent forced abortion. </PARA>
<PARA> Advocates of population control claim that by procreating too often, the poor help to create and perpetuate their own poverty. Their numbers consume scarce agricultural and environmental resources at an alarming rate, keep wages low, and cost governments too much money in social services. Forcing down birth rates through population control programs is thus said to help the poor help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are two distinct problems with this analysis. Firstly, it obscures the real cause of poverty in the Third World: the unequal distribution of resources and power within individual countries and between the developed and underdeveloped sections of the world. Secondly, the emphasis of population control distorts social policy and undermines the delivery of safe, voluntary family planning services. In many countries the World Bank has urged governments to make population control a higher priority than basic health care. It has also pressured them to relax prescription guidelines for contraceptives and aggressively push those considered most effective-that is, intra-uterine devices, pills, injections, and now implants. That has been done in the absence of adequate screening and treatment for side effects which can be serious and even life threatening. As a result, many women have become disillusioned with these methods and have dropped out of family planning programs altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> Population control is not the only policy that we can adopt to alleviate poverty and promote economic growth. Education programs and better international cooperation must be utilised to ensure that the less developed countries and, indeed, the world can benefit from the population of developed countries. Funding for developing countries should be invested in human resources. These people should be employed to increase economic activity and ensure the productivity of their countries. There is a huge amount of resources in the form of human capital which is under-utilised and which requires better management for its potential to be fully realised. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that the effects of population control enforcement are felt most strongly by the poor and powerless, people who have no control over the policies that have such a dramatic effect on their lives. The women in developing countries are detrimentally affected by countries such as Australia, which financially and legitimately support the bureaucratic power to force birth control legislation on them. We must understand the effects of our ideological policies that do not take into consideration the cultural and sociological differences between life in what we term developing countries and in Western countries, which is what we are pushing the people of less developed countries to aspire to. However, I emphasise that no matter what our cultural and sociological differences are, we all share the same desire and respect for unequivocal human rights. I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is the issue that is at stake here, today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this motion and commend my colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for initiating this very important debate. I do not want to enter into an argument with the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), but I would suggest that he should read up a little on this subject. I, myself, have been involved in activities on population and, as a member of the Asia Forum on Population and Development, I know many of the people in the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA). For him to say that they are not concerned with the cultural or sociological aspects is just sheer nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Moore talks about women. There is nothing about human rights for women in developing countries who are repeatedly giving birth to child after child. That is a danger to their health. Of course there are social and environmental problems; of course they need education. Many of these countries cannot put their funds into education. Because of the increasing population every year, the money that should go towards education cannot go there. Many of the Third World countries have an international debt; they are cutting back on their social welfare programs every year because of their increasing population. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member opposite is right when he says it is not just a population problem. I agree with that. It is a whole interrelated problem, and I am not going to say that one just takes the population issue out and deals with that. Of course one cannot. One has to, as the honourable member opposite rightly said, deal with the educational, sociological and environmental problems. One should go to India or any of the Asian countries-and Asia is the fastest growing part of the world-and ask people living in those countries what their human rights are today. One should go to India. Why do Indian men always want more and more sons? If India had a proper welfare system, they would have guarantees for their old age. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member opposite talked about China. I think that China has an enviable record. We are not talking about Australia's population. I am amazed that once again in this debate, it is mostly men talking about these programs. The real impact is always on women, but it is always men who deal with these matters. However, if one goes to any of these countries and talks about the population there, one will find that we are not putting our values on the people in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, we have not got a population problem. We are one of the countries whose population increase each year is coming from immigration, not from natural increase. We have a declining birth rate here. Yet I believe that because population is not an isolated Australian problem but an international problem, we must improve our contribution to solving it. Although we have contributed and over the last couple of years increased our contribution to the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities-we doubled it the year before last and we had another increase this year-still it is low by international standards. I believe we must lift that. There seems to me to be no doubt about that, when we start talking about these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot believe it when people start talking about the `human rights issues' of this matter. One does not have too many human rights if one is born into poverty and dies at the age of 30 still in poverty. There are not too many human rights attaching to people who are forced into prostitution to exist in these countries. If one observes the sex trade in Thailand or any of these places, one will be aware that that is a result of over-population. If we are going to talk about human rights, let us be assured that we know what we are talking about. When we start putting our values and start pontificating about what is wrong in these countries, let us not always put forward our own values-the values that are a luxury, a result of not having over-population. Let us not start putting these values on these people where overpopulation is a real problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We only have to look in our own region at Papua New Guinea. In Papua New Guinea, the birth rate is 3 per cent a year. One-third of the population of that country over the age of 15 is illiterate-and this is the International Year of Literacy. Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are among the fastest growing countries in the world. We know of the problems in Papua New Guinea but, unless adequate measures are taken, by the year 2015 the current population of Papua New Guinea of 3.9 million will be six million to nine million. We read in the papers every day about the problems in Papua New Guinea. We read about the `rascals'-the unemployed urban youth, often coming from the hinterland to the coastal cities. How much greater will that problem become, unless something can be done about the population situation in that country?</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I am a member of the Asia Forum on Population and Development and the third general assembly of that group was recently held in Bangkok in Thailand. I attended that meeting, as indeed did the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck), and I am sorry that he is not here to contribute to this debate today. At that meeting, the link between population growth and the environment was constantly made; people are realising this. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member opposite has quoted various experts from Bangladesh and so forth. I would have liked that expert from Bangladesh to have been at that general assembly with the Bangladeshi delegation-most of whom were Ministers-the Indian delegation and the Thai delegation. We can all trot out from our favourite bit of research facts, figures and statements to support our particular case. We can all do that, whatever the case is. It is not hard to dig out a quote to support an argument. But when one listens to the leading experts and politicians from other countries, one realises that these people are asking Australia and the United Nations to do more in those countries to help them in their population program. </PARA>
<PARA> If these people are going to advance at all to a decent standard of living, they cannot do it while their population is increasing every year at such massive rates. Malthus was talking about this 150 years ago. Surely, we have learned something. We have seen the population of the world increasing, doubling every 15 or 20 years. It is not a small increase that we are talking about; it is a massive increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The greenhouse effect can be seen even in places like Kiribati which, although it does not have a huge population, is densely populated. Something will have to be done in areas such as that. In Australia young people move from country towns to the cities. If one lives in Kiribati, the Cook Islands or somewhere like that all the young people leave to go to New Zealand or Australia. This is because there is not enough work there. It is wholly caused by overpopulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I agreed with the honourable member for Moore when he said that we cannot isolate population and that by controlling it that will be it. It is the major cause of all the other problems that he mentioned. I worry about the whole situation of human rights. In some countries I believe that there has been, if not coercion, a form of inducement to comply. When we are dealing with such huge populations sometimes there is no other answer. Japan is a good example of a country that has achieved population control. In countries where women enjoy a standard of education and literacy there is no need for these inducements for fertility control. This has been seen in Japan and, to a lesser extent, Korea. </PARA>
<PARA> I was talking only last week to the Assistant Director-General of the United Nations Fund for Population who was out here. It is a pity that many more members of parliament did not go to hear him talk. Two of us were there; this shows the interest in this place about this issue. He is a Japanese national. He made the point about how Japan had been successful. I raised with him the question of coercion. I suggest that the honourable member for Moore join the Australian branch of the Asia Forum for Population and Development. Maybe when we resume in this debate in the not too distant future his speech may be a little different from the speech he made in this chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the honourable member for Fraser and have great pleasure in supporting this very important motion that he has put forward. I think it is about time politicians in this place talked more about this international problem of population and development. </PARA>

The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) enthusiastically moved his motion and then left the House. If he was entirely serious about participating in the debate he might have remained to see what we had to say about his motion. I would have thought that this motion was extremely superficial. On the face of it, it may be rather appealing to talk about this problem in this way. When one looks beyond what is actually proposed I believe it has absolutely horrific ramifications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is ironic, when we look at the Notice Paper for today, that we find Notice No. 1 deals with the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill which has been moved by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). I would ultimately hope that that Bill will have the support of this House. What a contrast! In this place earlier we were talking about a Bill to prevent the funding of abortion within Australia; we are now talking about a scheme that ultimately will allow the spread of abortion in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about population control at its most base. As the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has said, we are talking about a violation of fundamental human rights. I find it astonishing that a nation such as Australia can not only continue to support but also increase its support for the methods employed by some other countries in population control schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the countries that we are talking about helping-some have been mentioned here this morning, such as China, in particular-have a deplorable human rights record. We are talking about increasing our support for schemes that violate the right of individuals to have control over what is done to their own bodies. Let us be even-handed about this. I am sure that the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) would be interested to see some balance here. For instance, in Indonesia we are talking about schemes which see men fleeing their villages and deserting their wives and children to avoid forced sterilisation. We are talking about schemes that force Chinese mothers to abandon their home to escape abortion or sterilisation under the strict government policy of one child per family. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I was looking at an article in the Canberra Times on 3 July dealing with what is actually happening in China under this scheme which we are supporting. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Chinese mothers are fleeing their homes to escape abortion or sterilisation under the strict government policy of one child per family, the People's Daily said today. </PARA>
<PARA> Government officials have previously denied allegations that the population-control policy includes compulsory abortion and sterilisation. </PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about an inhumane government regulation that would not be tolerated for one minute in this country. Yet we will stand by here and promote it and move in this House that we should not only support it but increase our support for it. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) calls on the Government to recognise the vital role of small business to the prosperity of the nation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns the Government for its policies which have caused the failure of small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>Particularly at this time of recession this Government must realise the vital role played by small business in our national economy. Small business comprises about 95 per cent of all enterprises. Small business is one of the largest single employers. There are over 750,000 small businesses, which include 150,000 small businesses in the farming sector. These small businesses operate in all sectors of the economy-in retail trades, finance, property, business, agriculture, construction and manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business often acts as the specialist supplier of parts and components to larger companies because it can produce these parts more effectively than the larger firms. Small business provides competition by offering a wide range of goods and services and highly specialised skills. Small business is such an important source of innovation in products, techniques and design. Most importantly, it provides the means of entry into business for new entrepreneurial talent. </PARA>
<PARA> One would think, especially in these tough times, that this Government would recognise the vital role played by small business. One would imagine that a government facing a gross foreign debt of $156,275m and growing, a severe downturn in our rural economy, with the predicted fall of net farm cash income of 32 per cent, still high inflation compared with our major trading partners in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, poor productivity, low savings and inefficient work practices would recognise the value of this large source of employment and the productive sector of our economy and that it would ensure that it was providing a stable, healthy economic structure in which to operate-that is, lessen excessive reliance on monetary policy, ensure that fiscal and income policies accept a greater share of the burden of restraint and actually achieve micro-economic reform instead of simply talking about that reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Never has it been more necessary for this Government to introduce micro-economic reform than right now. We on the Opposition benches will support the Government, if only it will show the resolve to initiate change. We are currently in recession-the one I remind this House that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) stated we had to have-a recession induced by this Government's economic policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. This policy has been responsible for unprecedented increases in small business and personal bankruptcies-a massive 32.7 per cent increase for the September quarter. In the Government's response to the report of the House standing committee examining the role of small business, entitled Small Business in Australia: Challenges, Problems and Opportunities, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A dynamic small business sector provides the engine for innovation, employment generation and growth in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister and his Government genuinely believe this, then why have they not addressed the principal findings and recommendations of this committee? Those findings identified a range of problems, from duplication of regulation, compliance, taxation, incorporation to industrial relations, as areas of major concern. At page 3 of the Government's response to that report, it says that it `seeks to set in place a results oriented package of measures to assist the small business sector'. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government for being prepared to make some decisions in regard to reviewing regulations, a strategy to reduce paper work and minimise costs, having greater consultation with small business organisations and to taking into account the impact new regulations will have on small business. But there are in fact 66 very worthwhile recommendations awaiting action. However, small businesses are struggling to survive today because this Government has failed to tackle the issues that are of most concern to small business: taxation reform and industrial relations reform. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the lack of taxation reform and industrial relations reform that prevents small business from functioning as efficiently as it might and impedes its growth potential in earning and employment capacity. It was the complexity of taxation issues-income tax, company tax, provisional tax, sales tax, capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, superannuation and trading stock valuation-that most concerned those numerous small business representatives who made submissions on problems facing small business. But all this Government has been prepared to do is make administrative changes. Pay as you earn tax collections and some sales tax collections can now be made on a quarterly basis rather than a monthly basis. </PARA>
<PARA> There is still no decision to assist developing, innovative small businesses in regard to roll-over of capital gains tax. There is no incentive whatsoever for a small business that begins as a concept, develops into a thriving industry, provides employment, continues to invest and expand, pays income tax at hefty rates throughout this period and then pays capital gains tax on the sale of that business. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 5 of the Government's response to the small business inquiry, headed `Taxation Reform', is indeed an illuminating chapter because it focuses on this Government's real position-its lack of commitment to small business. The Government's response to the problems small business faces with roll-over capital gains tax is:</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer and the Minister for Small Business and Customs will continue discussions on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Government's response to the problems of the holding costs of stock, income averaging, company and provisional tax, employee share acquisition schemes, superannuation and business establishment costs. There is certainly plenty of rhetoric contained in the pages of the Government's response, but that is about all there is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is continuing to discuss the 21 recommendations made by the committee dealing with taxation matters affecting small business. If this Government was sincere in its stated commitment to simplify the tax system, from both an administrative and equitable viewpoint, it would start to tackle these problems now. Instead, it is procrastinating with further discussions, more reports, more administration, more bureaucracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly: this government has done nothing. The small business sector needs urgent action that will increase productivity and competition and provide incentive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well as taxation reform, small business urgently needs reform of our industrial relations system. I recently visited a shoe factory in Russia that was a joint venture between the then West German Government and the Soviet Union. I could hardly believe what I was hearing when the manager of the factory announced that the workers were paid bonuses. I asked what criteria were used to determine who was paid a bonus. The answer was those who increased production and maintained quality and safety in the workplace. Here was a shoe factory in Russia embracing the market economy and moving away from centralised control of workers. What a contrast to the centralised, fixed labour market decisions and of the deals done between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is such a paradox here that at a time when membership of trade unions is diminishing-in fact only 32 per cent of those working in the private sector belong to a union-employers are locked into accepting award payments, work practices, conditions, hours of work, et cetera, having had little or no consultation in the highly centralised process of industrial relations. Yet there is an alternative to this approach, and that is employer and employee reaching a voluntary agreement on the terms and conditions affecting their particular enterprise. Such a voluntary agreement was made at Power Brewing in Queensland. This agreement resulted in an 85 per cent increase in productivity with the workers earning $8,000 to $10,000 per annum more than their counterparts working elsewhere and the company gaining 20 per cent of the Queensland beer market. </PARA>
<PARA> The underlying principle of these enterprise agreements is that there must be a close relationship between what workers are paid and what they produce. Enterprise agreements would allow better use of capital assets. In many countries overseas, industries are able to utilise their plant fully; they are not restricted to a four-day week. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government would actually reform our transport system, instead of holding discussions about reform, small business would benefit from not having to hold large reserves of stock. It would be able to use the more efficient and less costly system of just-in-time inventory management. That is just one example of how small business would benefit from micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the lack of resolve of the Government to initiate the 66 recommendations of the Beddall report, and in particular those 21 recommendations relating to taxation issues, but also the failure of this Government to change the economic policies that have caused this country to sink into recession. It is this lack of direction that has caused the demise of both urban and rural small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> The bankruptcy figures for small business are increasing and there is a flow-on effect from contracting big business-subcontractors, for example. Unemployment figures are increasing. One of the unfair aspects of this recession is that the public sector is protected at the expense of the private sector. We are witnessing the collapse of thousands of small businesses, and that, in both economic and human terms, is a tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> But an additional problem is developing for small business, and that is the decline in business investment that is required to ensure the future viability of the private sector. We are witnessing, as I said, the collapse of many small businesses, largely because the monetary policy of this Government has produced high interest rates and an inflation rate well above those of our trading partners that has in turn produced a reduced cash flow and low levels of profitability for small business. Interest and tax payments in the current economic climate barely allow small business to remain solvent. What incentive is there for reinvestment?</PARA>
<PARA> The policies of this Government are causing the failure of small business. In economic terms, we have lost valuable productive units; in human terms, we have lost the skill and expertise of thousands. How many small businesses have to add to the growing statistics before this Government will, firstly, change the direction of its macro-economic policy and, secondly, introduce real micro-economic reform and initiate the recommendations of its own parliamentary committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, in its inquiry into small business? That is necessary not only to ensure the survival of small business but to provide the economic framework in which it can grow. How else are we as a nation to trade our way out of debt and build for the future?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am rather appreciative that the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) has moved this motion because it not only gives an opportunity for Government members to bring information forward as a history lesson for the honourable member for McEwen but also allows me to say that not only does this Government recognise the vital role that small business has had in the development of this nation, but also, since coming to office in 1983, this Government has worked towards creating an environment conducive to small business growth in Australia by implementing policies which recognise the important and major role small business plays in our Australian economy. Even Opposition members would recognise that if we are to have such debates, honest information must be represented before the House. I will, for the information of honourable members opposite, supply them with some history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1983 we have had the deregulation of the financial system, which has resulted in small business having greater access to finance as opposed to the pre-deregulation period when funds were not readily available to many, especially to the middle income earner. The Labor Government floated the Australian dollar and removed the exchange controls. Small businesses were given greater opportunities to expand into overseas markets through enhanced price competitiveness. In 1985 this Labor Government began a series of cuts to the personal tax rate, reducing it from 60 per cent to 47 per cent, and reducing the company rate from 49 per cent to 39 per cent. This Hawke Labor Government brought that action in, and it resulted in an increase in internal funds available to small business to finance growth. In 1983 this Labor Government recognised that real unit labour costs had fallen by 10.6 per cent, enabling the gross profit share to increase from an average of 27.3 per cent in the years 1973 to 1983 to 34.4 per cent from 1984 to 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> It was Labor which established direct consultative links between small business and the government and implemented a range of support programs. In 1984 we established the Small Business Council, whose functions included providing a forum for consultation for small business, identifying major development problems for small business, advising the Minister for Small Business and Customs on policies to minimise impediments to the establishment and development of small business enterprises and, particularly, advising the Minister on matters referred by him to the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Later I will mention Labor's fourth term and the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology inquiry into small business-the Beddall report-which has been mentioned in the debate, but in its first term in office Labor developed schemes to help small business industry. They included the new enterprise incentive, the scheme aimed at encouraging the formation of new small enterprises through joint assistance from Federal and State governments. It was never heard of until the Hawke Labor Government came to office in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The export market development grants scheme was devised to assist Australian firms in seeking out and developing new export markets and sales. The scheme was again amended in 1985 to improve its cost effectiveness and to target it more closely at small and medium sized exporters. The scheme is again being updated and amended. In fact, proposals are before the Senate now to bring it more up to date with current changes. We are not stopping still; we are continually moving. </PARA>
<PARA> It was under the Labor Government in 1987 that the National Industry Extension Service was established. This service is based on bilateral agreements between the States and the Commonwealth. It coordinates, rationalises and works on improving Commonwealth and State extension services to small and medium sized businesses with potential for growth in internationally traded goods. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 we saw the launching of the national small business information and awareness program (NIAP), aimed at establishing small business extension services and increasing the use of small business advisory programs. The program involves both the Commonwealth and State governments, as well as five private sector organisations-the Australian Bankers Association, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia, the Australian Society of Accountants, Business In The Community Pty Ltd, and the Law Council of Australia. NIAP was developed by the National Industry Extension Service and has been particularly successful in Victoria, where a number of pilot projects have been running and will be running during 1990 and 1991-and thank goodness they are reaching success in that State at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANZ, Commonwealth, State and Westpac banks are all involved in the NIAP pilot projects, which are aimed at improving local networks between banks, lawyers, accountants and other business support and information providers to help to advise small business. </PARA>
<PARA> The new enterprise incentive scheme was also introduced by the Labor Government in 1985-86. The honourable member for McEwen, having been in small business, surely would recognise that. That is still successfully operating, even today. That scheme aims to assist unemployed people receiving social security benefits in establishing self-employment ventures through the provision of a comprehensive package of assistance. That scheme operates as a partnership between the Commonwealth, State or Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time, as has been acknowledged by the honourable member for McEwen, an inquiry was undertaken by a Federal parliamentary committee whose report, Small Business in Australia: Challenges, Problems and Opportunities, also known as the Beddall report, was referred to in glowing terms by the editor of the Australian Small Business Review, Peter Thorpe. That reference was made not last year, not last month, but in November, in the current issue that the honourable member surely must have read. For her information and for the information of other Opposition members, I will quote from that article. Mr Thorpe said the Beddall report:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is the most comprehensive study of small business ever undertaken in this country. It has covered everything from the regulations small business operates under, through taxation, superannuation, training, marketing, access to information and advice and industrial relations. It also examined the impact of Government policies on small business, compared to larger businesses. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Thorpe then praised the Hawke Labor Government's initiative in appointing the Chairman of the Standing Committee, our colleague on this side of the House, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), to the position of Minister for Small Business and Customs. Mr Thorpe went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This is the first time the head of a parliamentary committee has been given the job of Minister, to carry out recommendations he was responsible for making . . . The move was largely welcomed by the small business community around Australia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are his words, not mine. They were printed in the November issue of Australian Small Business Review. There is a general feeling that at last we have someone in a position of influence who not only understands the major problems of small business but has been a small business man himself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Beddall report has made a number of recommendations, but the Government has put in initiatives designed to assist and stimulate small business activity in Australia, and we have certainly started to put those into practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what followed the  1990-91 Budget initiative. One reform is that the wholesale sales tax law will be amended from 1 August 1991 to allow businesses whose wholesale sales tax liability is $50,000 or less to pay that tax quarterly instead of monthly. It was not mentioned by the honourable member for McEwen that this will benefit 80 per cent of sales tax payers. Another tax reform announced in the Budget which is aimed at reducing the burden of compliance for small businesses is the increase in the threshold for exemption from quarterly payments for fringe benefits tax payers. Again, it was not mentioned by the honourable member for McEwen that more than 70,000 small businesses will now be able to make annual payments with effect from the financial benefit taxation year commencing on 1 April 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Simplifying tax law and administration to reduce compliance and reporting costs for small business is a high priority of this Hawke Labor Government. Major reviews by the Australian Taxation Office of the sales tax administrative system and compliance costs relating particularly to small business have already begun. That is not rhetoric but action. The Australian Taxation Office is also establishing small business liaison committees in branch offices, aimed at increasing consultation with small business communities. Committees have already been established in the branch offices in Adelaide and in Newcastle, which is in my State. A small business coordination group is also being established by the Australian Taxation Office to contribute to guidance and coordination of small business initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Beddall report, our Labor Government is also taking action on rationalising government regulations and simplifying licensing procedures for small businesses; organising a coordinated response to franchising, retail tenancy and other small business concerns; and achieving greater cooperation in the delivery of management training and advice to small business proprietors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government recognises that, although high interest rates and the slow-down in the economy have made it very hard for small business, an easing in interest rates and an improved inflationary situation will now help small business and emphasise the importance of communication between government and small business to ensure an environment conducive to small business success and growth. </PARA>
<PARA> To promote better communication between the Government and the small business industry, a national small business forum was held in Melbourne last week-not last month or next year-between the Minister for Small Business and Customs, the Small Business Council and relevant business and professional organisations. The forum examined issues of common concern within the sector and was, as all acknowledged, a great success. </PARA>
<PARA> The first annual meeting of State and Commonwealth small business Ministers will take place this month and aims to get a commitment from the Ministers for a more coordinated approach to small business issues. This meeting will provide a vital mechanism for progressing many of the recommendations of the Beddall report. I know that my time is limited, but I believe that this is so important, there is so much to be said, that one has to have a debate that has all the facts before the Parliament, not just one person's interpretation of them. There are major reforms in the Beddall report that are not only being implemented but have been acknowledged and will be put into place. A major forum for business suppliers and government purchasers, Meet the Buyers-Canberra 1990, was held in November as a result again of a recommendation in the Beddall report. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on for at least another four pages about what has already been achieved as a result of the Beddall report and the action of the Minister and the Hawke Labor Government. But in winding up, I think it will suffice to put to rest some of the furphies put forward by the honourable member for McEwen during her contribution to the debate. The information is contained in the report of the operation of the Bankruptcy Act, tabled in this Federal Parliament this week. If she failed to read that, the information was also listed in the Sydney Morning Herald today, which states that there were 5,546 non-business bankruptcies granted in 1989-90, compared with 2,947 for businesses. That is a ratio of nearly 2:1 and compares with the 57 per cent of businesses and 43 per cent of non-businesses in 1972-73. Any bankruptcy is a disaster for the country, but the facts and information provided show the full story of what is happening with small business and how this Hawke Labor Government, through the implementation of its program, is assisting small business and will continue to recognise the vital input that it makes to the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to try to bring some truth into the argument. Perhaps the previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), should go back to her electorate and have a look at the problems that people are facing on a daily basis. They are not interested in the litany of quangos existing today that have arisen since 1983 under the Hawke Government; they are all still there. Small business has been routed and has nearly gone; it is on its knees. We have witnessed since 1983 new taxes and the destruction of small businesses. How times have changed. How can the honourable member for Prospect be so deceived as to present the arguments that she did?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) for her explanation of the difficulties facing small business in Australia today. Let us get to the seriousness of the argument where we talk about what is happening today. There has been a rise in bankruptcies of 30 per cent across Australia. Let us look at what is happening in my State of Victoria, where, according to the Age of 2 October, bankruptcies are rising by 70.6 per cent. Today's Australian quotes the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . lack of skills among business people was more to blame for present business failures than the recession. </PARA>
<PARA>Poor skills was the main cause for bankruptcy, with economic conditions rating ``a poor third''.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister should tell the new group of people who have lost their jobs in Victoria, where the Dandenong Commonwealth Employment Service office is recording people putting in applications for unemployment benefits to the tune of 100 a day. Every member of this House knows that those people are not coming out of the Government supported big businesses like Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and other allied industries but are coming out of small businesses that are closing down on a daily basis. In every member's electorate there are empty shops and people who no longer have jobs. Do not tell me that interest rates are not a cause of that; every member of the House would know that over the past year-after deregulation in 1983-small businesses paid above the rate, not below the rate. Someone had to pick up the charge, and who picked it up? Small business in Australia. That is who picked up the charge. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about bankruptcies, but that is not the end of the story. Let us talk about all those people who decided to close down their businesses because they could not go on, they could not make the payments. Let us talk about the anguish of the owners of those businesses who had employed people for a long time and who know the names of the wife or husband and children of their employees. The blood of those businesses is on the Hawke Government. The honourable member for Prospect should not talk to me about what the Hawke Government has done to small business. The Government has increased taxes left, right and centre. There is no money at all left for those small businesses to reinvest. Many of them will never start again. Those people have suffered great anguish. In fact, I go further and say that there is anger out there. How many on the other side of this House have ever lain awake wondering how they were going to pay their wage bill the next day?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MT4">Mr BROADBENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I do know the honourable member for Prospect well enough to say that she has probably lain awake on many nights. I hope that since she was elected to this House, she is still lying awake on behalf of all those who have lost their businesses this year. This is a tragedy facing Australia. This is not just some blimp on the skyline; this is a tragedy. Anybody who has been in small business will know that it is closely aligned with the people who work for it. There is real anger out there. Small business people are saying, `Why should it be my business and my staff that have to lose their jobs or be put off because of this engineered recession that we just had to have?'. Honourable members should go to Victoria and see street after street after street of empty shops. People had viable businesses, but interest rates have broken them down day after day after day. They were meeting those commitments. The Minister says that these people cannot make any money, that these people are bad business managers. This is how much he cares. Small business people in Australia are sick of government reports, of quangos that are set up supposedly to help them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us talk about small business. Small business in Australia is often a family business or a husband and wife working together and then employing people in that business and trying to expand it. A business cannot grow when interest rates are 25 per cent. That is what we have done to Australia-let us be fair; we have wiped people out. While the Government is prepared to pay its advisers an extra 30 per cent, the people in my electorate are losing their jobs. Yes, I lie awake at night thinking about the issue. There is a lot of disappointment out there. People are disappointed with this Government that they put in office in 1983. I am one of those people who say, `Australia, we put them in and now we are suffering the consequences of just that'. I am angry; it has probably come out in what I have said today. I am angry that a lot of businesses like mine are struggling today. People are hurting and many will have the toughest Christmas that they have had since the Second World War. That is exactly what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Retail business, especially in Australia, has been in a slump which, in my opinion, started about 18 months ago. Yet it is only now that this Government has finally realised that there is a problem out there, that the damage is so far gone that people are losing their jobs day after day. We have a problem. I plead with the Government to begin to address this problem. Now is the time to address it; we can wait no longer. We do not want dole queues. People want to be able to use their talents and time in employment; they do not want a handout. It is time for me to sit down, but I say to the Government that a whole lot of people in two years will stand up and say, `Gotcha!'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak against this proposition, but there are a few observations I will make before I get into the detail of what I want to talk about. First of all, the speech by the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) was quite good, and indeed it should be-most of it derived from the Government's report produced in January 1990 by the then back bench Chairman of the Committee and the present Minister for Small Business and Customs, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a very good report. It contains lots of information and very good propositions about what this Government should do with respect to small business policy. The honourable member for McEwen comes in today and says that that is what we should do. She is three years out of date. The other fact is that there are approximately 66 recommendations in this report and this Government is working its way through them. These propositions have been welcomed by the small business community of this country. Sixty-six propositions cannot be introduced overnight, so we are working our way through them. The small business community of this country knows that. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I would like to deal with before getting into some more substantial items is the proposition that this Government should introduce micro-economic reform. We have been introducing micro-economic reform for 7 1/2 years. When the opportunities arise to dismantle the dirigisme, the regulated economy, that these turkeys opposite constructed during three decades of rule of this country, we seize those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take some examples. When opposition members were in government, a report recommended that they deregulate the finance sector. What did they do? They did nothing. We came in and deregulated the finance sector. As soon as the opportunity arose for us to dismantle the inefficient, regulated two-airline policy, which has maintained an overhigh rate of air fares for Australians-honourable members opposite, businessmen, small business people and private travellers-we deregulated it and thus the price of air transport is coming down. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to tariffs, which Government has steadily reduced the rate of tariffs in this country in order to produce cheaper imports for consumers and small business? This Government. What party is capable of introducing micro-economic reform and has a record of doing so? The Australian Labor Party. What did the Opposition do in office? It talked and regulated. There was no reform and no attention was given to small business. Who produced the definitive report on small business? The Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter to which I draw attention is this proposition that it is the Australian Labor Party's macro-economic policies that are producing small business failures. Let us have a look at the proposition with respect to the report which the Minister tabled only yesterday and which, apparently, no-one on that side of the House has bothered to read. The businesses were asked to submit the causes of their bankruptcy. I picked the report up and thought, `Here is some objective evidence as to why small business goes out of business'. I can listen to the speeches from honourable members opposite and from members on our side or I can read the testimony of those owners of small business who find themselves liquidated. What do the small business people say? What is the first cause they give? Six hundred and twenty said lack of business ability. What can be done about lack of business ability? Obviously, one does not vote for the Liberal Party; one tries to introduce schemes whereby people who want to enter business get trained with the necessary skills in order to ensure that they stay in business and hopefully become big business. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we initiated? We have initiated an extensive review of the education system in this country from secondary schools through technical and further education to the university system to enhance the training of business people. Of course we have-everyone knows that. If people bothered to read our policy pronouncements they would know that last week the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) announced a massive expansion of university studies and research into business studies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) recognises the importance of the citrus industry to the social and economic life of regional Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) remove developing country status and tariff concessions from Brazil, the world's major citrus producer;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) immediately introduce anti-dumping and countervailing legislation which is fast and reliable;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) remove sales tax from all fruit juice products;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) stop the abuses of labelling, packaging and quality regulations which are confusing the consumer and harming the producer; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) streamline and make applicable to the operation of the Food Standards Committee, commercial practicalities and technological development. </PARA>
<PARA>We all recognise the advantages of a free trading system. The theory is impeccable, but in practice world trade is neither free nor fair. Every form of protection, subsidisation and market corruption is rife and generally is increasing, despite the best efforts of governments and members of the Cairns Group to bring some sense into General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> But this House cannot simply sit back and wait for changes to occur. Australian rural industry is facing an unprecedented crisis, the economic structure of our rural industries is crumbling and rapidly affecting the social fabric that has bound together and carried them through droughts, low prices and volatile markets in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion specifically refers to the citrus industry, but applies generally to many Australian industries the viability of which is under threat from the smorgasbord of imported food entering our markets at cheap and subsidised prices. It is not just the issue of consumer access to cheap imported food. The effect on our economy in the city as in the country on the transport and processing sector and on workers will be serious if agricultural industries are weakened or closed down. </PARA>
<PARA> There is more than a touch of madness in our trade and tariff policies. On the one hand, governments praise the efficiency and productive capacity of primary industry but, on the other hand, tariffs and other forms of protection of this sector have to be reduced to a level lower than 10 per cent. However, similar changes have not been made to tariffs and costs on our inputs-machinery, chemicals, fuel and water-so there is no level playing field. The open door trade policies are not just squeezing our competitiveness on overseas markets, but now on the domestic market as well. We have today become the repository for many nations' imports of cheap, subsidised, often low quality surpluses and the list grows daily. All this is at a time when Australian farmers plough their produce back into the soil or cannot afford to pick it. </PARA>
<PARA> Citrus fruit production in 1991 will be close to 600,000 fresh tonnes. It is a vital regional industry, and in the Murray Valley some 700 citrus growers produce crops in excess of $80m. The marketing of the crop varies from season to season, but approximately 5 per cent goes to fresh exports, 40 per cent of the crop to the fresh domestic market and some 55 per cent of the crop is processed into juice. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia produces but 1.26 per cent of total world citrus production, while Brazil produces 26.6 per cent. Imports of citrus juice into Australia have had a massive influence on Australian growers' viability. In the 12 months ending June 1990 imports from various countries were worth in excess of $8m. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a chart showing this level of imports. </PARA>

These prices are clearly unsustainable and if immediate action is not forthcoming from the Government financial ruin will be the result of years of effort by many growers and their families.</PARA></TALK.START>

Not only is Brazil the largest world producer, but much of its production is a result of massive amounts of German and United States foreign investment. The United States does not grant developing country status to Brazil; neither should we. The question of labelling of products which are being sold in Australia from overseas has become an increasing problem. These subsidised food products are flooding our market and now account for 10 per cent of our current account deficit, and are causing great harm to our farmers and horticultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Dishonest labelling practices by importers are rife. Australians would prefer to buy Australian goods, but it is almost impossible to identify them. I acknowledge the excellent promotion exercise carried out in Melbourne last week by our horticultural industries and the apparent positive response from the Victorian Government, and I believe that a deputation which we have had this morning to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, will also have a similar positive outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to refer to the loophole in the law which allows imported ingredients to be processed into other products and then labelled `Produce of Australia'. For example, imported fruit juice concentrate can be imported, mixed with Australian water and labelled `Product of Australia'. Efforts are also being made to introduce a code of practice for the fruit juice industry which is aimed at eradicating adulteration and dilution of fruit juices and other unfair practices at the processing level. It is expected that this code will be in operation early next year. However, on the other hand, the introduction of food regulations aimed at simplifying the present complicated and inefficient system is making slow progress and is in fact hindering the industry's attempt at restructuring and self-help. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know in this House that the imposition of a sales tax on all fruit juice products will add to the burden of an already stressed industry. An exemption is therefore sought by the industry for the removal of the tax on 100 per cent fruit juice containing not less than 25 per cent by volume of Australian juice. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the most significant point in this motion, concerning the anti-dumping and countervailing legislation. I acknowledge the work of my colleague Senator Ron Boswell in successfully establishing a Senate inquiry into this issue and I refer the House to the Senate Hansard of 6 November, page 3486, for the detail. The current anti-dumping legislation is time consuming, cumbersome, prohibitively costly and biased against industries with a long production time and fluctuating cost structures. This inquiry's investigations are urgent and must be completed as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue is not one of erecting trade or tariff barriers. Our future well-being is dependent on two-way trade, but a trade that is fair and uncorrupted by subsidisation. Growers are currently being told by the Government that their answer to the rising flood of imported foods is in anti-dumping and countervailing legislation. Again this is fine in theory, but it simply does not work out in practice. In the first instance, an industry has to suffer material damage before a case can even begin. The Australian Customs Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority can take anything up to 295 days to decide whether the case is positive, and this is far too long. Cash securities can be applied only after the case has been under way for almost five months, and well after the case has been accepted as positive. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference of this inquiry suggest that these securities should be applied after a preliminary positive case has been determined, that is, after an initial 55-day period. If the Anti-Dumping Authority agrees with the producer that material damage has been suffered and the product has been dumped, then a duty should be imposed on the incoming goods. However, the producer now has to take that case back through the entire process every three years to have the market situation reassessed, otherwise the imposed duty automatically expires. </PARA>
<PARA> This also is time consuming and expensive and it can take up to $200,000 simply to re-establish a dumping duty. Many Australian primary producers and their industries simply cannot afford to do this every three years. The necessity, therefore, for these sunset clauses must be questioned in this inquiry. In many situations a case also has to be mounted against the importers of the processed product, usually a major retailer who is also the main customer of the Australian canner, and the retailer is often reluctant to take on its customers in court. By the time a case has been prepared and presented and the Australian Customs Service has made a decision on it, so much damage can be done to one of our industries that it is simply not worth the money, or the trouble, and it walks away from initiating such a case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that anti-dumping and countervailing legislation was made to work to the benefit of the Australian producer, not the importers, and to give them adequate protection. We must have a mechanism that can immediately identify dumped products and suspend distribution until such time that the exporter proves the authenticity of the quoted f.o.b. value. This, in effect, would place the onus of proof where it should lie- with the perpetrator, rather than the victim. </PARA>
<PARA> Many members of this House this morning attended the last great Aussie breakfast outside Parliament House. This morning we saw the diversity, the quality and the value of Australia's horticultural production. It is second to none and better than most. Most industries have been through a continuing process of restructuring, of improved irrigation and farming practice, and of market diversity. We must support their efforts to maintain their viability and their productivity and so continue to contribute to the well-being of the nation. It is a disgrace that these highly productive people are forced on to the streets to protest in order to survive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Michael Tate, announced that there would be compulsory labelling regulations introduced for not only orange juice but also apple juice, pineapple juice, and all other fruit juices and fruit juice products. The change in regulations will make it compulsory to show a declaration on the package of any juice, or juice product, to identify the country or countries of origin. Also, a declaration must be made in the case of mixes; in other words, products that have both Australian and imported juices in them. So we have now an opportunity for consumer preference; an opportunity for consumers to make their mind up. I am sure, with the strengthening of marketing and promotion, that more and more people will simply choose Australian products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is expected that the amendments to the food standards code will be gazetted early next year. This also gives ample time for importers and distributors to make the necessary changes to their packaging arrangements. Today, the Minister for Consumer Affairs announced that he will be calling on all the State Health Ministers to support his initiative in having country of origin labelling on all food products, both fresh and processed. I think that, too, is a remarkable landmark, and it is very important because it is not only the citrus industry that has raised some of these problems; of course, it is also the fruit and vegetable industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very proud to say that Bundaberg, my home town, is the leading centre in Australia for horticulture. I had a meeting only recently with fruit and vegetable producers and they raised their concerns in regard to food products coming in from other countries. If they are labelled, and I am sure that all State governments will support this initiative, then we will again have the opportunity for all mums and dads in the supermarkets to say, `We want to buy the Aussie product', that people will not be conned by the slick labelling of the past, where it says `Product of Australia' when it has only been packaged in Australia and the product has been imported from another country. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this is a landmark decision. I do recognise that when this motion was formulated the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) would not have been aware that this initiative was about to come forward, and I think that everyone on all sides of the House would support the initiative of Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are approximately 3,500 citrus growers in Australia, mainly small farmers located in the Riverland, the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, Sunraysia, and of course at Gayndah and Mundubbera in my region. There is an expanding citrus industry, too, in the Emerald region. In fact, I believe that there is going to be a very large production of citrus coming out of the Emerald region over the next few years. Of course, that means that we need to look not only to the domestic market and holding our market share here in this country but also to expanding our export potential, because that is where the future for Australian primary products lies-overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many concerns raised in regard to the developing country tariff preference. The removal of developing country status from Brazil effectively would mean an increase in tariff. In my view, this would be contrary to the Government's trade and industry policy on the need for industries to attain international competitiveness. Also, I feel it would be prejudicial to Australia's position in the Uruguay Round negotiations. I recognise, as we all do, the seriousness of the intransigence of the European Economic Community at the present time, but it is in our interests, more than any other primary producing country, to ensure that we get the best opportunity to gain fairer trade because some 80 per cent of our farm product has to be sold overseas. I would like to point out that both Australia and Brazil are members of the Cairns Group who, as fair traders, stand to gain enormously from any trade liberalisation outcome that could be achieved through those negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the short time allotted I will not take up much more of the time of the House. I do recognise that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) wants to make a contribution, too. However, I would just like to stress that the initiatives taken by Senator Michael Tate last week, and again today, are going to play a very positive role in regard to the fruit and vegetable industry, as well as the citrus industry. I think they will be welcomed by everybody, but again it does not contradict our position of arguing through the Cairns Group for freer trade. In other words, we are allowing consumers to make the choice instead of putting up walls of protection. Surely, if we look at history, it has been shown that protective barriers only work in the long term against the interests of the very country that hides behind them. As I said last night in the House, Europe will regret the position it has taken on protection because it is creating inefficiency in its own countries. Those countries are showing that they are cowards when it comes to decency and integrity in free trade. </PARA>

<PARA> There has been a popular view, Mr Deputy Speaker, that honourable members on this side of the House have been as guilty as those on the Government side in regard to the attitude that we have taken to a free trade policy. I just want, in a couple of minutes, to make a point or two about that. I want to acknowledge that I stand as part of a coalition that has been proudly consistent in the way in which it has dealt with all primary products, particularly horticultural products. We have stood here for freer trade, and we stand here for fairer trade. I want you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to compare our stand with the bloody-minded and cheap approach taken by the Australian Democrats, who would tear both of the major parties apart, and I want you, too, to compare our stand with the stand taken by the Australian Labor Party when it was in opposition. I want to remind the House that the ALP in opposition, through the now Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), had the sheer barefaced audacity to say in 1983 to citrus growers in Griffith, in the electorate of the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks):</PARA>
<PARA>The citrus industry is threatened by the Fraser Government's decision to reduce its protection. A Labor Government will maintain existing protection levels. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for a promise from the ALP. Never will either of these coalition parties be guilty, in opposition, of saying something they were not prepared to deliver in government. Citrus growers might do well to remember that, tough as things are now, from these parties they got some realistic protection-protection that was levelling down, it is true, but nonetheless they got it. I say that with conviction, because I was a citrus grower at the time. These parties have stood for recognising the essential role that horticultural industries play, not only in the Australian domestic market but also in generating export income for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On first arriving in this place, I was pleased to hear the commitment of both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to lifting the standard of behaviour and the resulting quality of debate in this place. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister state, and I quote from Hansard of 8 May 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>There is on us all a responsibility which we have not met as often as we should have. That responsibility is to give to this Parliament its proper status as a forum which commands respect within the community. We can expect that respect only if we earn it through the relevance of what we discuss and conduct those discussions in a positive and constructive spirit</PARA>
<PARA>With such promises in mind, I was therefore dismayed when I witnessed the outrageous behaviour of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) during Question Time on 15 November 1990. Responding to a question from his own back bench regarding the changing diplomatic situation between Australia and South Africa, the Prime Minister launched into an unprovoked and unnecessary attack upon the Leader of the Opposition. Further, the Prime Minister, in answering a question relating to South Africa, had the temerity to use this time to embark upon a sordid attack on Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war and Indo-China. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought we had scraped the bottom of the barrel when we heard the Prime Minister accusing members on this side of the House of being responsible for the loss of young Australian lives because of political opportunism. But the worst was yet to come. This House was to witness the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs interject with the disgraceful comments, `You never went yourself. None of you went' and `They are on your heads, all those deaths'. </PARA>
<PARA> The behaviour of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs deserves the condemnation of this House. My objections to the outbursts of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs are threefold. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the Prime Minister's abuse of Question Time, especially when the question emanates from one of his own backbench, is total hypocrisy when one considers his statement in this House of 8 May 1990. Let me repeat the words of the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>The responsibility is to give to this Parliament its proper status as a forum which commands respect within the community--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! It is inappropriate for the honourable member to refer to the Prime Minister's `total hypocrisy'. He will withdraw, please.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IT4">Mr ATKINSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will withdraw that remark. I continue the words of the Prime Minister:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The responsibility is to give to this Parliament its proper status as a forum which commands respect within the community. We can expect that respect only if we earn it through the relevance of what we discuss and conduct those discussions in a positive and constructive spirit. </PARA>
<PARA>How can anyone take these comments seriously when we see such blatant examples of the Prime Minister abusing Question Time? His comments to which I referred earlier were not relevant, nor were they positive, nor were they said in a constructive spirit. The Prime Minister's conduct fell short of his goal of lifting the respect with which the nation views this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The behaviour of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs during Question Time on 15 November was not a case in isolation. Indeed, since arriving in this place I have been appalled at the way in which the Government has abused Question Time. On many occasions we have seen Question Time corrupted by longwinded answers which have had no relevance to the question. So often answers are tarnished by abuse and personal attacks. Question Time has been corrupted by dorothy dixers being used as a device for what are really ministerial statements. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to interjections by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, I wrote to the Prime Minister on 22 November 1990 expressing my disappointment at the actions of his Minister. I expressed my belief that the Minister's actions were unbecoming of a Minister of the Crown and I urged the Prime Minister to ask the Minister to withdraw his comments. I seek leave to table a copy of my letter to the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IT4">Mr ATKINSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have not had a reply from the Prime Minister at this stage. However, the Minister has approached me privately to offer assurances that he had not intended to insult any individual in the House with respect to service in the armed forces in Vietnam. Whilst I thank the Minister for his private assurances, the Minister's interjections are recorded in Hansard and are therefore on public record, and I believe that the Minister should correct the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My second objection to the Prime Minister's behaviour on 15 November concerns his selective interpretation of history. Certainly the decision to commit Australian troops to Vietnam belonged to the coalition government of the day, but that is only part of the very long story. The Prime Minister should be careful when he so carelessly blames the coalition government of the day for the loss of young Australian lives. Is this not the same Prime Minister who was a senior player in the Australian trade union movement and the Labor Party which supported anti-war moratoriums, advocated the burning of draft cards, and invoked union action against the supply ships Boonaroo and Jeparit; all of this while young Australians were serving their country in a combat zone?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's selective interpretation of history does not, it would seem, include the confusion and dismay experienced by young Australians serving in Vietnam as a result of the anti-war movement back home. The Australian Labor Party and the union movement have much to answer for for the manner in which they treated young men who served in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost 21 years ago-in fact, on 15 December 1969-Bob Hawke, as he was then, addressed delegates from about 30 left wing unions at a meeting called by the Melbourne anticonscription committee, not long before he became Federal President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. According to his biographer, John Hurst, he spoke strongly against the war, declaring that no Australian with any sense of decency would tolerate Australia's involvement in the Vietnam holocaust. </PARA>
<PARA> After he left the meeting, a provocative resolution was passed calling on national servicemen in South Vietnam to lay down their arms in mutiny against the heinous barbarism perpetrated in our name upon innocent aged men, women and children. Yet now we have the Prime Minister attempting to divorce himself and his colleagues from the Vietnam days. The men who served in Vietnam will long remember his contribution. Indeed, I was one of those young men serving in the Australian forces, in fact in an infantry battalion, at that very time. I believe that his comments were totally out of order. </PARA>
<PARA> My third objection to the events of 15 November relates to the incorrect statement of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs:</PARA>
<PARA>You never went yourself. None of you went</PARA>
<PARA>In my letter to the Prime Minister, which I have tabled, I made the point that the Minister should acquaint himself with the facts before making inaccurate statements. The Minister should be aware that 32 members of the present Parliament list military service in their curricula vitae and I am aware that at least three members-the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and myself-have served in Vietnam. We can only pray that our servicemen now serving in the Gulf receive greater support from the Labor Party left wing than our troops did in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> The difference between the Labor Party and the coalition while in opposition is very clear. Unlike the disgraceful behaviour of the Labor Party during the 1960s and 1970s, we as an opposition have offered bipartisan support to the Government for its military commitment in the Gulf. Young Australians serving their country in the Gulf will have every confidence that they have not only the support of the Government but also the support of the Opposition and the vast majority of ordinary Australians. In contrast to the Labor Party in opposition, we on this side of the House will continue to play a positive and constructive role in this debate. We will not allow political opportunism to cloud our judgment and our commitment to the well-being of our service personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I remind the House of the words of the Leader of the Opposition on 8 May 1990 in response to the Prime Minister's commitment to lift parliamentary standards:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the standard of parliamentary conduct has continued to decline and possibly reached its lowest level in memory during the last Parliament. Members of the public, rightly, are appalled by the personal attacks and by the bad language that so frequently mark debate in this chamber . . . I invite the Prime Minister to join me in making a commitment to ensuring the highest standards and the proper functioning of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The actions of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs on 15 November would seem to indicate that that invitation has not been accepted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been trying to work out exactly what and who the National Party of Australia represents. In pursuit of that I have been looking at statistics. I had a look on an electorate basis at the statistics from the last census in Australia, which was in 1986. I looked firstly at families with incomes of less than $12,000. According to that census, 11 of the 15 electorates with the highest percentage of people below that income level were National Party electorates. In fact, all 18 National Party seats at that time were placed in the bottom one-third of the list. At that time Page, Richmond and Kennedy were National Party electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That tells us that a big proportion of families in National Party electorates are on low incomes in comparison with the rest of the nation. In comparison with Bradfield, for instance, which had only 6 per cent of families with incomes below $12,000, my electorate of Page had 30.8 per cent, or five times as many families, on that low income or less. One can conclude from that that for some reason National Party electorates have many families on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Then I looked at the other end of the scale, at the proportion of families with incomes above $40,000. I found that the six electorates with the lowest percentage at that income level were all National Party electorates. All National Party seats would fall within the 40 per cent with the lowest percentage of families earning more than $40,000. So a reasonable conclusion is that in National Party electorates there are only a small number of families with high incomes and a very high proportion of families with low incomes. In my electorate, which in 1986 was a National Party electorate, there were 8.2 per cent of families with incomes higher than $40,000. If we compare that again with Bradfield, on the other end of the scale, there were 54.8 per cent with incomes of more than $40,000 while Page had only one-sixth of that number of families on high incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> I then looked at statistics of median family income. I found that 12 of the lowest 14 median family income electorates are National Party electorates and that all National Party electorates fall into the 40 per cent with the lowest median family income. In my electorate of Page the median family income was $16,940, compared again with Bradfield, at the other end of the scale, which had $43,000, or more than 2 1/2 times the average income of families in my electorate. In other statistics we find that five of the eight electorates with the highest unemployment rates are National Party electorates. In my electorate the unemployment rate in 1986 was 18.5 per cent-five times the unemployment rate for Bradfield. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion we can draw from all that is that there are a lot of people on low incomes; few on high incomes; and that families in all National Party electorates are low income earners. Unemployment in National Party electorates, we can also conclude, is very high. This has built up over many years, I believe, and is the result of poor representation by National Party members. We now have the likes of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) complaining of unemployment rates of 7 or 8 per cent, but in their own electorates they have put up with 15, 16, 17, 19 per cent and more unemployment rates for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> One would think that the National Party members, with the high proportion of low income earners, the low proportion of high income earners, and the high proportion of unemployed, would be more concerned about the needs of their low income constituents and other disadvantaged people in their electorates than about the high income earners. But after the latest efforts of the National Party one really has to wonder whether that is so-whether it has ever been so. We have to ask how these figures came about. Are they the result of inadequate representation?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the Budget measures that we proposed was a family allowance assets test limit of $500,000 net of debt, exclusive of the family home, and income of $60,000 a year. But this was overturned, largely at the instigation of the National Party. Now that really does say something. It says that National Party members are undertaking to look after the very wealthy, people with large assets. Some of those people will have $500,000 of assets; others will have $2m; others $10m. These people are very, very wealthy but because of National Party intervention they will still be eligible for the family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> It stands to reason that if a benefit is given to one group in the community it should be taken away from another. So they are giving a benefit to that top section of the community at the expense of the bottom section. And I ask honourable members to remember what I said before: the number of people in that bottom section of income levels is highest in National Party electorates. So are National Party members really representing everyone in their electorates? They are not. They are representing very small groups in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> This misrepresentation can be seen over a whole range of issues. It might be thought that National Party members would represent strongly the low income earners who make up such a large percentage of their electors. But there is evidence-I have just given some-that that is not what National Party representatives are doing. In other areas, they want a flat tax rate, a consumption tax, Skillshare training to be abolished, cuts of $1 billion to the social security budget, and they have already refused to change the assets test for people with $500,000 of assets, net of debt. These are all things that would disadvantage low income earners. They are not doing the job of representing that large portion of their electorates. Rather, they are choosing to support the views of a very narrow and a very small group in their electorates. The benefit they give to those chosen few is to the cost of the many. </PARA>
<PARA> The most damning evidence of that is the absolute ambiguity of proposing $3 billion in cuts to the Budget whilst refusing us the ability to make cuts by blocking Bills in the Senate. I might say that the Leader of the National Party of Australia presides over a party that is rapidly losing any significance. Its views are the greedy aspirations proposed by the few. The Leader of the National Party shows his absolute insignificance with the lack of argument he always has to fall back on. In fact, a few weeks ago here he dropped to the level of attempting to quote my remarks at a meeting of the Grafton Midday Rotary Club. Can honourable members imagine that-the great National Party leader having little people running all around Grafton reporting the words of one of the newest members here? It really is big time stuff. It really does demonstrate the absolute insignificance of the National Party and its leader. His informers got it wrong anyhow; they misquoted and took my words out of context, especially my alleged remarks about Keating and Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA> If 10-80 is insignificant, how insignificant does that make the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) who buckled on the assets test provisions on the family allowance? But people are waking up to the National Party. They have realised that the National Party does not represent ordinary country people but only a small group of the people who bankroll it, and that is plain to see from the evidence I have given. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is other evidence. In environmental matters, the National Party displays its usual ability to take quite an unbalanced view. The local National Party person up my way, who happens to be the former State Minister for Natural Resources, in charge of forestry, asks me for unqualified and unequivocal support for logging. That means support for whatever the industry wants, even if that is not in the interests of the workers in the industry, even if it is not in the interests of the community or the environment. The National Party asks me for unqualified support for policies that may reduce employment, especially in the long term; be responsible for the extinction of flora and fauna; destroy the natural attributes of the area; and put forestry on an unsustainable basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the need for the north coast of New South Wales to have a sustainable timber industry and I support the need for the industry to have a secure resource. But that must be qualified by the wishes and needs of other sections of the community and it must be recognised that community expectations may change over time. The community expectations regarding the timber industry now are vastly different from what they were 20 years ago: 20 years ago the forests were drastically overcut by the industry. Can we make a decision now that cannot be changed for 20 years?</PARA>
<PARA> The people in these electorates are waking up to the injustices perpetrated on them by the National Party. Recent election results in Page, Richmond and Kennedy demonstrate this. Recently the north coast seat of Coffs Harbour had a by-election. The Labor Party obtained an unprecedented 16.7 per cent swing on a two-party preferred basis against the National Party. If that result was transferred to a Federal situation now, the National Party would have four seats left here. For the sake of National Party constituents let us all hope that that happens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time allowed to me in the grievance debate today I want to raise two matters, both of which I think qualify for the grievance debate. The first relates to honesty and open government, something frequently mentioned but not so often practised. Recently we have had announced some royal commissions which I trust will contribute substantially to that cause. In this regard I welcome the naming of royal commissioners in Perth and wish those gentlemen well in their efforts. The Premier of Tasmania, Mr Field, also announced a royal commission to investigate aspects of an attempt to bribe a member of parliament in Tasmania. Mr Field obviously believes that the court proceedings that have already dealt with this matter have not covered all aspects of the case and that further inquiry by way of a royal commission is necessary to guarantee to the people of Tasmania that justice has both been done and is seen to be done. I am sure that this action to give the people of Tasmania all the information regarding this matter must be welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The members of the public are entitled to all the information relating to a member of parliament prior to casting their votes for that person or the party he or she represents. This was certainly the situation in my case. Shortly after my Liberal endorsement to the seat of O'Connor in 1980, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) drew this Parliament's attention to my 1967 conviction for assault. The matter received wide publicity as a result. The people considered the issue and elected me notwithstanding. No doubt Mr Field wishes the results of his royal commission to be available before the next Tasmanian election and in this I support him. However, now he has commenced this process of cleansing the political scene in Tasmania, he is obliged to do the task completely, and as he is yet to announce his terms of reference for that royal commission, I think it necessary that Mr Field ensure that those terms of reference include some other court cases involving politicians, and in particular the one in which in 1973 Mr Field was found guilty of growing Indian hemp or cannabis. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest this because notwithstanding that the charge against Mr Michael Walter Field was proven and then upheld in the Supreme Court by Chief Justice Green-judgment 23, 1974 of 29 May 1974-no conviction was recorded in this serious matter as the original magistrate decided to release Field under the Probation of Offenders Act 1973. I find the decision of a magistrate on a matter where the penalty in 1973 was $2,000, two years in gaol or both extraordinary, particularly as Field was a schoolteacher at the time and consequently held a position of trust with children in Tasmania. I am not sure what the purpose of his cannabis growing was, but I hope it was not to supply it to schoolchildren. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision is therefore also worthy of inquiry by the royal commission to guarantee the public of Tasmania that no outside influence was attempted by any person or any member of the then Labor Government. I certainly have no evidence of this occurring, but nor has Mr Field identified any specific issues to warrant his royal commission. He says he wants an inquiry to ensure that no additional impropriety occurred, and so do I. I trust therefore that in the spirit of honest government that Mr Field so earnestly supports he will also allow this matter to be fully investigated by his royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise relates to the circumstances of public servants here in Canberra and their right to promotion. I refer to the circumstances of one Mr Patrick O'Malley, an employee of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC) who recently applied-in fact, in about April-May-for a position that was advertised as No. 7578. Mr O'Malley was unsuccessful in his application. I am not in any way questioning whether the various agencies that considered his application made the correct decision in appointing somebody else, namely, a Ms Katherine Jones, but I am deeply concerned from the information provided to me as to the procedures that were followed. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr O'Malley was advised that he was unsuccessful and that Katherine Jones had been appointed, he was told that, firstly, his interview technique was bad. One might wonder whether somebody's work effort is best judged by his interview technique. By the way, he denies that that is the case other than he did have bronchitis on the day, which was mentioned in the report. Mr O'Malley's concern is that although he had been working at DITAC since January 1988-Miss Jones had been working in the Department for only six months-he was able to get references from only his immediate superior but Miss Jones got references from the First Assistant Secretary. In fact, it is further of concern to me that Miss Jones's referees were the Department's Assistant Secretary and First Assistant Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA> One would wonder why a fairly moderate promotion to class 6 or position 6-whatever it is called-would warrant references from people so senior in the Department and, in fact, how they had sufficient knowledge of someone who had worked for six months in the Department to give such references. You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are procedures by which people gain these promotions. The first of these is that they are interviewed and a decision is made by a departmental committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We can all put ourselves in the position of sitting on that committee when one applicant comes up with the boss's and the assistant boss's reference. It would be a pretty fair tip who was going to get the job, would it not? I think it is outrageous that those two people chose to give a reference in a matter of this nature and it raises considerable concerns as to the procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> There were other problems. O'Malley, of course, appealed and when he appealed and went before the promotions appeal committee, he discovered that the promotee, Miss Jones, had refused to attend. She just would not go. So he went and put his case. When he got there he found that one member of the committee hearing his appeal was a very close working associate of the chairman of the original committee that failed to appoint him. He complained about that. He said that he did not think that this was very appropriate considering there were hundreds of members of DITAC who could have been appointed to the task and been more independent. That was rejected apparently on the grounds that-I will see if I can find the words:</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra is a company town and you should not worry about things like that. </PARA>
<PARA>But the reality is that he was rolled in his objection to the fact that one of the three people who were hearing his appeal was very closely associated with the chairman of the original committee. He went to a Ms Bruin, I think it was at the time, who was supposed to have a role in protecting public servants in such cases and was given short shrift. He was forced to buy a copy of the Public Service Act because the Public Service Commissioner would not even give him certain information he sought. </PARA>
<PARA> Most importantly, he was the only person to turn up to the appeal and yet he still was not given the job. I just do not know how. These processes are all there to protect public servants. Surely if somebody appeals it is incumbent on the person who is being appealed against to attend and give evidence to the new committee. That her refusal to do so could be accepted as some reason why she should keep the job astounds me. I am asking through this Parliament and directly to the responsible Minister that he have some independent inquiry into Mr O'Malley's failure to be appointed. I will accept that maybe the other person was better anyway. I do not know that. I have only met Mr O'Malley, but I can tell you this, Mr Deputy Speaker: if I were trying to get a Public Service job and I found that one of my opponents who had only been working in the place for six months had references passed down by the First Assistant Secretary and the Secretary, I would be a bit nervous. I certainly would not like to be one of those trying to make a judgment on the proper merits of the applicants when one of the applicants was anointed from that high up. </PARA>
<PARA> I further question how those particular individuals could have had the knowledge of this worker to give that sort of reference. Quite clearly those sorts of interdepartmental references should come from your immediate superior, and no higher. I think it is quite a concerning matter. I do not know whether it happens frequently in DITAC. I do not know whether there are any outside influences. I really think the Minister should look into that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to defend the historical claims of Queensland, the Queensland Australian Labor Party (ALP), and many of the cities and towns in my electorate of Kennedy. While I respect the commitment of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party to a fitting celebration of the Labor Party's centenary, it is important that the historical record be set straight before any more spurious articles appear like the one by Paddy McGuinness in the Australian of 29 November.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The New South Wales branch of the Labor Party is made of a great bunch of people deeply committed to our party and the people of Australia. But unfortunately New South Wales misses out on the honour of being the place where the Labor Party was formed. The claim by McGuinness that it was at a meeting of the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council on 28 November 1890 that the decision was made to form what became the ALP is clearly incorrect. I am afraid I have to disappoint my New South Wales colleagues and put them on the right path. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party was, as most of us should know, actually started in Queensland on 1 August 1890. On this historic day in Brisbane 100 years ago, the first annual session of the Australian Labor Federation (ALF) took the decision to involve itself directly in political activity and drew up a program for reform as well as a set of conditions of Labor candidature. At this meeting it was the delegate for Charters Towers, a city also in my electorate, who raised the question of political action by the union movement. This delegate was one Charles McDonald, who was also the President of the Australian Labor Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am extremely proud to stand in this place today and highlight the central role played by Charlie McDonald in the formation of this great Australian Labor Party. It may interest to know that I am his successor as the member for Kennedy. Charlie McDonald actually held Kennedy for Labor from the seat's creation in 1901 until his death in 1925. It may also interest you to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that not only did he start the discussion that formed the Labor Party on that day in Brisbane 100 years ago, but he was also the first Labor Speaker of this House. Charles McDonald will be pleased to know that Kennedy is back where it belongs, with the Labor Party, and where it shall remain for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> As an aside I point out to the House that Mr McDonald, or fighting Charlie as he was known, was a famous cyclist. On one campaign he reportedly rode over 4,800 kilometres. As the Kennedy electorate is now just over 44 per cent of the Queensland land mass I am thankful for charter allowances. Not only did Charters Towers produce Charlie McDonald; it also produced the first Labor Premier in the world, Anderson Dawson as the member for Charters Towers in the Queensland Parliament, Dawson was able to form the world's first exclusively Labor Ministry in December 1899. Unfortunately for Dawson and the government it was a short-lived Ministry, and I am pleased to see that nearly 100 years on Labor governments do tend to last a little longer. </PARA>
<PARA> To set the record straight for my New South Wales colleagues, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to point out that the first branch of the Labor Party in Australia was formed in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane, on 26 February 1891. The Charters Towers branch was formed only two weeks later. The Charters Towers branch will celebrate its centenary on 11 March 1991, nearly a month before the celebration in Balmain. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to labour the point but quite clearly when the committed workers of the Balmain labourers union got together to form a branch on 4 April 1891, they were not the first. April follows March which, of course, follows February. It was not surprising that a city like Charters Towers that is so steeped in Labor tradition gave the Prime Minister an enthusiastic welcome when he visited there, just last month. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the Towers, many other towns and cities in Kennedy are indeed rich in Labor history. I am sure I do not have to remind honourable members that the battleground for the great shearers strike of 1891 is now largely covered by my electorate. As a result, the Queensland ALP can also lay claim to the symbolic birthplace of the Labor Party. In the main street of Barcaldine in my electorate there is a 150-year old eucalypt, the Tree of Knowledge. In 1891 the ringleaders of the shearers strike were chained to the Tree of Knowledge to await transportation to prison. </PARA>
<PARA> As we all know, it was the great shearers strike that galvanised the workers into concerted political action. It was the shearers strike that gave momentum to the Australian Labor Federation's decisions of the year before to form the Labor Party. In Barcaldine in May next year we will be having a week of celebrations to commemorate the role of that strike in Queensland history. I would like to take this opportunity to invite all my colleagues, especially those from New South Wales, to travel north to my electorate to join in those celebrations next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the ALF decisions of 1890 because they further confirm the case for Queensland being the birthplace of the Labor Party. As well, they point to the contribution made by another town in my electorate, Blackall. At the August meeting of the ALF in Brisbane, when the delegates had finished drafting the platform and conditions for being a Labor candidate, they ended the meeting by instructing the executive to meet in the near future to draw up a set of rules for the organisation of the party they had just founded. This meeting occurred in the western Queensland town of Blackall on 9 December 1890. It drew up a set of seven rules covering such things as selection of candidates, determination of policy, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> It gives me great pleasure to inform honourable members, especially those from New South Wales, that to commemorate the 100th anniversary of this significant meeting Australia's Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and, I might add, a senior member of the New South Wales Labor Party and the Deputy Premier of Queensland will visit Blackall this coming weekend. As well as official duties, a series of wonderful community events have been planned. </PARA>
<PARA> It would have been remiss of me to sit back and let the heritage claims of my electorate be sidelined by inaccurate history. Whilst I hope my good friends in the New South Wales branch have a wonderful celebration of their own significant dates, I think it should now be clear to everyone in this House that the Labor Party was indeed formed in Queensland. As this really is a question of great historical and heritage value-a point on which I am sure I would get bipartisan support-I seek leave of the House to have incorporated in Hansard two documents that prove my case. The first is an account of the 1 August ALF meeting from the Worker newspaper of September 1890 and the second is an account of the 9 December meeting in Blackall from the Worker newspaper of 27 December 1890. </PARA>

Queenslanders, however, can be proud that this great Party was born in our State, a State that is now governed admirably by a Labor Government. We can also be proud that it was born in the Federal electorate of Kennedy, which now has a Labor member-and will have for many years to come. This really sets the scene perfectly for next year's centenary celebrations, which will take place in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most members of the Parliament would agree that we spend far too little time engaged in discussions on the future of the Australian information industry. Given the importance of the future of the computer industry specifically, I feel that not nearly enough time or effort is spent within this chamber or within the committee system discussing and debating Government policies that will affect the future of the information industry. We need such an effort now more than ever, given that the current recession threatens to reduce Australia to the role of subcontractor in the global high technology information industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recession has hit the Australian information industry extremely hard. I will give the House some background, Mr Deputy Speaker, on the Australian information technology industry. It generally employs 170,000 people and has an annual turnover of $13 billion to $14 billion. Australia's trade deficit in information technology now stands at around $4 billion but it is claimed this deficit will reach $10 billion by 1996. Information technology is essentially an enabling technology and is, therefore, crucial to raising efficiencies and competitiveness across industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, as the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) pointed out in its paper on the trend towards globalisation in this industry and its relationship to trade generally, the indigenous information technology industry, as a producer of largely generic technologies, generates important spillovers for the rest of the economy. A stable and growing indigenous information technology industry is, therefore, at the heart of whatever Australia hopes to achieve towards building an internationally competitive manufacturing and service sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The recession, however, has struck at the information technology industry in much the same way as other sectors in the economy. For the first time in 12 years the computer industry has recorded a profit fall in real terms, and this from one of the most dynamic sectors of the global economy. It is quite tragic. </PARA>
<PARA> The recently published annual report by the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA) shows its membership to have reported revenue growth for the past financial year to total below the consumer price index increase, namely, growth has been set at 5.7 per cent. While exports of hardware, software and services had increased, the trade grab had also increased. The computer industry has begun to shed staff. Furthermore, investment, which fell by 13 per cent in the past year, is set to fall even further over the coming year. Though exports by AIIA members grew to $455m, it was still necessary to import some $2.4 billion in computer systems and services. </PARA>
<PARA> The general downturn, or now the official recession, threatens this important sector of the economy, particularly those companies struggling to meet demand and close off the looming export gap in information technologies. A fall-off in demand for networking services, data processing, personal computers and so forth is already in evidence. Ironically-and this will be one of the real problems as the nation struggles out of its recession-the collapse in investment in computer technology by companies will mean their efficiencies and competitiveness will fall away even further over the course of the downturn. The lead time for recovery will be greatly extended as a result. In the interim rival economies will be moving into increasingly higher realms of efficiency in regard to their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a passing claim, Mr Deputy Speaker. Reportedly, US businesses spend as much as 11 per cent of annual turnover on new computer systems and networks to increase their overall efficiencies. By comparison, Australian businesses currently spend about 1.3 per cent of total turnover. The recession, therefore, will suppress investment even further and push back our competitiveness relative to our trading partners. Importantly, the recession also threatens the viability of those many fledgling Australian information technology businesses for which life was enough of a struggle before the Government induced recession arrived. </PARA>
<PARA> The recession threatens to deluge the Australian information industry sector and overturn the Government's predictions for growth in exports and import replacement as made in its 1987 information industries strategy. Though a crucial area of the economy, the information industry is a notoriously difficult sector for government to oversee. It warrants close examination and carefully designed policy responses. A recession, therefore, is the very last thing this industry sector needed as it struggled for stability. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very real problems associated with the extent of government interaction in any selective way with the information technology industry. The industry is very volatile, as are most industries undergoing rapid growth. Therefore, what are ostensibly stable markets one day can rapidly disappear the next day, and industries can be quickly swept away as a result. Australian domestic companies as well as heavily capitalised transnationals operating locally have been cleared out of the marketplace overnight because of the volatility of the information technology sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Domestic companies like Impact Systems which broke ahead of the pack in recent years as a manufacturer of laser printers and automated office equipment has failed owing to a number of internal management and cash flow difficulties. Similarly, Texas Instruments Australia Ltd, a subsidiary of a multinational which invested significantly in the Australian personal computer market in the early years of the last decade, quit the local scene after incurring losses of some $200m. For better or worse, it needs to be said that most Australian companies operating in certain sectors of the information technology sector have potential but are compromised by a range of external and internal difficulties. The hardware, software and component arms of the industry face many difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of this, there are windows of opportunity in certain of the small scale and value added domestic enterprises. Australian companies do have strengths in communication related technologies and specialist application of software development. Australia possesses competence in these areas because they are basically driven by human skills, by intellectual resources. Success in these areas is not solely dependent upon high levels of capital investment and volumes of production, as is the hardware sector. There are quite a large number of component suppliers or highly specialised computer services businesses which have won their niche in the local market. It is a niche, it needs to be added, which is largely built around supplying components and related services to transnational hardware and software enterprises or their subsidiaries operating in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The ambitions of these companies are forever thwarted because they are mostly dependent upon the purchasing policies of the transnationals; that is to say, they are mainly subcontractors to the transnationals. Importantly, the development of their own technological expertise is therefore greatly retarded. It comes as no surprise, as the BIE has reported, that markets are often transitory and local component suppliers are prone to fail without warning. Even the successful ones are likely to be directly taken over by the transnationals. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, successful local component or service industries become so deeply locked into the buying needs of particular foreign companies as to preclude their selling to competitors. These factors profoundly retard the development of any indigenous export orientated supply and specialised service industries. The battle then is to win back the nation's technological sovereignty. Sadly, this battle is currently being lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The domestic information industry is a volatile, immature, yet strategically important sector of the economy. It must now not only struggle against a host of structural and financial difficulties; it must also cope with the ravages of recession. In order to ensure the survival of the domestic computer industry, the Government must provide the leadership to improve its operational efficiency. The industry needs government guidance so as to boost its labour productivity, overcome its depleted skills base, encourage higher quality controls and ensure aggressive marketing initiates are forthcoming. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, in the first speech which I made in this House I claimed a mandate to represent Richmond on a number of grounds. That claim was based upon the massive swing against the sitting National Party of Australia member, Charles Blunt. It was a decisive statement by the voters in the Richmond electorate. Since then that swing has been confirmed by the State by-election in Coffs Harbour, where the electorate has shown that the move away from the years of conservatism on the north coast, demonstrated by the decisions of the voters in Richmond and Page, were no aberration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I particularly claimed a mandate on the basis of that vote of no confidence in the National Party of Australia in the Richmond electorate. I claimed a mandate as an anticorruption member and as a pro-environment member. I also claimed a mandate to represent the business sector for which the Richmond electorate had become the Cinderella electorate of New South Wales because of the lack of effective representation over many years. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I want to direct the attention of this House to several problems which people living in this electorate are facing. The population of the Richmond electorate is soaring, with a growth rate surpassing that of almost any other region in Australia. Many people who have retired have come to live in the lovely environment which Richmond provides--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hulls" NAMEID="TT4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9U4">Mr NEWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Along with its excellent post office facilities, as the honourable member said. So many of the people moving to that area have young children, and many of the younger people growing up in the region are now seeking a new life for their younger families. Many of them are sole parents. It would be wrong for anyone to suggest that they do not have the right to seek a good life for their families. I have heard it said that they should stay in the capital cities where employment might be available, rather than come to the north coast. This is a hoary myth, and many of the people who would like to seek work in the capital cities cannot afford to live there, with rents outstripping wages. Who can blame people who then seek to make a new life for their families? One of the characteristics of the north coast, and particularly the Richmond electorate, is its low industry base. A big effort is being made to change that; but that is another story which I do not have the time to address here. It is sufficient to say that changes do not occur overnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the south of the electorate much depends on the prosperity and growth of the city of Lismore in the future provision of work opportunities. Even in these difficult economic times that city is experiencing something of a rebirth and, through encouragement from this Government and from such schemes as the new cities approach announced in Lismore by the Leader of the New South Wales Opposition, Bob Carr, that prosperity seems assured. </PARA>
<PARA> In the north of the electorate, in the Tweed area, the population is increasing even more rapidly, again outstripping available employment opportunities. Each morning an observer can detect that lack of a substantial industry base as an endless stream of traffic leaves New South Wales to cross the border into Queensland, and in the evening that stream is reversed. I pay tribute to the efforts that have been made through the various Skillshare projects within the electorate and to the dedication of those at the helm. I have also taken the opportunity to visit some of these programs and the job training programs operating in conjunction with the Commonwealth Employment Service offices at Lismore and Murwillumbah. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who doubts the enthusiasm of unemployed people in retraining for the work force should get out there and see that enthusiasm for themselves. For those who adopt a `blame the victim' attitude these visits should be mandatory. Because of the high rate of unemployment I would be anxious for our best thinkers to put their heads together with the movers and shakers to deal with the imbalance between our industry base in the north and the needs of the people to be engaged in useful and productive employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I am seeking to foster a coming together of groups within the electorate- groups which, at least in the Richmond electorate, have never come together before-to see what can be done. Those groups would include the trade unions, through the provincial trades and labour councils; the entrepreneurs and developers; the environmental groups; and representatives of local government and small business. Such a task force, should it come about, could prove to be a useful sounding board at worst and an exciting catalyst at the very best to attract appropriate development and hence create jobs within the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that in a few years nearly one-third of the population of the Tweed Shire will be under 19 years of age. We must continue, with the help of the Government and various interests within the electorate, to address their needs. The loss of a generation to the future of this nation of young people who should be allowed to reach their own stature is too awful to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA> I want now to address the problems experienced by people at the other end of the age spectrum, many of whom are described as the frail aged. The home and community care program, known as the HACC program, operated jointly by the Federal Government and the New South Wales Government, has recently been the subject of much media discussion and comment within the electorate. The program provides funding for support and maintenance services in the community for frail, elderly people, younger people with disabilities, and their carers.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently grants totalling $332,832 under the home and community care program for the electorate of Richmond were announced. The funds were largely for new projects, and the projects will allow many people who might otherwise have had to move into residential care to remain in their own home. The changing population within the Richmond electorate is putting great strain on resources for programs such as home and community care, and that clearly is a problem when people move from the city to the north coast and funding for support programs lags behind the new need. This matter will have to be faced squarely by the New South Wales and Federal governments if the skewed funding brought about by the shifting population is not to cause hardship to those people who are least able to endure it. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently met the home and community care organisers to discuss the whole problem. The major problem for HACC workers and their clients appears to stem from the policy decisions of the home care program, a program which operates under the HACC umbrella in New South Wales. Because of these policy decisions made under the program's guidelines, 131 Lismore people have been axed from the service, and 163 have had their hours reduced. The anecdotal evidence of the distress these cuts have imposed on the frail and aged in Lismore are certainly horrifying. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to add some realism to that, I will refer to particular meetings that I have had. I have met with one particular lady, a 61-year-old myalgic-encephalomyelitis, or ME, sufferer who has had all her hours of support withdrawn; I have met with another lady of 83 years of age who has had her hours of care, which provided services such as washing, removed from her; and I also met with an 88-year-old lady who had her hours reduced to zero, and her particular care involved looking after her 92-year-old husband. There have been calls for the State Minister for Family and Community Services, Mr Webster, to restore home care services to the Lismore people who have been cut out of these programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the introduction of a so-called regional equity rationale, these Lismore people were considered to be in need and as one critic, the Australian Labor Party candidate for the Lismore seat, Janelle Saffin, said, `In comes the formula and, hey presto, they are no longer needy'. Home care clients who have had their hours reduced and those cut from the services have expressed the fear that they are headed for an institution. Home care is part of the home and community care program which is jointly funded by the two governments, and the aim of the program is to give support to the frail and elderly or disabled so they can remain in their own homes. The cuts in this Lismore region certainly appear to be contrary to these aims. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales home care program has certainly concentrated on providing personal care; that is, bathing, dressing and the like. What the users of these services are telling them is that they do not want that, they need heavy housekeeping done. I think it is about time the New South Wales Government listened. It is a big issue in New South Wales and anything the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) can do to persuade his colleague, Mr Webster, in New South Wales to prevail upon home care, to review the north coast situation, would be gratefully welcomed by many people who are now worried about their future when just a few dollars or a few more hours would make all the difference and at the same time save the taxpayers of this nation much more in the short term as well. </PARA>
<PARA> For elderly people the lack of assistance with home keeping services is often the deciding factor in their being able to live in their own homes, and in this case for the sake of a few dollars we are taking away people's independence and forcing them into an institution which costs the taxpayers more money. One of the submissions that I have received on behalf of the frail and elderly has come from the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Campbell Hospital at Coraki, a hospital which services both the electorate of Richmond and the electorate of Page-and the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), who spoke previously in this debate, pointed out some of the problems which have faced the electorates of Page and Richmond, the low income base being one in particular which he addressed most forthrightly earlier this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> The CEO of that hospital, Mr Brian Mahaffey, also pointed out the problems that the frail and elderly are facing. I also received representation from Mr Rummery, the chairman of the board of the Lismore Base Hospital. A submission was presented by Mr Rummery, and he again pointed out similar problems to those I have been raising, some of the problems that the frail and elderly are facing. He has also pointed out that these cuts have certainly placed hardship on clients, when in some cases the home care service has been their only form of support. </PARA>

<TITLE>Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="4594" SPEAKER="Mack Mr E.C." NAMEID="AT4" PARTY="IND" ELECTORATE="NORTH SYDNEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AT4">Mr MACK</NAME><ELECTORATE>(North Sydney)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.30)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is considering the expansion of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport by way of a third runway, subject to a satisfactory environmental impact statement (EIS). The EIS is unsatisfactory, both for what it reveals and for what it does not address. It is fundamentally flawed in that it has no proper cost-benefit study of either the third runway or the various options. It has a range of dubious assumptions as to the effects and extent of noise and the effects of noise on property values. There is no consideration of the potential toxic effects of aircraft emissions on health; no proper examination of the effect of the third runway on management operations and the efficiency of Sydney Airport; and no proper consideration of compensation for the `losers' of the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The EIS contains unvalidated assumptions that Australia will lose tourist business from congestion at Sydney, ignoring the benefits to the national economy from growth in other cities and States. There is no full analysis of hazard assessment for the proposal or alternatives, no statement as to where 11 million cubic metres of fill from marine sources would come from, or any environmental assessment of those sources. The EIS contains no real analysis of the constraints at Kingsford-Smith on the Government's deregulation of the airline industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Other issues emerging from the EIS are inappropriate concepts in relation to airport capacity and international comparisons; inconsistencies in cost estimates; considerable understatement of the effects of noise on both people and property; insufficient attention to air pollution; safety concerns; inconsistencies and omissions in relation to the marine environment and the problem of bird strike; biased consideration of health effects; and inadequate consideration of capacity problems in road access. </PARA>
<PARA> The EIS is misleading in its minimisation of the effects of the take-offs to the north and the use of the east-west runway. The fact that the east-west runway can be operated independently of the other two runways means that its use will grow in the future, as will pressure to have the curfew lifted by the time the third runway is completed. The benefits of reduction in air traffic on the areas east and west of the runway and increase in property values are also grossly exaggerated. </PARA>
<PARA> The EIS is fundamentally flawed, as has been virtually every study done on Sydney Airport in the past, in that it does not address the famous `big picture' of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). It ignores the long term economic, social equity and environmental effects of continuing to expand Australia's major airport in the densest part of Australia's largest city and the enormous implications that flow from such an action. The cost to the Australian taxpayer of this failure and of not establishing a long term strategy of providing a replacement airport at Badgerys Creek make the cost of airport construction pale into insignificance. The difference in public infrastructure cost alone between continuing expansion of Kingsford-Smith Airport and providing a replacement airport at Badgerys Creek over a 15- or 20-year period is in the order of $10 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the 15 years from 1986, 441,000 new households will be formed in the Sydney region on an increasing population basis alone. Sydney's 3.8 million people will increase to close to five million people by 2020. Conservatively, over 15 years from 1986 a further 50,000 new dwellings will be required because of demolition of existing housing stock in the Sydney region. The vast majority of almost half a million new dwellings required will be on the outer fringes of Sydney, at a minimum basic infrastructure cost of $40,000 per dwelling. That cost approaches $20 billion. Such funds are, in all probability, simply not available. </PARA>
<PARA> These fringe dwellers will never, at least in the next half century, receive a comparable infrastructure to that available to inner Sydney, which is worth in the order of 10 times the basic infrastructure cost per dwelling-the parks, footpaths, street lighting, landscaping, libraries, child-care centres, sporting facilities, police, education and health services, job opportunities, entertainment facilities, and so on-but a demand will be set up which cannot be met. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of urban consolidation and minimising the sprawl of Sydney and other major cities have been recognised in the last decade by both Labor and Liberal State governments in New South Wales. They have unfortunately achieved little by their ineffective developer-driven solutions of attempting to force high density housing on an unwilling community while having no transport and land use policy and no policy of conservation of residential land, which are the only effective answers to urban consolidation. </PARA>
<PARA> What have not been recognised in the urban consolidation debate are the economic, social and environmental effects of Kingsford-Smith Airport, burgeoning since 1945 like a black hole, absorbing housing, attracting motor vehicle traffic, breaking down the urban environment for kilometres around the airport. In the 19 years since 1971 there has been a loss of 50,000 people from the south side of Sydney and the environs of the airport. Twenty-five thousand new households have had to be created at the end of the development chain in western Sydney, at a minimum of $40,000 each: $1 billion and no jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> Did that appear on the Federal Airports Corporation balance sheet? It did not, just as the cost of social problems in the west does not and the cost of exacerbating Sydney's existing job imbalance, with the bulk of the people in the west and the bulk of the jobs in the centre and inner areas. Neither does the Federal Airports Corporation budget include increased travel costs for these displaced people and the increased road congestion, pollution, accident and environmental costs. </PARA>
<PARA> If the third runway goes ahead, with its four-fold increase in heavy jets to the north over the highest population density in any city, what will happen to the 82,000 people under the 20 ANEF noise contour shown in the EIS? In addition to the environmental and health effects, they will steadily move, creating yet more households at the end of the development chain on the western fringe and further massive public infrastructure costs. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the fate of residents of postcode 2044 in Tempe, Sydenham and St Peters-8,106 people within two kilometres of the runway, directly under the flight path; 47 per cent non-Australian born; 33 per cent below the poverty line; 46 per cent left school before 15? For them it is not just a matter of annoyance noise, it is vibration that cracks walls, and noise and kerosene from jets that seriously damages health. It is slow extermination of postcode 2044 as a residential area. Is the supposed electoral support for country members more important than this, or do minorities not matter? Have we reverted to Germany in the 1930s? I think of Australia as a liberal democracy where minorities matter and will be protected. These people would get a better deal if they were native flora and fauna. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides the 82,000 people living under the 20 ANEF noise contour of the environmental impact statement, there are 56 community centres and churches, 18 schools and educational facilities, and four hospitals. The medical board of Aus- tralia's largest hospital, Royal Prince Alfred, has only this week pointed out the unacceptable effect of the third runway on 51,000 patients per annum, as well as thousands of doctors, nurses and hospital staff. Yet even this is but the tip of the iceberg. In truth, over 600,000 people in Sydney will be affected to some degree by aircraft noise. </PARA>
<PARA> The proponents of the third runway rely on rhetoric about the importance of aviation to the Australian economy, to employment, about the benefits to tourism and the future growth of air travel. All these are undoubtedly true, but they are not at issue. All would be better served by the creation of a replacement airport at Badgerys Creek. The argument that Kingsford-Smith Airport is convenient really favours Badgerys Creek in the long term. Badgerys Creek will be more accessible and convenient to the majority of people of the greater Sydney region and the State, including Illawarra. Even now, 27 per cent of passengers do not leave the airport, and for international tourism the Badgerys Creek location is comparable to most other major cities. A railway is needed to the area in any case, and the development of the airport at Badgerys Creek offers an unprecedented opportunity for desperately needed infrastructure and employment opportunities in western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unmitigated arrogance to put the convenience of a minority of Australians and even a minority of airport users in the long term above the overwhelming economic, social and environmental interests of millions of Australians. The risk of a major airline disaster is real. To deliberately exacerbate the risk by continuing the enlargement of the airport in the densest part of Sydney, adjacent to the Southern Hemisphere's largest petrochemical works, is almost criminal. Statistical evidence shows that a majority of airline disasters occur within 14 kilometres of the runway. Regrettably, a major airline disaster is inevitable, and when it comes the government of the day will U-turn instantly and get the airport out of Sydney to where it belongs. </PARA>
<PARA> The expansion of Kingsford-Smith Airport, which is one-third the area of any comparable airport in the world, would be a short term decision ensuring the continuation of a third rate, inefficient airport, damaging to the Australian economy and our international image. The present expensive campaign being run by selfish and vested interests by way of petitions at airports, business cards and radio advertisements is a sickening attempt to divert billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds to private profit. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the EIS, a third runway is not justified in economic or any other terms. I urge the Government to ensure that a full public inquiry is held, as promised in both Houses of Parliament when the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act was enacted, and to make a decision, in the Prime Minister's words `for all Australians', not just the greedy minority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of those people in our community who are the poorest, the most disadvantaged and the most marginalised. I speak, of course, of our original Australians, the Aboriginal group. Many of them who are seeking to make sense out of this, their modern world, are also seeking their identity. What does this mean? This means knowing who one is and where one comes from. Of fundamental importance to that is something which we, in modern Australia, take for granted-that is, an acknowledgment of who our birth mother happens to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind honourable members that from the 1930s through to the mid-1960s policies were pursued under which children were dragged from their parents, largely their mother, often simply on the basis of colour. It was believed by those people in authority, often adopting a superior point of view, that if children happened to have a little white blood in them then, of course, they should become part of this white society with no acknowledgment at all of their Aboriginal heritage, who their parents were or what may have happened to them. </PARA>
<PARA> To make matters even worse, we have tales now of children being dragged screaming from their mothers, of mothers being hoodwinked and not being told now what was happening. And all of this under the guise of some sort of paternalistic welfare and, even worse, undertaken by people purporting to using Christian values and Christian charity. What has happened to very many of these people? Very often they had no birth records at all and they were not registered. In fact, in good old Australian terms they fail to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Their horror and the full impact of this kind of policy upon Australian society has been emerging for quite some time. What in fact it has now thrown up is a whole group of people who wish to know quite simply who they are, where they came from and a little bit about what their heritage was-surely not much to ask in a modern, wealthy Australia. But we find that the very people who at first enslaved them, dragged them away, pretended they knew what was best, are those same people who are now holding back the documents, holding back the records and not allowing this process to be pursued to the full. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members may or may not be aware of current changes to the adoption laws in Queensland which enable people to have access to information about who their natural mother was. If no objection is placed on the record, then they are able to make contact. The growth in Aboriginal identity and the development of land rights-the issues that have currently emerged throughout the 1980s-have led to the development of a program called Link, which is run in Brisbane. It attempts to establish or re-establish those ties between children and their previously unknown parents, families and others. </PARA>
<PARA> The full impact of this, of course, is very important in any sort of any cultural sense to the Aboriginal community because Aboriginals are largely defined by who they are related to, their family and their wide range of relations. It seems extraordinary that now that laws have enabled them to find out just who they are and who their family may be we now find that certain documents are denied to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Who holds these documents; what are they? Basically, many Aboriginals in central and north Queensland were taken and looked after by the Anglican Church. The Church of England ran a number of centres there. While people did not have birth certificates they were certainly registered as being baptised. A whole range of documents exists within the confines of the Anglican Church in Queensland which would enable people to make contact with their mothers if they were alive or at least with relatives, and also to make some sense and to get some value from an identity which is often at crisis point. </PARA>
<PARA> The very interesting point about all of this, of course, is that we now ask ourselves in whose hands lies the future of the poorest and most marginalised people in Australia. Of course, honourable members would be well aware that we have a new Anglican archbishop in Brisbane who is noted for his speeches, his concern for the poor, his concern for the marginalised, his concern for the disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer the House to a newspaper report today that Queenslanders are paying more than they need to for some drugs under the Government's new ScriptWise scheme, which came into effect last Saturday to encourage the use of cheaper generic prescription drugs. One of the key ingredients of that scheme for pharmacists is the so-called yellow book listing minimum prices for all medications under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In that scheme, the Government sets the cost of the cheapest generic drug and people must pay the difference if they want a name brand drug.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although there has been a recognised hold-up in the printing of the latest yellow books, a spokesman for the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) yesterday said that those books `are in the hands of pharmacists'. I would like the Minister to know that a random check of seven pharmacies in my electorate this morning revealed that not one had received the yellow book. It is once again clear that the Minister's right hand does not know what his left hand is doing and we have what the Brisbane Courier-Mail has referred to as a monumental shemozzle. This of course is not the first shemozzle affecting the Minister, who needs to spend more time on the social needs within his portfolio rather than the party politics connected with those needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1971 the Commonwealth passed back to the States the right to take over payroll tax, and today I call for a complete review of our taxation system. The payroll tax throughout Australia is an imposition, and to me it is immoral. It is a tax upon the worker, it is a tax upon industry and it is a big factor in the cost of production in Australia. Over $4 billion a year actually comes in to the coffers of the States through payroll tax, and over $2 billion of that comes into New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a climate where the economy is so bad and we are calling for micro-and macro-economic reform, surely we ought to have a look at our taxation system because it is at the foundations of many of the problems that we have. Industry has to pay a tax on the wages of every worker that it employs, and this of course goes on the cost of production. It means a lot so far as our ability to compete with other countries is concerned. </PARA>

We have a ridiculous situation where tax stamps will no longer be available from postal agencies but will in fact be available from post offices. Postal agencies also, at this point, are unable to supply tax file numbers and passport applications.

<PARA> There is no country in the world that treats its farmers worse than Australia does. It is high time that the breakfast consumers of Australia were made aware of that and started recognising, when they fill their plates every morning, that Australian farmers are producing those goods. Among the hosts were many people who had travelled up to 1,000 kilometres and more, including some from my own electorate- the peanut growers and navy bean growers of Australia who have come down here to help host the last Aussie breakfast. May there be many more Australian breakfasts-and not just breakfasts but dinners and evening meals as well. Australian products are of world quality and they deserve to be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this debate needs to continue. It is clear that the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) is correct when he refers to the fact that Australian farmers and producers supply products of a high standard that ought to be consumed by Australians. Why are they not? They do not because we have been severely lacking in this country in the development, marketing and production of these goods and in getting the message across to consumers that Australian-made food and produce is value for money. Only the other day I saw a statement from the chief buyer for the SSW chain saying that in the honourable member's own State of Queensland, Golden Circle simply will not produce a generic brand for the supermarkets to buy; it insists on producing only its Golden Circle brand, and then it complains that the supermarkets are stocking other brands of pineapple.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So in the land of the peanut and the pineapple, the honourable member should go and see the manufacturers at Golden Circle and see whether he can get them to cooperate with what the customer wants, that is, well labelled, well presented Australian-made products on the shelf. If the company produces it and markets it and sells it properly, we will make sure people buy it, no problems. </PARA>

I want to make it clear that my purpose in asking it is none other than to seek clarification from the Prime Minister on a vitally important aspect of Australian policy on the Gulf so that the Australian people are properly informed and the bipartisan approach on which the Opposition places such importance continues. I refer the Prime Minister to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald today citing a letter to him from the centre left's national convenor, Senator Beahan. I ask the Prime Minister to confirm whether he received such a letter yesterday and whether it reflected the concern of Senator Beahan and others about what they see as discrepancies between the text of the Prime Minister's statements to the House on Tuesday and his media comments following it. I also ask the Prime Minister, as I did on Tuesday, to inform the Parliament and the Australian people of any constraints which now apply to the Government's future response to the Gulf crisis as a result of internal party negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do honourable members opposite say `Ram Say'? When he is writing, it could be `hearsay' or `any sort of say' but we will say Ramsey. As usual, when one gets to this gentleman, when he is talking about me, one will be lucky to get accuracy. Senator Beahan agrees with me that the account in the Ramsey story is quite inaccurate. The story says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That approval was reached only after long bargaining on Monday between Mr Hawke, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, and key members of the Government's three parliamentary factions. Senator Beahan insisted . . . that some form of words to this effect had to be written into Mr Hawke's statement to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>In respect of what I have read out here, Senator Beahan makes it quite clear that this is an inaccurate account of what happened. Let me give the facts to the House. I had a discussion with my colleagues in the leadership and Senator Ray and between us we, without dissent, came to the position that, as I put to the House in the statement, that should be the position of Australia, that is, the three ships.</PARA>
<PARA> That was the position agreed to by the leadership, including Senator Ray, with me. The representatives of the three groups came into my office on Monday morning and in a very short period of time the position which I put to those representatives was accepted by them. There was not any long argument. We put the position. It was accepted. That was then accepted by the Cabinet and then that was accepted by the Caucus. It is interesting that in the Caucus a question was raised, `Well, what if there were some requests and if the question arose about any additional forces?'. I said that, if that were to happen, we would look at it but there would be discussion. Those are the facts. The facts are that the position put by me on behalf of the Government was the position put by me with my colleagues to the groups within the Party. That was put to the Cabinet, put to the Caucus and has been accepted by the Party.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, when these sorts of things are given to some sources, one can bet London to a brick that they will be perverted, as in fact they have been. It reflects very little credit at all, if any, upon the Leader of the Opposition that he should seek in a matter such as this to attempt to create some picture of diversion within the Government ranks. This was a position which was adopted across this Party. I have made it clear in the Party and in what I said after that on the radio. Our position is quite clear. We do not propose any further commitment. We do not expect any further request. But, in the unlikely event that one came forward, we would consider it.</PARA>
<PARA> Does the Leader of the Opposition suggest, for instance, that, if such a request came forward, we would not read it? That is the position. I repeat the three words which I believe appropriately describe the contribution of Australia-a contribution which, I may say, has been warmly and widely welcomed. It is a contribution which is significant; it is proportional and it is practical. I believe that that description of the Australian contribution is accurate. Rather than seeking to beat up something out of this letter, as one journalist has, the Leader of the Opposition would do very much better to concentrate on matters which reflect some credit on him.</PARA>

I thank the honourable member for that.</PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, also suggested that it was a matter for the Leader of the Opposition. It is interesting to note how that arose. It arose at one of those press conferences that the Treasurer refers to from time to time. In the press conference the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was referred to as `PKR'. The journalist, Laurie Oakes, asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, on this important matter of company regulations, are you going to approach the Western Australian Liberal Party and ask them to pass the legislation?</PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Leader answered:</PARA>
<PARA>Laurie, I am very happy to talk about the Farrow Group if you want to talk about companies.</PARA>
<PARA>The journalist asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Why won't you talk about this, Mr Reith?</PARA>
<PARA>This was the answer:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I think this Farrow-you reckon this is an important matter; I think it is important and my focus.</PARA>
<PARA>The next question was inaudible. This was the answer:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I do not think it is important, but I'm quite happy to get into corporation regulations with you, Laurie, and I am inviting a few people around for drinks at half past eight tonight and I will be happy to see you there.</PARA>
<PARA>The journalist then asked the crucial question:</PARA>
<PARA>Will you or will you not approach the Western Australian Liberals?</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to that, the Deputy Leader said:</PARA>
<PARA>That is a matter for Dr Hewson.</PARA>
<PARA>The journalist asked:</PARA>
<PARA>Why?</PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Leader answered:</PARA>
<PARA>Because he is the Leader of the Party, Laurie.</PARA>
<PARA>The journalist asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What are you talking about, company regulations now?</PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Leader answered:</PARA>
<PARA>No, what I am talking about is the regulation or otherwise and the supervisory role of the Reserve Bank over our financial system. That is what I am talking about. I am not saying . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The next question was:</PARA>
<PARA>But are you the Deputy Leader, Mr Reith, and the shadow Treasurer and are you saying that you have no responsibility over corporations company law?</PARA>
<PARA>This was the answer:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, Laurie, you are switching your argument. You put to me that I had a responsibility on behalf of the Federal coalition to raise the question of the vote in the upper House last night in Western Australia. My response was a simple one to you and that is that the relationships between the coalition and the State parliamentary Party in Western Australia are principally the responsibility of Dr Hewson.</PARA>

The Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank has informed me that the advice offered by the Bank to the Victorian Government covered such topics as the potential knock-on effects should Farrow collapse or be closed, the relative merits of moving more quickly rather than more slowly in appointing an administrator if the decision to make such an appointment was clear-and it is the role of the administrator which was relevant to the question the honourable gentleman put-the role of the Reserve Bank in liquidity support where the liquidity shortage was experienced by a non-bank entity. It did not extend to whether the Farrow group of societies belonging to it should be let go. Discussions that the Reserve Bank had with the Victorian Government officials in February related only to questions of liquidity support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The Minister for Trade Negotiations, Dr Blewett, rang me again this morning to provide an update on negotiations at the meeting of trade Ministers in Brussels. Negotiations will continue until noon on Friday, European time, but at this point, it appears most likely that the Round will be formally suspended until next year, through the agreement of all parties, who believe that the substantial gains made in the last four years of negotiations, with the obvious exception of agriculture, should be preserved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst obviously I regret to inform the House of this development, at this point of time this is a better result than either, on the one hand, accepting a minimalist position that would perpetuate the present iniquitous agricultural trading practices in the European Community and in the United States into the next century or, on the other hand, abandoning the negotiations and plunging the world into completely uncertain trade in future.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the failure of the Brussels meeting to finalise the Uruguay Round is due to the impasse in the agricultural negotiations. All other negotiations were predicated on the development of a balanced package which has been impossible due to the European Community's refusal to negotiate its unacceptable offer on agriculture. The question that will be canvassed over the next 12 hours is: what can be salvaged from the Brussels meeting? There are two pressing needs: first, of course, to bring the meeting to a close without undue acrimony; and secondly, and importantly, to preserve the gains made in the negotiations to date. Such an outcome from the Brussels meeting would obviously be a profound disappointment to myself, as I know it would be to all honourable members of this House.</PARA>
<PARA> But the Government has always maintained-and this is our position-that it would not sacrifice our fundamental interests in agriculture in any way. In this sense, we take the view that no deal is better than a bad deal. The House may be assured that the Government will continue to pursue through all possible avenues a satisfactory outcome in the Uruguay Round. We deeply regret that the timetable that had been set and which would have represented the ending of some four years of important negotiations has at this point broken down in this way.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we do everything we can, not only on our own account but also as the leader of the Cairns Group, in discussion with other like-minded nations, to try to ensure that a situation of chaos is not perpetrated upon the world by this failure. We will do everything we can to try to work towards a satisfactory outcome in the months ahead.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me refer to the things this Government has done to provide opportunities for dealing with those who become unemployed. The Opposition's policy, as put at the last election and which apparently is still its position, is that one throws people on the scrap-heap if they cannot find a job in nine months. I ask Opposition members not to come to us talking about unemployment and the position of the unemployed. Their position is that they throw people on the unemployment scrap-heap after 12 months. Let us consider the situation of 1982-83, the recession that came about because of the Opposition's total incompetence and its lack of a wages policy. Throughout the Opposition's period in office, it had been not only reducing in real terms the value of unemployment benefits but it also had in place no schemes for offering training or retraining opportunities to those who were unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unlike the Opposition, this Government has in place strong and active training and retraining programs and special measures to assist the older unemployed, the sort of people whom the honourable gentleman who asked the question is referring to. Without being exhaustive about those programs let me remind the House of the Newstart program which commenced in 1989 and which provides a major focus on the long term unemployed up to the age of 54. The Newstart program involves intensive interviews with the target group, seminars and information packages of employment and training opportunities, 25,000 places for training, work experience and Jobsearch programs, with emphasis on tailoring assistance to the specific needs of individuals, active job placement involving the Commonwealth Employment Service canvassing for suitable vacancies and job placement opportunities. Approximately $85m will be spent on this program in 1991. In addition, special retraining programs are available for industries where major restructuring is now taking place, for example, in textiles, clothing and footwear and in motor vehicles. In addition to those we also offer Jobsearch assistance to develop appropriate skills in finding jobs--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Finance aware of reports that government expenditure could be reduced by as much as $3 billion? Can he advise the House of what the impact of such expenditure cuts would be?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4606" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of statements by the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Treasurer that their election time proposals for expenditure cuts remain relevant and should be implemented by the Government. Firstly, their memories are rather rusty. They claim that these proposed expenditure cuts were worth $3 billion and that they remain unchallenged, in the words of the shadow Treasurer, or uncontested, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that they were heavily challenged and contested at the time of the last election and found to be worth far less than $3 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition claimed that the cuts were worth $2.7 billion but I remind the House-this is simply a reminder; I am sure that everyone basically recalls this-that the Department of Finance said that the costings of these proposals show that the savings were actually worth about $800m less than the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer claimed, that is, that they were worth less than $2 billion. Let us forget this $3 billion nonsense. They are talking about $2 billion. So much for the figures being unchallenged, uncontested or, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, figures that no one has been able to lay a glove on. A billion dollars worth of a glove was laid on them by the Department of Finance.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth noting where the Opposition would make these savings. About one-third of those savings would come off the unemployed through reduced entitlements to the unemployment benefit and the slashing of labour market programs, such as those mentioned by the Prime Minister in the previous question, and about a third of the unemployed would be put on special benefit which has a much tighter means test than unemployment benefit. In other words, at a time of rising unemployment, the Opposition's solution to the problem is to engage in a massive onslaught on the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House also that included amongst those savings was $300m from the States. We took $600m off the States in this year's Budget, but the Opposition says, `No, our package of expenditure cuts is still relevant; knock another $300m off the States'. Of course, the traditional soft targets it does not give a damn about, like the Aborigines and overseas aid-knock $100m off each of those. The Opposition would introduce a new tertiary fee which would cut expenditure on tertiary education by $200m by increasing costs on students enormously. That shows its concern about tertiary education!</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the Opposition is being all hairy-chested about these theoretical expenditure cuts, when it comes to the point of being confronted with making hard decisions to reduce expenditure, it wants to water them down or abandon them altogether. I recall the discussion recently in Question Time about the family allowance assets test, which the Opposition has opposed. Whilst it was opposing it, the Leader of the Opposition was still going around the country saying that he supports targeting income support payments. He said on Perth radio on 20 November:</PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned that what's happened over the years is that the genuinely needy have been disadvantaged by the failure to effectively target income support payments.</PARA>
<PARA>What unbelievable hypocrisy. That is a very good statement of what happened when the previous Government was in office, but the Leader of the Opposition gets an opportunity in relation to the family allowance assets test to show his conviction about targeting income support payments and what does he do? He goes to water and will not support it. So much for his credibility.</PARA>
<PARA> Another example is the deeming provisions for the pensions income test. When that went into the Senate, the Opposition wanted a higher threshold for married couples. These same people who were all hairy-chested about getting stuck into various welfare groups, when it comes to a small thing like the threshold for the deeming provisions, want a higher amount.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the liquid assets test on unemployment benefits and sickness benefits, the Opposition wanted a much wider discretionary power for the Department to exempt people from its application. When it came to the pipeline, of course, the Opposition was notoriously unable to front up to its convictions about privatising that, simply because it was unable to accept that it was first necessary to put it on a commercial basis before it could be effectively privatised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was referring to the proposed privatisation of the pipeline, which I remind the House was, of course, in the Opposition's so-called economic action plan. The point I was making was that the Leader of the Opposition's claim across the table, which he has made at other times as well, is that the courts were against us on this issue and therefore that stops the privatisation. That is a nonsense. The court decision simply said that, if we had to offer right of first refusal to AGL, it would make no difference whatever to the price that we would get for the sale of the pipeline if that decision were to be maintained and our appeal were to be lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only thing that is stopping the sale of the pipeline for an effective sum to the Australian people is the attitude of the Opposition, which is supposed to be a supporter of privatisation but which does not have the guts, when faced with the issue, to support it. We do not regard the Opposition as having anything worthwhile to say on expenditure cuts. Members of the Opposition grossly exaggerate what could be achieved by their proposed cuts. What they propose is inequitable and repugnant, and when it comes to supporting hard but rational decisions they simply do not have the guts to do it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are too kind, Mr Speaker, but for the moment I will answer from here. I thank the honourable member for his question, which reflects some rumours circulating in the defence community about the purpose of the census which we propose to take. I inform the House that I have given approval for the Department of Defence to commission a census of all Defence Force members and their families, including single members and personnel serving overseas, to take place in March next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The census is for the sole purpose of designing future family support policies, to which, as you know, Mr Speaker, this Government attaches great importance. Questionnaires are to be delivered to all serving members so that they and their families can fill them out on 12 March next year in the privacy of their own homes. The census will seek information on families' housing, transport, schooling, health and employment needs. It will be conducted with the utmost respect for people's privacy and the results will be processed on an anonymous basis by the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS). The AIFS, as honourable members will know, is a highly regarded independent body which understands and respects the desire of its clients for confidentiality. Family members' names will not be collected with the information they provide and people have no reason to fear that the census will compromise their privacy. Indeed, they can only gain as a result of the improved family support policies which will come out of it.</PARA>
<PARA> While much good work has been done since the Hamilton Review of Effect of Service Life on Spouses and the Cross report-the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade-including the introduction of the family support funding program and the creation of the family information and liaison staff, we are always looking at ways of easing the demands of service life. The census will help us achieve this by identifying priority areas where ADF families need more assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> It will also enable us to press home to the States that Defence Force families have special needs which are not currently being met and thus assist us to present a case to all levels of government for improved services for ADF families, especially in the areas of child-care, education and the employment of spouses. In conclusion, I encourage all defence families to participate in the census, and I personally guarantee that the information collected will not be abused in any shape or form.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. A number of statements have been made by the Leader of the Opposition and others generally in the context of micro-economic reform which suggest that the Government's refusal to bend rules in relation to foreign ownership in the broadcasting area is, in some way, responsible for its existing state and, in terms of a micro-economic reform program, ought to be changed to permit higher levels of foreign ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I myself have doubts as to whether broadcasting is sensibly included within the area of micro-economic reform, in exactly the same way as telecommunications, the transport sector and the waterfront unquestionably are, and whether these particular alterations in the broadcasting area add to the national economy, as opposed to serving other particular objectives which also ought to be of importance to honourable members.</PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, it does not seem to me to be any part of a micro-economic reform process to allow owners to escape the consequences of poor investment decisions, excessive demands and wages in staffing areas and the payment of extraordinary sums, in this case, to foreign producers, by going outside what has been a time-honoured framework of the ownership structure in the broadcasting industry.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the networks that raised the interest of the Government in the foreign ownership provisions did so because it was already well in excess of 40 per cent foreign ownership-and, on some interpretations, over 50 per cent-without that curing its particular problems. So quite clearly the issue of foreign ownership in that particular instance was not resolving the problems that it was confronting.</PARA>
<PARA> It has to be understood by honourable members that the broadcasting sector has experienced extraordinary increases in revenue until this year-well above the inflation rate. In 1988-89, from recollection, it was something like 17 per cent. I recollect 1988-89 for the purposes of this argument because in that same year there was an adjustment in what was paid for foreign product on Australian commercial television stations, from $126m in the previous year to something more than $250m. That suggests a bargaining process of which absolutely nobody here ought to approve.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these sorts of decisions and the well known extraordinary salaries that have been paid out in the broadcasting area until recently, obviously adjustment is bound to have to occur. It ought not be thought, however, that because that adjustment ought to occur, it should be able to be escaped by changing what is a reasonable limit on broadcasting ownership-a limit which is not only applicable in this country but which other countries themselves have also seen fit to impose.</PARA>
<PARA> The United States, for example, imposes a 20 per cent limit on foreign ownership of American broadcasting, even though the United States has infinitely more broadcasting outlets than Australia. The Canadians impose a 25 per cent limit on ownership of foreign broadcasting. Most European nations have limits, but these days those limits have been compromised not in the context of the change of foreign ownership policy so much as changes taking place within the structure of the European Economic Community. Otherwise there are quite stringent rules related to foreign ownership.</PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for the existence of these rules today are the same as those in Bob Menzies' time. The position that he used to argue at that time was that national broadcasting was absolutely central to the development of a national culture. With an ownership structure dominated by foreign interests, it is not sensible to argue that that will not be compromised. It is true that limits could be imposed on foreign broadcasters, on Australian content and all the rest of it, but the fact of the matter is that if a country's television stations are owned substantially by foreign production houses or outfits with an interest in foreign production, whatever particular rules are in place in relation to Australian content, those rules will not be permitted to operate in such a fashion that the Australian product is competitive with theirs elsewhere around the globe.</PARA>
<PARA> We have one or two advantages as a small nation. One of those happens to be that we are English speaking. In broadcasting, in the cultural area, that is an enormous advantage. It gives us an opportunity, if we develop good Australian product, to have a capacity for the development of a substantial export market-which is again a fundamental issue across the board of our economy in the area of micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, over the past five or six years-despite anything I might have to say about the way in which the owners of our broadcasting industry, until recently, have conducted themselves-a notable series of achievements have been racked up by Australian production houses in being able to export Australian product. That is to be encouraged. It will not be encouraged if their competitors are permitted to own the broadcasting outlets of this country. That is why the Government put in place and reinforced those limits which had existed for most of the period that the Opposition was in office and until the conclusion of that period. We put that rule in place both because of the very great significance of the broadcasting industry to our national culture and the possibilities it offers us of operating elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> Reasonable criticism might be levelled at that if other people did things differently. As I indicated earlier in the answer, other people are in a much stronger position, both in terms of the strength of their national broadcasting production industries, such as the United States, and in terms of the numbers of outlets that they have-at least at this stage in the television area, for example, television access to the spectrum is a finite resource; it is not unlimited-to impose their limits for exactly the same sorts of reasons that I have outlined here.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of foreign ownership has absolutely no part in the micro-economic reform agenda in the way in which the Opposition Leader argues it has. The micro-economic reform agenda has a position in so far as it encourages the export of Australian product in the way in which I have outlined.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the right honourable member for New England for that important question. As to the first part, I think the right honourable gentleman would agree with the position that the Government has taken to this point-and it has been common in the Cairns Group-that we should not be talking about a walk out and denying operability in other areas of actual or potential agreement. It would not have been appropriate to do that at this stage, but increasingly as we have come up to this point there have had to have been indications made much more firmly, and we have made them, that, as far as we are concerned and the Cairns Group is concerned, the negotiation of an acceptable outcome in agriculture is sine qua non for any agreement at all. We are not going to have a situation where there can be side deals and satisfactory arrangements made between some groups. The right honourable member mentioned the United States and possibly Europe. We have made it clear, and our colleagues in the Cairns Group have made it clear, that if we are not satisfied in that area then, as I have put it in an earlier answer, no agreement is better than a bad agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me pick up, while still answering the first part of the right honourable gentleman's question, his reference to the United States. I am very pleased to be able to say to the right honourable gentleman that, despite the apprehensions that some people may have had earlier in the processes that the United States may not have adhered to the strong position of reform and meaningful reform in regard to agriculture, the Minister for Trade Negotiations, Dr Blewett, reports to me that the United States has stayed absolutely firm. There has not been any suggestion that it would be doing other than adhering to the position which it has discussed with us and which it has put forward in the negotiations. On the basis of all that has been said, I would expect that to remain its position.</PARA>
<PARA> I come to the second part of the question that was put by the right honourable gentleman-and again, it is an important question. When I initiated the APEC group, which the right honourable gentleman will recall was in January of last year in Seoul, I made it clear then, because we were very, very much into the guts of the Uruguay Round, that this was not intended to be a grouping of a trade bloc type but rather that we saw this as having as one of its original motivations and causes the bringing together of that group of nations around the Asia-Pacific rim, which would espouse and advance in the Uruguay Round and elsewhere the cause of freed-up international trade.</PARA>
<PARA> I did indicate at one stage, as the right honourable gentleman may recall-I was not saying that is what would happen-back in 1989 that if one took the worst case scenario that the Uruguay Round turned out to be unsuccessful, then it may be in those circumstances that we would have to look in this group in a way whereby together we may be able to pool our interests.</PARA>
<PARA> So I say to the right honourable gentleman-and I do accept the seriousness of his question-that, as I have said, in that worst case scenario I had flagged that possibility before. But I do want to repeat now-and I think the honourable gentleman will agree with me-that it still remains preferable from Australia's point of view that we do what we can to try to get a successful outcome from the Uruguay Round. But it is quite clear that, if we take now the most pessimistic view-that it breaks down completely and we are not able to revive it at the political level-the sort of thing that the right honourable gentleman referred to will have to be among the options that we look at.</PARA>
<PARA> If we look at what is happening on the other side of the Pacific, there is the agreement between the United States of America and Canada. As the right honourable gentleman will know, currently, obviously, very serious negotiations are going on between the United States of America and Mexico. Noises were made to us relatively early in the life of our Government as to whether Australia would be interested in that sort of arrangement. I do not want to overstate that; it was just an idea that was floated. I put the position very firmly then that we did not see it as appropriate then because we were wanting to make the Uruguay Round a success. But the right honourable gentleman is absolutely right in the implicit premise of his question that if, as a result of the intransigence, particularly of the Europeans, the world is plunged into the insanity of a system not based upon totally international free trade and the world goes into the blocs and groups, the only responsible thing in those circumstances, which I trust will not occur, is for Australia to look to its interests; they may be of the kind that the right honourable gentleman suggested, but there may be others.</PARA>

The meeting itself took place against the background of some significant initiatives that this Government has taken: the Prime Minister's initiative in terms of the new approach to Commonwealth-State relations and the new cooperation that has come from the States in that regard; the initiative of the Minister for Community Services and Health, who has been advocating since he took responsibility for that portfolio the need for an urban development and infrastructure strategy; and the initiative of my colleague the Minister for Local Government, who has been a strong advocate for involving local government in these discussions.</PARA>
<PARA> My responsibility-this is the specific point of the question that the honourable member has asked-goes to the role that my portfolio responsibilities involve, that is, ensuring that we have an effective industry development strategy that makes sure that from a cost or supply side of the equation we are contributing to the lowering of costs for both land and housing to ensure this goal of quality affordable housing.</PARA>
<PARA> The industry development strategy that was yesterday unanimously agreed by Ministers to be pursued was one in which we should try to make the industry itself more efficient, more competitive and more flexible. I say `more' because it does have to be acknowledged that in the house building industry there is already considerable flexibility by virtue of the numbers of players and their ability to respond to the level of house commencements. But I say that what has tended to happen in the past is that this flexibility has tended to be a reactive one-one that has simply reacted to what has happened or to what was about to happen rather than one that tried to anticipate better and prepare accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> Our approach is to try to ensure that, within the industry development strategy, the industry itself takes a more forward looking stance; that it commits itself to more effective research and development, as does the housing industry in other countries; that it looks at mechanisms for the recycling of products used in the construction industry; that it looks at the circumstances in which energy efficiency can be introduced into the housing market; and that it looks at means by which building materials and processes can be delivered more cheaply and effectively.</PARA>
<PARA> This has significance not only from the point of view of lowering costs here, but also, if we get it right, because it means that we have the capacity to sell the services and the product overseas. So it has potential not just for cost reduction here, but for net export growth as well.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the direction that we are seeking to get the industry to take. It is very important to acknowledge the framework that the Government has established to facilitate this, because we have been mindful that there are circumstances over which the housing industry does not have control which make it difficult to plan in this framework.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Special Premiers Conference on housing some two years ago, we set out to better establish the database upon which industry could respond. The statistics that have come from the Indicative Planning Council for the housing industry have been acknowledged by all States to be top quality statistics. What we have now asked the States and what they have agreed to do--</PARA>

<PARA> Before I was interrupted, the point I was making was that we have provided a better statistical base to the extent that the States are now prepared to indicate to us, because it is their responsibility, the basis upon which they will release land over the next five years, to attempt to contain the spiralling costs of land that are consequent upon the peaks and troughs that industry has experienced in the past. I think that is a very important development. To the extent to which we can control more effectively the release of land supply over which the States have control, we can contain the costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The other area over which this Government has established certainty is the review of the regulatory environment in which the construction and planning industry has to operate.

Is he aware of the Bureau of Industry Economics forecast of a $6 billion boost to gross domestic product (GDP) from micro-economic reform? Is he also aware of a Business Council of Australia estimate that two-thirds of the advantages of micro-economic reform will come from land transport? What action has been taken to reform land transport?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4615" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon R.J." NAMEID="5A5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CHARLTON" MINISTERIAL="LAND TRANSPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the question that has been asked by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I am aware of both those reports and I am pleased as well that both of them tend to confirm an earlier report or study which was undertaken by the Industries Assistance Commission in 1988. The last report of the Industries Assistance Commission before it was revamped into the Industry Commission also confirmed that and indicated that if Australia was able to achieve world best standards in terms of general operating costs, we should be able to achieve an increase in national gross domestic product each year of something like 3 per cent within the transport sector alone. Those people who understand the significance of that will realise that as a result of GDP currently being in excess of $300 billion a year, that would represent an increase to GDP of something in excess of $10 billion from one sector alone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the type of improvement in GDP that Australia has traditionally depended upon to be provided by the growth within the whole economy. We can achieve that within transport alone. It was suggested that, as a result of the reforms that can be introduced and reforms which are being pursued by this Government, in the area of land transport alone the amount would be something like $6.5 billion; in the area of rail transport, we could achieve something like $2.5 billion; and in road transport, it would be something like $4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> Those are some of the reasons why we have been pursuing the types of reforms which the honourable member opposite obviously had in mind when he asked that question. There are two particular reasons. The first one, which I am pleased to be able to enumerate and which, I am sure, the Leader of the National Party in particular appreciated and applauded, is the fact that, when the Prime Minister met with the Premiers and the Chief Ministers at the Special Premiers Conference, they showed even greater initiative and commitment towards the purposes that could be achieved than their own transport Ministers. This was obvious when they very positively endorsed the concept of a National Rail Freight Corporation and, with the Prime Minister, entered into and signed a heads of agreement as an indication of their very firm commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> The second reason is that at the Special Premiers Conference an agreement was reached by the Premiers, together with the Prime Minister, to pursue at least the principles that were contained in the Inter-State Commission report into economic pricing of the road asset and sensible economic cost recovery. Some of those principles, of course, have been very significantly embraced, and the Premiers themselves acknowledged that the three essential elements of that particular approach would include, in the first place, a national registration scheme for all heavy vehicles, as part of that reform process.</PARA>
<PARA> They also recognised-and this has been very warmly welcomed by the land transport industry and all of the operators in it-that for the first time we would pursue and hopefully secure uniform operational and technical regulations for the whole of Australia throughout the industry. The third essential element of that approach was the one that I have referred to where they agreed that there would be economic pricing based on full cost recovery.</PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that I would like to emphasise is that, as far as we were concerned-and this has been one of the elements of the Government's approach which a number of people have misrepresented, for reasons best known to themselves-we insisted that the whole of the exercise should be based on revenue neutrality. That is, that out of that exercise there would not be, as far as we could possibly ensure, one extra cent taken from the road transport industry. We would ensure that, based on economic cost recovery and economic pricing, we would put into place an arrangement where, for the first time ever, we would be able to take road pricing, funding and programming out of the Budget cycle, the election cycle and partisan politics and place it firmly and comprehensively on an economic basis.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought and hoped that that would secure a bipartisan approach. I know it would be supported by the Leader of the National Party and, I hope, by many of his colleagues-the honourable member for Lyne, for example, who speaks frequently on the question of road programming and road funding, and his colleagues from the coast of New South Wales who have expressed concern about the Pacific Highway. If those honourable members are prepared to support this, as the State Premiers and the Chief Ministers of the Territories have been prepared to support the Prime Minister, we will put that into place for the first time. If we put that into place not only will we be able to achieve a level of efficiency within the road transport industry and the general land transport area but, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro quite correctly indicates, we will also be able to bring major dividends to the Australian people and the national community. Those major dividends could be in excess of $10 billion every year.</PARA>
<PARA> The opportunities are there and we will be pursuing them, I hope, in a bipartisan way. I also hope that members of the Opposition will prevail on some of their less responsible colleagues, particularly those in the Senate and in Queensland, not to misrepresent the essence of the objectives which are being pursued in that area because, if they continue to do that, those objectives may not be achieved. But we will continue to pursue them and I endorse the decision that the Prime Minister was able to arrive at with those Premiers and Chief Ministers.</PARA>

I try to distribute the call to those who have had least questions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have analysed the last seven speeches given by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on matters of public importance. On every occasion, without exception, he starts with personal abuse of the person who raises the matter of public importance and, almost without fail, on each and every occasion, he finishes with personal abuse. The content of the speeches virtually always follows the same line. He says that all Australia's problems are the fault of somebody else, that the coalition's policies are all wrong and usually that he is one of the world's great Treasurers, busily building a better Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We in Australia have been riding a world boom for virtually the whole time that this Government has been in office. During that whole time he has been misleading the Australian electorate about the state of our economy. I think it has been only in the last 12 or 18 months that many people have started to realise that there is a huge gap between what the Treasurer says and what is actually happening in the real world. Obviously, he cannot and will not concede this point, but the fact is that the Treasurer is the `Mr Recession' of Australian politics and basically his political career is finished. The public will not wear a Treasurer who engineers a recession and then has the arrogance to stand here and say that this is a recession that we had to have. Does the Treasurer know what people will do to him? They will use a traditional Labor tactic. He will be the Laurie Brereton of Federal politics. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) was right. He got a free market award last night in the Labor Caucus awards. He ran three dinner functions. For one, the charge was $65; that was to be in the presence of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). For the second, the price was $750; that was to be in the presence of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). The third function-guess who was the guest?-was free. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a good recession; there is no such thing as a good recession. These are not beautiful numbers. The fact is that this recession, the Treasurer's recession, is a personal tragedy for tens of thousands of Australians. Many factors have contributed to this recession, but one of the most obvious is the persistent refusal by the Treasurer to give the Australian people a realistic, honest and fair assessment of our economy. He persistently misleads people on the fundamental data. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I am releasing some examples of how this man has consistently misled people on those basics. I challenge the Treasurer to give me a detailed response to each and every example that I raise. I say to those in the gallery, those who are interested in the substance of the debate rather than the perception, that they ought to assess the Treasurer's performance on the basis of the detailed responses that he gives when I sit and he stands. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at Keating claim No. 1. He said on 22 March 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>We won't let there be a recession. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the most arrogant statements ever made by a Federal Treasurer. Of course, as everybody knows, the September quarter revealed a 1.6 per cent fall in gross domestic product. That was the second largest fall since 1959 and probably since World War II. Now the Treasurer comes in here and says, `It's the recession we had to have'. Keating claim No. 1 is wrong. What about Keating claim No. 2? He said on--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Treasurer said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>High interest rates are behind us. </PARA>
<PARA>On 2 November 1990 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We don't have high interest rates now. </PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that we will continue to have high interest rates whilst we have the massive current account deficit problems that confront us. It misleads people to tell them that the days of high interest rates are over; they are not. As a supplementary to that argument, the truth is also that, yes, the Government had a lucky break in respect of inflation, and, yes, I understand, I think it is fair enough, that the Government ought to do all it can to break inflationary expectations in this country. But the fundamentals are that we have had a high inflation economy for a long time and when we have high inflation, we will continue to have high interest rates. So the Treasurer's claim No. 2, about high interest rates being behind us, is simply wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's claim No. 3, on 20 November 1990, was:</PARA>
<PARA>Our inflation rate is, as you know, one percentage point below the OECD average. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very misleading claim, because the comparisons that he uses are simply wrong. Australia's inflation performance of 6 per cent in the September quarter is actually worse than the average of the seven major Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, their average being 5 per cent in the September quarter. The Treasurer's use of the average inflation rate for the total OECD-that is, 7 per cent for the 12 months to September, compared with Australia's 6 per cent-hides much more than it reveals, because that total figure is boosted by the inclusion of very high inflation figures from places such as Turkey, Portugal, Iceland and others. It is much more relevant to compare Australia's performance with that of our major trading partners in the OECD. The Treasurer's claim No. 3 is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's claim No. 4-and he has repeatedly made this claim over the years-is that this country's debt problems are due to `30 years of coalition indolence'. That is not true. If we go back to 1972, at the end of the great Menzies years-and the Treasurer ought not dare to compare himself with Sir Robert Menzies-we find that in October of that year, Australia actually had a current account surplus. In 1972-73 we had a $754m surplus, and in October we had a surplus of $90m-odd. Compare that with the October 1990 deficit of $1.2 billion. Last year we had a record current account deficit of $21 billion. At the end of this term, the Treasurer's lot will have been in office for 13 out of the last 20 years. By and large, most of the problems that we have got today are as a result of the Treasurer's economic policies. The Treasurer's claim No. 4 is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's claim No. 5, on 20 November, was:</PARA>
<PARA>Factor productivity is really at or above the OECD average. </PARA>
<PARA>Any fair assessment would reveal that claim to be wrong. If the Treasurer wants a fair assessment, he should go to his own advisers in the Industry Commission and to its 1988-89 annual report, which says:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's productivity growth rates have not been impressive compared with other countries, particularly in the decade since 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer should go on to the further detailed analysis and look at the fact that in the public sector productivity in Australia is about half that of the OECD average-one of the areas crying out for reform, one of the areas where there is tremendous potential to turn around this country's economic performance. So the Treasurer's claim No. 5 is demonstrably wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's claim No. 6, on 20 November, was:</PARA>
<PARA>Now it is worth recalling that when the Government came to office Commonwealth outlays were 30.5 per cent of GDP. This year they are about 23.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should ask themselves what was left unsaid. What was left unsaid is that the Treasurer is a cutter of the States' expenditure but not a cutter of his Commonwealth own purpose expenditure. Look at the figures. In 1989-90, as a percentage of gross domestic product, Commonwealth own purpose expenditure was 18.8 per cent. What was it when this lot came into office? It was 18.9 per cent. In other words, there has been virtually no change whatsoever. This claim about the Treasurer's tremendous capacity on fiscal policy is absolute nonsense. The Treasurer's claim No. 6 is clearly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's claim No. 7 was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have had a secondary monetary policy operated by banks of the credit squeeze variety which has exacerbated this slowdown and in part has caused it to be called a recession. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on-and I emphasise these words:</PARA>
<PARA>I might lament that, but I can't do much about it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer made those remarks on 4 December. But on the very same day he said that he purposefully engineered the recession. He blamed the banks for creating it and then said there was not much he could do about it. I do not know how that squares with statements that this was the recession that Australia had to have and his astonishing claim that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this is not a condition beyond control. It is a condition, in fact, engineered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer cannot say that he is in control, also blame the banks and then say that there is not much he can do about it. The Treasurer's claim No. 7 is clearly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Claim No. 8 is a doozey-it really shows the competence of this man! On 4 December a journalist put a question to the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA>But the reason your balance of payments is much better than you thought it was is because the activity levels are much lower than you anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have a recession so we are not having the imports we expected; it is a pretty simple proposition. The Treasurer's answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>But what has that got to do with the current account?</PARA>
<PARA>What an incredible statement! For heaven's sake-that is the Treasurer's policy. That is what that means. The Treasurer's policy was to engineer a slow down that became a recession. What unbelievable incompetence! If I said that, I would be hounded out of Canberra-and rightly so. The Treasurer will be hounded out of Canberra for his incompetence. So claim No. 7 is simply wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will remember the Treasurer's next claim:</PARA>
<PARA>Let me remind you that Nobby's savings bank went insolvent in 1986 and was saved by the banks subsidy introduced by me. </PARA>
<PARA>What an abuse of office that was. That claim was wrong and it shows the Treasurer for the sort of person that he is. That was the week that was he practising Prime Minister; it was not a good week. He ought to stop carrying that baton around in his back pack because it is a dead weight for him. That claim was clearly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The next claim by the Treasurer was:</PARA>
<PARA>If we don't touch the budget any further, or the forward estimates we've published, in two years' time the spending of the Commonwealth of Australia will be the same level it was in GDP (terms) the first year Robert Menzies came to office in 1950. </PARA>

He should read the comments of his own Treasury officials in the Senate Estimates committee in the last month or so which show that point. That claim was clearly and demonstrably wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer's next claim was:</PARA>
<PARA>We've now got a profit share greater than any time in the nation's history-this very day. This very day, and a wage share and GDP back at the 1950s levels. </PARA>
<PARA>That claim is wrong. I have given the Treasurer the papers. Let us see him stand up here and give us a detailed response. He should forget the personal abuse and actually stand here and meet the challenge. On that claim: wrong. What a cruel hoax it has been to the average worker that the Treasurer claims to represent. He reckons that he has boosted profits and investment and that that means jobs for people. Obviously it does not. The J-curve never worked, we have never seen it and never will under his policies. On that claim the Treasurer is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Treasurer was interviewed on the October balance of payments, the following exchange took place:</PARA>
<PARA>Journalist: Mr Keating, are you concerned that imports are rising on a daily basis even when that (LNG) tanker is taken out?</PARA>
<PARA>Treasurer: Well, I am not sure that is right, Steve; I'm not sure that is right. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, as a matter of fact, Steve, you were right and he was wrong. One of the concerns about that last set of figures is the simple fact that on a daily basis, whether the tanker is in or out, endogenous imports actually went up. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether it is that claim, the claims about the consumption tax, the bank bashing exercise or the claims about capital stock, the fact is that year after year this Treasurer has misled the Australian people. I call on the Treasurer to stand now, defend himself and give us a decent response and not the personal abuse he usually starts and finishes with. </PARA>

That is basically what rankles the shadow Treasurer. I have no intention of going over the propagandising of the shadow Treasurer-none. He just does not understand the things. I will go through some of it. He said the profit share was wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is the stupid reply-I do not understand the debate. I have said to the shadow Treasurer that the profit share of the national accounts of last week showed profits still this year well above the average of the last 25 to 30 years. Yet the reply of the shadow Treasurer-his inane reply-is that I do not understand the debate. That will give the House some idea of what he is about. He does not understand that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then he referred to outlays to gross domestic product (GDP) and said that the Budget Papers were hardly worth the paper they were written on. He relies upon what a Treasury officer said in the Senate about outlays to GDP, about whether they are on the basis of the Department of Finance or on a national accounts basis after the early 1970s. He said that that was the point, a differentiating point, by a Treasury official. The shadow Treasurer relies upon that but the Budget Papers, that is, the tabulations which are worked over by the Department of Finance and by the Treasury year in year out, he says are hardly worth the paper they are written on. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable members know why the shadow Treasurer says that? He says that because the Budget Papers show that in two years time this Government will have outlays of the Commonwealth at the average of the 1950s or below, and that galls him. He makes this puny, spurious claim about outlays, saying that they are different now because then they had the income and outgoings of telecommunications, then the post office; he says that that is now off. Those tables are adjusted for the ons and offs. I will tell the Opposition one thing they are not adjusted for, and that is Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is an on, and it is still in there in the outlays. Even with Medicare in we are likely to have outlays lower than the average of the 1950s. Why try to deny the Government that achievement? Why try to deny Australia that achievement? But that is what the Opposition is about. The Opposition is basically never about owning up to the fact that it left us with a bloated government sector, which we have run back to one of the smallest public sectors in the world, and that is why we get the commendations from almost any international visitor to Australia on our effort on fiscal policy. I get asked about it by every finance Minister around the place. The Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) media release of 14 November states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's general government sector is small. </PARA>
<PARA>-The share of general government expenditure in the Australian economy is low compared to most OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA>-Australia has substantially lower but more targeted social welfare transfers; but even excluding such transfers, government expenditure in recent years has been below the level of most OECD countries . . . and getting smaller</PARA>
<PARA>-In recent years, government outlays have been declining proportionally more in Australia than in most OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and states that government is becoming more efficient. There have been significant improvements in program effectiveness. That is what EPAC has to say about it, and yet we have these sorts of inane political remarks dressed up as argument so that I am supposed to say, `Oh, the shadow Treasurer has some conceptual grasp of outlays to GDP, which is better than the Treasury or the Department of Finance, and that seven years of work, of cutting $28 billion on a national accounts basis out of the outlays, all went for nothing; it was all a fiction of someone's imagination'. I am supposed to get up and answer this stuff. This is the performance of the shadow Treasurer; this is his last throw of the dice on economic policy before the curtains come down on the parliamentary year and before, of course, the curtain comes down on him. And this is the best he can do. </PARA>
<PARA> `No change whatsoever in Commonwealth outlays', he says. He then refers to my claim about factor productivity which, as I said, was at or above the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average. He then says that is wrong and what he then refers to is the Industries Commission report, which refers to the fact that Australia's productivity performance can be improved. Of course it could but it does not mean to say that it is not at or above the OECD average, which it has been. That is supposed to be another telling remark. </PARA>
<PARA> Then I said that a secondary monetary policy was operated by the banks. He said that I am now blaming the banks for what has happened. I never blamed the banks at all. What I said was the Government took responsibility for its policies but that after deregulation it was not possible for the Commonwealth to put a quantitative control on money. We cannot run a credit squeeze. The only organisations that can run a credit squeeze now are banks because they can decide not to lend, and credit growth has dropped to very low levels. Part of the reason is their unwillingness to lend and the withdrawal of lines of credit. That has made economic conditions more harsh than official policy would otherwise have them. I said, `I cannot do much about that. I lament that but I cannot do much about that'. Is that unreasonable? No. But this is a high political point in this pea-brained presentation we heard a few moments ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That would be a challenge for the honourable member for Hume too, let us face it. He said that our inflation rate was one per cent above the OECD average. Then he made the terribly puny economic point; he said the September quarter was five point something. But it was the year figure. It was inflation for the year which was above the OECD average; the underlying inflation rate is not only below the OECD average, it is at our trading partners' average, which does not include the Turkeys and some of the other countries with high inflation rates. At 5.5 per cent we are at the OECD average. Again, he said that the figure was more relevant with our trading partners. Even with our trading partners it is 5.5 per cent. So what point did he make there?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer then got on to me about my claim that higher interest rates are behind us. In November 1990 he said, `He had a lucky break with inflation'. There was nothing lucky about it. We had $5.5 billion in tax cuts in 1989 to try to hold the wage system from responding to the big lift in spending. We had the most ambitious monetary policy of any country in the OECD-which he has been complaining about all year. Then, when we get a low inflation figure, he says that it is a lucky break. This is supposed to be all quality argument. Where does he get off? He does not have any policies; that is the plain fact of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Then he went on about the profit share being wrong. He has no policy and no policy structure. This Parliament has been sitting for the better part of a year and he does not have any idea about what sort of policy he would run. He says that he would cut $3,000m from outlays. But, when pressed for five minutes under a bit of scrutiny, he says that he would give it back in tax cuts. What is the difference in the public sector balance if one cuts $3 billion from outlays and gives it back in tax cuts? It remains the same. But that is what he said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . tightened fiscal policy now would worsen the recession . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The transcript reads:</PARA>
<PARA>JOURNALIST: So, it would pick up some part of or all of the $3 billion?</PARA>
<PARA>REITH: Well, the $3 billion is obviously going to be in the hands of taxpayers-</PARA>
<PARA>All of a sudden it went from Budget outlays back into the Budget and the next thing it is in the hands of taxpayers-</PARA>
<PARA> and, yes, that will effect consumption and savings patterns, but the truth is that it is not a single policy prescription. </PARA>
<PARA>JOURNALIST: . . . hands of taxpayers, Mr Reith?</PARA>
<PARA>REITH: Well, if you are talking about the size of Government and if you reduce the total level of taxes, which I thought was the proposition being put to me and-</PARA>
<PARA>JOURNALIST: . . . going to reduce the level of spending?</PARA>
<PARA>REITH: Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>JOURNALIST: by $3 billion and then you said that that's going to be in the hands of taxpayers. Are you going to make tax cuts worth $3 billion?</PARA>
<PARA> REITH: Well, look, our tax, we will release our tax policy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Treasurer does not have a clue. He is more to be pitied than despised. I say to him, `You are not despised by any of us, pal-not at all'. I made it clear the other day that, despite all of these woes we hear about the state of the recession and its impact on the public, the shadow Treasurer said on 29 November:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I would scrap the Accord and the $12 would go with it . . . </PARA>
<PARA> So the $12 wage increase-the only one from the centralised system this year-would be out; he would not pay it. He would take $12 from every Australian worker. He made it dead clear-an unambiguous quote that he has not denied. But these are the same people who he has been crying crocodile tears over. He also said, `I would cut out the unemployment benefit after nine months'. The questioner then asked, `At a time of increasing unemployment?' He replied, `Yes, but we ought to be operating the economy more efficiently.' These are the people he supposedly cares about and is worried about-the thousands being put on to unemployment benefit. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has detailed various firms where people have been made unemployed. These are the people who the shadow Treasurer says should have their unemployment benefit cut off after nine months. How disingenuous is he?</PARA>
<PARA> The same applies in relation to interest rates. When he was asked a question about whether interest rates would be reduced if he were in office now, he replied in the negative. In other words, he goes on with all this crying and whingeing, but really he would run the most savage policy he could get his hands on because he does not have the wit or the imagination to run anything better. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that Australia will come out of this recession and into a recovery. It will be driven by a pick-up in housing starts. Honourable members may have noticed that already this week the Housing Industry Association has said that housing is set to recover. Its media release heading was `Housing Set To Recover'. It then stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Today's dwelling approvals provide further signs that the housing industry has levelled out and is about to turn the corner. </PARA>
<PARA>Stocks are at very low levels. The stock cycle will contribute to production over the next 12 months as those low stock levels are rebuilt and the lower interest rates and the tax cuts will pick up consumption as we go through the year. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Government is in control of events and we do not need to answer inane propositions from the Deputy Leader--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interesting thing about what has just taken place is that, while the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of this country was defending his economic record, what did we see on the front bench? There has not been one Minister in here to support him. For three-quarters of his speech, there were more people on this side to hear what he had to say in his defence than there were on his own side. That is the measure of concern that Government Ministers have about where Australia is going. His glib, cynical and foul mouth was the way he started and again at the end of his speech he resorted to the cheap shots that he was trying to extract from a press conference. What he tried to succeed in doing was to convince his own side-who are not convinced and they know they are not convinced-that everything is okay, that it will all get better and that we are looking to better times after Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any people sitting in the gallery and my colleagues here will know what the headlines were today if they picked up any of the three major newspapers in this country that report economic news. The headline in the Sydney Morning Herald was `Merry Christmas, you're redundant'. The headline in the Australian was `Councils sell rate debtors' homes'. It is reported that there has been the worst rate level collection for over nearly two decades in Victoria, apparently. One can go to Port Douglas and have a look. People are being put out of their homes. This is because of national economic policy. This is because of the myopic approach that the Treasurer has taken to interest rates. The headline in the Australian Financial Review was, `Ford staff strike over lost-jobs package'. They all left yesterday because many of their colleagues will be thrown out of work. They hoped, by getting the Treasurer down there to have a look and explain to them what the car industry and the steel industry mean to this country, that he would listen. But it was absolutely unbelievable. It was great television but it was absolutely unbelievable and irresponsible. All he could say to journalists who wanted to ask him questions was, `Disappear, pal'. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of government is about telling people what it is really all about and what is going to happen and to treat everyone equally. But under this Government we have the mates syndrome. I am sure that many people saw the incredible example this morning in the Australian, which carried a report of a speech from a former managing director of Qantas Airways Ltd, Mr Menadue. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>  Politicians regularly used their positions as the heads of Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) to advance political colleagues without regard for the profitability of their organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>It further stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . governments saw it as an opportunity to give broad appointments to political friends. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer and his colleagues have been masters of this in this country. There has been no concentration on the profitability of government business enterprises. There has been no concentration on the need to address those problems. This Government has starved them of loan funds. That is why the chairmen of the boards of Qantas and Australian Airlines Ltd are standing up and saying that it will be terribly difficult to sell them. That is why people in Telecom Australia are saying, `Well, if we cannot access loan funds, how are we going to pay the OTC merger fee? Where is the money going to come from?'. This Government is denying them all opportunities to privatise properly and effectively. This is the sort of attitude that is now being exposed. When the mates fall out, all will be revealed. This may be the first example of it-seeing Mr Menadue tell the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know that the Treasurer is consumed by power. He has strutted his stuff in this country for some seven years. It is the arrogance that upsets people. It would be all right for him to come into this place and say, `I have made a mess of it. I am sorry and I am now going to seize the opportunity and get it back on course again'. People would accept that. But it is the arrogance and the cynicism of the Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, that upsets people. It upsets his colleagues and it upsets the Australian people. He drives around in cars with tinted windows and takes VIP flights to the football. He blames television hosts and banks for everything. It is always the fault of someone other than Paul Keating. He is almost like a wilful child or someone who needs a caning. </PARA>
<PARA> The language of the Treasurer has been made a national issue by him, not by us. The way that he has used the language in here has denigrated this place. When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) took over, the first thing he said was that we were going to try to lift the standard of debate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just had an example of the language of the Treasurer. He came in and called my colleague a peabrain. What was the point of that? Why not address the issues? The Treasurer has created his own reputation as the `Freddie Foulmouth' of Australian politics. That is something that Australian people do not want. They do not enjoy hearing that. What they want from their politicians is a little bit of vision, understanding and compassion and for everyone to be treated in the same way. That is not what the Treasurer has done. It is that cynicism that he displays so often that has led him into trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to see him dining last night with the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton). Mention was made that we could well see an Unsworth episode. Mr Unsworth removed the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith for inflicting damage on his Government-just as the honourable member for Blaxland is inflicting damage on the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has lost touch with reality; he has introduced economic policies that have failed; and he is terribly unpopular. He may well go. Now would not be soon enough for many in this country. He is no John Major, come to save the Labor Party; he is its biggest liability. As I said before, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) is on a fast track to the top and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), if he keeps telling jokes, will probably end up being Deputy Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The essence of it is that there has been a breach of faith with regard to the relationship between the Treasurer and this country. He has not told the people the truth. He has not addressed the economic issues. He tried to skate around the issues today in a very glib way. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), has introduced detailed arguments that need to be answered-some 20-odd points. </PARA>
<PARA> One of those points, I think, requires mentioning again-that is, the issue of spending. The Treasurer said on 21 November 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>If we don't touch the budget any further, or the forward estimates we've published, in two years' time the spending of the Commonwealth of Australia will be the same level it was in GDP (terms) the first year Robert Menzies came to office in 1950. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, that was not true. But all that the Treasurer did was embrace the rhetoric again and ignore the facts. That is what he has consistently done in these arguments. He embraces the rhetoric and ignores the facts. He embraces all the material from Treasury that he is told to convey, without having any true comprehension of the impact it is going to have on ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why we take the view that when we look at issues such as the level of spending we have to look at them more closely. Last year, the total Commonwealth sector represented 26.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). In the equivalent Budget back in 1956-57-a typical 1950s Budget-the Commonwealth sector represented 21 per cent of gross domestic product. The 5.2 per cent difference between now and 1956-57 represents about $21 billion. That is an enormous bill compared with the discretionary savings in this year's Budget of around $1 billion, as asserted by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, he is leading people to believe that he is doing a good job by making comparisons that simply are not true, when in actual fact he is not doing a good job at all. He is leading people to the false assumption that he is doing the things that ought to be done. Of course, they are not being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other issues that does not get a lot of play but which has some significance is the question of capital stock. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) raised the concern to attend to infrastructure needs. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has raised this issue as well. On 11 October 1990, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have reinvigorated all of our capital sectors both in the trade and in the non-trade areas of the economy. The economy out there in terms of capital stock is almost brand new . . . We have had the job of rebuilding the capital stock and we have used some of that wealth to do it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is just utter rubbish. How can the capital stock have been run down when total investment in Australia during the 1950s and 1960s steadily grew? Investments were expanding and so was the capital stock. It is just a complete and total furphy. Without improvement in the quality and quantity of export oriented investment capital stock, all the Government's efforts have come to naught. The pain and stress experienced by Australia's families have been worthless. Quite clearly, he does not understand, he does not want to understand and he is not responding to the needs of Australians and the need to make that capital stock grow. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a couple of other points. We are starting to see a new phrase used-`policy structure'. It is just like the J-curve. It is used to describe the great big picture-micro-economic reform. The Treasurer says that the policy structure is in place. Well, it is not in place. Australians know it, and he ought to accept his own message. It is time that he was the one to disappear. He is the one who has brought about difficulties for all Australians. It is time that his colleagues on the Government side woke up to that fact and did something about it. I understand that many of them have; they will take that opportunity and we will see the Treasurer disappear, just as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith disappeared from the Unsworth Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposal this afternoon from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) is just a little more sanctimonious than some of the usual ones which unfortunately we on this side of the House have to put up with from time to time from those opposite. It is dressed in terms of honesty and clarity, but in all reality this proposal is not about honesty; it is not about clarity; it is in fact very much about contrasts. It is about the contrasts that we have consistently evidenced in this chamber over the last seven years, time and time again. It is about the very clear and stark contrast between the continued, never ending, shameless rhetoric of a half-armed Opposition and the very real, hard slog, principle based decisions that this Government is pursuing, and will continue to pursue, in the long term interests of this country, despite the fact that at this moment it is probably to our own short term electoral risk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate this afternoon, as has been the case with so many debates, is about us versus them. It is about commitment versus weakness; it is about hard decisions versus populist television grabs of 30 seconds; it is about resilience versus compromise; and it is about quality of decisions versus an intellectual squalor lacking any consistency. How those opposite can quite honestly come into this House this afternoon and say that in the last seven years there has not been a clear, honest and realistic assessment from this Government at all times to and on behalf of the Australian people is quite simply beyond the pale. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we not remember all too well the heady days in this country after the banana republic statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the vilification that he went through because of that statement? The Treasurer had the temerity to be interviewed on Australia's most popular radio show, hosted by John Laws in Sydney, to try to shake the country out of its 30 years of sleep and to say to the country that we had to do something different. </PARA>
<PARA> Vilification and wry humour was thrown at the Treasurer by those on the other side of the chamber. After they had done nothing, after they had hidden the absolute decline and demise of any worthwhile manufacturing base in this country after being in office for so long, when the Treasurer had the audacity to be honest with the Australian people, those opposite vilified him. I say to the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) that, some four years later, it is because the Treasurer had the guts to tell this country a few hard facts that this country's long term future is a lot brighter than it was before we came to office in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeing the same pattern yet again. When two successive lots of figures put us technically in a recession, the Treasurer bluntly went to the press, faced the Press Gallery, faced the television cameras on every television screen across the country on the day that the figures were released, and bluntly told the nation that we are in a recession-a recession that may do some good. That takes a lot of honesty, guts and a great deal of presence of mind-something which I would say is lacking almost consistently on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> More significantly, let us contrast the capacity of the nation today to understand the economic debate with the capacity a decade ago, because that goes to the very heart of this country's capacity to absorb change and to plan for the future. Would we have ever heard Prime Minister Fraser, Deputy Prime Minister Anthony, or Treasurer John Howard, let alone their advisers whispering in their ears, explain to the Australian people the significance of our terms of trade, the importance of micro-economic reform or the complexities of the wage tax trade-offs? No; they would have kept it hidden from people because there was a bit of bad news in it which would not be to their short term electoral benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Where has the Opposition been with regard to this long and winding road along which this Government has had to take this country? While we have been cutting deficits year after year and putting this country into a surplus, the Opposition has been out there on the electoral stump whingeing about assets tests, fringe benefits and capital gains taxes. One by one, Opposition members have been forced to accept them, with the exception of the capital gains tax because that represents big dollars to their supporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Now they have found some new ones to squib on-the family allowance asset tests and the pipeline issue. It goes to the very heart of the matter that there may be a new face in the Leader of the Opposition's chair on the other side of the House at Question Time, but there is the same old backsliding still going on. The present context is no different. Let us consider fiscal policy. The Opposition has made much of its $3 billion list, which was exposed at Question Time today by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). Much has been heard of course about its prejudice over policy where the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tripped over his tongue in attempting to explain in a most clumsy, half-hearted and disingenuous manner how our repeated surpluses were in fact crowding out private sector investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in his contribution this afternoon, also had something to say about our deficit cutting. He said, in effect, that the Treasurer had placed the onus for cuts on the States. I invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to have a look at the Treasurer's press release of 28 June 1990, where general government own purpose outlays are explained, and this facade that he has picked up from the New South Wales Government by including outlays of the public trading enterprises, such as Qantas, Telecom and the State electricity authorities, to distort the figures is shown for the distortion that it is. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is not good enough, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to look at the Commonwealth's contribution to the reduction in the net public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR), because it shows that the Commonwealth has contributed much more than the States to the turnaround in the PSBR from deficit to surplus. If that is not good enough, he should have a good look at the own source revenue growth, because that is a correct measure for the comparison between the State and Commonwealth sectors. It shows that the States' own source revenue has increased by a far greater amount than that of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> We raise the interesting subject of monetary policy, and I refer to interest rates. It was not so long ago, I seem to remember, that those on the other side of the House were accusing the Treasurer of ringing the Reserve Bank and telling it to place interest rates at a level lower than what they would otherwise have been. The Opposition said that interest rates should have been higher. That was the rhetoric. Today, December 1990, despite the fact there has been a fall of some 5 per cent from the peak rates in the 90-day bills, it is saying interest rates are still too high. The rhetoric is inconsistent. There has certainly been no discussion about the timing of any interest rate movements from the Opposition; that is a bit too technical and too hard. Opposition members give that a big miss. </PARA>
<PARA> In his rush to accuse the Treasurer of misleading this afternoon, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition also falsified the figures in this House in relation to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) inflation figures. The facts are that in the 12 months to September, the total OECD inflation was 7 per cent, compared with ours of 6 per cent. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition invited comparisons with our major trading partners. He should know that the inflation rate for the comparable period in the United States was 6.2 per cent, above ours. In Maggie's England, it was a good old 10.9 per cent. He invites comparison; there is the comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very limited time left to me, I want to raise one further point, and it is this: never once has there been a truly international perspective offered by members of the Opposition. There has been no mention whatsoever of one by them-with the exception of a question at Question Time today from the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who is on the back bench. There has been no perspective at all from them about the ramifications for the Australian economy; of what is happening in the American economy; what is happening in the Japanese economy, with the various stock market corrections; what is happening in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT); or the significance of the Gulf war. There is no consistent overview, no international perspective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, under governments of both political parties a trend has developed over the past few years-and I emphasise `under governments of both political parties' because I want to be bipartisan in this matter-to come back here towards the end of the year to deal with matters returning from the Senate. For the benefit of those who are unaware of what is happening now, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has moved that the House at its rising meet again on 20 December 1990 at 10 am, unless Mr Speaker fixes an alternative day or hour of meeting. What is intended, of course, is that we will now go into recess for a number of days until 20 December 1990 and we will come back probably for one, or perhaps two days. The trend that has developed over recent years is that when the House comes back for, say, two days, in parliamentary terms it develops as one day. In other words, at the end of the first day, the Parliament rises to an hour or till the ringing of the bells and, when we come back on the second day, there is no Question Time. That is the point of my rising on this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I appeal to the Government-and I realise that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) is not present, so I do not seek a response from the Government at this moment-to consider allowing a Question Time on that second day, if we meet on 21 December 1990. In this year, 1990, the House has met for only 36 days. Today is the thirty-sixth sitting day in 1990, which is the lowest number of sitting days in any year for 50 years. Indeed, it is the second lowest number of sitting days since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Each time we have a day cut off the sitting pattern, it means that there is one less Question Time. Not only are members of the House of Representatives suffering in this way, but we now also find that the maximum number of questions that we can anticipate being asked on a sitting day is 14. Because of the long answers being provided by Ministers, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) almost daily now has to extend his Question Time period to enable Opposition and Government members to ask seven questions a side. So I put it to the Government that, on this occasion-and I would hope in the future as well-if we sit on 21 December 1990, it be treated as an ordinary sitting day. By that I mean that we will assemble at 10 a.m. and there will be a Question Time at 2 p.m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, this is a procedural motion and it will have the support of the Opposition. However, members on both sides of the House ought to be aware of what this motion really means. Each day, mainly at my request on behalf of the Opposition, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) moves a motion for the House to take note of certain papers. I then move on behalf of the Opposition that the debate be adjourned. Very few of these papers come back for the consideration of the House of Representatives. Indeed, in the last session not one paper was brought back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On this occasion, however, the Government has agreed to bring back some of the papers for consideration and three are listed as the last item on the Notice Paper for today. So on the assumption that we reach the last item in this time available, those three papers will be dealt with. But all of the other papers remain on the Notice Paper for a period and then, ultimately, a resolution of the kind just moved by the Minister is brought to the House for our consideration and those items of business are removed from the Notice Paper. We do not object to the motion, as I have indicated, because there are far too many items there to be dealt with in the time that is available. But again I make a plea-not just on behalf of the Opposition, but on behalf of all members of the House of Representatives-that next year the Government makes more time available for the consideration of these matters. Already we have the sitting pattern for the autumn session of 1991 and it is rather interesting that 35 days have been set aside for the House of Representatives to meet during the autumn session, which is one day less than we have met during the whole of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that with the Opposition continually drawing the attention of the House and the people of Australia to the fact that this Parliament is not meeting as often as it ought to, the Government has now reacted. Next year in one session we will be meeting for one day less than we have met in the whole of 1990. I am pleased about that. In drawing attention to the fact that there will be more sitting days in 1991 than in 1990 I would hope that more of these items that are referred to as papers to be considered by the House will be considered by the House of Representatives and that when we come to the end of next year there will not be so many items to be discharged. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to the Parliament: Redevelopment of Aeronautical Research Laboratory site, Fishermens Bend, Vic. </PARA>
<PARA>The Aeronautical Research Laboratory (ARL) is part of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation of the Department of Defence. ARL's terms of reference are to develop, maintain and exploit scientific and technological skills and facilities in areas generally central to military air vehicles and relevant aspects of weapons for the benefit of the Australian Defence Force. Existing laboratories and office accommodation at ARL are crowded and unsuitable for effective research, development and investigation in a number of areas of technology. </PARA>
<PARA> ARL operates from a site at Fishermens Bend, Port Melbourne, which until 30 June 1988 was leased from the Victorian Government. On the expiration of the lease the Commonwealth purchased the site as well as an adjacent site, previously used by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), from the Victorian Government. ARL will ultimately expand into both sites. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence is purchasing useable ex-CSIRO buildings with the aim of refurbishing them. The redevelopment proposal also includes refurbishment of some existing ARL buildings. The redevelopment proposal has evolved from a need to rationalise the operation and management of the research facility and will provide badly needed laboratory and office space and enable staff of the scientific divisions to be collocated. This in turn will enable other buildings to be appropriately modified to provide more flexibility and efficiency and assist ARL to meet its research and development objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Health and safety surveys and site investigations commissioned by the Aust- ralian Construction Services and co- ordinated by Scientific Services Laboratories identified areas of hazardous chemical and radiation contamination on the ex-CSIRO site and radiation contamination on the existing ARL site. Both sites have now been cleared of all radioactive waste and a consultant has been engaged to further investigate the chemical-solvent contamination on the ex-CSIRO site. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence will be monitoring and surveying the removal of contaminants and redevelopment of the site is dependent on full decontamination of the ex-CSIRO site. Work will not proceed on the affected part of the site until it is safe to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The project will consist largely of refurbishment and demolition works and will provide functional laboratory facilities to support the advanced technologies embodied in recent aircraft acquisitions such as the FA18 fighter, Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters. The provision of roads and car parking, extension of the existing security system and provision of electrical services will also be undertaken in the planned redevelopment. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report the Public Works Committee agreed that many of the existing buildings at ARL are inadequate and therefore recommended that the proposed redevelopment should proceed. However, it made two points that should be noted. Firstly, it recommended that ARL investigate the possibility of providing child-care facilities for its employees, and ARL has advised it will survey staff requirements in this respect and also canvass neighbouring organisations about the possibility of a combined facility being set up nearby. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee recommended that Australian Construction Services undertake an energy audit to ensure the most efficient use of energy at the site, and I have been advised that this audit is currently being arranged by ACS in Victoria, which will report back to the Committee on the audit results.</PARA>
<PARA> Submissions were received by the Committee from the Government and Opposition of Tasmania suggesting that the aircraft systems division of ARL be moved to Launceston. A second hearing was held by the Committee in September 1990 to discuss this matter but the Committee ultimately concluded that the laboratory would function more effectively and efficiently if that division were to remain in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit of cost estimate for the proposed work at April 1990 prices is $17.5m and comprises $15.48m for building refurbishment and modification and $2.02m for site works and services. The work will be undertaken in two phases to accommodate funding arrangements of ARL, with phase A planned for commencement in 1990-91 and phase B in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank the Committee for its support of the project and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The proposed work is for the development of an existing building into an air traffic services centre in Brisbane for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The new centre is a vital component in the CAA airways productivity investment program as it will enable upgraded radar data to be displayed at new radar display consoles. It will also provide the necessary accommodation to permit consolidation and rationalisation of remote air traffic services units into Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal will provide the necessary floor space to accommodate the replacement radar displays as well as the functions currently provided by the existing Brisbane flight service centre and the existing flight service units at Charleville, Mount Isa, Weipa, Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton, Dubbo and Coffs Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal is to rehabilitate the former Australian Airlines domestic terminal building located at the old Brisbane Airport. The CAA has purchased 14 hectares of the Queensland airport, including the former Australian Airlines building, to enable it to ultimately consolidate and collocate all its off-airport activities at the one location. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal will provide a main building and adjoining annex with a total floor area of approximately 6,800 square metres comprising: an air traffic services operational and support area of 2,200 square metres; technical services and support areas of 2,500 square metres; services areas of 1,500 square metres; and administrative support and social facilities of 600 square metres.

<PARA>  That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to the Parliament: Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar. </PARA>
<PARA>Through its information policy paper `The Defence of Australia 1987', the Federal Government announced a commitment to defence self-reliance and the development of a defence force capable of meeting the unique strategic demands of Australia. A significant part of Australia's achieving self-reliance rests with our ability to detect and prevent an attack by aggressors through air and sea approaches. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of our expansive coastline, Australia is obviously extremely vulnerable. The Government has placed a high priority on the development of an extensive radar network capable of broad area surveillance of these vast air and sea approaches. Using state of the art technology, the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar (OTHR) is designed to do just that and Australia is leading the world in this type of defence facility. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike traditional ground based radars, the sophisticated Jindalee system will scan over the horizon and it is expected to be able to detect ships and aircraft up to 2,000 kilometres from the Australian coastline. The present phase of the project will involve major installations near Laverton in Western Australia and near Longreach in Queensland with a coordination centre at RAAF base Edinburgh in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The entire network is estimated to cost in excess of $500m, with the cost of the works component estimated at $95m. The network will significantly enhance the ability of Australia's defence forces to effectively monitor air and sea movements across our remote northern approaches. The system is expected to be operational by the mid-1990s and, in addition to its major defence role, will have other significant applications. For example, it should be able to provide a deterrent to illegal immigration and drug smuggling through neighbouring South East Asia as well as providing valuable weather information and assistance in aircraft safety and search and rescue operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Phased over five years, the development of the OTHR will involve not only the erection of the sophisticated radar equipment, but also construction of facilities to house the equipment and operation centres at each radar and the main management cell in South Australia. In the past, defence and other consignment works were built using a design and construction approach where buildings and works are specified separately to the equipment part of a project. In the case of the Jindalee project, this approach has many disadvantages as the equipment and facilities parts of the project are dependent on one another and timing for each component is critical. Therefore, a turnkey approach has been adopted, allowing the prime contractor to undertake all aspects of the project simultaneously, thereby having more control over project timing and minimising financial risk to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> The project will provide employment opportunities and economic activities to the remote areas which will house each installation and, once operational, each radar will employ between 20 and 30 maintenance personnel, mainly civilian. The Department of Defence has actively pursued avenues of public consultation and has developed effective relationships with the local communities, all of which generally support the project. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report, the Public Works Committee determined that there is a need to establish the Jindalee radar network and that to provide optimum radar performance both radars, as proposed, will be ideally sited. The Committee therefore recommended that the Queensland, Western Australian and South Australian sections of the project should proceed. In making this recommendation, however, it also made a number of additional comments. The Committee recommended that the Department of Defence provide an analysis of the effectiveness of the turnkey approach being adopted for this project. The Department of Defence will provide the requested information upon the completion of the project, when a full analysis of this approach can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee further recommended that the Department of Defence give a high priority to overcoming technical problems related to the source of electrical power, including possible alternative energy sources; undertake an independent assessment of the electro-magnetic effect of the transmitter near Longreach in Queensland; and broaden its community consultation programs in the Longreach area. Defence has indicated that arrangements are well in hand for the additional work and that it will be completed as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommended that it be advised of the cost split between the antennas and other facilities following the awarding of the Jindalee contract. The Department of Defence expects to award a contract in early 1991 and has undertaken to report back to the Committee with the successful tenderer's costs and details of the cost break-up as requested. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to thank the Committee for its support of the project and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Opposition supports the building of the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar, there are a couple of points I would like to raise arising from the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I commend the Committee for its work, particularly as I know it has had a number of references over the last few months. This matter was referred to it only at the end of August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) referred to a turnkey contract. While we accept that this type of project is probably best suited to a turnkey contract, it does really then put a lot of responsibility on the prime contractor and, in particular, on the ability of the prime contractor to manage the costs of the project. I think this is something that the Opposition will be watching fairly carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Works Committee reported that there was no limit of cost estimate given to it when it was assessing the project. While that in itself is of some concern, it was also noted that the price ceiling originally of $125m, which was negotiated for the three Jindalee over-the-horizon radar stations, was subsequently reduced by the Department of Defence to $95m. The report does not indicate how that drop of $30m was arrived at or how the Department of Defence was able to estimate that the turnkey approach will save it $8m. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this demonstrates the difficulty of estimating costs and the problem of measuring the total final cost with the turnkey approach. So we still have the possibility that this project could suffer a blow-out in its cost. I say to the Minister and the Government that the Opposition will be watching these two points very closely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>When it was introduced in 1947, the Social Security Act 1947 brought together separate legislation dealing with age, invalid and widows' pensions, maternity allowances, child endowment and unemployment and sickness benefits. Commonwealth legislation in the area of social security dates back to 1908 with the enactment of the Invalid and Old-Age Pensions Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1947, the Act has been subject to over 100 amending Acts. At the outset, the Act depicted a passive payment mechanism, providing benefits in the form of direct cash payments to clients. It has now become more attuned, because of the many recent amendments, to the changing social and economic environment through its development into a more active piece of legislation that targets individuals and families in genuine need while positively encouraging them toward independence of the welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments have involved increasing complexity and diversification within one of the most important pieces of Commonwealth legislation. A large proportion of the Australian population is affected by the Act. The volume of recent amendments, the increased complexity of certain areas of the Act and changes in drafting styles since 1947 are some of the factors that have contributed to reduced comprehensibility of the Act as well as a hodgepodge of styles and presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> A legislation review was instituted by the then Minister for Social Security and carried out by the Department of Social Security with the cooperation of representatives of the welfare sector. This Bill is a result of that process. In February this year copies of an exposure draft of the Bill were released for public comment. Public seminars were held in each capital city to explain the background to the review of the legislation and to examine the structure, format and style of the draft legislation. Those attending were invited to suggest changes or improvements to the exposure draft. The response to these consultations was both constructive and positive. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of this Bill is to overcome the problem of readability by using a `clear English' drafting style and format. That style and format should make it a more accessible piece of legislation that ordinary Australians can reasonably be expected to understand. In many instances, traditionally used legislative words such as `notwithstanding' have been dropped or replaced by non-technical words such as `despite' or `even if'. In some places `cease' has been replaced by `stop' and `request' by `ask'. These are just a few examples of one aspect of `clear English' drafting. </PARA>
<PARA> Two main aims have been pursued in redrafting the Social Security Act. The first has been the aim of making each individual provision as simple and easy to read as possible. The second has been the aim of making the arrangement of the provisions in the Act logical and easy to follow. As a result, this Bill contains many new features at both the individual provision level and at the overall organisation level. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 1 of the Bill is of fundamental importance because it provides the basic interpretative tool for the reader. It sets out in one place the definitions of principal terms used in the Bill. Definitions may:</PARA>
<PARA> - settle the meaning of a word or phrase that might otherwise be of doubtful meaning;</PARA>
<PARA> - extend the ordinary meaning of a word to achieve a broader effect;</PARA>
<PARA> - narrow the ordinary meaning of a word to achieve a restrictive effect; or</PARA>
<PARA> - allow a shortened reference to a complicated concept or a long name. </PARA>
<PARA>Two innovations of note in the definitional part of Chapter 1 are:</PARA>
<PARA> - an index of defined words and phrases; and</PARA>
<PARA> - groups of definitions according to subject matter. </PARA>
<PARA>The main advantage of grouping is that it reduces the ambit of the search area for a reader. The index will improve accessibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 1 includes a part concerned with determinations having an interpretative effect. Some definitions in the current Act confer powers. For example, an organisation cannot be a `benevolent home' for the purposes of receiving a portion of a social security payment under the Act unless the organisation has been approved as such by the Secretary. The use of definitions in this way is inconsistent with the purpose of definitions and puts the reader to unnecessary trouble. Hence, such provisions, where they remain essential, have been reworked and grouped together in a separate part of the interpretational chapter. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 2 sets out the modules for each of the 20 types of social security payment. Each payment module is almost totally self-contained so that a reader will find out everything he or she needs to know about a particular pension, benefit or allowance without referring to a multitude of provisions outside that module. Special or less frequently used provisions that affect qualification or payability, such as the effect of compensation payments, are located outside the payment modules for cost and space efficiency reasons but they are signposted at appropriate points in payment modules. Rate calculators are also located outside the payment modules for similar reasons. The provisions of each payment module deal with matters in a procedural order covering in turn qualification criteria, how to claim, determination of claim, how to assess rate, how payment is made, recipient obligations, continuation, variation and termination of benefit, bereavement payments and fringe benefits provisions. Equivalent provisions to these are currently found scattered throughout the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 3 of the Bill contains general provisions which relate to rates of benefit and to means testing. This chapter contains the rate calculators for the social security payments covered in chapter 2. The generic rate calculators are probably the most effective innovation of the rewrite exercise. This is because they have transformed an incomprehensible set of rules into more useful tools that, while still complex, are set out in steps to assist social security clients and their advisers to check rate calculations. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 3 also includes general provisions relating to the ordinary income test, the maintenance income test, the assets test, the effect of the receipt of compensation payments and indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 4 provides for payment of certain pensions outside Australia and sets down the rules regulating the rate payable to people who can take their pensions overseas. The chapter also covers bilateral social security agreements between Australia and other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 5 consolidates provisions dealing with the identification of debts arising under the Bill and with the recovery, waiver or write-off of those debts. Currently, these provisions are found in different parts of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 6 mirrors Part XIX of the present Act that deals with the review of decisions by officers of the Department of Social Security; the Social Security Appeals Tribunal; and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Part XIX was an early piece of `clear English' legislation to emerge from the legislation review and was introduced into the Social Security Act 1947 by the Social Security (Review of Decisions) Act 1988. Hence, it is one of the few areas of the Bill that did not need substantial revision. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 7 of the Bill sets out the Secretary's responsibilities regarding general administration and information gathering. There is a separate division dealing with confidentiality and the protection and use of personal information. Chapter 7 also provides for the establishment, membership and organisation of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Chapter 8 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains notes following some provisions. These are designed to assist readers in locating definitions and other relevant provisions. Examples showing the operation of the provisions have been incorporated in the text to explain how some provisions work-especially those involving complex calculations. At the front of the Bill is a `Reader's Guide' which explains how the Bill is structured and how it can be used. </PARA>
<PARA> The rewrite of the Act does not involve any major policy initiatives and it does not have any financial impact. The new legislation is intended to reflect existing policy which is, in turn, reflected by the existing legislation. The primary purpose of the rewrite is to overcome readability problems that had developed mainly as a result of the volume of changes made to the current Act since 1947. Another important object of the rewrite is to make the Act easier to change in the future as the need arises. Those purposes would be fulfilled by this Bill. Furthermore, it is expected that this will pave the way for other large pieces of Federal legislation to be written or rewritten in a similar `clear English' style and format. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has already begun working on a `clear English' rewrite of part III of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill does not include any amendments to the Act introduced during these sittings. These changes will be introduced as amendments in the autumn sittings next year. A Bill covering the transitional arrangements and consequential amendments will follow this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation working party of the Social Security Advisory Council played a major part in the preparation and discussion of research papers and other less tangible ways in the development of this Bill. The members of the working party, especially its chairman, Professor Terry Carney, deserve special thanks for their enthusiastic and important contributions. That working party did an extraordinary amount of work for very limited compensation-well beyond the call of duty. </PARA>

Again, a great deal of forbearance and patience was necessary on the part of our external advisers. In the Department itself, people can imagine that some of the battles were, if not quite bitter, at times very heated.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Since coming to power in 1983 the Government has committed itself to improving the management of Commonwealth fisheries. In December 1989 the Government released a major policy statement setting out the future directions for Commonwealth fisheries management. The policy statement emphasised four objectives for fisheries management: to ensure that fisheries resources are not overexploited and that any exploitation is at a level which can be sustained while maintaining the surrounding environment; to enable commercial fishing operations to be as economically efficient as possible, using the most appropriate technology to achieve the greatest net returns; to create conditions where fishermen are able to make a payment to the community for the right to exploit a public resource for private gain, recognising that such a payment should not reduce the profitability of fishing operations to less than their current levels; and to ensure that the administration of Commonwealth fisheries should be conducted on the most efficient and effective basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation designed to achieve the first three objectives, which comprise the essence of the Government's fisheries management policies, is being drafted and will be put before Parliament in the autumn sittings next year. In addition to introducing new policies arising from the Government's policy statement, this legislation will replace the Fisheries Act 1952, which will be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us now concerns the administration of fisheries management. The Government recognises the importance of an effective and efficient administrative structure if the fisheries management objectives which I have outlined are to be achieved and sustained. This legislation establishes a new statutory authority-the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA)-to undertake the Government's fisheries management responsibilities. It also establishes a Fishing Industry Policy Council to provide advice to the Government on matters affecting the fishing industry and an Australian Fisheries Management Authority selection committee. An associated Fisheries Research and Development Corporation will also be established under the auspices of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, to commence from 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> My remarks will be primarily about the new Authority, although at the end I will come back to the selection processes and the role and composition of the Policy Council. The Government has decided to establish the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to undertake its fisheries management responsibilities which will be included in the Fisheries Management Bill to be introduced in the autumn sitting. It has done this because it believes that the statutory authority model of public administration has a number of important advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> These advantages include: increased industry and community involvement in decision making through an enhanced role for the management advisory committees, and industry and community involvement in selecting the governing board; increased flexibility of operations, without the constraints of a departmental structure; increased public accountability for the Authority for both decision making and expenditure; increased independence in day to day decision making, with ministerial involvement at a strategic level rather than ongoing involvement in operational matters; and increased incentives to ensure that all of the Authority's operations are conducted in a cost efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that these advantages are realised, the charter of the new Authority will be exclusively fisheries management. The Authority will not have to undertake the additional broad policy functions currently being performed by the Australian Fisheries Service. A policy branch will remain within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to handle those matters. In most cases the functions of these two bodies will be quite distinct. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will be required to manage the marine resources of the Australian fishing zone in accordance with the Government's sustainable development objectives and policies. The Authority's principal responsibilities will be: to develop and implement fishery-specific management plans; to set sustainable catch quotas for our fish stocks; to grant ongoing or temporary access to fish resources; to effectively monitor the activities of Australian and foreign fishermen licensed to exploit our fish resources; and to monitor the general performance of each fishery and introduce, where necessary, appropriate restructuring programs. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to undertake these responsibilities, the Authority will have an important role in identifying research and development requirements for fisheries and commissioning expert assistance from organisations such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Bureau of Rural Resources and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy branch within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy will retain its responsibility for advising the Government on broad strategic fisheries policy matters. These will include the development of resource use and environmental policies, advising on policy matters concerning foreign access to the Australian fishing zone, developing policy on fisheries access rights and the collection of community returns from the fishing industry, monitoring the effect of taxation rulings on fisheries management and developing policy that will reduce domestic and international marketing impediments for Australian fish products. The fisheries policy branch will also be required to monitor the overall performance of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority in regard to its implementation of the Government's fisheries management objectives and the general performance and profitability of the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated and in keeping with the principle that formal inter-government negotiations are led by Ministers and their officials, the Department will generally take the leading role in delegations to inter-governmental negotiations on fisheries matters and will represent the Government on multilateral fisheries fora. The Authority will also have a role in inter-governmental negotiations where these relate to fisheries management. It will assist the Department as required in such negotiations, as for example in the bilateral and trilateral arrangements with Japan concerning the international management of the southern bluefin tuna stocks, and the arrangements with Papua New Guinea on the management of Torres Strait fisheries, and with New Zealand on the driftnet surveillance program. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangements there will be a need to continue and, where possible, strengthen the close working relationship which currently exists between the Australian Fisheries Service, the Bureau of Rural Resources, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and relevant external agencies like the CSIRO. Because of the particular importance which I place on the work of the Bureau of Rural Resources, I will ensure that additional staff resources are made available to it from within my portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note, in keeping with the undertaking in the policy statement, that one quarter of one per cent of the gross value of fisheries production will be provided by the Government for fisheries research, and these funds will be distributed between the Authority, the Bureau of Rural Resources and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics at my discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> An important feature of the new administrative arrangement is the enhanced role which the Authority will be able to give-at its discretion-to management advisory committees. In order to meet the challenging responsibilities which I have outlined above, the Authority will be able to devolve functions to these committees to perform on behalf of AFMA. The Authority will still be the body which will be held accountable for meeting the fisheries management objectives, but nevertheless, provided that the Authority has confidence in a particular management advisory committee, that committee will be able to exercise considerable influence in the management of the fishery concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The functions of the management advisory committees are to advise the Authority in relation to fisheries management, to act as a liaison mechanism between the Authority and the fishermen concerned, and to assist in keeping the Authority informed about the biological and economic status of the fishery. Management advisory committees will consist of a chairperson-to be selected by the Authority-the fishery manager and up to seven members selected by the Authority after consultation with the industry, relevant State or Territory governments and relevant members of the research community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that the strength and success of the Authority will depend on the quality and calibre of its board. The Government is firmly convinced that it is highly desirable to select the board on the basis of expertise, and this legislation establishes a selection committee which will choose five of the board members. The selection committee itself will consist of two industry representatives to be nominated by the peak industry body, two community representatives, a nominee of the Australian Fisheries Council, and a presiding member to be selected by the Minister. I hope to be in a position to announce the name of the presiding member within the next few weeks. The National Fishing Industry Council will be specified in the regulations as the peak industry body. </PARA>
<PARA> There are clear parallels between these selection procedures for the Authority's board and those which are used for the statutory marketing authorities and the research and development corporations associated with my portfolio. However, there are also some important differences. The most important difference is the role which industry will play. Industry, quite rightly, has an influential role in the outlook and activities of the statutory marketing authorities and the research and development corporations, and is a key participant in the formation of industry commercial philosophy of those organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority will have the task of enforcing regulations which will prevent fisheries from being overexploited or overcapitalised. At times, the collective interest of all the fishermen in the fishery and of the broader community may be at odds with the self-interest of individual fishermen. Since the Authority will be a Government body undertaking the Government's regulatory role in fisheries management, it would be inappropriate for industry to have a dominant influence. To do so would be like asking the players to umpire their own football match. At the same time it is highly desirable for some board members of the Authority to have fishing industry experience. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason I have decided that the board of the Authority will consist of a chairperson and a government member to be selected by the Minister, with five directors to be selected by the special selection committee on the basis of their expertise. The areas of expertise will include commercial fishing, fishing industry operations other than fishing, fisheries science, natural resource management, economics and business management. There will be a requirement that no more than two directors be currently engaged in the fishing industry. The managing director of the Authority will be chosen by these seven directors and will be an ex-officio member of the board. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Authority has been given some independence from the industry, and indeed from day to day ministerial control, it is important that there are mechanisms through which the Authority will be held accountable. The Authority will be accountable at three levels. It will be required to submit both a longer term corporate plan and an annual operational plan to the Minister setting out the means by which it will achieve its statutory objectives. The Minister may approve or seek a variation to these documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will be required to provide an annual report to Parliament and will be subject to the scrutiny of parliamentary committees. It will also be subject to an annual audit by the Auditor-General. The Minister will have the power to direct the Authority in exceptional circumstances, but it will be a requirement that any such direction be presented to both Houses of Parliament and reported in the Authority's annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will be required to have a high degree of disclosure in its annual report. It will be required to focus in that document on strategic reporting against the goals and key parameters for performance outlined in its corporate and annual operational plans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority will also be accountable to the fishing industry and the general public. In addition to the annual report, the Authority will be required to hold public meetings at least once each year in order to ensure that the fishing industry and the community in general have an opportunity to consult the board, to question its members and to have them justify their management actions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the matter of staffing for the new Authority. I have consistently stressed that I want the employment conditions of the current staff in the Australian Fisheries Service to be safeguarded, and for employees transferring from the Australian Fisheries Service to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to continue to work under the Public Service Act 1922 and to enjoy their current conditions of service, including superannuation entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA> I also recognise the importance of providing the Authority with the flexibility to develop remuneration packages to attract and reward staff with particular skills. For this reason the legislation will give the Authority the power to set the terms and conditions of those employees who are recruited from outside the Australian Fisheries Service. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to make some brief remarks about the Fishing Industry Policy Council. This legislation establishes a statutory Fishing Industry Policy Council which will advise the Minister on matters which have been referred to it, or indeed on any other matters affecting the well-being of the industry. The Council will convene meetings and conferences, produce reports, consult with other persons as necessary and generally provide the Minister with an independent and wide-ranging source of information on the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The composition of the Council will be broad. It will consist of a chairperson; the chairperson of the Authority; the chairperson of the Fishing Industry Research and Development Corporation; a representative of the National Fishing Industry Training Council Ltd; two industry representatives representing the spectrum of catching, processing and marketing interests to be nominated by the peak industry body; a representative of recreational fishermen; and a person having an interest in environmental and/or consumer aspects. This membership may be widened to include representatives of other groups at a later stage at the discretion of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will not have any significant affect on government expenditure. The Authority will be funded on the same basis as that currently in place for the Australian Fisheries Service of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, with 90 per cent of attributable management costs being recovered from the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Some additional government funding may initially be required to cover transitional arrangements. The Industry Commission is to review the basis of cost recovery for fisheries management prior to December 1991 and every five years thereafter. However, it is worth remembering that the Government, as custodian of the marine resources of the Australian fishing zone, will always retain certain responsibilities and meet the costs associated with the management of those resources. Examples of such responsibilities are surveillance costs to detect illegal foreign fishing activities, and protecting the traditional way of life of Torres Strait Islanders in joint authority with Queensland and in treaty with Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> In drafting this legislation the Government intends that, where relevant, the new policy adjustments for statutory marketing authorities arising from the report of the Davis Committee be included in the arrangements for the Authority. In particular, this legislation does not contain any restrictions on the appointment of directors because of their age and limits the duration of their tenure to three consecutive terms. It also requires the Authority to identify key indicators of its performance in its corporate and annual operational plans and to report on these in its annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry, through representatives of the National Fishing Industry Council, have been kept informed of the development of this legislation and have actively participated in ensuring a smooth transition to the new Authority through a special liaison committee. They have been supportive and constructive and many of their suggestions are embodied in this Bill. I thank them for their assistance and look forward to continuing productive consultations. With their assistance I believe that the target date for the establishment of the Authority on or before 1 July 1991 can be achieved. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the Grape Research Levy Act 1986 to remove minor legislative inconsistencies and improve the operation of research and development in the portfolio. The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 set the framework for the establishment of research and development corporations and councils for smaller industries to improve the management of portfolio research activities. There are a small number of drafting errors in this Act, which this Bill will correct. </PARA>
<PARA> While these changes are relatively minor in themselves, collectively they are important and necessary for the smooth operation of the research and development corporations and councils established under the principal Act. These amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act remove anomalies in reporting requirements for research and development corporations and councils and streamline reporting requirements for selection committees by allowing the incorporation of their report in the annual report of the associated research and development corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill makes references to representative organisations consistent throughout the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. Representative organisations as defined by that Act are declared to be associated with the research and development corporation or council rather than with industry. This Bill corrects inaccurate mention of representative organisations being associated with industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill removes the unintended anomaly of having different reporting schedules for research and development councils and corporations. Annual operational and five-year plans for research and development councils will now be submitted in line with timing requirements for research and development corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also provides that the chairpersons of research and development councils attend annual coordination meetings along with chairpersons of research and development corporations. This Bill also amends the Grape Research Levy Act 1986. The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 inadvertently amended this Act and removed the right of relevant industry organisations, whose members pay the levy, to make recommendations to the Minister regarding the rate of the industry levy for funding grape research. This amendment will restore that right. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures set out in this Bill will involve no Commonwealth outlays. Administrative savings may be achieved for the research and development corporations and councils through the inclusion of selection committee reports in the relevant corporation's annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> The major impact of the Bill will be the removing of inconsistencies in reporting requirements for research and development corporations and councils, the clarification of the use of the term `representative organisation' and the remedying of the unintended alteration to the process for determining the level of levies in the grape and wine industry. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It will give effect to the personal tax cuts announced on 20 November 1990 and make a consequential amendment to the rebate allowable for medical expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital gains tax amendments to be made by the Bill will ease restrictions on the availability of capital gains tax rollover relief and also ensure capital losses are not brought forward artificially as a consequence of asset transfers between companies under common ownership. Some technical amendments to the capital gains tax provisions as they apply to disposals of partnership assets are also proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> A Budget announcement to be given effect by this Bill will limit the franking credits available to life assurance companies under the imputation system. It will also provide for the taxation treatment of various bereavement payments that have replaced the special temporary allowance and funeral benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments contained in this Bill will modify the foreign income legislation presently before the Parliament to remove some potential double taxation, to correct technical deficiencies and overcome tax avoidance avenues, and to implement the Budget announcement to extend the deductions for certain capital expenditures on particular activities in Australia to similar offshore activities that generate income to be taxed here. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also ensure that a deduction is not allowable for bad debts of a foreign branch of a moneylender who has not derived assessable income from those debts. Finally, the Bill will amend certain provisions of the Taxation Administration Act that deal with the protection of taxation information. I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Personal Tax Cuts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government announced on 20 November 1990 that it had reached agreement with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to replace the first wage adjustment under accord mark 6 with personal tax cuts to cement in place Australia's decelerating inflation rate which is now lower than the average for Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to reduce the lowest marginal rate of tax, applying in the income range $5,401 to $20,700, from 21 per cent to 20 per cent. This reduction will only apply for resident individuals and trustees. As the change applies from 1 January 1991 a composite rate scale will apply for the 1990-91 financial year. That scale will comprise a weighted average of one-half of the rate scale applying from 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1990, and one half of the new rate scale that is to apply from 1 January to 30 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The lower rate of tax will be reflected in pay as you earn deductions from 1 January 1991. It will not be used in the calculation or recalculation of 1990-91 provisional tax, but will be available to provisional taxpayers on assessment in 1991-92. The cost to the revenue of the personal tax cuts is estimated at $430m in 1990-91, and $1 billion in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Rebate for Medical Expenses</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of the reduction in the lowest marginal rate of tax from 21 to 20 per cent, which I have just mentioned, the level of the rebate of tax for net medical expenses exceeding $1,000 will be reduced to 20 per cent for 1991-92 and subsequent years. The revenue savings from this measure are estimated at $2m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital Gains Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Capital gains tax rollover relief will be made more accessible for asset transfers in a company group. Existing anti-avoidance rules require the issue of shares or securities equal in value to the transferred asset as consideration for the transfer. Taxpayers and professional groups have made a number of representations over difficulties that company groups experience in reorganising their business affairs to meet these requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has considered the arguments put to it and has decided to replace the existing requirements with a new anti-avoidance provision-to be inserted by this Bill-that will deem a transferred asset to have been disposed of at market value if the group relationship between the two companies subsequently ceases. The Government believes that this change will make it easier for company groups to reorganise without suffering any adverse capital gains tax consequences, while still maintaining the Government's antiavoidance objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes a number of technical measures to ensure that no artificial timing advantages are obtained by shareholders in a company as a result of the transfer of an asset to another group company for reduced consideration. At present, such asset transfers between 100 per cent commonly owned company groups can result in the early realisation of capital losses or reduced capital gains on the disposal of shares in the transferor company. Advantages can also arise in some cases in respect of loans made to the transferor company. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that no taxpayer should obtain tax advantages by reason of an internal reorganisation of a company group's affairs, as a result of which assets are transferred within the group. To prevent this, the Bill proposes a series of cost base adjustments to shares or loans held, directly and indirectly, in the respective companies, that is, the transferor and transferee of the asset. The adjustments are intended to reflect changes in the value of shares or loans held within the group following the transfer of assets from one group company to another. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions will apply only where actual consideration paid for the transfer of an asset is less than its indexed cost base or, if less, its market value. In other words, companies will be able to avoid the need to make any cost base adjustments by ensuring that consideration equal to the indexed cost base of an asset is paid for its transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will make a number of technical amendments to make it clear that the capital gains tax consequences on the disposal of a partnership asset will be accounted for by the individual partners, and not by the partnership. The capital gains tax rollover and partnership amendments will not substantially change the operation of the existing law and should have no revenue impact. The amendments to deny timing advantages for asset transfers between commonly owned companies will prevent significant but unquantifiable revenue losses. </PARA>
<PARA>Dividend Imputation Arrangements for Life Assurance Companies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under present law, tax paid by a company gives rise to a franking credit which may be used to frank dividends paid to shareholders. This is also the case for mutual life assurance companies and government insurance offices which have no shareholders to whom dividends can be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments contained in the Bill will give effect to the Budget announcement to deny mutual life assurance companies and government insurance offices the right to maintain a franking account, and cancel any surplus of franking credits held by them at 21 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> As also announced in the Budget, franking credits arising to non-mutual life assurance companies from the beginning of their next franking year on account of tax paid on the income from statutory fund business will be reduced by 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures will stop double dipping of imputation credits and prevent the potential loss of significant but unquantifiable amounts of revenue. New shareholders of companies that were previously mutuals, or of privatised government insurance offices, will not have access to franking credits that arose before such companies changed their status. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also give effect to the Government's decision that franking credits should arise to non-mutual life assurance companies for 20 per cent of franked dividends paid on assets included in their insurance funds. This will apply to franked dividends received by the companies from the beginning of their next franking year. </PARA>
<PARA>Bereavement Payments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No.4) 1989 gave effect to a number of measures announced in the 1989-90 Budget, including a scheme of bereavement payments to either replace the tax exempt special temporary allowance and funeral benefit, or to make such payments in a number of situations not previously covered by the special temporary allowance. This Bill will ensure that the taxation treatment of bereavement payments is broadly the same as the treatment which applied to the benefits they replaced. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, the Bill will exempt from tax the additional pension payment that is made following the death of a pensioner without a pensioner spouse, and the payment made to a third party in the situation where the death of the first deceased pensioner is not notified until after the spouse has also died. Further, the bereavement payment made following the death of a child to a person who was in receipt of a child related payment will also be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Sole parent's pension is now continued for 14 weeks after the death of the only qualifying child. These payments will continue to be included in assessable income. The continuation of carer's pension for 14 weeks after the death of the person being cared for, not being the carer's spouse, will be exempt in certain circumstances where the recipient is under age pension age. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also exempt from tax the bereavement payment made to a widow or widower of a veteran or mariner who was in receipt of a disability pension. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost to revenue of these proposals is less than $500,000 in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Source Income Measures</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to the proposal announced in the Budget to extend the scope of certain special deduction provisions of the income tax law relating to capital expenditures incurred in particular activities or investments which take place in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Those provisions are to be broadened to allow these deductions for relevant capital expenditures incurred after 7.30 p.m. eastern standard time on 21 August 1990 in the derivation of income that will be assessable in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Bill will extend, in relation to foreign activities that generate assessable income-</PARA>
<PARA> * the deductions relating to mining and petroleum activities in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> * the deductions for industrial property granted, registered or subsisting in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> * the deductions for capital expenditure on buildings in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that the cost to revenue of extending these deductions will be less than $15m in 1991-92 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also announced in the Budget that, because of the way the income tax law dealing with bad debts is couched, it is arguable that a financial institution is entitled to an income tax deduction for bad debts of its foreign branch that are written off even though, under the proposed new foreign income measures, the income of the branch will generally be exempt from Australian income tax. Measures in this Bill will ensure that a deduction will not be allowable for bad debts in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> An appropriate apportionment arrangement will apply where a relevant loan has been created or acquired after 7.30 p.m. Australian eastern standard time on 21 August 1990, and some of the income derived from the loan debt will be assessable to Australian tax. While there is no revenue gain or loss from this measure, it could be significant in protecting the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments contained in this Bill are directed at removing some potential for double taxation and correcting technical deficiencies in legislation now before the Parliament in terms of the Foreign Income Bill, and at removing tax avoidance avenues. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of these amendments are aimed at ensuring continuity in the capital gains tax treatment of assets when an entity either ceases to be or becomes an Australian resident. For the purpose of calculating the attributable income, the assets will be treated as having been disposed of and re-acquired on the change of residence. This will ensure that no part of any capital gain is taxed twice. </PARA>
<PARA> Also to eliminate double taxation, income of a controlled foreign company will not be attributed to Australian taxpayers where they hold interests in the CFC through another entity resident in a country that taxes the income under its accrual tax measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Other measures in the Bill will extend foreign tax credit and exemption arrangements to certain deemed dividends subject to appropriate notification within one year of the end of the relevant financial year. These credits and exemptions would then be available in much the same way as where an actual dividend is paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The definitions of `exempting receipt' and `notional exempt income' in the Foreign Income Bill are to be amended to ensure that premiums paid for insurance or reinsurance with non-residents are not categorised with income that has been subject to full rates of Australian tax. The cases covered are those where, under special provisions of our domestic law, only 10 per cent of the premium income is subject to Australian tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes being made to the foreign branch exemption provisions will create greater certainty about the time at which the tests for exemption are to be met, and close off tax avoidance opportunities. They will also align the treatment of foreign source capital gains and losses of an overseas branch of a resident company. This will be done by ensuring that a foreign capital loss is not available for offset against capital gains where, had that loss been a gain, it would have been exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Other measures in the Bill will close potential avoidance avenues by the use of interposed partnerships and trusts to prevent Australian residents being assessed on income from a CFC, and will allow a deduction for interest payable on certain convertible notes in calculating the attributable income of a CFC. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, to effect minor technical changes consequential upon the proposed introduction-in the Foreign Income Bill-of a new system for the quarantining of foreign losses. The revenue impact of the amendments to the foreign income measures is not quantifiable. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of Information</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the provisions in the Taxation Administration Act in two respects. The existing law makes it an offence for a person knowingly to take action to obtain information held under or for the purposes of a Commonwealth taxation law, unless the person does so in the course of exercising powers or performing functions under the law. This is having the unintended effect of hindering enforcement activities by State and Territory taxation authorities which, for purposes of their own revenue laws, are seeking access to information collected by businesses and used for the purposes of a Commonwealth taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA> The law will be changed so that an offence is committed if a person takes action other than in authorised circumstances to obtain access to records containing information about a person's affairs, but only if those records are in the possession of the Commissioner of Taxation and are held by the Commissioner for the purposes of a Commonwealth taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevant provision will no longer operate to prohibit access to records that are in the possession of someone other than the Commissioner. The amendment will not adversely affect the confidentiality of tax file number or other personal information as the taxation and criminal laws contain safeguards which ensure that any unauthorised conduct in these areas is an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the law will be strengthened to create an additional offence if a person uses information in respect of another person's affairs held by the Commissioner, where the information was obtained by breach of a taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to support the Privacy Amendment Bill 1990 which is before the House and, of course, to reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). I listened to the honourable member for Higgins last night and again just briefly this afternoon. He is certainly getting mixed up with regard to what this whole matter is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If he had referred to the Bill itself and also to the second reading speech, he would have realised that this matter is about privacy protection for individuals in relation to their consumer credit records. I think that is very important. Privacy is something that we all cherish greatly. We are always very conscious of our own assets and information kept about us. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point made by the honourable member for Higgins that I want to pick up is in relation to businesses trying to provide credit for various clients. The Bill actually picks that up in proposed new section 18K, which provides that information can be made available to credit providers provided that the credit provider has specific written instructions or authority from his client. It is an important area that has been covered. I do not think that some of the concerns expressed by the honourable member for Higgins are valid.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill represents a watershed in privacy provisions at two distinct levels: firstly, through the extension of information privacy principles contained in the Privacy Act to a private database; and, secondly, through the creation of a complete array of consumer rights in relation to that database. </PARA>
<PARA> In today's climate, the importance of a good credit rating cannot be underestimated. Take the case of a family applying for a housing loan. It would be grossly unfair for any incorrectly recorded information pertaining to the couple's previous credit history to be the sole reason for their loan application being refused. The honourable member for Higgins mentioned a similar situation with regard to real estate agents. It would be dreadful for somebody to be refused a roof over his head in a rental situation purely on the basis of credit reference information. I think that there are other ways of dealing with the situation. Rental accommodation is excepted. Bonds, rent in advance and all those sorts of aspects are covered quite well. It would be dreadful if someone were refused accommodation for his family because of misinformation provided to a credit bureau or agency. </PARA>
<PARA> Allegations that a person has failed to respond to letters requesting that he contact a financial institution may not necessarily be true. The person may not have responded because he had changed his address. A change of address form may not have been received by the institution. If it had been received, it may not have been recorded correctly. </PARA>
<PARA> These days a lot of information is kept on computers. I am sure that many honourable members have found when they have tried to notify a change of address that they still get mail sent to the incorrect address. These things do take time and errors do happen from time to time. Certainly, it would be pretty bad news if someone were adversely affected in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> If either of those situations were the case, people would have felt that they had adequately ensured that the institution knew of their whereabouts. For these and a host of other reasons, a person may incur a bad credit rating. Therefore, when people apply for loans, it is important that the credit information recorded by agencies be as accurate as possible. It should also be the case that where information has been incorrectly recorded a person should have reasonable means of redressing that error. The Bill specifically addresses this area in that in cases where a credit provider refuses an application for credit and the refusal is based wholly or partly on information derived from a credit reporting agency, that credit provider must give notice to the individual in writing as to why the application has been refused, whether the refusal was based wholly or partly, as the case requires, on information derived from a credit report given by a credit reporting agency, and the name and address of the credit reporting agency. The individual has the right under the Act to obtain access to his credit information file maintained by the credit reporting agency. </PARA>
<PARA> Such measures have twofold benefits in that they place great emphasis on the need for credit reporting agencies to maintain accurate records-something that is in their own interests, that protects their own credibility and that, importantly, gives the individual the means necessary to redress any erroneous records that a credit reporting agency may hold in his name. It is also only fair and reasonable that there be limits to the use or disclosure of material held by credit reporting agencies and, once information is given to credit providers, that they too be limited in what they are able to do with that information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill clearly provides for the first of these in its requirement for a credit reporting agency in possession or control of an individual's credit information file not to disclose personal information contained in the file to any person other than the individual, unless the information is required for the purposes of determining that individual's eligibility for credit of some kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also prohibits credit reporting agencies from disclosing personal information contained in an individual's credit information file if the file or other record contains personal information that the credit reporting agency would be prohibited from including in an individual's credit information file or would be required to delete from such a file. These requirements are backed up by severe penalties. Any credit reporting agency that knowingly or recklessly contravenes either of the above requirements is guilty of a maximum penalty of $150,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional safeguards for individuals include the requirement for credit reporting agencies to include a note on a person's file of any disclosures of information, and the requirement for agencies not to include in a credit report given to a credit provider any information relating to that person's commercial activities. Once the information has been given to credit providers, strict limitations are provided for in the Bill as to what the credit provider is able to do with that information. </PARA>
<PARA> The credit provider must not use the report or any personal information derived from the report for any purpose other than assessing an application for credit made to the credit provider by the individual concerned except in extreme circumstances. Such circumstances may be where the report was obtained from a record containing publicly accessible information and the credit provider uses the report or information to assess an application for credit made to the credit provider by the individual concerned; where the credit provider uses the information to assist in the collection of payments that are overdue in respect of credit provided to the individual by the credit provider; or where the credit provider believes, on reasonable grounds, that the individual has committed a serious credit infringement and the report or information is used in connection with that infringement. The penalty for breaching such conditions is also a maximum of $150,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the possibility of positive reporting, that is, the provision of all information about a person's financial dealings, has been closed off through the imposition of such limitations to the use of credit information. Credit consumers' rights are greatly enhanced through the Bill's provisions for a person authorised by the Privacy Commissioner to enter the premises of credit reporting agencies and credit providers to inspect documents for the purposes of performing the Commissioner's functions as designated under the Act. It is also a requirement of the Bill that the person whose premises are entered should provide reasonable assistance to the person carrying out the investigation on behalf of the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Having a secondary interest in consumer protection through my involvement with the Ipswich and West Moreton Consumers Association in my electorate of Oxley, I am pleased that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) principles on personal privacy have been maintained. Much of the credit for this lies in the detailed consultation with all players in the consumer credit protection arena which has gone on for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 18 months of deliberations that led to the passing of the legislation in the other place, a wide variety of groups have been involved, including the Privacy Commissioner, the Credit Reference Association of Australia, the Real Estate Institute of Australia, the Institute of Mercantile Agents and the Insurance Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The diverse background of these groups illustrates a further point, and that is the complexities of the marketplace today and the array of information people must deal with when making consumer decisions. The sheer pace of today's society makes it vital for laws such as those proposed in the Privacy Amendment Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the Bill's provisions for the Privacy Commissioner to have responsibilities for supervising the consumer credit industry, this very question is addressed. Importantly, this will mean an enhanced level of consumer protection for credit consumers to a degree that will protect Australians from the sort of practices which have flourished in this area in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Through such measures Australia has adhered to the OECD's guidelines on personal privacy. These principles cover that there should be limits to the collection of personal data. Any such data should be obtained by lawful and fair means with the knowledge or consent of the data-subject; that personal data should be relevant to the purpose for which it is to be used and should be accurate; that the purposes for which personal data is collected should be specified at the time of collection and subsequent use limited to the fulfilment of these purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, that personal data should not be disclosed for other purposes except with the consent of the data-subject or where required by law; that personal data should be protected by security safeguards, and individuals should be aware who holds their personal data; that individuals should have a right of access to and correction of their personal data; and that a data controller should be accountable for complying with measures to give effect to these principles. </PARA>
<PARA> While these internationally acclaimed principles are encompassed in the Bill, it is important to point out that so too is the protection of any existing State and Territory laws relating to interferences with privacy in credit reporting and which are capable of operating concurrently with this legislation. Appropriately, the conditions contained in the Bill are also extended to every external Territory of Australia. This will provide for a smooth transition for the changes contained in this legislation with consumers not being required to come to grips with a complete new protection system. </PARA>
<PARA> Redefinition of some terms contained in the Privacy Act 1988 will enhance further protection of credit information in Australia. For example, there needs to be a clear distinction between the protection of credit records in the commercial sector and those of individual consumers. This distinction is central to the scheme defined in the Bill. Because credit, as it is already defined, refers to consumer credit, the insertion of a new definition is required to cover non-consumer credit in view of the distinction between the two areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence the Bill satisfactorily addresses the need for the distinction by defining non-consumer credit as a loan given to an individual, other than a loan given to an individual to be used for domestic family or household, that is, consumer credit purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> To facilitate smooth administration of credit reporting regulations, the definition of a `credit reporting business' deliberately considers only such organisations to be those businesses or undertakings that involve themselves in the preparation or maintenance of records containing personal information relating to individuals for the purpose of providing information to other persons on an individual's eligibility to be provided with credit, history in relation to credit, or capacity to repay credit, whether or not the information is provided for the purposes of assessing applications for credit.</PARA>
<PARA> Because the purpose of the Bill is not to regulate the reporting of publicly available information, the definition does not include a business or undertaking that prepares records in which the only personal information is publicly available information. </PARA>
<PARA> With the complexities consumers face when making their daily transactions, there is an ever-increasing amount of information about individuals' credit histories. It is therefore imperative that there be limits placed on the number of institutions able to access that information which may be held by credit reporting agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11B of the Bill addresses this specific need by providing that a body will be regarded as a credit provider for the purposes of the principal Act if the body is either a bank or a corporation which is one of the following: a building society, a credit union, a retailer which issues credit cards or charge cards, or a corporation a substantial part of whose business is the provision of loans, including the issue of credit cards or charge cards. </PARA>
<PARA> To link in with the previously cited distinction in definitions between domestic consumer credit and that of commercial concerns, this definition of credit providers will also include commercial credit providers. The benefit here is that in certain circumstances, disclosure of a consumer credit report by a credit reporting agency to a commercial credit provider will be allowed, as will the use of commercial credit reports by a credit provider for the assessment of consumer credit transactions. An integral part of the legislation is the provision for the development of a code of conduct for the collection and handling of personal credit information by the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 18A of the Bill provides that the code can deal with the following: the collection of personal information for inclusion in individuals' credit information files; the storage of, security of, access to, correction of, use of, and disclosure of personal information included in individuals' credit information files or in credit reports; any other activities engaged in by credit reporting agencies or credit providers that are connected with credit reporting; and the procedure for the manner in which disputes between individuals, credit providers, and credit reporting agencies, including their initial resolution, are to be handled by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The consultative process that has been a piece of this legislation since its inception is again evident in the requirement for the Privacy Commissioner, in formulating the code, to consult with the credit industry, government, consumer and privacy groups and other relevant bodies to the extent that it is appropriate and practical to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, in preparing the code of conduct, the Commissioner is required to have regard for the information privacy principles set out in Section 14 of the principal Act, the provisions of part IIIA of the principal Act, and the likely costs to credit reporting agencies and credit providers of complying with the code of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> On this last point, it is estimated that there will be minimal direct cost impact on consumer credit reporting agencies and credit providers, as the industry already finances a self-regulatory scheme for the industry. Clause 18B of the legislation requires that a credit reporting agency or a credit provider must not engage in any activity that breaches the code and in doing so regards any breach of the code of conduct as an interference with an individual's privacy.``As such, a credit reporting agency or credit provider could be prosecuted for an offence or be liable to pay damages as compensation for an infringement of an individual's privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> There are contained in the Bill rigid guidelines on organisations permitted to operate as credit reporting agencies. It is only those persons who are corporations who are able to carry out a credit reporting business. </PARA>
<PARA> Further strengthening the Government's commitment to privacy of individuals in the consumer credit area is the imposition of a maximum penalty of $30,000 for anyone who breaches such conditions. Strict limitations also exist as to the information which may be kept on a credit information file. Such information is limited to information which has a direct and relevant bearing upon eligibility for consumer credit. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the legislation proposed before us tonight, credit reporting agencies will be prohibited from holding personal information on any individual, except where the information relates to records of applications made for credit; defaulted payments-that is, where the individual's payments to the credit provider are at least 60 days overdue and the credit provider has taken steps to recover any part of the debt; bankruptcy; judgments; serious credit infringements; dishonoured cheques; and necessary identifier information. In addition, credit reporting agencies must delete from an individual's credit information file any personal information in respect of which the maximum permissible period to retain that information has expired. The Bill provides that the credit reporting agency has a period of one month after the expiry of that period in which to make the deletion. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the great differences in the types of credit that people apply for today, there have been set aside varying limits on the length of time for which credit recording agencies are able to keep credit records. These include five years for information concerning a credit provider, or a mortgage or trade insurer having sought a credit report in relation to the individual. The five-year period will run from the day on which the credit report concerned was sought. A similar period is provided for in the case of credit provided to individuals that has lapsed into overdue status, and dishonoured cheques; information concerning judgments made against the individual; in the case of a notation of a current credit provider, 14 days from the day the reporting agency receives notification that the credit provider is no longer a current credit provider in relation to the individual concerned; and in cases relating to bankruptcy orders and serious credit infringements, a seven-year period of retaining credit records will be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> During the time I served in my last occupation prior to coming to this place, I witnessed the down side of consumers being affected by inaccurate credit reporting, and how much those people relied on adequate protection in consumer credit areas. I can actually recall instances where information which had been provided by a credit reporting agency was incorrect, really through no fault of the individual. There may be some dispute in a lot of cases. Of course, I mentioned before that the change of address question often comes up, but certainly those cases in which there were disputes were quite common. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I feel it is important to emphasise how this specific Bill fits in with the Government's overall program to give consumers the necessary power to control their own financial destiny in an increasingly complex financial environment. The Bill sits firmly alongside the agreement reached earlier in the year on uniform national credit legislation. This will give consumers uniform information and uniform practices in their personal dealings with financial institutions. I point out that to complete such measures, the Government has moved to establish a complaint resolution scheme in the insurance industry and has put in place a review of levels of consumer information made available by the superannuation industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Privacy Amendment Bill aims to extend privacy protection under the Privacy Act of 1988 to consumers subjected to credit reference reporting. It principally affects the Credit Reference Association of Australia Ltd (CRAA), which is responsible for about 98 per cent of all credit reference reporting in Australia. The CRAA is owned by its 4,800 members, who include major financial and lending institutions and various retail and manufacturing companies. This data base is accessed as many as 30,000 times a day by these credit providers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition accepts the need for some regulation in this area. The information obtained by credit providers from consumers could be said to become the providers' property, which they should be free to dispose of as they wish, although in accordance with any conditions that consumers might wish to impose on the use of that information. Consumers and credit providers could, in theory, enter into contracts governing the uses to which credit information could be put which would obviate the need for legislation such as we are debating today. Unfortunately, the transaction costs that would be imposed by such contractual arrangements would be prohibitive if they were to adequately protect consumers from potential invasions of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumers generally wish to supply only enough information as will facilitate transactions for which they are seeking credit. Credit providers, however, obviously have an interest in combining and sharing this information to the greatest possible extent so as to apply it to all subsequent transactions and thereby minimise their exposure to credit risks. Today's information technology makes possible extremely comprehensive credit reference reporting. We have thus seen, on the part of the credit reporting industry, moves towards so-called positive reporting of consumers' credit records. </PARA>
<PARA> Such reporting would include not only the negative aspects of a person's credit record but also detailed information about spending habits, financial commitments, assets, timeliness of past repayments and the like. Credit reference reporting agencies would thereby be in a position to compile vast amounts of personal information about consumers, information that is simply unnecessary to form judgments about credit risks and which would pose a considerable threat to the privacy of individuals. It would seem that a regulatory solution to this problem is inevitable in current circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will support moves by the Government to outlaw such positive reporting. The banning of positive reporting and the enhancement of the consumer protection provided for under the Privacy Act was to be the principal purpose of this Bill. However, the Government has taken this legislation much, much further. As it has emerged from its lengthy passage through the Senate, the Bill places numerous and unnecessary restrictions on current negative credit reporting practices. It will give Australia some of the most restrictive credit reference laws in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill prohibits much of the current commercial access to credit reference reporting. The CRAA has indicated that a great number of its current members would no longer be able to use its services after this legislation is passed. The exact number is difficult to ascertain since there is scope for greater access to be secured for some credit providers via application to the Privacy Commissioner and with the consent of consumers. Not only does this Bill impose enormous restrictions on access to credit reference reporting, in some respects it fails to adequately protect the privacy of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal problem with this Bill is that it is based on an entirely spurious and overly narrow definition of what constitutes credit. It is indicative of the entirely inappropriate concept of credit employed in this Bill that it effectively excludes so many of the current members of the CRAA. Credit under this Bill is defined as a loan, and then only a loan for domestic, family or household purposes. Clearly credit takes a myriad forms other than that of the direct provision of a loan to consumers. The Bill makes a wholly unrealistic distinction between personal and business credit. A lot of credit provision simply cannot be categorised in this manner. Particularly in the case of small business, it is common for commercial loans to be applied for household purposes while personal loans can be used to facilitate the operation of a business. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this narrow concept of what constitutes credit is to completely prohibit access to credit reference reporting by a whole range of credit providers such as real estate agents, insurance companies, mercantile agents and any other entity which is not deemed to be a so-called substantial credit provider under the terms of the Bill. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) claimed that the use of credit records for `insurance proposals, insurance fraud and rental housing' would `clearly breach privacy principles'. Why this should be so needs to be spelled out, since it is by no means obvious to us on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The extra costs imposed by this legislation on businesses, and ultimately consumers, will be enormous. Real estate agents will not be able to check on the solvency of tenants, despite the well established link between breaches of tenancy and credit difficulties. It will become extremely difficult for the insurance industry to combat the billion dollar insurance fraud racket. </PARA>
<PARA> Small businesses will not be able to use debt collectors to recover their debts economically since debt collectors will also be denied access to the CRAA database. It is small businesses such as retailers more than the large personal finance companies which are in the greatest need of the pooled resources of an organisation such as the CRAA. Yet mercantile agents are locked out of credit reference reporting by this Bill. In its place the Government somehow expects businesses to make an application to the Privacy Commissioner, who is then required to make a recommendation to the Parliament as to their suitability for access to the CRAA. There will no doubt be a stream of class-like actions by business groups, seeking a determination that they are `other credit providers' as defined, to obtain adequate security from excessive exposure to credit risk. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill thus greatly enhances the powers of the Privacy Commissioner, powers against which there are inadequate appeal mechanisms. The Commissioner will be responsible for formulating the code of conduct which will regulate the behaviour of the industry. The Commissioner will be able to investigate breaches of the code, make binding determinations as to its interpretation and, where necessary, prosecute members of the industry for breaching the code. The Commissioner will thus be the rule-maker, judge and jury all rolled into one. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that even Telecom Australia, which is one of the biggest credit providers in Australia, is denied access to credit reference reporting under this Bill, despite the millions of dollars it loses to bad debts every year. While this might not make much of a dent in Telecom's enormous monopoly profits, these problems will be devastating for many small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this Bill has been variously estimated at between $1.3 billion and $2.4 billion per year. These costs will be passed on directly to consumers in the form of higher prices and higher premiums. There will be a massive and wholly undeserved transfer of wealth from responsible consumers who will face higher prices to the increasing numbers of debtors who will be able to escape the wrath of the law under this misconceived legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see that the honourable member for Chifley is shaking his head. Who does he think is going to pay the $1.3 billion to $2.4 billion? I know that he believes in the fairies because he will follow the Treasurer (Mr Keating) anywhere and accept the nonsense that he trots out day after day. Who does he think is going to pay the $1.3 billion-plus a year? It will be the consumers, and the sooner that gets through his thick skull the sooner he will be developing sensible legislation in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There will be a massive and wholly undeserved transfer of wealth from responsible consumers, and they will face higher prices. We will get a larger number of over-committed borrowers and creditors due to the greatly reduced accessibility to credit reporting. The Government subscribes to the nonsense that we see trotted out from time to time about how those in the lower socio-economic groups are the object of predators in the commercial world. Yet it goes through this sort of nonsense to facilitate the very thing it rails and rants against in this place. It does not think it through. It is particularly true of the honourable member for Chifley because he does not understand how these mechanisms work. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to illustrate the effects of this Bill, I need only quote from a letter to the Australian Financial Review on 30 August this year in which P. J. Balsarini, Managing Director of A &amp;K Mercantile Pty Ltd, said:</PARA>
<PARA>From a selfish point of view, I hope the Bill does exclude debt collectors. If no debt collector has access to the Credit Reference Association of Australia, we all remain on an equal footing and the legislation will increase referrals to companies like mine. </PARA>
<PARA>It is debtors and debt collectors who will benefit from this Bill. The Bill encourages credit providers to seek out alternative, unregulated, and perhaps more intrusive means of assessing the creditworthiness of individuals and to track down debts. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the real estate industry, for example, we are bound to see the emergence of tenant databases that will be completely outside the scope of this legislation. Credit providers will adopt arbitrary measures of the creditworthiness of their customers in an attempt to compensate them for the lack of information available to them. They will resort to subjective appraisals of people's creditworthiness, whereas they previously had access to the far more objective information available from the CRAA. This will disadvantage people from lower socio-economic groups, and people with other characteristics of dubious relevance to their creditworthiness. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite extensive regulation of credit reference reporting there are some major omissions in terms of the privacy protection afforded by the proposed amendments to the Act. There is no automatic notification to consumers when credit reference files are accessed. The artificial distinction between personal and commercial credit means that while individuals seeking personal loans must be notified if their credit reference report was responsible for their being denied a loan, would-be commercial borrowers have no such benefit; nor can commercial borrowers access their credit files or challenge the accuracy of information in them in the way that personal credit users can. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill thus violates many of the provisions of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines on personal privacy, which the Minister claims this legislation is meant to uphold. It is little wonder then that business and the credit reference reporting industry have been overwhelmingly opposed to this Bill. This Bill imposes enormous and wholly unnecessary costs on the Australian community, and yet contains major omissions in terms of its protection of the privacy of individuals, which was the supposed rationale for this legislation in the first place. This Bill totally fails to achieve the balanced approach that the Minister claimed for it in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for those reasons and others advanced by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) that I wholeheartedly support his amendment. He goes to the heart of the matters of concern to us where he refers to the Bill proposing arbitrary and unjustified prohibitions on the collection of information concerning the credit standing of applicants for consumer and commercial credit. Between us I think we have detailed enough argument to support that contention. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill fails to allow commercial organisations with legitimate needs access to credit records. It will deter the detection of insurance fraud, as I have already said. It will add to the cost of insurance. It will add to the cost of goods and services and impose additional costs and inefficiency on business, on consumers and on commercial operations. It will not, I am afraid to say, adequately protect individual privacy. It is opposed by a number of State Ministers for consumer affairs. I would have thought that the Minister at the table, who made such a virtue out of the cooperation he has been able to obtain from all governments in connection with corporations legislation, would have made the effort to get the cooperation and support of his State counterparts. Obviously if he has sought to do that he has been singularly unsuccessful because there is much opposition from State Ministers for consumer affairs or their equivalents, as I have said. </PARA>
<PARA> The corporations legislation-that enormous piece of legislation, probably the most important in terms of company law in this country in my 12 years in the Parliament-was guillotined through the House of Representatives in something like 70 minutes or less at the last sitting. No wonder people in Western Australia are saying, `What is this Government about? It won't even debate the most important piece of corporation legislation-in the history of the country, probably-in the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak against the amendment, I speak for the Privacy Amendment Bill and I speak for the poor. I notice that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raised the plight of the poor. The plight of the poor has got nothing to do with this Bill. Indeed, the plight of the economy has got nothing to do with the poor; it has got all to do with corporate cowboys wasting billions of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member did make a number of remarks during his contribution which I need to respond to. He pointed to the plight of real estate agents, which I thought was an unfortunate example. Here we are talking about the provision of credit. What happens if people want to lease or rent a house, a flat or a unit? The first thing they have to do is put a bond up. They are not going to draw on credit; they actually have to provide the reverse. They must provide physical money to the real estate agent. Often it is necessary to provide a week's rent in advance. That is not credit; that is the reverse. The real estate agents are getting money out of their clients. If the clients are poor, it hurts. So it is not really a credit transaction at all. The ones who are benefiting, the ones who have got the money, are in fact the real estate agents. I do not understand at all why the honourable member raises the plight of real estate agents. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the honourable member, I have had real estate agents come to talk to me. Yes, there have been some who have bleated about it and said that it is terrible and they cannot do it. Others have said, `Look, quite frankly, we have a number of ways of assessing clients and we will be using those. They will not be intrusive; they will not invade people's privacy; but they will rely on our good business judgment. After all, I am assessed by owners on the quality of the tenants I put in, their turnover rate, the return they are getting on their buildings. I have in my wherewithal as a small businessman sufficient judgment, acumen, whatever, not to require to be propped up as I currently am'. I report those remarks quite frankly. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the honourable member for Curtin is saying that in Western Australia there is a lower quality of real estate agent. There certainly is a lower quality of corporate cowboy-or maybe a higher quality. In the electorate of Chifley in New South Wales we have our fair share of poor people. They are great people. The honourable member made the absurd proposition that small business would not now be able to use debt collectors. I have really looked through the speeches and the Bill, and I cannot see why debt collectors are going to be excluded from recovering debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise a concern with the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) about the implication of the Bill because I do believe people need to be protected. I notice that in some areas the Bill shows flexibility and latitude. For example, it allows non-credit providers, people who are not banks or finance companies, to seek a reference, providing they have the written authority of the party, which is exactly the situation outlined by the honourable member for Curtin. It can be done on a voluntary basis, as it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a concern to make sure that people do not abuse this, that they have their rights and that they have full information. I say to our Privacy Commissioner, Mr O'Connor: this is an area that I think you ought to monitor carefully. People will be interested to know how effective it is. They will want to know that people are not being intimidated, whether they be small sublessees or even tenants of real estate agents. Should those unfortunate real estate agents in the honourable member's electorate who have to rely solely on outside information and who cannot apply their skills to the problem of selecting tenants intimidate the tenants and force them to sign voluntary contracts?</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member raised the issue of Telecom. It really made me smile because here again we have customers who are asked to pay rent in advance. They are not asking for credit. They have to pay a connection fee. They have to pay rent in advance. Then they get a quarterly bill. I have been very critical about Telecom's approach to credit management because it arbitrarily, and not on a uniform basis, applies security deposits. The practice varies from district to district. I have described it previously as a tax on the poor. I find it offensive and it is an area which we need to clean up. Here we are saying, `Poor Telecom has been excluded from drawing on privacy information'. I have said to Telecom often enough that this is an act it will have to clean up. Of course, with a second competitor, it will not have any choice about whether it delays cleaning it up. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Opposition members have been very short-sighted in their contributions. Sure, we live in an age where businesses have access to information and like it as quickly as possible, preferably in real time; but we have to protect their clients, their customers and their subcontractors. We must ensure that the information they seek is proper and appropriate and it is not breaching privacy. Why would a piece of legislation dealing with credit reference not allow information only to those organisations like banks and finance companies actually providing credit? I fully support this Bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was responding to some of the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin. In particular, he raised the issue of real estate agents and asked why we had not responded to their need for credit reference information. I think every member on this side of the House would have been contacted by real estate agents. I certainly was. They came to see me and wanted representations made. But the real crux of the issue is what actually happens to individuals seeking to rent a house or a unit. They do not seek credit; they are not extended credit by the real estate agent or the owner. In fact, the real estate agent, acting on behalf of the owners, asks for a bond as a deposit of goodwill to ensure their appropriate conduct. If people go to a real estate agent they have to put some money up; they are not getting credit. Real estate agents often ask for rent in advance. Once again, it is not an issue of the real estate agent or the owner being a provider of credit or money; it is actually the reverse-the tenants put the money up front.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose there is a case to be argued about the rights of tenants to have information about the owners, because tenants are extending credit by way of bonds and rent in advance. The real crunch is that when people actually sit down and work through the issues with the real estate agents, as I have done, they will tell people that when they are making their assessments of tenants they do not have to rely solely-as apparently the real estate agents in the electorate of the honourable member for Curtin do-on the information provided by the Credit Reference Association of Australia Ltd. They are small business men, they are in a very aggressively competitive area and they are able to make realistic judgments about tenants without that information. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no real concerns, and nor should anyone else, from my perspective. It is just a pity that the honourable member for Curtin does not do the decent thing and speak up for the poor and the vulnerable in our community. He should speak frankly to his real estate agents and suggest that if they are giving him problems-but I do not know that they really are-they should use their good business sense and judgment to make those sorts of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to report that in this Bill we are not moving to positive reporting. There is a tendency to want all sorts of information, to pool it and then have to question where and how it will affect individuals. Of course, a positive system of reporting would mean development of a system of reporting comprehensively on a person's credit history regardless of any new loan application or defaults on a payment. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this positive reporting system, as is described in the second reading speech, people who use consumer credit in any form-for example, credit cards or personal loans-would have a monthly statement on their account provided by their relevant credit providers to a central national database operated by a central agency. Credit providers would supply the reporting agency with computer tapes of all their customers' credit accounts. These tapes would have been merged with the central database, usually every 60 days. Credit providers would receive a report listing all known credit accounts, the balance owing on each account and its currency. I am very pleased about that. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I stand here opposed to the amendment pursued-quite fallaciously, I believe-by members of the Opposition, although it is realistic in terms of their real concerns. They are not concerned for the poor; they are concerned for the big money end of the community. I stand for the poor and I stand in support of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is an extension to the original Act, the Privacy Act 1988. In terms of the Act and this amendment, I want to report to the House some problems I have experienced as a member of this Parliament in relation to the application of the Privacy Act. Indeed, I have discussed the matters with the Privacy Commissioner. Unfortunately, some departments were, in my view, restricting members in the conduct of legitimate constituent representations to departments. They took the view that departments ought to have to get their members of parliament to provide written authority before the members or their staff could pursue the matter. I am pleased to report to the House that, following discussions with the Attorney-General, whom, I sincerely thank for his keen interest in and concern about the matter, and with the Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, we were able to overcome these difficulties. I am 90 per cent satisfied with the resolution of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters touch on two important principles. I think we do have a need vigorously to protect people's individual requirements. I know, Mr Speaker, that you and the Clerks of this House take a great interest in the ability of ordinary members of parliament adequately to represent their constituents. I commend you and them for it. But we must fight at all stages to ensure that members are unrestricted in their ability to represent vigorously the concerns that their constituents may have. This is a fundamental principle of our Westminster system and we must always ensure that neither the Executive nor the departments are ever able to encroach on that ability. One of the fine things about our Australian form of democracy is the physical presence of members in electorates via their electorate offices, through the staff they have working for them, and thus the ability of ordinary people to approach their member of parliament about any concern that they have. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not always the case. Although this Parliament may have, and should have, a great concern to protect individuals from any encroachments on privacy, in this case I was legitimately pursuing a concern that was inhibiting my staff and me from adequately pursuing those inquiries. I do not want to dwell overly on it, but people are presented with a difficulty in, for example, migration. Do we really need to get a written authority from the person seeking to sponsor a family member or do we need that in conjunction with a written authority from the person being sponsored? In some countries that may present little difficulty. But in many other countries just using the mail system can be a real problem. Therefore, I found that inhibition to be most abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst my colleagues on both sides of the House have all the natural foibles that can be seen outside in the people whom we represent, I think it is fair to say that it is exceptionally rare for members to fail to diligently and legitimately pursue the interests of their constituents. If any member fails in that regard and in some way abuses his authority for some other motive-the press is always willing to pick it up and rightly bring it to public attention-that member should receive all the condemnation that the public would heap upon him. But it is not my experience that that happens; my experience is that quite the reverse happens, that members of Parliament take the responsibility placed upon them by the public very seriously, as do the members of their staffs. They earnestly and diligently try to get the best result they can for their constituents, and they should not be inhibited by any Act of this Parliament in the pursuit of it. </PARA>
<PARA> It appeared that the Privacy Act was indeed inhibiting. I am pleased to say that that turned out not to be the case. However, I place on record that it is a great temptation for me at some later stage to present an amendment to the Bill which would make the rights of members of Parliament, pursuing the legitimate interests of their constituents, quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish by saying that I do have great confidence in the Privacy Commissioner. This legislation imposes some heavy penalties for any breaches of the Act. I suggest to anyone who is contemplating breaching the Act to desist. I have confidence that the Privacy Commissioner will vigorously exercise his duties if called upon to do so. Of course, it is up to individuals in the first instance to try to resolve their differences before the Privacy Commissioner is brought into play. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that, in pursuing consumer protection in its most recent form, this Government and Parliament-not so much the Parliament as certainly the Minister-established an independent banking ombudsman on the basis that cost recovery should apply. Whilst I support that great initiative, I had an alternative proposal. I ask the Minister: is there going to be any cost recovery from the credit reference area in the activity that the Privacy Commissioner may be involved in? If it is not currently provided for in the legislation, will the Minister, in the light of experience and practice, make an assessment and review the situation at a later date? I think that this Bill will be of great benefit to my constituents in Chifley. It is well and strongly supported on the Government side. It is just a pity that it has been so poorly misrepresented on the Opposition side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Bill 1990 is part of a package dealing with occupational health and safety which has been introduced by the Hawke Government. The first Bill created Worksafe Australia to promote the development and implementation of national occupational health and safety standards in 1985. The second Bill revised the Commonwealth employees compensation and rehabilitation scheme and created Comcare to administer the new scheme in 1988. This third Bill provides for the creation and implementation of occupational health and safety standards for Commonwealth employees. It integrates preventive measures with existing rehabilitation and compensation measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Schematically, Worksafe devises national standards and programs to ensure a safe working environment. This Bill will oblige Comcare to oversee their implementation in relation to Commonwealth employees and Comcare will take care of Commonwealth employees who, in spite of the precautions of the two previous measures, are injured. Let me make it clear at the outset that injury to employees is a matter of grave concern. First, of course, it involves suffering to the employees concerned, who often suffer substantial or long term injuries. That is to be regretted and, if at all possible, avoided. Injury to employees not only causes suffering to the employee himself or herself, however, but also causes suffering to families, who lose an income earner as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> Loss or injury to employees also dislocates the work force. If one of their number suffers an injury, this dislocates the work force and interrupts production. Of course, loss or injury to employees also has an enormous cost to employers. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has estimated that the cost of workers compensation claims in 1989-90 was around $4.8 billion-about 1.3 per cent of non-farm gross domestic product. That is an enormous cost not only to industry but also to the country as a whole in terms of its effect on output and the gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is vitally interested in the prevention of loss and injury to employees. Prevention ought to be the focus of our deliberations when it comes to injuries in the workplace. Prevention is much better than cure. It is much better to prevent an accident before it occurs than to address the question of compensation afterwards. Employers have an interest in preventing accidents. After all, it is their employees that suffer loss. Regardless of what might be said, the reality is that employers and employees in many parts of this country have a very close connection and are interdependent and rely upon each other, and employers have a basic humane approach to avoiding accidents in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> Employees also have an interest in avoiding accidents in the workplace, not only for themselves but also for their families and their fellow employees. All too frequently, where work systems are in place, it is a problem to protect employees against injury when employees themselves ignore or avoid warnings. We need to reinforce not only to employers but also to employees that safety standards are there to be followed, to be observed and to protect them, and it is in their vital interests to ensure that they take notice of safety standards as much as employers. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill directs itself at Commonwealth employees. Commonwealth employees, no less than other employees, have an interest in a safe working system; and the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities and agencies, no less than private employers, have an interest in providing such a system. This Bill applies to Commonwealth employers and is directed towards the laudable aim of ensuring safety for those employed by the Commonwealth, its agencies and business enterprises. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill for that reason. The Opposition believes that the Commonwealth, like any employer, has a responsibility to ensure that its employees work in a safe and secure environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has several parts. The first part is preliminary and the second part relates to occupational health and safety. It sets out the duties of various persons in relation to providing safety in the workplace. Clause 16 provides a duty of employers in relation to their employees. One must bear in mind, when discussing this Bill, that `employer' is defined to mean the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority. When clause 16 provides that an employer must take all reasonably practicable steps to protect the health and safety at work of the employer's employees, it is, of course, directed at the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 essentially provides the current state of the law and what is provided by the common law of tort. Employers have a duty to maintain an environment that is safe and that provides facilities for welfare at work. It also provides:</PARA>
<PARA>(b) in relation to any workplace under the employer's control, to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) ensure the workplace is safe for the employer's employees and without risk to their health; and</PARA>
<PARA>(c) to ensure the safety at work or, and the absence or risks at work to the health of, employees in connection with the use, handling, storage or transport of plant or substances. </PARA>
<PARA>Essentially what that does is set out in statutory form what in fact is the law as developed through the common law courts over a long period. </PARA>
<PARA> As we move down clause 16, however, we see a few frills come into this statute. Clause 16(2)(d) provides that there is a responsibility on employers to develop, in consultation with any involved unions in relation to the employees of the employer, policies relating to occupational health and safety. What that paragraph is laudably directed towards is policies to provide healthy and safe workplaces. We have no objection to that. However, it enshrines and ensures that unions are to play a vital role in that process. This indicates that the Government really cannot help itself when it comes to all manner of things affecting workplaces and employment. It cannot help using every opportunity it can find to ensure the primacy of unions and to make sure that it writes provision for union rights and privileges into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth itself does not have to pass that legislation. The Commonwealth, as an employer, can work with unions in developing particular plans in relation to health and safety. What it attempts to do is, by legislation, bind itself in relation to that or, shall we say, not really bind itself but bind into such a scheme any successor government that may come along after this Government. This is reinforced in subclause (3) where the policy that is developed in consultation with unions must provide for the making of an agreement between the employer and unions with further mechanisms for continuing consultation. Why that has to be spelt out in legislation is rather beyond me. Unions have a proper role in representing employees. There is no reason why that cannot be done without laying it down in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the Government cannot help itself. Every time it sees a piece of legislation it asks the question, `Why cannot we put the word ``union'' into this in some form or fashion?'. The answer probably was, `Well, it will not make much difference in the immediate term, but, yes, you can have it, yes, you can keep the constituency happy and, yes, you can try to ensure that sort of primacy which you like to see in all sorts of legislation'. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 (2) (e) then goes on to require that employees be provided:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in appropriate languages, the information, instruction, training and supervision necessary to enable them to perform their work in a manner that is safe and without risk to their health. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course employees who do not speak English ought to be given information in a language that they can understand to ensure that they work in a safe and healthy environment. I must say, however, that it does not strike me to be the primary responsibility of an employer to give language training. I would have thought that there was an obligation on the person who comes to Australia, maybe not speaking English, to try to learn the language. It is symptomatic of what I consider to be a general approach of this Government that all social obligations, whatever they be, even in relation to language, can be foisted on employers. In this case it is an obligation foisted on the Government because we are taking about the Commonwealth as an employer. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I visited the Nissan Motor Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd factory in Melbourne where 70 nationalities were working on the assembly line producing Nissan motor cars. One of the things that struck me about the very enlightened management-a management that does provide English courses to those working on the assembly line-was that it did make the point that English was the language of Australia. The company expected all the employees to be able to communicate with each other and with management in English. There is a general perception in the community that those who live in Australia ought to make some effort to the learn the English language and that English ought to be the official language of Australia. I hope that we do not depart from that proposition. So clause 16 goes on to set out the duties of employers in relation to health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 sets out the duty of employers in relation to third parties. Clause 18 sets out duties of manufacturers in relation to plant and substances. Essentially, of course, it sets out basically what was the common law position: that a person has a duty of care to his neighbour-a person who is foreseeably affected by his or her actions-and a duty of care that therefore obliges him or her to behave with reasonable care. The law, of course, imposes at common law an obligation on that person if he or she does not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has taken the opportunity of this Bill to stray wider. For example, in clause 18 (2) (c) it gets into the question of product safety standards. This is a general and, I believe, worrying feature of Commonwealth legislation that every opportunity is taken by the Commonwealth when it may be legislating on one thing or another to try to extend the ambit of its powers. Nonetheless, there we have product safety standards effectively introduced in that clause-again a matter of duplication because nearly all the States make provision for product safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 19 goes on to prescribe the duty of suppliers in relation to plant and substances. Clause 20 provides for the duty of person erecting or installing plant in the workplace, and clause 21 provides for the duties of employees in relation to occupational health and safety. That, of course, is very important. As I said before, not only employers have responsibilities in relation to health and safety, but so do the employees. So many accidents are caused by employees. It is in the interests of employees, as much as anybody else, to ensure that they observe high standards in relation to health and safety, not only to protect themselves, but also to protect those with whom they work. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 is where the real action in this Bill begins to take place. This part, which is directed towards workplace arrangements, sets up a complicated and heavy-handed system for providing for working groups and electing representatives. It is a highly structured approach, which is so loved by this Government. It means that health and safety is nailed down and worked through in all sorts of complicated provisions which seem to owe as much to politicking in the workplace as anything else. What it provides is that a request may be made to an employer to enter into consultations to establish designated work groups. If unions are involved, the union can make such a request. The employer must enter into consultations with the unions or the employees. Designated work groups can be varied as a result of compulsory consultations. If there is no agreement about what the designated work group should be, this can be referred to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Within 14 days after completing consultation concerning establishment of work groups, the work groups have to be established. Then there is a provision as to how the designated work groups can be varied and the notice and consultation that must be given. One would have thought that establishing a work group in a place of employment was not a particularly difficult thing, but this Bill provides a full two pages setting out how groups of employees can be formed and a complicated and heavy-handed structure as to how to do it. One would have thought that establishing a work group was not a matter that would take two pages of Commonwealth legislation, but if anything can be done simply, this Government likes to do it the long way around. </PARA>
<PARA> Then after one has established those work groups, one finds how the health and safety representatives are to be elected. If there are unions involved, the legislation makes provision for the person being elected as a health and safety representative to be nominated by the union. Clause 25 (5) states:</PARA>
<PARA>An employee in the designated work group may be a candidate in the election if and only if:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>(b) where an involved union in relation to the group is conducting the election-the employee is nominated by an involved union in relation to the group. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, this is ensuring the primacy that this Government loves to give the unions involved. What would be wrong, for example, with a non-union member who had the support of his fellow employees being elected? But no, proposed section 25(5)(b) states that where a union is involved in conducting the election, it has to be a union member-again taking the opportunity of health and safety legislation to ensure the primacy of unions, to ensure their centrality and to ensure control in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in relation to these elections, if no union is involved the Occupational Health and Safety Commission can authorise a person to conduct a ballot. What we see here is a dual system growing up in the workplace of groups and elections and all sorts of other complicated and heavy-handed procedures. Once one has those health and safety representatives, those persons are given very wide-ranging powers. Under proposed section 28 they are given powers in relation to inspection and under proposed subsection (1) (d) the right to obtain access to any information under the employer's control relating to risks to health and safety of an employee. </PARA>
<PARA> So effectively the employer has to take these health and safety representatives into his or her confidence, and I imagine that one could almost make a career out of being a health and safety representative in the workplace. Under proposed section 29 there is the right to issue provisional improvement notices, and these can specify that there is a contravention of the Act and the action to be taken to fix it up. Then we go on to other powers, probably the most significant of which falls in proposed section 37, which states that where a health and safety representative for a designated work group has reasonable cause to believe there is an immediate threat to health and safety he can inform the supervisor, but if the supervisor cannot be found immediately, he can direct the employee to cease working. </PARA>
<PARA> So the health and safety representative not only has rights of inspection, provisional improvement notices and all the rest but the right to stop work if that should be deemed to be necessary. I would venture to suggest to the House that that is a wide-ranging power that could be used capriciously. No doubt the Government would argue in response that there is provision in the Bill for the disqualification of health and safety representatives where the power is used unreasonably or capriciously or indeed where the power is used with the intention of causing harm to the employer. </PARA>
<PARA> If one were to take the disqualification procedures, the obligation would be on the employer to prove the subjective intention of the employee-a matter which is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove-or to prove that a power was exercised unreasonably, capriciously or otherwise than for the purpose for which the power was conferred. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government is really serious about preventing a particular practice, as for example under proposed section 76, to ensure that employees be not dismissed in prejudicial circumstances, it reverses the onus of proof and says that it is deemed to be in contravention of the Act unless the employer proves he was not motivated by a particular intention. Of course, the Government would not for a moment consider being even-handed and saying that health and safety representatives could be disqualified unless they could prove subjectively within their own province that they were not motivated to act to cause harm to the employer. But it is indicative of the general structure of this Act, and I ask rhetorically whether the Government can point to any circumstance where a health and safety representative has ever been disqualified. I do not believe it could, but if it can I would ask the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) to come in and give us a few case studies of that particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This would not be a problem if there were not occasions where health and safety has been used as a pretext for other industrial demands. I have seen this happen in the work force, unfortunately. It is bad for two reasons: it is bad because it compromises legitimate concerns for health and safety where it is used as a cover for something else; such as where a health and safety representative cries wolf on health and safety and it is established that really it was a bit of a cover. The next time the representative complains about health and safety there is a tendency to disbelieve the representative or not take him or her seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a notorious practice in the building industry where on a building site nearly anything can be characterised as a health and safety issue. I well remember looking at an industrial dispute which occurred on a Melbourne building site where an industrial demand was made and backed up with the threat that if the demand was not given, `We will make this the safest site in Melbourne'. There was no complaint about the site unless the industrial demand was not met. But if the industrial demand was not met, it was clear that all sorts of health and safety breaches were going to be found on that particular site. That illustrates the way in which health and safety can provide a cover for other industrial demands. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, we have in that part of the Act which relates to workplace arrangements and the functions of health and safety representatives a rather complex and cumbersome set of procedures fraught with danger-wide powers capable of being improperly used. But one might observe that if all of those powers are there and all of those powers can be used, one would think there would never ever have to be the generation of industrial action on health and safety. I would not object to all of those wide-ranging powers if the Government would come in here and say, `We are conferring all of those wide-ranging powers-all of those powers to protect health and safety-so that there will never need to be an industrial dispute generated about health and safety other than within the ambit of this Act'. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government would come in here and say, `This is a code for dealing with health and safety; we can guarantee there will never be an industrial dispute about health and safety otherwise than in accordance with this code', all of that might be justified. But what we know is that, regardless of all those provisions, regardless of all those powers, industrial disputes are and still will be generated outside. This will effectively provide one mechanism, but only one mechanism amongst many others. </PARA>
<PARA> A concrete example of this occurred in Victoria recently in relation to the Hoechst dispute. In Victoria there are occupational health and safety laws; there are provisions for health and safety representatives, inspectors and provisional improvement notices. What the Act in Victoria does not say is that if such a person is worried about health and safety he can bring a 60 Minutes crew into the plant, and that is exactly what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Why was there any need to bring a 60 Minutes crew into the plant when he had all these powers? What is the purpose of all these powers if he has to rely on the 60 Minutes crew to get a bit of health and safety? That dispute was generated out of health and safety. Then we had a picket line and massive dislocation down in the petrochemical plant. How good was the health and safety legislation that gave all those wide-ranging powers to prevent unsafe work practices? How good was it? It did not make one iota of difference. The 60 Minutes crew came down, the men went out, the Premier hopped on the picket line, and the petrochemical plant stopped. How good was the health and safety?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government was given the opportunity to come into this place and say to the people in Victoria, `We do not support your strike'. The Government could have come in here and said, `That strike is unnecessary. There are occupational health and safety standards down there in Victoria; activate them'. But the Government chose not to do that. The Government was quite happy to let this dual system go ahead. It was quite happy to leave that particular matter to a province wholly outside the Occupational Health and Safety Act; a wide ranging code that should have been an exhaustive code turned into nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government ought to make clear in this debate, and Government members ought to make clear in this debate, that if this Bill goes through the Government does not expect and would not support any industrial dispute generated outside the provisions of this legislation. If the Government does not do that, it is effectively saying, `We are introducing another system. It may or it may not work, and we really do not care whether it does'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government ought to come in here and say, `We believe all of these powers are justified because they will stop industrial disputes over health and safety occurring otherwise than in accordance with this particular procedure'. If it does not, its bona fides on that issue will be exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> Logically, this Bill should have been introduced when the Commonwealth employees compensation and rehabilitation scheme was reviewed. As a result of the time it has taken, Commonwealth employees are the only category of employees in the Australian work force without a legislative occupational health and safety framework. Various Commonwealth authorities and agencies have had interim measures in place for years, which raises doubts about the need for the Bill at all. Previous Ministers have not felt an urgent need for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is broadly consistent with State legislation already in place which covers not only State Public Service employees but private sector employees as well. But there are three grounds for reservations about the Bill. The first is the Bill's highly structured and regulatory approach, which I have already covered. The second is the cost of the proposals and the third has to do with the nature of the Commonwealth's involvement in health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> I have covered the highly structured and complex regulatory regime. Let me come to the question of costs. The present Bill will not give rise to costs in the private sector. Nevertheless, the initial compliance costs of the Commonwealth departments, agencies and business enterprises concerned are likely to be considerable and much larger than the direct costs cited by the Minister for Finance. The Minister has estimated that the direct costs will be between $1.1m and $1.4m for additional Comcare staff and consultants during the first three years of operation. The Minister has acknowledged that there will be initial compliance costs but said that they cannot be estimated. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Commonwealth's general involvement with occupational health and safety, let me make the point that the States have their own occupational health and safety laws. It is no problem to apply them to the Commonwealth. This is another example of duplication, admittedly only for the Commonwealth's own servants and agents. But what is wrong with applying the State laws? Why do we need another Act with another duplicated set of inspectors to apply in this particular area? The Government keeps talking about diminishing duplication but, at every opportunity it gets, it goes into duplication. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has pledged to remove duplication between State and Federal governments, to save costs and to abolish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission for an estimated saving of around $18m. The functions that are provided by that Commission could well be done by coordinating standards within the Department itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I took the opportunity to have a look at the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission annual report. If one looks, for example, at its achievements for 1989-90, it has produced a few strategies and a national approach; it has established a secretariat; it has had a memorandum of understanding, some study awards, some research grants, a training package, a handbook and a multilingual science poster. This is the way the Government gets into spending money. </PARA>
<PARA> If we have a look down its budget, of course, in relation to $15m of expenditure, $7.6m was on salaries. Then there were travel expenses, postage and consultants' fees. Then there were commissions, committee and working party meetings, library materials and all the rest of it. Talk about an employment scheme! This is a beauty! It is just another Commonwealth Government employment scheme where all of the money that taxpayers are paying is going out to provide jobs for educated people whose job is to look after safety in the workplace. They do it by having conferences, commissions, packages, programs and study grants. Then there are repairs and maintenance to their motor vehicles, and freight and courier services. There are tutors and guest lecturers who get a bit of money. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission also gives out some resource grants. The Australian Council of Trade Unions got only $778,000 from the Commission. The Confederation of Australian Industry got $748,000. The ACTU does not need money from the Government. The CAI does not need money from the Government. They can raise funds like anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be substantial savings to be made. The Opposition will remove that kind of waste, that kind of duplication, and get back to some real, achievable savings in Commonwealth government spending. The Opposition supports the general thrust of the Bill. It has criticisms about the way this thing operates. I therefore move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill and ask the Government to recognise all of those inherent weaknesses in this particular piece of legislation:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give this Bill a second reading, the House notes that the need for uniform national occupational health and safety standards has not been demonstrated; that the States and the Commonwealth are the best placed to determine their own needs; that a future Liberal/National Government would abolish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and resume its functions within the Department.''</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) was, as usual, very disappointing on this subject. The Opposition says that it is concerned about occupational health and safety and one would like to believe that it is. Yet it says that it will severely undermine both the institutions and the codes for achieving safer and healthier working conditions. It neglects to say how it would achieve any improvement. It only criticises; it seems to have nothing positive to say. The interest it claims to have therefore cannot be taken seriously. Like its predecessor, the Fraser Government, the Opposition would apparently neglect occupational health and safety. Under it, occupational accidents and disease would therefore start to rise again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Bill will enhance safety conditions for Commonwealth workers. It covers employees of Commonwealth departments, statutory authorities and government business enterprises (GBEs) in Australia and overseas, although not all provisions will apply overseas. It also covers persons employed by the Commonwealth under a law of the Commonwealth and of a Territory or under a contract of service or apprenticeship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill establishes a statutory framework to ensure the health and safety of Commonwealth government workers. It will provide government employees with the protection of modern occupational health and safety legislation similar to that already enjoyed by both public and private sector employees in most States. </PARA>
<PARA> This is legislation which many people, including me, have been advocating for several years and I am delighted that it is now before the House. Given the Fraser Government's neglect of this area, and given Australia's previous backwardness in the area of occupational health and safety, the introduction of the legislation is particularly welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is part of the Federal Government's high priority national strategy on occupational health and safety which had to be developed to reduce the shocking national human and financial costs of occupational injury and disease. I noticed that the previous speaker acknowledged that this was a serious problem, but he did not articulate any definite approach to handling it. The Hawke Government, in contrast, has acted effectively in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the tripartite-that means business, unions and government, not just unions and government-National Economic Summit Conference participants all urged that this issue be given top priority. The policy was an important plank of the Australian Labor Party-Australian Council of Trade Unions statement of accord, but it has also had the endorsement of business. One of the striking features of the way this whole strategy has worked is that at every point and in every detail there has been close consultation with both business and unions equally as well as with all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government established the tripartite National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to facilitate the development of a uniform approach to occupational health and safety around the country. The development of this Commonwealth legislation for the protection of its own employees is a further element of the Government's strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now an increasing interest in occupational health and safety, and this is very good to see. It is perhaps best exemplified by the proliferation of tertiary courses on the issue. When we came to government it was hard to find a single course on this subject anywhere in Australia at a tertiary institution; now there are quite a number. Another example of the growing interest is that there have been several well researched feature articles in national papers and journals on the topic in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation recognises that responsibility for health and safety issues must be placed with both those parties that directly affect workplace conditions, that is, employers and employees. Based on Robens style legislation of management-employee cooperation, its underlying principle is self-regulation and a recognition that occupational health and safety problems can be avoided only by safer and healthier working conditions and practices. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia the incidence of occupational death, injury and disease in the work force has been extraordinarily high. On average, each week over 3,000 workers experience a compensable work injury resulting in a period off work of one week or more. Recent figures from the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission revealed that every week eight Australians leave home and die on the job or in transit. </PARA>
<PARA> Occupational injury and disease therefore have very high costs. Those costs include not only human misery, pain and suffering, but also enormous financial costs to Australian industry for lost production and retraining and costs to the community for income support, medical attention, rehabilitation, retraining and compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures suggest, as I was glad to note the previous speaker acknowledged, that the cost of workers compensation claims in 1989-90 was $4.8 billion-that is, $4,800m. That represents 1.3 per cent of Australia's non-farm gross domestic product. That does not even take account of indirect costs, such as lost production and retraining. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth expenditure on workers compensation in 1989-90 was $240m. Working time lost in Australia through occupational injury and disease has been estimated at around 10 times that lost through industrial disputes. Therefore, the impact of industrial accidents on Australia's economy is very substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> Humans beings have a need for achievement and must be assisted to fulfil their potential in a safe and secure working environment. Managers must show genuine concern about health and safety at work. But despite its importance, Australia's safety legislation developed in a piecemeal and uncoordinated manner. Often, concerns about profits have outweighed interest in workers' health. </PARA>
<PARA> Aligned with this mentality have been other reinforcing factors. For instance, insurance companies have been reluctant to publish statistics on death or injury at work because as part of big business it simply was not in their interest to do so. Employers might find it difficult to attract employees to workplaces with reputations for dangerous working conditions. Often workers were not concerned about dangerous chemicals or machinery if handling them involved payment of danger money and secure employment. Hazardous working conditions were often considered preferable to no job at all. In fact, not wanting to lose their jobs or be branded as troublemakers, people often concealed injuries. </PARA>
<PARA> The law, too, was often on the side of suppression of this issue. There are many cases documenting judicial decisions which favoured a company sued by an employee, such as a company which had clearly been negligent by placing production continuity ahead of the option of closing a factory for long enough to clean up spilt oil on the factory floor, at the risk of the workers' health. </PARA>
<PARA> Also there has been a genuine lack of knowledge about dangerous chemicals or machines on the part of both employers and employees. Unlike safety hazards, the effects of chemicals have often been slow to manifest themselves, are cumulative, irreversible and complicated by non- occupational factors. The most obvious example of this is asbestos related diseases, which are now coming to light many years after the first exposure of many employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Many workers have had difficulty in proving a correlation between a disease or injury and its place of origin, namely, the workplace. That particular problem has occurred within the Commonwealth's own service in relation to repetition strain injury. Now that we have more information on the correlation between asbestos and lung cancer, we can take preventative measures. That is what this legislation is about: prevention through information and communication. </PARA>
<PARA> Underpinning the culture that developed about the issue of occupational health and safety has been the idea that work accidents were not `real accidents'. The Government has adopted an integrated approach to prevention, compensation and rehabilitation. A progressive compensation and rehabilitation system was introduced under the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and is administered by Comcare. It is designed to minimise the human and financial costs of work related injury and disease, whilst simultaneously providing adequate compensation and support for long term incapacitated employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Prevention must play a pivotal role. All the major industrial disasters of recent times have had small beginnings, often with the common thread of ignorance or an erosion of standards in ensuring compliance with safety regulations. The law can only compensate for what has occurred as a result of an accident in the workplace and award monetary compensation, but money can never fully compensate for the enormous physical and emotional losses. </PARA>
<PARA> Without elaborating fully on the Bill, I would like to highlight some of its features. There is to be a large degree of flexibility. That was not acknowledged by the previous speaker. Where no National Occupational Health and Safety Commission standards or codes exist, the Commonwealth will adopt the existing State or Territory standard, pending review of its appropriateness and applicability to the Commonwealth sector. There will be consultation, as there has been in the preparation of this Bill, with State and Territory authorities in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Except where any provisions are contrary to the Act, the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Bill is not meant to override any of the interim occupational health and safety agreements between the management of individual public sector bodies and relevant unions that were formulated while this legislation was being researched and drafted. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is comprehensive. It emphasises direct involvement by employers and employees in workplace occupational health and safety. Accordingly, it requires Commonwealth employers and employees in each workplace to take greater responsibility for the management of health and safety in that workplace, consistent with the contemporary coregulatory approach already adopted in most Australian States, the Australian Capital Territory and overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides for regulations and codes of practice to be developed to cover specific problems while imposing a duty of care on employers and employees as well as manufacturers and suppliers of plant and substances to take all reasonably practical steps to ensure a safe and healthy work environment. </PARA>
<PARA> It also provides a framework for employers and employees to cooperate and consult in addressing health and safety matters in the workplace through the establishment of designated work groups and health and safety committees. The previous speaker mocked that, but how on earth does he expect effective implementation, even self-regulation, without that kind of consultation? I was astonished by the apparent ignorance of his approach. These attributes are splendid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his comment. Occupational health and safety needs a program of planned and unplanned inspections, personal involvement in safety awards and goals. This integrated safety initiative will have involvement from all quarters of the work force. The key to job safety is developing a mentality of safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the most important aspects of the legislation is the role of the health and safety representative, who has the power to issue a provisional improvement notice requiring management to take corrective action to stop or to avoid a breach of the legislation. The representative, when the supervisor cannot be located, has the power to order cessation of work when there is an immediate threat to health and safety. If the supervisor is located, she or he has the right to decide whether work should cease. While this approach has been adopted in most of the existing occupational health and safety agreements in Commonwealth agencies, it has rarely, if ever, been used. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for an advisory function for Comcare. This is important in assisting employers, employees and contractors with their obligations under the legislation and in dealing with occupational health and safety problems. The first step is the investigation process. The legislation enables Comcare to refer requests for advice to experts outside the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Investigations are to be carried out with a focus on a cooperative approach, but investigators are to have wide ranging powers, including powers of entry and powers to issue prohibition and improvement notices to remove threats to health and safety or to stop or prevent breaches of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also has an appeals mechanism for appeals against investigators' decisions and provides sanctions where a breach of the legislation occurs. For instance, financial penalties can be imposed on GBEs or their employees; that again was neglected by the previous speaker. </PARA>

Employees of such agencies may be subject to disciplinary action under the Public Service Act or other terms and conditions applying to non-Australian public service personnel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is not intended to exclude the application of the criminal law in appropriate cases. Instead, it is intended that the criminal law of the States will apply to Commonwealth employees to the extent that those laws are capable of concurrent operation with this legislation. Financial penalties which this Bill imposes upon GBEs and individuals who contravene the legislation are consistent with the range of penalty levels in similar State legislation and are in line with achieving greater consistency in occupational health and safety legislation, standards and strategies around the country. Surely that is desirable. Again I am astonished by the previous speaker's amendment, which shows that he does not think there is a need for uniform national occupational health and safety standards. I would have thought uniform standards were a great benefit to employers and management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, we must oppose the amendment. It is simply not sensible. In response to another of the previous speaker's comments, it is essential to emphasise that the cost of implementing the proposals included in the Bill will be offset by savings already being achieved by Comcare through the rehabilitation of long term compensation claimants and by a reduction in accidents and in disease at the workplace. The provision of safe and healthy working environments and the increased emphasis on cooperation to achieve such an environment are expected to reduce the incidence of accidents and injuries in which the Commonwealth would be liable. It should result in reduced Commonwealth expenditure, reduced compensation, and reduced associated costs through unnecessary retraining, lost time and sick leave.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Legislation such as this is significant in the milieu it helps create in the workplace. We must have notices about dangers; noise pollution must be taken into account; work stress and powerlessness in large organisations must be offset with genuine consultation and appropriate strategies, and not simply rationalised away as individual difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> With the substantial changes in the nature of working life predicted over the next two or three decades, there will be an increased need for an emphasis on occupational health and safety procedures with a preventative and consultative approach to problem solving, especially in areas using sophisticated technology. There may be need for more consultation between health economists and managements to show employers that occupational health really pays. Design of machinery, psychological considerations, the effects of education and training, influence of age, experience and fatigue must all be taken into account. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The aim of this Bill is to provide safety in the workplace. It is essential that it promotes prevention. Therefore, its passage cannot be opposed. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) claimed the coalition was not in favour of safety in the workplace. I totally dispute this. The honourable member for Fraser also said that the Government had a high priority for this legislation. I ask why it has taken so many years to bring the legislation before this House. Although not opposing the Bill, I want to draw attention to some problems in application, problems in the amount of regulation involved, and at the same time stress that passing the legislation is one thing, but seeing it properly applied in practice is another. This is particularly so with handling injuries-lifting and carrying, and pushing-which are by far the most prolific. Education and training is the key. I am pleased to see this being partially addressed in the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission annual report. Every employer, including the Federal Government, must provide a safe working environment. I cannot imagine employees being subjected to deliberate unsafe conditions, and I dispute the remarks of the member for Fraser.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem then is to realise potential hazards. I repeat that the key is training, for the proprietors, for managers, for safety representatives, for employees. Training or advice can be obtained from independent outside experts. This is ignored in this legislation. The Minister for Finance, in his second reading speech, indicated that this was modern educational health and safety legislation, based on various State legislative measures. Having personally tried to comply with Victoria's legislation, I trust the Victorian administration is not used as a model. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RT4">Mr FORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. We are in real trouble if the Victorian one is used as a model, because it has 250 pages of legislation, thousands of pages of regulations, and I believe this is reflected in the Victorian WorkCare financial situation. The Bill before the House is for a highly structured and highly regulated system for ensuring safety in the Commonwealth workplace. As the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has pointed out, this is far from right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hear frequently in this House the word `deregulation'. I hear from the Minister opposite about deregulation. But where is it? It is certainly not in this Bill. This Bill is about more regulation. It involves the formation of safety committees in enterprises with over 50 employees; it involves the appointment of safety representatives, which is all very worth while. But so is training for these safety representatives-paid for by the employer with the employee actually contributing nothing. To what extent is this person being trained?</PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria, occupational health courses are run by various tertiary colleges and they are three-year courses. Federally, dare we have one person in 50 away on a course for three years? The old State workers compensation schemes had many problems, as the honourable member for Fraser pointed out. However, they did involve experts visiting each enterprise at least twice a year. The insurance companies had a vital financial interest in each enterprise. If there was an accident, they paid-not as the honourable member for Fraser claimed. I believe this is lacking in the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Full training of a person from each enterprise is completely out of the question. Where are all the facilities? The training facilities are not available to cope with the numbers involved. For instance, there are thousands of Commonwealth enterprises throughout the country, and to train one person from each would take years. The application of this Bill could take five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister stressed costs and possible savings. Injury claims nationally involve 1.3 per cent of non-farm gross domestic product. With oncosts, the figure is far higher. We should and must decrease this huge problem. However, the same Minister is happy to apply a 1 per cent training levy on wages. These costs all make the nation less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I mentioned safety representatives as being most worth while. These representatives have wide powers; they have the power to inspect; they have the power to investigate; they can request information; they can request safety breaches to be rectified; they can investigate the process or product, and inspect how it is operating in an establishment. Having done all this, and with all these powers, they are absolved by this Bill from civil liability if, subsequently, something goes wrong. I question this provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The safety representative may be absolved, but look at the penalties for others: $100,000 for a government enterprise; $20,000 for a supplier or installer; $5,000 for an employee of a government enterprise. Yet the safety representative, who may have direct involvement, is absolved. This situation, I suggest, has to be addressed. As I said earlier, the cost of injury to Commonwealth employees was $240m or 1.3 per cent of non-farm GDP in 1989-90. Will adoption of this Bill reduce this huge cost in both money and people? I doubt it. Costs have been rising when so-called modern systems have been operating for three to five years. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission has already instituted many training programs. It has issued resource kits such as Preventing Back Pain in the Workplace, which have been widely praised and accepted, yet injuries still occur. Further training and education in the workplace is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one huge omission from this Bill. There are similar omissions from State occupational safety Acts. That omission is the individual and his or her age and habits outside the working environment. Ageing is a problem with injuries, not only in the workplace. The older we get, the more prone or susceptible we become to injury. Far more attention should be paid to this area-and it is not even mentioned in this Bill. Also, what about the state of a person's individual health: suppose he or she smokes or drinks excessively; suppose that he or she is well overweight or indulges in hazardous activities outside employment. These factors all should receive urgent attention. They affect the employment performance and may be a safety hazard in the workplace. Australia really does require uniform legislation in many fields, of which safety in the workplace is one. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of grave concern that the parliamentary research service indicates that, if challenged, the Federal Government would have to resort to the external treaties power to implement this Bill. I find this very difficult to accept, but it is certainly mentioned in the background papers. This Bill will, however, assess safety in the workplace. It has application errors and it has a number of important omissions. But with all these faults, it should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides penalties for breaches, as I said earlier-$100,000 in the case of a government business in relation to its own employees or a third party, and $20,000 in the case of a manufacturer, supplier or installer. It imposes a general duty of care on employees themselves, and it provides a penalty of $5,000 for a breach by an employee in a government enterprise. The Bill also provides for the creation of conveniently and functionally designated work groups. Just how these are going to work, I do not know. It also provides for health and safety representatives, as I said earlier, to undertake accredited training courses at the employers' expense-that is, at the taxpayers' expense. There would be no expense incurred by any other source. We even subsidise the unions and the Chamber of Automotive Industries, but the taxpayer has to pay for the training. </PARA>

That, as I mentioned earlier, must be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill provides for an employer or an involved union to apply to Comcare for disqualification of a health and safety representative for various reasons. As the honourable member for Higgins pointed out, in the past there have been many reasons for this type of activity. The Bill provides for the creation of health and safety advisory committees comprising of representatives of employers and employees where requested at a workplace of 50 or more employees. The Bill also provides for Comcare to appoint investigators with specified powers and it provides for appeals to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission against an investigator's findings. The Bill also provides for the implementation by WorkCare of codes of practice developed by Worksafe Australia, subject to ministerial approval. That is certainly providing the Minister with open slather to actually remove anything that the regulations should cover. Logically, this Bill should have been introduced when the Commonwealth employees compensation and rehabilitation scheme was reviewed. As the honourable member for Higgins mentioned, Commonwealth employees until now had no complete legislative safety framework. Mr Speaker, this Bill is long overdue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the legislation and I oppose the amendment by the Opposition. The Opposition wants the Commonwealth, which in virtually all its operations transcends State legislation, to be subject to eight different occupational health and safety regulation Acts. That is bad enough. We already have the confusion caused by the different State regulations in many fields-in education, where a child finds it difficult to move from one State to another and cope with a different curriculum with children of the same age; and in road laws, because people turn left in front of someone turning right in one State, and have to wait for the person turning right in another State. Do not let us extend the problems to Commonwealth operations. Do not let us extend the confusion which already exists because of our over-government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The high cost of the proposal of the States would transcend the high cost of the alleged waste that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) was talking about, which I will deal with in a moment. It would certainly be a high cost to try to operate under eight different occupational health and safety rules. Of course, the emphasis put on this by the Opposition is, as usual, that it believes it to be a costly patching up exercise rather than prevention. I feel that we ought to amplify what the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) was talking about when he referred to repetition strain injury (RSI) and just what has happened over many years. I want to look at three or four papers and just see the difference in approach that has been taken to RSI and try to draw out from that what the successful approach has been. In the Medical Journal of Australia, 4 September 1989, volume 151, David S. Bell wrote an article in which he talked about the psychological basis of repetition strain injury. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The psychological basis of ``repetition strain injury'' (``RSI'') is revealed by its rapid rise and fall. The epidemic of ``RSI'' evolved from a similar entity which was recognized and compensated as ``tenosynovitis''. The number of cases of this had been increasing for a decade or more but had not been questioned seriously until ``RSI'' appeared. The rapid growth of the disorder in Australia between 1983 and 1985 earned for it the derogatory term, ``kangaroo paw''. The speed and enormity of its spread in particular groups such as the Australian Public Service seemingly submerged the responsible authorities into total acceptance of a highly improbable condition before they were able to assess it. </PARA>
<PARA> In some Federal Government departments, ``RSI'' manifested equally rapidly in replacement staff members leaving few persons unaffected. Payments to pharmacists fell so far behind that the Federal Government adopted an extraordinary extemporaneous arrangement which, in effect, abandoned most of the fees processing system. In contrast, other offices remained untouched. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same article the writer states:</PARA>
<PARA> The belief that the complaints were a result of an injury, and hence compensable, has been the single indispensable factor which has impelled this epidemic. The influence of compensation is illustrated by the relative absence of the disorder in countries where it is not compensable and by events in West Germany, where the incidence of similar complaints dropped dramatically in parallel with a reduction in the numbers of complainants who were awarded compensation. </PARA>
<PARA>Or was it that there was improved equipment introduced for staff? I believe that that was the case. I know in my office and probably in yours, Mr Deputy Speaker, equipment has improved for staff operations. It is not only the Public Service that was affected. I can recall a constituent coming to see me who had his own computing business. He could no longer operate that business because he had repetitive strain injury. He was successful, he was selling software, working hard, enjoying it and making a lot of money. He developed RSI. Here we have the Medical Journal of Australia claiming that it was all imagination. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some more enlightening articles. Andrew Hopkins of the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University talked about repetition strain injury. He pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the 1970s the number of new cases of `musculoskeletal' disease recorded each year in the NSW workers' compensation statistics showed no particular tendency to increase. But in the five years from 1979 to 1984 it jumped from 980 to 4450 new cases per year, a nearly five-fold increase. We were clearly in the midst of an epidemic, an epidemic which is already showing signs of waning. </PARA>
<PARA>He wrote this in 1989. Further he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>But an epidemic of what? In the first instance, of compensation claims. </PARA>
<PARA>He writes later:</PARA>
<PARA>To take the matter to its logical extreme, could it have been merely an epidemic of malingering?</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to quote what Bammer and Martin have called the standard view of RSI as adopted in a much cited article by Browne and co-workers in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1984. Quoting Bammer and Martin, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> RSIs are . . . musculotendinous injuries of the upper limbs, shoulder girdles, and neck caused by overload of particular muscle groups from repeated use, or by the maintenance of constrained postures, which result in pain, fatigue and a decline in work performance. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he goes on to quote people who claim that RSI is a neurosis. He quotes Lucire who said:</PARA>
<PARA> So the powerless and dependent, and those who cannot otherwise express their righteous rage at the supervisors, employers and spouses, resort to the use of their exquisitely symbolic pain and incapacity as a mode of communication of their distress. </PARA>
<PARA> The same author went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>As long as compensation is paid for functional (i.e. non-organic, non-physical) symptoms as if they were the result of a hypothetical `injury', symptoms are rewarded and reinforced, and the epidemic will continue to spread . . . Control of this epidemic will require a complete withdrawal of the injury theory and its mythology and terminology. </PARA>
<PARA>Andrew Hopkins concludes in his article:</PARA>
<PARA> We see then that the intervention of the social constructionists in the RSI debate has been, in political terms, on the side of insurance interests. This has occurred despite the fact that they quite specifically distinguish themselves from the psychiatric interpretation of RSI on which the insurance interests tend to rely, and despite, in Willis's case, a specific endorsement of the injury theory. This has come about, in part, because of the ease with which the relatively subtle social constructionist position can be misunderstood, and in part because social constructionist thinking . . . slides into a denial of the significance or even existence of injury. I have argued that the social construction approach can nonetheless make a substantial contribution to our understanding of the epidemic of RSI in Australia, in a way which provides no comfort whatsoever for insurance interests. </PARA>
<PARA>I think one can say that there may have been a psychological component but very often this psychological component was due to the fact that people were not accepting the physical base of the disease. Also in 1989 an article was written by Narelle Hooper in the Business Review Weekly on 23 June. She writes in that article:</PARA>
<PARA> I think there was less of that malingering than anyone imagined, says David McIvor, a director of the Melbourne-based Occupational Safety and Health Associates. McIvor, who wrote a book on the issue, rejects further claims that RSI was in the minds of its victims. It is nonsense to say it is 100% psychological, as it is to say it is 100% physical; it may be a bit of both. But the more the physical component is ignored the greater the psychological component will be . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McIvor pointed out that another term for repetitive injury, occupational overuse syndrome, was very often due to equipment. He pointed out that in operator sections of Telecom Australia, where injuries had a strong correlation to rigid job design and use of archaic equipment, the incidence climbed as high as one in four. By 1987 occupational overuse syndrome injuries cost Telecom more than $21m in medical costs, lost time and production. </PARA>
<PARA> David Gosling, then one of the five ergonomists now employed by Telecom, believed that the epidemic was caused partly by the industrial climate and partly by years of neglect in reviewing the welfare of workers. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I think we have succeeded in reducing the incidence. Now we are more experienced and know how to react responsibly and how to overreact. </PARA>
<PARA>There is one more study I want to mention. That was in the editorial research reports of congressional quarterlies in the United States dated 16 February 1990. It points out that repetitive motion is a new job ailment, recognised in the United States in 1990 in this article. In an article in that paper Robert K. Landers records that in the 1980s there was a dramatic increase in the specific kind of job related disability, repetitive motion injuries. </PARA>
<PARA> Employees in a wide range of industries from meat packing to data processing reported suffering debilitating pain and comfort. Some employers find it difficult to accept that their employees' complaints are work related. Most recognise that is it in their best interests to improve work conditions and eliminate factors that contribute to cumulative trauma disorders. Robert Landers pointed out how firms have been able to apply guidelines to combat cumulative trauma disorders. He talks about a management commitment. An employee involvement, work site analysis, hazard prevention and control, medical management and training and education are the very things that the honourable member for Higgins was disparaging. </PARA>
<PARA> It has become obvious in the United States as well as Australia that management needs to redesign jobs in many cases. I believe this legislation is long overdue-I must agree with the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) on that matter-but at least it is coming now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look back again to 1989 to see how News Ltd brought the RSI epidemic under control by taking note of what was happening in Japan, where a gym had been installed in an office and staff members were required to be involved in the gymnasium program, treating not only RSI but also heart disease, stress and obesity. It has become recognised by organisations that we need to have better equipment and better management to cope with RSI. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is necessary because of the huge gap in occupational health and safety coverage for Commonwealth employees. It provides mechanisms to reduce occupational injury and disease that give rise to unacceptable human and economic costs. I say to the honourable member for Higgins that we cannot afford to allow the States to administer the law in this area. If we allowed the States to administer it, it would mean that the Commonwealth, which operates most activities transcending State boundaries, would have to adapt to the laws of eight States and Territories, and the States would be interfering in the employment of Commonwealth officers to, I believe, an intolerable extent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if we had uniform regulations, then that sort of application could be considered, but we do not have completely uniform regulations. The honourable member's suggestions would mean more inefficiency and additional costs for the Commonwealth administration. He referred to leaflets, to teaching migrants English and to training schemes as waste. I am glad to see the honourable member for Dunkley disagreed about training and said the legislation should have more training involved in it. The things the honourable member for Higgins referred to as waste are the things which will prevent the sorts of problems I was talking about and reduce RSI. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member suggested it would cover all the other workers as well. I am suggesting that the current situation is that the States handle this area of safety and health. From time to time, they do not do a bad job. I do not agree that the Commonwealth should take over this role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Occupational Health and Safety Bill that is before us arises from the discussions between the unions, the Australian Labor Party and the Government about occupational health and safety back in 1983 under the guidelines of the accord mark 1. Of course, we are up to the accord mark 6 now, and we are not sure where that will end up. In particular, this Bill seeks to extend the existing arrangements in the private and public sector with a State Government jurisdiction to all Commonwealth government employees. The coalition accepts that occupational health and safety is an issue of increasing national concern. It acknowledges that work related injuries are a cause of death and long term disability in the Australian work force which impacts significantly on the costs borne by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> However, from the outset the Opposition has rejected the view that a national statutory authority is the appropriate body for the protection of health and safety of workers. One only needs to look at the conclusions and recommendations contained in the McKay report in 1988, which criticised the operation of the Occupational Health and Safety Commission, to conclude that the Government's management in this area has been of very limited success. The Opposition, as the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has indicated, supports the Bill with reservations and we have moved an amendment to indicate our position. We have a commitment to abolishing the Health and Safety Commission when we are in government, because of the potential saving of some $19m. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to the report which was tabled recently in Parliament which gives an indication of the sorts of activities that the Commission undertakes. The key element is the $19m expenditure which I have referred to on a number of occasions in this House. The report refers to some background research and some reports into the manual handling operation. Again I refer to the guidelines and stipulations that the Commission put forward to members of the rural industry and members in manufacturing as to how they should handle heavy weights. It got itself into a great amount of trouble because of specific guidelines in relation to how workers should lift weights of a particular type. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an interesting report on back pain which I commend, reports into noise and skin disorders, and one report into farm safety. These are all highly commendable, but let us look at the cost that the Commonwealth has been involved in in producing these reports and keeping the Commission in business. The State instrumentalities could easily undertake these investigations and, of course, the private sector could obviously quite easily do a very good job in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill itself proposes a very highly structured and regulatory approach to the fundamentals of occupational health and safety in the workplace. It imposes a general duty of care on Commonwealth employers to protect the health and safety of Commonwealth employees, manufacturers and suppliers of plant and substances to the Commonwealth employers and installers of plant. It also provides penalties of $100,000 for breaches of the duty of care owed by Government business enterprises to their employees and gives health and safety representatives wide powers of inspection. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the honourable member for Higgins made some comments in relation to these very wide powers as detailed in the Bill. It should be compared, however, to the $5,000 penalty to employees who have failed to take reasonable care in the performance of their work related tasks. So there is some discrepancy between the employer's responsibilities and the workers on the job and the way in which they might protect their own safety and the safety of their fellow workers. Satisfactory health and safety arrangements surely depend on the mutual cooperation and respect for the duty of care owed by both employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Of great concern to the Opposition and to me is the highly structured process the Bill imposes on all Commonwealth departments, agencies and enterprises subject to the Bill and the compliance costs associated with it. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has acknowledged that the direct costs amount to between $1.1m and $1.4m. At a time when Australia moves into a recession, we are adding further costs through the Federal bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> No figures have been forthcoming as to the indirect costs of the compliance procedures. The Minister has rationalised the expense by claiming significant savings from the reductions in accidents, lost work time, and reduced compensation and rehabilitation requirements. I only hope that an Act of parliament will bring about a better state of affairs in terms of health and safety with Commonwealth employees rather than a change of attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition acknowledges that this Bill complements the prior agreements in health and safety and the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and a further level of protection is afforded them by the code of general principles on occupational safety and health in Australian government employment implemented in September 1974 under a variety of industrial awards. The House would be aware that there has been a code of practice in existence that has assisted Government employers to look after their employees in a reasonable and sensible manner. </PARA>
<PARA> This code covers such things as the provision of a safe workplace, a safe working environment, arrangements for consultation between employers and employees on safety matters, provision of personal protective equipment and training in its use, and health and first aid services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the coalition's belief that, far from ensuring higher occupational health standards, the Bill will achieve little by way of significant improvements. All Australians would agree that the health and well-being of everyone in the work force is of fundamental importance. The real issue remains how best to achieve this goal. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in 1985, in my view only action on the shop floor and an understanding between the management and the workers will bring about a change in attitude towards safety and a situation in which long term improvements can be achieved in the workplace. I am sure that, whilst it may sound well-intentioned to some, what we need in Australia is legislation to encourage by positive incentives the development of a properly planned accident control-occupational program. Negative enforcement such as this Bill proposes will never work in a society such as ours. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw the House's attention to some proceedings that were held at the Australian National University in 1981 and a paper produced by Mr Saunders in his discussions about the United States of America Occupational Health and Safety Act which he considered to be a failure in that country. He said that to introduce a similar Act in this country would be `an absolute disaster'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that whilst it may sound very attractive to some, the reality of our situation demands the framing of legislation to encourage by positive incentives the development of properly planned accident control/occupational health programmes. Negative enforcement has never really worked in a society such as ours, and probably never will. Yet legislators tend to persist with this type of Act. A most notable example among many is the total failure of negative motivation to reduce murder and violence in the community over a consistently long period. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view, whilst the occupational health and safety issue is one which should not be ignored, we should be aiming to provide guidelines and encouragement for organisations to develop their own occupational health and safety programs specific to their particular needs. This has been achieved with particular success in America, where the Bechtel corporation, the largest construction company in the world, got together with the unions and, with the approval of government, organised its own approach to accident control. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason why, with the cooperation of unions, participation of employees and the resources of management, such programs could not be equally successful in Australia. I am strongly of the view that many accidents in the workplace result not from the purposeful negligence of employers but from behavioural problems often associated with outdated work practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of the House the interesting example of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme back in 1947. I understand the manager of the project was very safety conscious. He insisted that drivers of any vehicles strap their seat belts on at all times. I understand that the accident rate from persons driving vehicles in that project was very low at that time, when safety belts were not normally in use in Australia. I also understand that, because of the attitude of senior management, the accident rate was kept to a minimum on that project, where people were working in very difficult conditions, in very dangerous areas, including tunnelling through the mountains-an occupation which tends to have a fairly high accident rate just by the nature of the work. That is again an example of a change in attitude by management in encouraging its work force to adopt safe practices. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw attention to the more recent problem of the politicisation of health and safety issues by overzealous union officials on building and construction sites throughout Australia, which has led to increased scepticism of the validity of many of the safety and health issues complained about by employees. Again, the honourable member for Higgins drew the attention of the House to matters that had come to his attention in dealing with industrial matters. Health and safety issues on construction sites in particular are fast becoming the basis for wage increases rather than any genuine concern for the health and safety of workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Unions in the building industry are well known for their extremist attitudes towards health and safety issues when negotiating work conditions. It is estimated that 50 per cent of disputes with unions are now negotiated on extremely spurious health and safety issues. The Australian Bureau of Statistics in August 1990 revealed that disputes involving physical working conditions, safety issues, first aid services, protective equipment, conditions of amenities and arduous physical tasks are the second most often used reasons by unions for strike activity and the third highest in terms of working days lost. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria it is apparent that health and safety issues are a major catalyst in creating legitimacy for industrial disputes. Of particular concern is the general attitude of many in the work force to the concept of work related compensation. We have already seen in Victoria over recent years the massive blow-out of the WorkCare scheme, with $5 billion in accumulated liabilities to the end of 1989, as rorts in the system had enabled those with questionable injuries to receive compensation handouts. Even in that State the Labor administration has made adjustments to the WorkCare scheme to ensure that the payouts came back to reasonable proportions to look after those genuinely injured workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Based on the Australian national account figures, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has estimated the cost of Commonwealth workers compensation claims in 1989-90 to be $4.8 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 1985-86. The annual cost of workplace deaths and injuries, including compensation, lost production, retraining and welfare, is much higher and has been estimated to be in the region of $9.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I put forward the suggestion that it is important to provide incentives for better safety in the workplace. The important aspect is a change in attitude by management and, along with this, a change in attitude by workers. The important thing is that there is an attitude of providing for safety in the workplace by both the management and the workers, that it is a high priority for everyone involved and that it is a day to day activity where everyone is concerned, especially in some of the repetitive tasks and in some industries which have an element of danger, where management and the work force are fully aware during the eight hours of work that the possibility of injury is always present and that every effort should be taken to make sure it does not happen.</PARA>
<PARA> I notice in some of the more progressive manufacturing industries boards indicating how long the plant has operated without any injury. Workers are encouraged to use protective eye covering, they are encouraged to utilise their protective clothing and to take evasive action in the case of any particular industry, particularly in the chemical industry and in the mining and agricultural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in closing that in the annual report the compensated occupational incidence of injuries received gives an interesting comparison of industries which are more difficult and more dangerous to work in. The incident rate is shown per 1,000 workers, in order of those that are more dangerous. The first is mining-and I think all members of the House would be aware that the mining industry, because of its very nature, is a fairly dangerous and difficult industry to work in. That is followed by the construction industry; and equal third and fourth are manufacturing, agriculture, forestry and fishing. My background is in the area of agriculture and I can attest to the difficulties in that area. Likewise, in the forestry industry, which is represented in my electorate of Corangamite, the possibility of quite substantial injury is always present. The fifth most dangerous area is transport, followed by electricity, gas and water. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that attitude is the major factor in terms of health and safety improvements and that the important feature in relation to industrial relations is making sure that health and safety issues are looked at in their own right rather than for their merit in providing the basis for an industrial dispute. I make the point that under the current arrangements the States have the main responsibilities for organising health and safety issues, and they should maintain these responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Higgins. We will disband the Commission; we will encourage the States and the private sector to develop practices in the health and safety area; we will discourage unions and workers from using these provisions for industrial uses; and we will encourage management and workers to provide better workplaces so that the incidence of injuries in the Australian workplace can be reduced over the next 20 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Previous speakers in the debate have detailed that the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Bill, which we are debating this evening, is not a five-minute wonder but resulted from a series of negotiations and discussions from 1983 onwards. Whilst the previous speaker, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), assiduously referred to the involvement of the unions, the Australian Labor Party and the Government, that was rather selective because, as he well knows, other participants in these discussions have been the employers of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As other speakers have detailed, it is very much a tripartite development in Australian industrial relations. There are employer groups that are keen to do something about the health and safety of workers in this country. The legislation being discussed tonight provides for a general duty of care and specific obligations relating to the health and safety of Commonwealth employees. The legislation comes about after discussions and a series of related pieces of legislation. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act 1985 provided a focus for the development of set uniform standards and strategies for reducing accidents. Of course, two years ago, there was the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. Quite clearly, those measures are interrelated and go in a direction which some speakers opposite have said they nominally favour. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, we have had the activity of Worksafe Australia in coordinating standards, assisting in training and giving grants to a variety of organisations that are doing significant work to categorise accidents and analyse chemicals that are harmful in Australian society, and put out papers. Grants were given to Lidcombe Workers Health Centre, which is in my own electorate, and also to Newcastle, Wollongong, et cetera. Also, various trades and labour councils and Australian Council of Trade Union officers have been employed in related programs around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that is discussed very much in Australian politics at the moment is the decline of the Victorian Government and the very large number of seats that the Australian Labor Party lost in Victoria at the last Federal election. There is a silver lining in all of these things. It is quite fortunate that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) have been elected to this House, because clearly they have been able to delineate the real policies of the Opposition. We have the up-front stuff about how everyone has to work together and everyone's mutual interest, increasing productivity and everybody will be very happy with wage increases resulting therefrom. But those particular gentlemen, two of whom have participated in this debate, have come out with the fundamental realities of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We all recall the contribution in earlier debates of the honourable member for Dunkley-he has spoken very recently in this debate-when he said that he had fought within the Metal Trades Industry Association Inc. (MTIA) against its soft line, that he was one of the courageous members of the Association who would not go along with all these deals that it was always working out with the trade union movement. I think that has been put in some perspective by the activities of the MTIA in recent weeks. It has not exactly been the soft pushover for the Australian trade union movement. That is the kind of position we have from him. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst other speakers have said that there is too much legislation, too much regulation and that it is too structured, the honourable member for Dunkley went on to demolish the contention of the honourable member for Higgins that the Hoechst dispute in Victoria should have been totally covered by this exhaustive legislation. The honourable member for Dunkley said that, after all the pages and pages of legislation, the Victorian legislation just was not adequate enough and that after all the paperwork it just did not cover the whole field. Yet the honourable member for Higgins said that Hoechst should have been sorted out in those disputes and that the recourse to industrial negotiations was totally improper. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, whilst there were nice throwaway lines from the honourable member for Dunkley about more training, he also went on to decry leaflets. He said that really throwing leaflets all around the place had no impact and that people still had back injuries. I think the bottom line was that doing that was a waste of time. He had grave doubts, rather amazingly, that this legislation would have any impact whatsoever on the $240m that he said was paid out as a result of injuries in the Commonwealth sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Higgins had a number of lines of attack on this legislation. He certainly undermined the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), who is sitting at the table. The honourable member for Dundas is doing so much for the Liberal Party out there in the migrant community, telling them how badly done by they are and that we should liberalise them and allow them greater access to Australia. The honourable member for Higgins said that Nissan was a very liberal and commendable employer in supplying foreign languages in its factory, but then he thought he would have a little sideswipe and appeal to a certain section of Australian society by saying that everyone out there should learn English and that everyone should put in the effort to go to night school and learn English. As I say, his contribution slightly undermined the efforts in the ethnic electorate for the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be the way that industrial relations are considered in an arbitration commission, but when one is actually out there at places like James Hardie, which relies for its labour on the latest ethnic group coming into the country in which virtually no-one speaks English-and Australia does not require them to in the first place-it is a little unrealistic to say that these guys, who are working in the asbestos industry and fields like that, in pretty arduous and quite often unsafe conditions, should all know English. That was the first focus of the honourable member for Higgins. He somehow lamented the fact that the legislation provided for people to have signs around the factory in other languages. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Higgins made a few snide references to designated work groups, notices and that groups had to be established, complaining that the situation was too structured. Quite frankly, out in the real world, I think that factories have to be very structured. The fact of life is that people do get injured in factories-they have been getting injured for decades-and it is a continuing problem. The problem has not been sorted out by the laissez-faire attitude of the Opposition, or by the ideas of company management in plants. The fact of life is that the Government has to try to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to clause 28, the honourable member for Higgins deplored the fact that the health and safety representative in a factory would get access to any information. He failed to cite subclause 6 which makes a number of exemptions to that right of access to information. As I say, the honourable member for Higgins, in a very selective and misleading way, attempted to say that there was just an open slather and that there were no restrictions on the right of access to information. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Higgins then made reference to the building industry, which was also referred to by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). The honourable member for Higgins said that it was particularly notorious in the building industry that health and safety issues were utilised for other industrial purposes. That is all very nice. One would think that all these people who are injured in the building industry are actually committing suicide or falling off buildings, just to give it the image of being an unsafe industry. The honourable member for Corangamite, towards the end of his speech, also made reference to this point. </PARA>
<PARA> A major national work related fatalities survey, carried out between 1982 to 1984, found that just under 200 people died within two years from working in this industry. That 200 people died in an area that, supposedly, notoriously misuses health and safety regulations is quite significant, to my way of thinking. Of course, we occasionally have the front page lamentations of the State Ministers in New South Wales who get a bit upset that a number of people were killed at Darling Harbour, but then next week they walk away from it or pretend that the unions in this field are not really serious about the dangers in the industry. The Government put out a new safety package, a kit, in June 1990 to explain the dangers to workers in the industry. The honourable member for Higgins might be very worried about the fact that it was actually put out in foreign languages as well. Those who have some knowledge of the industry are aware of the heavy number of ethnic workers in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the support of the honourable member for Higgins for this legislation, he managed to find a fair number of spurious reasons to denigrate it by saying, `You can trust us to support you on industrial health and safety because we are realists. We know that it is in the self interests of employers to do something about this because it saves money.'</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Higgins said that he did not like foreign language notices. He thought the legislation was too structured and that it was attempting to cover the field too widely. The honourable member implied that it provided supposedly open slather for health and safety workers, that they would get all the information that was available and then run off and give it to some company down the road. He raised the question of the misuse of this field for industrial stoppages for other purposes. All those reasons show us where the Opposition really stands. The issue concerns not just this amendment about State rights; the reality is that deep down the Opposition would like to do nothing about this matter. It would like it to give a completely free ride to employers in industry. </PARA>

There was also the complaint by the honourable member for Higgins about the onus of proof in dismissing work safety representatives. In fact, it might amaze the honourable member, but the union movement might not like that provision either because it would have some concern with the fact that people elected by union members in a factory are not ultimately responsible to those members. That implies that they cannot be trusted to comply with the Act and throw out a person who misused his power and used these rights to destroy the factory, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In contrast to the attitude of the Opposition, the Government's practice has been to get consensus in this very important field. Again, in the last week or so, we saw another example of the sorts of fears that the Opposition must have when the latest statistics on the reduction in work time lost by industrial disputes are produced. I will not bother citing those figures because they might be said to be selective and out of context. I would rather refer to the figures between July 1989 and May this year. Despite a big increase in industrial disputes in that time, the Government could still make a fairly encouraging comparison between its performance and that of the Fraser Government. After the worst increase per month for nearly a year, the Government could still boast a position where the average number of working days lost per month had fallen by 54 per cent from 250,000-odd under the previous Government to 114,600. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at work days lost per thousand employees, we see a similar measure of the success of the Government in actually going out there and discussing these matters and attempting to get some kind of agreement on the fundamental requirements of this country. Rather than indulging in all that fantasy island stuff-talking about how everyone should be good mates, slap each other on the back and produce more, as the honourable member for La Trobe constantly contends-this legislation reflects an attempt to get cooperation in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> The submission of the Opposition and the main amendment it has put forward talks about the State situation and how the legislation should effectively cover the field. With a number of honourable members opposite, I had the benefit last weekend of inspecting the future direction of the Australian Taxation Office and its efforts in the area of computerisation. It really drove home-or it should have done so; even to those honourable members opposite-the reality that Federal departments are going down functional lines. What happens in those departments is more relevant to what happens in offices of the same department in Sydney and Parramatta than to what happens to some worker down the street in South Granville. </PARA>
<PARA> Since objections were raised by the State governments, the Government has taken a number of measures to reduce the complaints. Amongst those, of course, was a tighter description of `workplace' so that, for instance, the egress and entry for Commonwealth department workers in a private sector building block would not be covered by these Federal measures. The Government has allowed the involvement of State inspectorates. It has said that, in areas where there are no national standards applicable, then State measures will have the right to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> In reality there has been an attempt by the Government to reduce the objections of various States. Quite frankly, from the unions' point of view, some of the more hardline groups might say that we should have these State prescriptions such as in South Australia and Victoria, which have been alluded to on the other side of the chamber, where there is a greater right for delegates to close down plants. There have been some complaints, of course, about the rights of delegates, in the absence of supervisors, to close down unsafe practices under this legislation. Some of the people advocating the applicability of State provisions might consider the more hardline provisions that currently apply in a number of States. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this legislation represents the culmination of a series of consultations. It has involved a previous series of codes and a previous variety of prescriptions. It does seek to bring to government employees in the Federal arena provisions that apply to employees in the private sector. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The introduction of Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Bill 1990 in this place raises a number of questions. It raises the questions of the rights of workers, the rights of trade union bureaucrats, such as the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and his brother and the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean). The Bill raises the question of the appropriate authority to administer any regulation and the position that it might hold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Paramount in all of this is the rights of the worker. Of course, we have not heard too much said about the rights of the worker tonight; this is legislation in support of the rights of the bureaucrat, primarily the trade union bureaucrat such as the Minister for Science and Technology was until recently. He called himself a trade unionist. I have worked with trade unionists and I know what they are like-they quite frequently wear blue singlets and black shorts. They know how to drive a truck, like I do, how to work in a shearing team and how to pick up a shovel. They are trade unionists.</PARA>
<PARA> Then there are trade union bureaucrats. They are often overweight with frizzy hair. They are all sorts of things but they do not know about work and work practices. But trade union bureaucrats have worked very hard in Australia to build themselves a constituency, to support a political party to the point where they are able to occupy government benches in rotation with the conservative parties. During their period of occupancy, they ensure that they entrench the rights and the privileges of the trade union bureaucrats at every opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Very closely associated with them is the Government bureaucracy. One cannot have this sort of legislation and these penalties without inspectors. It is a funny thing about inspectors-there are some quite capable inspectors employed by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Tomorrow morning all of us will fly off in aeroplanes. We will do that with some confidence in the Australian aeronautical system. Every one of the planes will be certified by a worker, not by a bureaucrat-that is a myth we create. All the licensed aircraft maintenance engineers who operate in the major airlines do not work for the Government, they work for the company. Of course they value their licence, their qualifications and their credentials and they see that they get us where we are going. </PARA>
<PARA> To be quite honest, when it comes to my personal safety, I would rather put my faith in those licensed aircraft maintenance engineers than in a trade union bureaucrat. But then comes the question of who is most appropriate. If one believes in this sort of legislation then one believes the answer is more laws. The second reading speech is very deficient in telling us where the financial savings are. It is also deficient in telling us how many lives we are going to save. </PARA>
<PARA> We know the Government is going to fine certain people $100,000, but the evidence of this rash of occupational safety legislation does not support the fact that it saves lives or reduces injury. This type of legislation is not new. Over the years I have been involved in the building, road transport and hotel industries and many other industries. There has always been an inspector; someone to tell me the sorts of things I should do to guarantee the safety of my work force. So there is nothing new about it. It is just expanding the role of the bureaucrat and opening up an opportunity for the trade union bureaucrat. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is going to pay for that? We live with this myth that somehow or other employers will pay for it. In regard to this legislation we will live with the myth that the Government is going to pay for it. The Government has never paid for anything in its life. It is the very workers whom the Government proposes to protect who will pay for it. I hope the Government does protect them. I hope they get value for money but if they do not this legislation is a waste of time. We are here to protect the workers but the Government does not give me any evidence in the second reading speech of how that is going to happen. The Government gives me no evidence of why the taxes of those workers must rise so they are safer because somehow or other the uniformity of Commonwealth legislation is going to make them safer than the lack of uniformity of State or local government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know why it is impractical for a Commonwealth employee to be subject to the safety requirements of the Victorian State Government. If there is some difference in those particular laws from those of the Government of Western Australia, I do not know why anybody will be that much worse off. We are just putting another layer of bureaucracy, another layer of government, on top of that which already exists, and which has existed for decades. Nobody comes up with the statistics to show how this has progressively improved anything. </PARA>
<PARA> One would think that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Reid, with his long association with the trade union movement, would not have bothered to try to pick-with, if I might say so, a lack of skill. I do not know how much he was paid when he was in the trade union movement but I would have thought I would have been losing on my membership. But let us put it straight: why did the honourable member for Reid not spend his time laying out the evidence? He told us that 200 get killed. Why did he not tell us how many it saved, because that is important to me. The honourable member for Reid should not shake his head. He should have given the House that information. He should have told me, but he has yet to convince me that this is a worthwhile exercise. He might have told me how many lives the legislation was going to save and not how many died. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the honourable member about a big killer in Australia: it is called the motor car. Each year 3,000 people are killed in motor car accidents in Australia and 30,000 are injured. By comparison where should we spend our money? Whether we like it or not, we just do not have enough to keep everybody alive or everybody safe from injury. It might be a question of where the Government would better spend the money, but that is not what this legislation is about. It is about increasing the power base of trade union bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) said there are big problems-there are so many safety related issues in the building industry. I read about them in the newspaper, but do honourable members know what amazes me? All those problems are settled with money. It appears that things can be made safer by paying more dough. The honourable member for Reid knows it happens-he probably negotiated one of those deals. If he did not, the Minister for Science and Technology certainly has. The honourable member believes that as long as one gets a bit more money, we are suddenly safe. What a load of rubbish! Either a site is safe or it is unsafe. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently a fellow in my electorate rang me about a big government project. No doubt this legislation will apply shortly. He said, `They are driving me mad. The other day the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) rang me up and said they were coming onto my site'. He said, `We do not really want you'. And there are not really many honourable members in this Parliament who want them either. The BLF said, `If you do not get all your people to join, we are going to pull a safety issue on you'. This bloke was ringing him from Perth, 300 miles away, saying, `We are going to pull a safety issue on you', and the honourable member for Reid tells me the system is not abused. This bloke from Perth would not know whether a site was safe or not, nor little would he care because he had not been up from Perth to look at the site. He had not worried about the workers but he wanted to make sure he collected a membership from every one of them when he got there, and that is what he did. How many times has Mr Trade Union Bureaucrat-the honourable member for Reid-done that? It happens every day. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the Minister has not done it; I see he is studiously ignoring the debate. But that is what it is about; it is not about saving the lives of workers. Health and safety legislation is in place and it is almost to the point of being draconian in most States. The situation has got silly, and that is the best word to describe it. Who pays for it? The very bloke who walks around the site in his free boots thinking he is in front of the boss. Whether the boss is the government, as this legislation covers, or whether it is a private employer, what does he do with the cost? He loads it right back on the taxpayer or the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government thinks it can beat that system, it should tell me how. It is worse than that because every time the Government rushes out there and gets workers a pay increase, this Parliament takes half but the cost of living goes up 1.25 per cent. The Government has been telling them what a good job they do and they have to pay, they have to have compulsory unionism so they can pay for the services of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting this duplication. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) needed a bit of attention-he wanted to get people's minds off the economy. So he got the Premiers, mostly his mates, up to Brisbane and they all talked about doing something about the lack of duplication. I do not know who is best equipped to run occupational health and safety but I should have thought the bloke who was closest to the job, in government terms, would have been best equipped. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure that a centralist government should have the role of running around checking on whether someone has the right planks in the scaffolding. I am not really sure that that is our responsibility. But we are going to double up on it; all the States have it, and we are going to have a bit more of it because we employ a lot of people. What is the purpose of that? How many inspectors does the Government want?</PARA>
<PARA> I know the Government has an unemployment problem. We will have an inspector-led recovery, but the truth is, the Government does not need them. The inspectors have been there for decades, and when the Government can prove to me that its recent trade union innovations at State level have clearly reduced the number of accidents and deaths, then I will say the Government is getting somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the other side of it, and the Government has been on about it here for two days, is that the Western Australia Liberal Party is paranoid about Federal Government involvement. I have a letter here: the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) has written to the Premier of Western Australia suggesting that he can use Section 51 (15) of the Constitution-the weights and measures proposal-to impose daylight saving on Western Australia. And the Government wonders why it is not trusted. What a dopey thing to do. The Government wants to take weights and measures-a proper responsibility of central Government-and convert that responsibility to daylight saving. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be interesting to look at the paranoia that occurs. There is always an issue. We are always generating new bureaucratic processes. We have domestic violence bureaucrats now who are selling us the idea that there is domestic violence in one in three families. Of course, women said that those being bashed were all women. Of course, the statistics do not even support that. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some interesting statistics from the United States. In relative statistical terms, the message would be just as clear here. They relate to some of the remarks that have been made here tonight, particularly with regard to asbestos. Clean air is a problem on a work site, is it not? Clean air is a problem anyway. In America they have got to the point of being so paranoid about clean air that this year they are going to spend a huge amount of money on it. It is estimated-the figure is questionable; it is the high point-that by that clean air legislation they will save an additional 2,700 American lives at $16m a life. We can say that a life is immeasurable in cost, but this year alcoholism and drug abuse will kill 380,000 Americans, yet they spend practically nothing on preventing those deaths. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we doing here? How best do we look after workers? Do we employ a few more trade union bureaucrats or do we look at the areas where people are dying? It is interesting that the United States Environmental Protection Agency wants emission risks to be reduced to one per million. The equivalent risk for Americans is to drive a car 40 miles, fly 2,500 miles in a commercial jet or canoe for six minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> In America diet is responsible for 178,000 cancer deaths per annum. The United States Government spends $280 per death on nutrition research. Nutritional problems are the biggest killer of people. Honourable members might be interested to know that cancer deaths in laboratory rats fed a potent carcinogen can be reduced from 90 per cent to 3 per cent just by reducing their calorific intake by 20 per cent. It is not the carcinogen that kills them; they are being fed to death. The same is happening with human beings. We are debating duplicate legislation when maybe we should be looking a little more at the worker's diet. </PARA>
<PARA> Asbestos is another matter. The other day an oil rig, I think on the North West Shelf, was closed down because somebody had the temerity to produce an asbestos gasket. If one knows anything, one knows what a gasket does. It is squeezed between two pieces of steel or brass. There is a tiny edge sticking out. About 500 blokes went on strike. If they had sniffed it for a week they still would not have got mesothelioma. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing is that, again in America, a program costing Americans a fortune will result in asbestos being removed from 733,000 buildings for the sorts of reasons that this Government would promote under its occupational health and safety program. This will cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and it has now been discovered that there is more risk in removing asbestos than in leaving it there. This is a very well established principle which is not contested. The program is based on a forecast that 67,000 Americans will die from airborne asbestos, but so far only 1,500 cases per annum of mesothelioma have been reported. Male asbestos mine workers over 65 comprise 80 per cent of the cases, many of whom were also heavy smokers. </PARA>
<PARA> The yanks have a radon bureaucracy now. People put radon measuring instruments into houses. It is said that 20,000 Americans will be killed this year by radon, but the claim is extrapolated from studies of occupational exposures of 375 uranium mine workers who were exposed to radon levels 12,000 times the level found in a typical US home. Iowa has the highest level of radon exposure and one of the lowest levels of cancer. </PARA>
<PARA> I will support the Government's legislation when it can show me that it is benefiting the worker-not the inspector; the worker-and that the money then spent is going to save more lives than might be saved by reducing cancer deaths through better nutritional research and better attitudinal development.</PARA>
<PARA> I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety, which looked at the licensing of drivers. I had a lot of preconceived ideas which are reflected in other people's thoughts today. When I had finished my work on that Committee, I had learnt that only changing people's attitudes would save lives. Everything else has been tried around the world-longer licence training and all sorts of things. In America a very big study was carried out. One group was taught by their families; one was taught by a driving school; one was taught at school; and one was given extra training. They followed the history of group members for about five years. The group that had the worst crash rate was the one that had had the advanced driver training. All of the other groups were about the same. </PARA>
<PARA> The only thing that will reduce our death toll on the roads and in our workplace is attitude-people taking care. This will not be done by having inspectors and fines. It will not be done by having two occupational safety levels at two levels of government. As State governments happen to be a little closer to the workplace, I think that they can do the job quite well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been much talk in recent years of the need for tourist resorts and facilities to be more environmentally friendly. This has culminated in the recent publication by the Australian Tourist Industry Association of environmental guidelines for developers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my electorate of Fairfax, a major family resort was opened on 30 November-that is, last Friday-which is an object lesson for ecologically sustainable development. It sets standards for resort developments throughout Australia, and I urge the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), to make an early visit. The development is also a culmination of nine years of local controversy over environmental factors which has been resolved to the benefit of all parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The development I speak of is the Twin Waters Resort. It is located on the Sunshine Coast where the Maroochy River meets the Pacific Ocean and offers 1.5 kilometres of both surf beach and river frontages. In addition to the attractions of the beach and the river, the resort has also constructed a six-hectare salt water lagoon, thus providing for other forms of water sport. </PARA>
<PARA> The resort buildings occupy 20 hectares of the site of a total area of 267 hectares, all of which, with the exclusion of the resort and an 18-hole championship golf course, is untouched bushland. On day one of the development, all key trees on the site were marked and retained. Indeed, the natural flora includes many examples of threatened species for which a specific program of care and propagation has been implemented. All mangroves on the site which are now known to be ecologically very important have been retained. </PARA>
<PARA> Substantial restoration work has been undertaken on the dunes fronting the beach and the river; they have been regenerated and provided with natural growth supplemented with 1,100 plantings of appropriate species supplied by the State Government's Beach Protection Authority. No building is more than two storeys in height and all buildings are therefore below the line of the surrounding trees. The resort is visually unobtrusive. Twin Waters resort is an object lesson in creating harmony with the environment and epitomises the benefits that can result from seeking and achieving compatibility with the surroundings. </PARA>
<PARA> Kangaroos, wallabies and other fauna come right up to the hotel, and guests can see and enjoy the environment in its natural state, augmented only by plantings of selected flora from Brisbane's Expo site, including also the thousand-year-old forked blackboy, which is a feature of the resort. Because of its sensitivity to the environment, I am confident the Twin Waters resort will have lasting appeal not only to Australians but also to overseas visitors to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a development of which locals are proud. Twin Waters is a resort which maximises the natural attractions and beauties of the existing local flora and fauna. It does not seek to change the character of the local area. The opening of the resort was a local community event, allowing locals to attend, participate, and share in the occasion. The opening was conducted not by a State or Federal Minister, as is usually the case, or any other political figure, but by a local achiever from my electorate, Lisa Currie. Future local participation is not only encouraged but is integral to the future success of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, this development has occurred in Fairfax at a time when recession-induced unemployment in the region has increased by 33 per cent in the past 12 months. As many as 260 permanent jobs have been created for local young Australians through Twin Waters. Over 1,000 people were interviewed for these jobs. Tourism is our largest export earner. Developments such as Twin Waters offer a real hope in times when we need to earn export income. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about the wool industry, which is without a doubt the greatest decentralised industry in Australia. In my view, it is absolutely essential that this industry is maintained. I have been looking at some average prices of greasy wool since the beginning of the century. These prices are expressed in 1989 dollars, constant 1989 dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the depths of the Depression, from 1929 to 1933, the average price of wool was 452.63c per kilogram. In the years from 1983 to 1987 it was 452.47c per kilogram, which is very comparable. In 1960 to 1970-these were the years after the effects of the war-it was at 688.69c per kilogram. In 1970 to 1980 it was 543.16c per kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> Over longer periods, from 1908 to 1939, from virtually the beginning of documentation until the Second World War, the average price was 574c per kilogram. The war years and the war influence would have been from 1939 to 1960. In that time the average price was 998c per kilogram. From 1960 to 1989 it was 583c per kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> When one extrapolates these figures, one sees that in recent times wool has been relatively cheap. The prices that have been recorded do not give any reason or indication for the dropping off in the use of wool. It is the percentage of the fibre market held by wool that is of most concern to me. In 1939, wool held 15 per cent; in 1960, it was 10 per cent; in 1988, it was 4.9 per cent; and it looks as though in January 1991 it will be 2.3 per cent. This is the very worrying situation indeed, as in the long run it is the percentage of the fibre market which is going to determine whether we have a viable industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that what we have in the wool industry today is a religion, where wool producers are told not to deal in facts but to have faith-blind faith-and to trust the Wool Commission, the Australian Wool Corporation, and not to rock the boat. In my view, it is an indictment of the industry and of the wool producers that they have not questioned the Corporation more strongly. In my view, the Corporation must be held responsible for this dramatic decline in the percentage of the fibre market held by wool, particularly when one recognises it has been spending an enormous sum of money on the promotion of wool. I am certain that if this contract had been given to the private sector, it would have done better. If it had not, it would have been sacked. According to the Wool Corporation, the solution seems to be to employ more people. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to information needs, I think one can be very critical of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Its rural department has for many, many years been an extension of the National Party. As such, it has kept many farmers in ignorance. It is interesting to note that the Wool Corporation is getting its message across very strongly and frequently on the ABC in the rural programs. The ABC is not giving anything like the same coverage to the people who are putting the alternative view. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told that recently the ABC has told people in its employment involved in the rural industry in Western Australia not to rock the boat; in other words, not to criticise or call into question decisions of the Wool Corporation. In the long run, the taxpayer is the one who will suffer if we lose too much market share. If the Australian wool industry contracts, the Australian taxpayer will pay very, very sorely. It is of interest to the Australian taxpayer, in my view, to get the best he can. In that regard it is important that the taxpayer buy the wool stockpile today at the discounted price, for this is the only way we can get stability into wool marketing. If that stockpile is locked up by the Government-it has to be the Government, because no-one will trust the Wool Corporation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to speak again tonight. Last night I discussed some essays that had been submitted, in response to a competition that I had asked for, from the local primary and secondary schools. The topic was `The Environment-The Challenge of the Future'. Last night I read an essay from Beth Mitchell, who won the senior award. Tonight it is my very great pleasure to read the essay of Adam Jackson, who is in year 6 at the Smeaton Primary School. Adam's essay is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In the world today, there is new technology which is achieving more each day, countries are getting bigger and stronger and the poor countries are being provided with a number of trades and also medical aid and food, but out of all these expanding topics, the environment is one of the most least beneficial areas. </PARA>
<PARA>The growing population of the world is using up most of the world's minerals, fauna and vegetation. Now what we have is a polluted, dying world and there are also cracks forming in the ozone layer which is something that should not be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>We are losing the beauty of the world and turning it into skyscrapers and concrete slabs. The world has already lost many of it's beautiful species of animals, but we still have many which are in danger of extinction. The minerals of the world are declining and if we keep on going the way we are, they will run out. </PARA>
<PARA>Out in the world there are many people eager to do something for our environment that would make a significant difference. If we all combine and communicate and take it a step at a time perhaps we may be able to save our planet. </PARA>
<PARA>Recycling is a big help in today's world. Far too many materials are being wasted which could be easily recycled back into useable products. If we would all take a bit more care and be aware of our own throw away habits, maybe our forests would have a chance to regenerate. One small way we could be helping is by using a string bag or equivalent to carry our shopping in instead of using plastic bags or paper wrappings. </PARA>
<PARA>Salinity is an increasing problem and many innocent farmers are suffering because others haven't taken notice. Salinity destroys the land and makes it useless. </PARA>
<PARA>Logging is destroying our beautiful rain forests. Not only are we harming ourselves, but the native animals and birdlife are continually being threatened. Protests are being held everywhere to make people more aware of the forests plight. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Government and the loggers should be making very careful decisions about our timber industry to ensure that we still have forests for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA>The cracking of the ozone layer will have far reaching effects on the world's weather which will dramatically change our lifestyle. Pollution is the cause of it, all the household sprays, car fumes and gases. Scientists have already developed new sprays and materials which are friendly to the environment. With new technology being discovered every day maybe it is not too late to save our planet. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that the money spent on arms and discovering new planets should be used to fix our environment. There is a lot wrong with our world, but there is still a chance of getting it back into a healthy state, so we must keep fighting together until we have achieved this. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an essay from a young man who is in year six. I hope that the contribution he makes is shared by many other children in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other people also contributed to the essay competition: Benjamin Richardson, Regina Righetti, Cassandra Peters, Elizabeth Righetti, E. Dutton, Chuong Nguyen, Jennifer Griffith, Tim Rivett, Nikki Quinney, Lisa Zachary, Raelene Sharp, Kim Hazeldine, Jade Harris, Sophie Elsworth, Jade Holster, Travis Vallance, Andrew Knowles, Josh Roe, Tanya Britten, Melanie Twomey, Kathryn Underwood, Anthea Greville, Cameron Hook, Nerrdyn Ford, Fiona Cullen, Kellie Manton, Andrew McNaughton, David Atkins, David Dowell, Penny Kerr and Sally-Anne Day. I thank them all most sincerely for their contribution to this extremely important topic. I know that, with the contribution of our young people, we can address the very serious problems of the environment that we face today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a well known fact that when one wants to prove a point on which one is a little bit shaky-be it one's political popularity or something that one wants to market-one gets some usually sympathetic survey group to carry out a survey and then, when it comes up with the result one wants, the point is proven. I was glancing through the Canberra Times today and my attention was drawn to the fact that, according to the headline here, 65 per cent of the people of New South Wales and Victoria approve of the Very Fast Train idea and, it was reported, more know of its benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Well, I do not know what its benefits are. Apparently there was a survey of 1,109 people and, from this small group, the survey deduced that 65 per cent of the people know of the proposal's benefits. I hope that the questioning was a little more thorough than this report would indicate, because apparently one of the salient features of the Very Fast Train which was put to these people was that it would take trucks off the roads. Anyone who knows anything about the Very Fast Train proposal knows that this is exactly what it is not going do. I would be the first to agree with the Very Fast Train proposal if it would take some of those trucks trundling down the Hume Highway, through my electorate, through the electorate of the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) and others, off the road. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Very Fast Train will not do-and it will never become a reality-is take any of those trucks off the road. That is what we have to do. We have to get those trucks off the road and get that heavy freight on to rail. But the Very Fast Train will not do that, and the consortium admits that. I have had many, many discussions with members of the consortium. I have taken a great interest in this proposal because, if it ever comes to fruition, the Very Fast Train will go through my electorate. I believe-and I have said it in this chamber many times-that both the State and Federal governments of both political persuasions over many years have neglected our State and Federal rail systems. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no argument with the point that the Federal Government should be putting more money into rail. We have increased the amount under the new proposals this year and, of course, coming up we have the freight proposal that came out of the Special Premiers Conference. But I believe that governments of all political persuasions, whether they are State or Federal, have neglected rail and the trucks have been encouraged onto our roads where they are doing a massive amount of damage. If we have money to spare, we should be doing something about the rail link between Sydney and Melbourne; we should be straightening out some of those bends. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed the other day it was announced that we would put in the new siding at Parkes and more crossing loops between Parkes and Broken Hill. In that way, by marshalling the trains at Parkes, we can send very fast freight trains across to Broken Hill and then across to the west. That is very important. I have also argued many times that if we had an adequate marshalling yard at Parkes, we could have an eastern seaboard port-hopefully, Port Kembla-where we could bring the containers in; put them on the rail; take them out to Parkes; remarshall at Parkes; and then, from Parkes, we could send them south to Melbourne, north to Brisbane and west to Perth. That would be a very important step and I would support that very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> But as to the Very Fast Train proposal, I keep seeing different figures. I think the estimate for the proposal is up to $18 billion at the moment. Money would have to be borrowed overseas-great for the foreign debt-and it is no wonder that some of the consortium members have recently withdrawn from this proposal. If I were looking to put my meagre investments anywhere, I most certainly would not invest in this proposal. I have not seen all the details of the survey-I will try to get a copy of it-but, judging by the report in the Canberra Times today, it was very biased. Regardless of the 65 per cent of people who allegedly approve of the Very Fast Train, I am one resident of New South Wales who opposes it. I oppose it, as do most of my constituents, especially those in the southern highlands area of New South Wales who would be greatly affected by this outrageous proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently, the Australian Political Exchange Committee presented to the Parliament the printed report of the Committee for the period 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990. The Australian Political Exchange Program administered by the Committee was established on 21 December 1981 when the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, with the support of the leaders of all parliamentary political parties, announced the establishment of an interim committee to arrange exchange visits between young political leaders of Australia and other countries. The leaders of the four parliamentary parties became the principals of this interim committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In August 1983, the interim committee, with the agreement of the principals, became the Australian Political Exchange Committee (APEC). The current Committee consists of the Chairman, the honourable Sir Robert Cotton KCMG; Mr Alan Cadman MP; Mr Robert Hogg, representing the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke); Ms Sam Hudson, representing the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Powell); Mr Tony Eggleton, representing the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson); the honourable Kerry Sibraa, President of the Senate, who is also a prime ministerial representative; and me. I am privileged to serve on the Committee as the representative of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). </PARA>
<PARA> The basic aims of the political exchange program are to foster international understanding and goodwill through the exchange of young political leaders, and to provide opportunities for young people involved in politics to study the political systems of other countries. The first exchange arrangement was with the United States of America. Similar arrangements have since been entered into with Canada, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Committee continues to consider the expansion of its operations to other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to quantify the benefits that have accrued to Australia through the operation of the program. However, it is clear that it has provided a framework within which initial contacts may be made and views and ideas exchanged between potential future leaders of Australia and other countries. Delegates are carefully chosen and have worked well together in the interests of Australia, as well as adding to their own knowledge and skill. </PARA>
<PARA> In the period covered by the report, the delegation has travelled from Australia to the USSR, while delegations have visited Australia from Canada, the United States and West Germany. I am sure the Committee would wish me to pay a tribute to those companies who help to finance the program and who are too numerous to mention in the time I have allocated. The Federal Government is also to be thanked, as is the Prime Minister for his support. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to pay a tribute on behalf of the Committee to a distinguished Australian, Sir Robert Cotton, who is the Chairman of the Committee, and also to the Secretariat, Mr John Leonart and Mrs Caroline Hughes, who are the executive officers, for their enthusiastic work for the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, I wish to say a few words about the important role that migrants have played in the growth and development of the south western Sydney area. I raise this subject because, once again, it seems that we are hearing unwarranted criticism of newcomers to this great country of ours. As a member for the electorate with one of the largest ethnic populations in Australia, I feel compelled to answer some of those criticisms and relate to the House the tremendous contribution that ethnic communities and their leaders have made to Fowler.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should preface my remarks by suggesting that some unkind people may feel that I speak with a bias when I come to the defence of migrants because I am a migrant myself. Of course I am and it is a fact of which, incidentally, I am extremely proud. That, however, is of no consequence as far as my feelings on this subject are concerned and of very little importance in Fowler where roughly 80 per cent of my constituents are the first or second generation of overseas-born Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the electorate of Fowler contains citizens from more than 100 different ethnic backgrounds. It contains very large communities of Italians, Croatians, Vietnamese, Chinese, people of Serbian extraction, and substantial communities of a host of other nationalities. Each and every community has brought its own distinctive style, culture and skills to the area; and each has played a part in contributing to the wider good of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> As the economy has slowed in recent times we have all heard the old party favourites trotted out regarding the cost to the wider community of the process of bringing new Australians to this country. We have heard that the dole queues are full of ethnic people who do not want to work. We hear that new arrivals are given handouts that far exceed anything available to ordinary Australians and we are told that multiculturalism has been a cause of all our economic and social problems and the destruction of our distinctive Australian way of life. This is all poppycock. </PARA>
<PARA> In the seven years I have been the member for Fowler it has been my experience that not only are those types of criticisms sad but they are fundamentally wrong. I have had the pleasure over the years in the electorate of Fowler to work very closely with a large number of ethnic communities and to study their attitude to this country and their perception of their role in the scheme of things. I must say that in each and every case I have found a community which wants to contribute and be recognised as an element of Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> I have found that our ethnic communities, through their leadership, have a social philosophy which is based on three fundamental elements-a desire to teach their own culture to their children, a belief in the need to contribute to the wider society, and an aversion to actions which create ethnic tensions, which is probably the most important one. </PARA>
<PARA> As an example I would point to the large Croatian community in Fowler which is very capably led by a gentleman by the name of Mr Ned Maruncic. Mr Maruncic is the type of leader that is the norm from community to community-a man who considers himself above all else an Australian, but who sees advantages for his children and other members of the Croatian community in the maintenance of aspects of the culture of his homeland. Mr Maruncic is also typical of the mainstream of ethnic leaders in that he has encouraged his community to become involved in issues of much greater importance than recreational activities-issues such as the care of the sick and the elderly, and the finding of employment for the young. </PARA>
<PARA> In Fowler we have seen the Croatian community raise a substantial amount of money to build their Cardinal Stepinac retirement village, just as the Vietnamese, Serbian and Italian communities have done before them. </PARA>
<PARA> In south-western Sydney we have our share of problems. Our youth unemployment levels are abysmally high, our public infrastructure is of a very ordinary standard, and our facilities are insufficient for our needs. Nevertheless we have a region that is growing faster than the State average, and a general community that is vibrant and forward looking. A great part of our success can be directly attributed to the influence of our migrant communities, particularly their capacity for hard work, their resolve to succeed, and their willingness to re-invest the proceeds of their efforts back into the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who questions the value of migrants to Australia need only come to south-western Sydney. Should they take the time they will see places such as Cabramatta, which are booming under the influence of migrant communities, and they will find a general level of activity that is the envy of regions that have not been so enriched. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the contents of the so-called blue files seized from under Robert Smith's bed by Federal police officers on 6 December 1988, how much did the then Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, know of the events described in the sordid diary entries contained with the file? Was the then Attorney-General briefed on the contents of the blue file? If so, what conclusions did he draw from the entries that identified Brian Burke as an active participant in the dirty tricks campaign?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Watergate without the Washington Post was how the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) so eloquently described the WA Inc. scandals. I am sure that the Smith tape revelations will occupy a similar relationship with the history of Western Australia as the Nixon tapes with the history of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> On Sunday 2 December the Perth Sunday Times reporter, Martin Saxon, unequivocally identified Brian Burke as the BB mentioned in the diary entries which I was able to read into Hansard some two to three weeks ago. In particular, the following is recorded in Smith's diary on 6= April 1987:</PARA>
<PARA> 9pm to Vince's. Delivered transcript to Vince of (name deleted)-Burke tape with tape. Copy to BB. Copy to TB. </PARA>
<PARA>Martin Saxon's article then describes how on the following day the Premier, Brian Burke, threw a one liner across the chamber of the Legislative Assembly which suggested he, Brian Burke, was aware of the contents of the City of Stirling bribe tape, secretly recorded in the office of the Premier's brother, Terry Burke. It is clear from the diary that the current Ambassador to Ireland received regular reports from Smith of his nefarious activities which included a campaign to denigrate Gary Aslan, witness for the prosecution in the trial of Brian Burke's close friend Len Brush, Liberal State MP, Ross Lightfoot and others, including senior WA Liberal MP Ian Laurance. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of these revelations it is now pertinent to ask what Attorney-General Lionel Bowen knew of the blue file, the tape and the diary. It is now clear from the entries revealed in Saxon's article and the trial of Robert Smith that Brian Burke was not only the BB mentioned in the diary entries but also an active player in the dirty tricks campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> If Lionel Bowen was briefed on the same information that has become available to the public, thanks to that trial and to Martin Saxon's efforts, why did he not come to the same conclusion as has been arrived at by the angry and betrayed voters of Western Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> Now is the time for the Federal Government to recall and stand-down the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. While these question marks remain over the activities of the former Premier during the dirty tricks campaign it is not appropriate for him to represent this country as emissary. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian National Railways (AN) advises that between 1983 and 1988, studies and discussions were undertaken with V/Line concerning upgrading and conversion of the Melbourne-Adelaide line, but major investigating work has been suspended pending developments on the National Freight Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, I approved, under the Australian Centennial Roads Development Program, funding of $21.029m over a three year period to upgrade a one hundred km stretch of the main south line from Coonalpyn to the Victorian border. The upgrading will include replacement of poor condition wooden sleepers with concrete, gauge-convertible sleepers. Upgrading will allow AN and V/Line to provide a more competitive and efficient service and to improve rail's share of the interstate freight transport market. Furthermore, the use of gauge-convertible sleepers will yield significant potential savings if the line is standardised.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Freight Initiative report identifies standardisation of the Melbourne-Adelaide rail link as one of a number of investment options that could be undertaken to improve the efficiency of interstate rail operations.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr Hand</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Mr Mark Darras is employed in a Migrant Workers Participation Scheme (MWPS) position subsidised by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the responsibility for the MWPS was formally transferred to the Industrial Relations portfolio with effect from 17 September 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Migrant Worker's Participation Scheme: Development Officer</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 1 October 1989</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The terms and conditions of employment are outlined in the Contract of Employment, a copy of which has been made available to the honourable member with salary details deleted as this is a confidential matter between the grantee organisation as employer and the employee.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The conditions of employment are set by the grantee organisation</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The term of employment is governed by the grant which was for a 2 year period to 30/9/91.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) (i) The Contract of Employment and MWPS Conditions of Eligibility and Rules of Operation stipulate that the minimum salary payable is 80% of the MWPS grant. The actual salary is negotiated directly between the grantee organisation as the employer and the employee.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) (ii) and (iii) The Scheme's Guidelines (a copy of which has been made available to the honourable member) allow for management committees (ie the grantee organisation) to cover travel and accommodation costs incurred by development officers in carrying out duties associated with the work program agreed with my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) The qualifications for the position of development officer under MWPS are outlined in the MWPS Guidelines at section 8.10 and are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> - knowledge of the Australian industrial relations and economic environment generally;</PARA>
<PARA> - previous experience in union related matters and, in particular, in implementing outcome oriented programs;</PARA>
<PARA> - detailed knowledge of issues relating to workplace reform such as award restructuring, work and management practices, the successful introduction of new technology etc;</PARA>
<PARA> - ability to liaise and consult effectively with union management, members, especially migrant members, and employers;</PARA>
<PARA> - ability to plan, develop and implement coherent strategies in line with the proposed work program and evaluate outcomes;</PARA>
<PARA> - knowledge of ethnic community structures and sensitivity to migrants' needs in the industrial context; and</PARA>
<PARA> - relevant language skills and cross-cultural sensitivity</PARA>
<PARA> (h-j) Mr Darras' application and qualifications are matters communicated in confidence between him and his employer and concern Mr Darras' personal affairs-these matters are protected by privacy and FOI legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian Brushmakers Union (ABU) did not lodge an application for a grant under the MWPS in its own right. However, a combined group of the Australian Brushmakers Union (ABU), Federated Ironworkers Association (FIA) and the Australasian Society of Engineers (ASE) did apply successfully for a grant under the MWPS.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 6 Glen Osmond Road, Parkside SA 5063, telephone number 272 6888</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) (A) Mr John Genovese; (B) Mr O'Dea was acting secretary</PARA>
<PARA>(C) &amp;(D) Mr J. Genovese was State Secretary on 9 May 1990 and he has been the occupant of that position over the past three years.</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) (A)-(D) According to the ABU there is no position of National Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) According to the ABU at the time of the grant application</PARA>
<PARA> (i) South Australian membership of the three organisations at the time was ABU 4500, ASE 6800, FIA 2500 (combined membership 13800)</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) Australia wide membership not stated</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The ABU first applied for a grant in conjunction with ASE and FIA on 10 May 1989. No previous applications have been made by the ABU.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) A copy of the application has been forwarded to the honourable member. No follow up or amended applications were made.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Yes-Mr Farrell ABU Industrial Officer completed the MWPS application form</PARA>
<PARA>(b) Yes</PARA>
<PARA>(c) A representative from each of ABU, ASE, FIA and DILGEA sat on the staff selection panel.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes, in conjunction with ASE and FIA.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) There is no provision for or against the secondment or sharing of MWPS officers from one union to another in the MWPS guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) As far as I am aware there was no such notification.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) As indicated above, a combined application for a MWPS grant was lodged by the ABU, ASE, FIA and a MWPS grant was awarded to those organisations. The Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, and the Australian Timber Workers Union are not MWPS grant holders and neither I nor my Department are aware of any secondment or sharing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) (a) The decision was made by my predecessor. The Department does not approve applications. Assessments and recommendations based on the guidelines were made by the Department. The Adelaide office recommended approval of the application. Central Office did not. (b) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) See (9) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) See (9) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Size of membership is only one of the criteria taken into account when assessing MWPS grant applications. (Section 6 of the MWPS Guidelines expands upon this issue). According to the information provided to the Department, the ABU had 4500 members at the time of application and the combined membership of the three unions was 13,800.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) See 1 (h-j) above. Mr Darras did describe in his application his resume of the position and its objectives. As is usual practice the actual program of work to be undertaken by Mr Darras was based not on his job application but on the detailed work program submitted as part of the joint MWPS application. The work program was negotiated and agreed with my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) No. Grant holders, rather than individual MWPS officers, are required to review the funded program with the Department. Reporting requirements are detailed at sections 8.22 to 8.27 of the Scheme Guidelines. Reports cover all aspects of the agreed work program. One progress report has been submitted to date and has been made available to the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) Yes. See (15) above. In addition to the initial work program update a six monthly progress report had been received by 10 May 1990. No further reports have been made.</PARA>
<PARA> (17) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (18) Yes, the reports do refer to the claims outlined. I have no knowledge of whether or not the Mr Darris or Darrell referred to is in fact Mr Mark Darras, employed by ABU, ASE and FIA under the MWPS.</PARA>
<PARA> (19) No. Development Officers under the Scheme are employed to implement agreed work programs which are in line with the Scheme's objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> (20) Yes-the honourable member himself forwarded a copy of the press release to me.</PARA>
<PARA> (21) I cannot answer from the information available to me.</PARA>
<PARA> (22) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (23) I will ensure that officers of my Department in Adelaide discuss these allegations with the ABU, ASE and FIA in order to ensure that the work program funded by my Department is being properly implemented.</PARA>
<PARA> (24) I am informed that MWPS officers visit factories and offices to discuss matters with workers; I am not aware of what credentials the officer needs to gain access.</PARA>
<PARA> (25) The grantee organisation is responsible for approving leave entitlements but in the event of the absence of a worker for other than leave entitlements, or the appointment of a locum to the grant position for the same period, the State Director of my Department must approve proposed arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> (26) My Department is not aware of any absences of the worker from the position. However, as indicated above normal leave entitlements are the responsibility of the grantee organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> (27) The United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia is the only other recipient of a MWPS grant in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (28) The United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia was also awarded a grant under the Scheme to implement a specific work program.</PARA>
<PARA> (29) See (28) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (30) No, however, my Department's Annual Reports provide a list of all MWPS grantee organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (31) Yes. However, not all MWPS grants are awarded to peak union councils. The previous Minister decided the identified needs outlined in the ABU, FIA and ASE joint application warranted funding under the Scheme.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 31 May 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a Chinese Government document which divides overseas Chinese students into five categories to receive various levels of punishment if they return to the People's Republic of China (PRC).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) If this document exists, do such discriminatory actions on the part of the Chinese Government give sufficient grounds for some or all PRC nationals in Australia to be granted residency on humanitarian or refugee grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) How many PRC nationals have applied for residence on (a) humanitarian and (b) refugee grounds since 4 June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) What percentage of PRC nationals currently in Australia has applied for residence or refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) How many applications for residence or refugee status from PRC nationals in Australia have been determined since 4 June 1989; if none have been determined, when will his Department commence so determining.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) How many of the applicants referred to in part (5) are PRC (a) diplomats and (b) students in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Is he able to say whether students who are PRC nationals are suffering increased financial and social difficulties in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Are PRC nationals in Australia granted temporary entry permits class 829; if so, does this (a) allow them to remain until 31 January 1991 but (b) deny them (i) a grant of residence on economic grounds, (ii) the right to re-entry visa, (iii) the right to graduate after 31 January 1991, (iv) the right to hold their scholarships, (v) the opportunity to finish their courses, (vi) the right of their children to public schooling and (vii) the right to Medicare benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Does his Department expect to complete determining the applications referred to in part (5), on a case-by-case basis, before the 31 January 1991 deadline.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Are PRC nationals in Australia who have been granted temporary entry permits class 829 unable to take up full-time employment based on their qualifications obtained in Australia because the new Migration Act specifically prohibits grant of residence on economic, occupation and special skills grounds to such applicants.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Will he use his discretion to waive the prohibition referred to in part (10) so that PRC nationals can endeavour to support themselves and their families while at the same time contributing their skills to the Australian economy.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4707" SPEAKER="Hand The Hon G.L." NAMEID="5H4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DUNDAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr Hand</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Chinese student groups have forwarded to me papers, purporting to be official Chinese Government documents, which place PRC students in the United States and Canada into five categories according to their apparent political commitment and activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The document to which Mr Ruddock refers deals specifically with PRC nationals in the United States and Canada. But it was one element in the mosaic of information available to the Government on this issue. Individual applications on humanitarian or refugee grounds are considered on a case-by-case basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) Humanitarian:</PARA>
<PARA> Up to 19 December 1989 approximately 6,650 applications had been received from PRC nationals for Grant of Residence Status on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. From 19 December 1989 to mid 1990 a further 3,140 applications had been received for a Permanent Entry Permit after Entry (PEPAE)-2400 humanitarian and 740 PRC. People may have made multiple applications, but there are no precise figures on this.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Refugee:</PARA>
<PARA> 1420 applications for refugee status from PRC nationals were lodged in the period from 4 June 1989 to 30 June 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In mid 1990 there were an estimated 44,000 PRC nationals temporarily in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> By mid year there were some 13,820 (7,950 Grant of Residence Status (GORS), 4,450 PEPAE and 1,420 Refugee) applications from PRC nationals for residence or refugee status. This figure includes applications for residence on spouse and occupational grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> A precise percentage cannot be given of PRC nationals who have applied for residence or refugee status due to the probability of multiple applications.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Approximately 1300 applications for GORS/PEPAE have been determined in the period July 1989-August 1990, the vast majority involved decisions on family and economic grounds. A small number of decisions have also been taken on compassionate and humanitarian grounds. Some applications have been withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA> A small number of applications for refugee status have been determined. It is not the practice of the Government to publish specific statistics where small numbers of cases are involved, as this may lead to the identification of individuals. This could result in harm to such individuals or their relatives in their source country and thus be in breach of Australia's obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) As noted in 5 above, information in relation to applications for refugee status, or on humanitarian grounds, could run the risk of identifying individuals.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Government's response to this issue has taken account of the financial and social difficulties of individual PRC nationals in Australia. Grants were provided to welfare and counselling agencies last year and on 10 July 1990 the Minister for Finance, Mr Ralph Willis, and I announced a range of Government services to which PRC nationals who were in Australia on 20 June 1989 and who are granted a four year temporary permit will have access.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The questions about temporary entry permits class 829 have now been overtaken by the announcement on 27 June of the new temporary entry permit for PRC nationals who were in Australia on 20 June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> The special permits provide for temporary residence until 30 June 1994. In deciding to provide the special permit the Government at the same time considered the question of applications by sponsored students from the PRC for grant of residence on occupational grounds. It was decided to amend the legislation to allow sponsored PRC students in Australia on 20 June 1989 to apply for residence on occupational grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> Holders of the special permit may apply for a single travel re-entry visa unless travel is to the PRC.</PARA>
<PARA> Where PRC nationals have maintained their student status they maintain their rights to scholarships. Students may apply for the balance of the permit to 30 June 1994, at the completion of their studies. Dependant children of the holders of this permit will be given access to primary and secondary education and to the English-as-second-language program. They also have access to Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) PRC nationals who were in Australia on 20 June 1989 who have already applied for resident status have the choice of proceeding with those applications or of applying immediately for the PRC (temporary) entry permit valid until 30 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA> Those applications that are not withdrawn will be processed on a case-by-case basis. Given current processing backlogs for refugee status and grant of resident status this is not likely to occur before 31 January 1991. However this is no longer a significant date.</PARA>
<PARA> PRC nationals in Australia on 20 June 1989 whose applications for permanent residence are unsuccessful will be permitted to apply for the balance of the special permit's validity to 30 June 1994. Applicants for DORS are able to apply at any time for the PRC (temporary) entry permit valid until 30 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) PRC nationals granted temporary entry permits class 829 were permitted to take up full-time employment. I understand there were some problems in obtaining long term employment relevant to qualifications and skills as these permits were only valid to 31 January 1991. The provision of the special permit,valid to 30 June 1994, should help resolve this problem. As indicated in response to part (8), the government has decided to amend legislation to lift the exclusion for grant of residence on occupational grounds with respect to sponsored students from the PRC who were in Australia on 20 June 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) As noted in questions 8 and 10, this is to be dealt with by legislative change.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr Hand</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The Procedures Advice Manual (PAM) provides guidance and assistance to officers for the purposes of implementing the Regulations. The settlement test is prescribed in the Regulations as follows and is binding on decisionmakers accordingly as force of law:</PARA>
<PARA> Regulation 2 of the Migration Regulations defines ``public interest criteria'' in relation to settlement as ``in the case of a person seeking to enter Australia for a period of not less than 12 months (other than a person seeking to do so under a spouse visa or as the dependent child of an Australian citizen or of an Australian permanent resident)-is likely to become established in Australia without undue personal difficulty and without imposing undue difficulties or cost on the Australian community''.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has residual powers under Sections 115 and 137 of the Migration Act to set aside these requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Applications for migration to Australia, temporary stay over 12 months and for a Permanent Entry Permit After Entry are all subject to the settlement requirement:</PARA>
<PARA> - with the exception of applicants for a spouse visa or as a dependent child of an Australian citizen or permanent resident as their immediate family links provide a high degree of settlement support.</PARA>
<PARA> The PAM explains how the settlement assessment is administered on the basis of the application and supporting documentation. Indicators available to the decisionmaker from the documentary information provided by the applicant are listed in the PAM. These enquiries are supplemented by a detailed assessment at personal interview where there is reason for concern. The PAM emphasises: ``If an officer considers that the applicant or a member of the family unit would be unable to settle satisfactorily in Australia the application is to be refused''.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr Robert Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At 19 September 1990, 78 houses at 35 rail centres in South Australia were vacant. Of these houses 3 have been vacant since 1986, 9 since 1987, 11 since 1988, 27 since 1989 while a further 28 have become vacant this year.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) AN is exempt from the payment of local government rates, but does make ex-gratia payments in lieu for residential properties. In 1990/91 payments totalling an estimated $5,566 will be made in respect of 18 of the 78 properties that were vacant at 19 September 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Of these 78 dwellings, 36 are now surplus to AN requirements. Of these 15 are soon to be transferred to the State Transport Authority of South Australia or the South Australian Government and 21 are to be sold. AN is to retain the other 42 dwellings as it still has a requirement for them.</PARA>
<PARA> Of the 42 houses AN is to retain AN will pay rates in respect of 16 and is examining the case for payment in respect of a further 6. No rates are payable in respect of a further 5 houses either because the houses are not used for residential purposes or because the local government authority concerned has not submitted a rate claim. No local government rates are payable in respect of 15 houses that are``out of districts''. These are houses at remote locations where there is no local government authority. At these locations AN itself is the provider of services normally provided by local government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) (i) The first round Access and Equity Plan was published in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The Department is in the process of preparing a second round plan. This will be published by June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) and (c) The Department has consultative arrangements with ethnic community groups covering, among other issues, the access and equity strategy. Details of these consultative mechanisms are below.</PARA>
<PARA> A Women's Issues and Access and Equity Section was established recently in the Ethnic Affairs Branch of the Department's Central Office. Amongst other matters, the Section has responsibility for the development of the Department's access and equity policy including community consultative arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>Central Office</PARA>
<PARA> Regular consultations at ministerial level are held with the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia (FECCA) on settlement and migration issues. The Settlement Branch of the Department is currently working with FECCA to involve it in settlement planning issues on a more systematic basis. Consultative arrangements are also proposed with other groups interested in migration and settlement.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth and State consultative arrangements are currently being put in place in all States to ensure State and community input into immigration/settlement planning processes.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Local Government Development Program (LGDP) funds are provided to councils to carry out specific projects of a research and developmental nature. An amount of $0.15m per annum for three years has been provided for a Multicultural Access and Equity category under the LGDP. Steering Committees for these projects may be formed comprising representatives of the local government body in receipt of the grant, other relevant bodies and community representatives. Under this category of the LGDP, initiatives by local councils to develop consultative mechanisms have been established.</PARA>
<PARA>The Regional level</PARA>
<PARA> The Department's State/Territory and regional offices maintain regular contact with Grant-in-Aid agencies, Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs) and representatives of the Office of Multicultural Affairs (OMA). State Ethnic Affairs or Community Liaison Officers are involved in ongoing consultations with community groups which include ethnic federations such as the Ethnic Communities Councils (ECCs), bilingual and ethnic workers, religious bodies, community welfare organisations, citizens advice bureaux, and cultural and educational institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, State/Territory and regional offices are involved in other consultative arrangements which are outlined below.</PARA>
<PARA> The Ethnic Affairs Section within the Victorian State Office participates in the Commonwealth Access and Equity Contact Officers Group convened by the OMA and in regular meetings concerning access and equity held by the City of Springvale. Departmental officers are members of the Springvale Migrant Settlement Committee and participate in the North-East Region Ethnic Issues Network.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department's State Office in New South Wales has established a network of Access and Equity Officers in each of the five regional offices, and in consultation with OMA has undertaken to establish a community consultation mechanism specifically for access and equity.</PARA>
<PARA> Both the ACT Territory Director and Settlement Manager have ongoing meetings with the ECC and the ACT Government which involve negotiations about service delivery to Non-English Speaking Background people. These meetings strengthen links with the community, enabling wider consultation. The Community Refugee Settlement Scheme (CRSS) coordinator receives feedback from the network of support groups and recent arrivals, and the senior social worker obtains feedback from the social service providers. Staff also develop feedback mechanisms by participating in immigration-related committees, eg. the ACT Housing Trust and the Torture and Rehabilitation and Network Service ACT (TRANSACT)</PARA>
<PARA> Departmental officers in Western Australia maintain contact with emergent umbrella groups such as the Multicultural Social Services Council to advise them on access and equity concerns.</PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian office produces a newsletter on issues relating to service provision as a result of its participation in the Access and Equity Forums organised by the ECC and OMA.</PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland a settlement committee consisting of Commonwealth, State, and local government representatives and voluntary agencies meets every three to four months to discuss migration and settlement issues. This committee includes OMA and the ECC.</PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory office participates in two monthly network meetings, convened by OMA, which also include local government representatives and other government officials. The meetings enable participants to share ideas and initiatives about cross-cultural training and other staff development issues, and to share data bases such as an ethnic communities mailing list. MRC and ECC representatives participated in the last meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The responsibility for access and equity is with the Women's Issues and Access and Equity Section which is part of the Ethnic Affairs Branch.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) The decision to fund Barramundi Waters from the Wet Tropics of Queensland Structural Adjustment Package was taken by the former Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, Senator Graham Richardson, on 9 August 1989. Funding was dependent upon that business being able to employ an appropriate number of eligible retrenched timber workers. The project was to be administered by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (DILGEA). A joint Ministerial press release was issued on 18 September 1989 stating that up to $400,000 would be provided for the project.</PARA>
<PARA> A contract for the Barramundi Waters project was prepared by the Office of Local Government (OLG) of DILGEA which was cleared by the Attorney-General's Department and executed by OLG. On 27 November 1989 $250,000 was paid by DASETT to OLG for expenditure for 1989/90. DILGEA has advised that to date $100,659 of this amount has been paid to the proprietors of Barramundi Waters for the project. A further $12,952 has been expended on monitoring the project and $6000 on an audit by a consultant into the operations of the business.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has advised that 3 displaced timber workers were engaged at Barramundi Waters under the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (b) In a letter of 28 November 1988 Senator Richardson offered funding under the Wet Tropics of Queensland Structural Adjustment Package of $622,200 to the Mareeba Shire Council Bicentennial Lakes Project. Funding was dependent upon the project being able to employ an appropriate number of eligible retrenched timber workers. Senator Richardson's offer was accepted and a contract signed by Mareeba Shire on 21 December 1988. The project involves the second stage of the development of an inland Tropical Botanical Garden at Mareeba called Bicentennial Lakes Park. The first stage was completed under Bicentennial Year funding.</PARA>
<PARA> To date, the total amount provided under the Structural Adjustment Package to the Mareeba Shire Council for this project is $292,384.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) I am advised that 5 employees are engaged under the Wet Tropics of Queensland Structural Adjustment Package by the Mareeba Shire Council on the Bicentennial Lakes Project.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the employment figures above, it should be noted that staffing levels fluctuate according to the availability of displaced timber workers eligible for assistance under the Package.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, an Australian Country Information Service Trial site has been established by Australia Post at the Korumburra Post Office since 2 July 1990 and will operate until 30 December 1991. Australia Post has advised that the operating cost of this site is on average $1 200 per month with the initial establishment costs being $3 417. These amounts exclude an apportionment of Australia Post Head Office and Regional Office costs and evaluation costs of the Trial.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are 20 offices of the Australian Country Information Service Trial located throughout Australia. These sites include regional offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) and the Department of Social Security, Australia Post, a CES Agent, Local Government and a community group.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Trial is to determine the most cost-effective and efficient means of increasing through face-to-face contact, remote and smaller rural communities' access to programs and services of 5 Commonwealth Departments. The Trial period is one and a half years.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Total funding for the Trial is $1.85 million, $.51 million for 1989/90, $.92 million for 1990/91 and $.42m for 1991/92. These funds have been allocated to each of the 5 agencies referred to in part (2), as well as the Department of Primary Industries and Energy who have responsibility for the evaluation of the Trial.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government provided additional funding within the budget for this Trial.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The South Gippsland Citizens' Advice Bureau does not receive direct Commonwealth funding. It does, however, receive indirect assistance from Countrylink by the provision of a stand and information. I understand that the Bureau also receives some financial assistance from the Victorian Government.</PARA>
<PARA>The service provided at the Trial site at Korumburra differs in some important respects to the service provided by the Citizens' Advice Bureau. For instance, staff have received training to enable them to provide more than an information service-a major part of the duties involves acting as an agent for the lodgement and acceptance of application forms such as the acceptance of unemployment benefits forms for the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA>All agencies determined selection of their own sites in consultation with other agencies. In Australia Post's case it selected a site in each state and attempted where possible to select sites where none of the 5 participating Commonwealth Departments whose services are available at the site had a presence.</PARA>
