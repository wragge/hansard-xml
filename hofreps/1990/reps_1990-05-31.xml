<TITLE>Therapeutic Goods Regulations</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufactures of natural remedies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt Homeopaths and Herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice and are an abomination.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a Public Enquiry into the questions of regulations of the natural healing professions and the supervision and regulation of natural therapeutic goods.</PARA>

<TITLE>International Earth Repair Action Decade</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out that:</PARA>
<PARA> our total global environment is rapidly deteriorating;</PARA>
<PARA> important natural resources vital to human life and livelihood such as ozone, trees, soil and the purity of air and water are being depleted at an increasing and alarming rate;</PARA>
<PARA> there is an urgent need to educate all people in conservation skills and the responsible use and maintenance of natural resources;</PARA>

<PARA> Earth Repair Action will unite people, communities, religions and nations in the productive purpose of greening and repairing our Earth for a safer and more peaceful future.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will: Propose that a world-wide ERA (Earth Repair Action) Decade begin on World Environment Day, June 5, 1990 with FIERY, the First International Earth Repair Year, and that this be proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly. This ten-year plan will ignite the spirit of local and global co-operation to stop the current destruction and start repairing our Earth by: growing billions of trees to replace forests lost and to replenish the atmosphere; hygienically composting all presently wasted bio-degradable materials into humus to revitalise soils; establishing globally, economically viable, permanent self-sustaining organic agriculture to end world hunger.</PARA>

<TITLE>Tutorial Assistance: Aboriginal Students</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain Residents of the State of South Australia concerned with Department of Education, Employment and Training (D.E.E.T.) funding and services for Aboriginal Education Programs.</PARA>
<PARA> Points out to the House that the undersigned wish to protest about the fact that there has been such a long delay in DEET funding for Aboriginal programs in Education during 1990. This delay is resulting in many Aboriginal students NOT having access to tutorial assistance despite repeated requests. As a result many senior secondary Aboriginal students are ``dropping out'' of school and throwing away what might have been promising opportunities for further education and employment. Also of concern is the fact that the process for gaining tutorial assistance has been changed and may be restrictive and inaccessible for many students. There also are NO written guidelines outlining DEET funding procedures for 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore ask the House to:</PARA>
<PARA> appoint tutors to Aboriginal students as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA> define the process for funding in order to achieve prompt action.</PARA>

<PARA> Down in Cygnet there are 80 tonnes of locally grown apples rotting on a hillside. This is only one example of the waste caused by Chilean apple producers dumping their product on the Australian market. American buyers have rejected these imports as Chilean apple growers use the spray Alar, a proven carcinogenic which has been banned by the American authorities. This substance has also been banned in Australia. Why is Australia accepting imports containing an illegal and dangerous substance? Why are we allowing massive waste of high quality Alar-free Australian juice apples?</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that we, the undersigned citizens of Australia, here register our firm protest against the current form of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1990-which seeks as S4 poisons those traditional natural medicines which have been safely used for centuries. The effect of the regulations will be to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Prohibit the sale of homeopathic remedies, in any potency, made from substances listed on the Poisons Schedule-including the right of qualified homoeopaths to dispense such remedies to their patients.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Prohibit manufacturers from communicating any information regarding the use of their preparations to natural therapists even in private or during an educational seminar limited to practitioners. This right will now be exclusive to doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons and pharmacists.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Prohibit the sale of many herbal substances commonly used by herbalists, including the right of qualified herbalists and naturopaths to dispense such remedies to their patients.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Increase the cost of all natural therapeutic substances by imposing an annual registration fee.</PARA>
<PARA> If these regulations are allowed to be proclaimed, it will mark the end of complementary natural therapy practice and deny the right of citizens of this country to choose the therapy they wish for their own wellbeing-in a manner which is affordable and accessible to all regardless of wealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report that I have just tabled on behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory was prepared by the Committee in the previous Parliament. The new Committee recently appointed in this Parliament resolved to adopt the report and to table it without amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report deals with the draft national capital plan prepared by the National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA). In July last year the Authority released volume one of the draft plan and this was followed in October by volume two. The report that I have just tabled is the result of the previous Committee's inquiry into those first two volumes of the draft plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee completed its report and had intended to table it last February but was unable to do so because of the dissolution of the Parliament for the election. Matters have progressed substantially since the report was prepared and the National Capital Planning Authority has extensively revised its draft. It appears that the Authority has now considered the comments and criticisms made during the extensive public consultation process. The Authority has also considered many of the concerns expressed by the Committee's inquiry and in the private briefing sessions the Committee had with the Authority. The Authority has also taken account of matters that I raised with it on behalf of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The report I have just tabled was prepared before the Authority revised its draft plan. However, I think it is important for the Parliament and the public to be able to weigh-up the new draft in the light of previous concerns and criticisms. I believe that this report needed to be tabled without amendment because it will help establish whether or not the National Capital Planning Authority has taken the right track. The Committee itself now intends to proceed to a review of the revised draft and I hope to be able to report back to the Parliament in August about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous Committee examined all the submissions received by the National Capital Planning Authority in response to its public consultation process and held a series of public hearings and briefings. It found both support and opposition, and also considerable misunderstanding of the plan. Expressions of concern about the role of the NCPA, the legislation dealing with planning in the Australian Capital Territory and the adequacy of the Australian Capital Territory self-government arrangements were also confused with comments on the provisions of the plan itself. The Committee considered that the NCPA had produced a draft plan that, if adopted, would comply with the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act in so far as the Act relates to the national capital plan. The Committee concluded that the draft plan contained proposals which would provide a sound basis for the continuing planning and development of Canberra in a way that would preserve the character of the city as the national capital. The committee rejected criticisms that the National Capital Planning Authority had exceeded its authority or had usurped the role of the ACT Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There were some shortcomings in the plan and the Committee found that it failed to anticipate or deal with many of the issues that subsequently became important. This led the Committee to recommend a series of significant changes to be incorporated before the plan is finalised and brought into the Parliament. For example, the Committee recommended that the plan be revised to stress and clarify its role in relation to the proposed Territory plan. The Committee also suggested that the proposal to adopt and incorporate gazetted former National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) policies be made more explicit and prominent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned that the draft plan contained neither an adequately full or explicit vision of Canberra's future nor analysis of alternative outcomes. It therefore recommended that the plan present more substantial economic and demographic data. The discussion about the future composition of the Territory's economy, population and work force and how the trends in these factors would affect the development of the Territory in its role in the national capital was found to be inadequate. The Committee also found that there was a need to discuss the implications of the plan for Commonwealth-Territory financial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases the Committee found that the proposals in the plan were quite acceptable but that many of the people who had responded to the draft plan were unaware of the proposals. In some cases they were aware of the proposals but did not understand them. The Committee therefore recommended, for example, that the plan make it clear how the principles, policies, standards and special requirements it sets down are linked to the old National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) policies. The future role of the plan itself needed clarification and the Committee recommended that the National Capital Planning Authority's intention to review gazetted policies be made explicit and that a timetable for the review be included in the plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations that I have referred to so far dealt with the plan in a general way. The Committee also made a number of recommendations about specific proposals for areas of land to be identified as designated areas or areas where special requirements will apply. The approach adopted by the Committee, when reviewing these proposals, was generally that leased land should not be made designated land nor should land where a significant Commonwealth involvement does not exist. It was felt that these areas should be designated only where it is necessary for the integrity of the character of the national capital. There were instances where the Committee thought that for some areas a better balance of Commonwealth, Territory and private interest would be achieved if special requirements were applied rather than designation. In each case the Committee believed that such an approach would not jeopardise the national capital role of the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Capital Planning Authority's revised draft was recently tabled in the Parliament as the certified draft national capital plan. The Committee has not yet had the opportunity to look at the certified draft in any detail. It appears that, in taking previous comments and criticisms into account, the National Capital Planning Authority has rectified many of the problems identified by the Committee. However, the adequacy of the certified draft is a matter for the further review that I referred to when I began my comments and I do not want to pre-empt that review. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to thank the Secretary of the Committee, Ian Dundas, and his assistant, Marlene Lyons, for the excellence of their work, and my fellow members of the Committee for achieving an agreed outcome in what was quite a controversial inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Dobell) (10.13)-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, and Technology, I present the Committee's report entitled Small Business in Australia-Challenges, Problems and Opportunities together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great honour for me to have the opportunity of presenting this report to the Parliament. It is, I believe, one of the most wide-ranging and significant reports ever presented. I will confess at the start that I had nothing to do with its preparation. The gentleman concerned with its preparation, as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in the last Parliament, is the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall) who, I am pleased to see, is in the House at the moment. This report was prepared by the Standing Committee in the last Parliament under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Rankin, and he now, as the incoming Minister for Small Business and Customs, has the unusual task of presenting the Government's response to one of his own reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report was presented to the Speaker pursuant to a special resolution of this House in the non-sitting period prior to the calling of the election. It has received a considerable amount of publicity, so I am sure that many honourable members are aware of its content and its wide-ranging recommendations. I believe the report also goes down in the record books because it is the only report ever referred to by the Governor-General in a speech on the occasion of an opening of a parliament. Once again, that augurs well for the implementation of its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of this report and the significance of small business are demonstrated by two statistics. In Australia there are more than 750,000 small businesses and they contribute to more than half of all the private sector employment in this country. That is a fair indication of the importance of this report and this sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is an extremely comprehensive one. It has 66 recommendations in all, and they range across the areas of taxation, finance, business regulation, government assistance, trade practices and many others. In addition to considering the immediate needs of small business, the report has also sought to address the deeper institutional problem of how the particular concerns of the small business sector may be fully considered in the development and implementation of Government policy. Hence, the report includes recommendations for the establishment of a national small business foundation, a Commonwealth-State ministerial council, annual reports to Parliament by the Minister for Small Business and Customs-of course, that being the honourable member for Rankin now-and an expansion of the role of the small business unit within the Federal bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the diversity that exists within the small business sector, the inquiry undertook an enormous task. It involved almost two years of work, during which time the Committee received evidence from approximately 230 witnesses at 22 public hearings held all around Australia. I believe the complexities of the undertaking were very well dealt with. The report is a thorough analysis of all the central issues and I commend it to honourable members for reading. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has established an agenda for Government action which, if achieved, will be of considerable assistance to the small business sector. The measures proposed are fundamentally concerned with removing many of the impediments to the operation of small businesses so that they can get on with their primary task. </PARA>

<PARA> In much of the media coverage of debate in this chamber, the media tend to highlight the divisions that exist in debates that occur, and many members of the public are unaware of the good work which is carried out by the parliamentary committees which contain honourable members from both sides of the Parliament and all the major political parties. </PARA>
<PARA> This report, as I mentioned, with more than 60 recommendations, was a unanimous report. That says a lot, not only for the Chairman but for all the members of the Committee for their contributions and their efforts in seeking to make sure that the report was a truly bipartisan one. I understand that the members worked in a very constructive spirit, and I hope that the spirit can continue on the Industry, Science and Technology Committee in this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to place on record the Parliament's gratitude to former honourable members of this House who assisted in the preparation of the report, and in particular the former member for McMillan, Barry Cunningham, and the former member for Gwydir, Ralph Hunt, who played a big role in the early stages of this report. In addition, I thank the Secretary of this Committee, Paul McMahon, and Doug Capp, who was the Acting Secretary for part of this inquiry, in addition to all the staff on the House of Representatives Industry, Science and Technology Committee. They deserve to be commended for the work which they have done for this Committee in the past; I am sure that will continue in the years to come. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I add my support to the remarks of our new Chairman, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) concerning the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, Small Business in Australia-Challenges, Problems and Opportunities, which was brought down during the break. Like our present Chairman, I commend those members of the previous Committee who worked in a very cooperative manner in producing a very comprehensive report about small business in Australia. As has been mentioned previously, it is representing the views of some 750,000 small business men and women around Australia who really are the big employers in providing jobs and jobs opportunities for so many Australians in our cities and rural areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to concentrate on the recommendations in the area of taxation. Whilst the Committee acted in a very cooperative manner in coming up with a number of recommendations, I hope that the new Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), because of his long experience on this Committee, will be encouraging the Government to bring about some changes in the tax area. On this side of the House we have advocated on a number of occasions that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) should change the capital gains tax-in fact get rid of it. At least the Committee made a recommendation on the roll-over arrangements with regard to capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee heard a number of submissions in relation to the whole sales tax area and heard at first-hand the administrative nightmare that was involved with small businessmen collecting money on behalf of the Government-the difficulties they had in making payments given the lag in time before they were paid as small businessmen but the promptness with which the Government demanded its dues. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting to hear the witnesses on many occasions complain quite bitterly about how they acted as a tax gatherer for the Government, let alone about the complexity of regulations and the lack of understanding of what their legal commitments were to the Commissioner of Taxation. The stock in trade was another matter that worried a number of small businessmen. As the inflationary pressures grew their stock on hand became a considerable problem to them. Sometimes they were showing profits in a book sense but in fact their cash at the bank indicated they were going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee looked at the problems of the company formation and provisional tax in some depth. We recommended that there should be another legal entity in small business rather than the formal company arrangements that suit bigger businesses. The general area of taxation, the problems of pay as you earn taxpayers and the fringe benefits problems, which again we on this side of the House have pointed out to the Government on a number of occasions, are of considerable moment to small business. Those of us who have had some practical applications of this are still in some difficulty in relation of how one meets one's commitments in paying fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I thank the outgoing Chairman for his friendly cooperation to members of the Opposition and the way in which this Committee operated. We spoke to a large number of witnesses throughout Australia. In my view this report is a comprehensive statement about small business and the state of play of small businesses in Australia. I hope that academics, people in small businesses and people in big business will use this as a reference work. I sincerely hope that the Government will take on board a number of the recommendations that we have put forward in good faith to look after the interests of small businessmen around Australia. I will be pressing the new Minister to ensure that he brings a number of these recommendations to the attention of the Treasurer and the Government in the hope that the long suffering small business men and women of Australia will get some respite from the regulations, from the tax and from the many problems that they face in the small business sector. This report really identifies that and becomes a benchmark work. </PARA>

I specifically congratulate the Minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), on the terrific cooperation afforded all of us in this inquiry. When the terms of reference were given to our Standing Committee some 12 months ago I never dreamt that at the end of the day we would have some 60 recommendations which would be unanimously passed. That was the highlight of the inquiry. It is the first major inquiry on this subject, as the honourable member for Corangamite (MacArthur), my colleague on the Committee, has pointed out-of course, the full report will act as a reference book in the future-and I will be looking forward to the Minister getting his submission to the Cabinet. We will be following his career with great interest.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst not being a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which prepared this report and submitted it to the House, I wish to be associated with that report and to commend it for the work that it has done on behalf of small business in Australia. Small business in Australia is facing a very difficult climate at the moment, particularly as Australia has an inflation rate which is more than double the average of our major trading partners and up to three times as high as that in some of our economies to the north with whom we are trying to compete. We also have the highest mortgage rates in the Western world. Lending rates to small businesses are three times as high as those in similar economies. It is in the climate that small businesses are trying to operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend the Committee for its work on behalf of small businesses. It has addressed many of the questions that small business is asking of the Government and asking of us as members of parliament to ensure that small business in this country does survive. The force of small business is extremely large in the overall context of business in Australia. The majority of those small businesses in Australia are very small. Ninety per cent of them employ fewer than 10 people. Ninety-five per cent of them employ fewer than 20 people. We can see that they are part of a very small framework and have extreme difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) is at the table. I read with great interest his article in the Melbourne Age of Sunday, 27 May. I hope that he was misquoted when he said that small business has run into trouble by not anticipating bad times after a typical seven-year growth period. Probably small business is least able to anticipate what is happening in our economy. When we see that the major banks in this country have made errors in anticipating the decline in our economy and the way it is biting I trust that small business receives a sympathetic ear from the Minister. I commend the Committee for the work it has done on behalf of small business in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend to the House the Pay-Television Transmission Bill 1990. The Bill sends a clear signal to the Government and the Australian public that the Opposition is serious about introducing pay television into Australia as soon as possible. The Bill repeals section 24a of the Radiocommunications Act, which imposes an embargo on the introduction of pay television services until at least September 1990. This embargo is the ultimate Luddite response to progress-legislate it out of existence. If it is passed the Bill will give potential pay television providers notice that action is being taken and that they can prepare with confidence for the advent of this new broadcasting-related service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not pretend that the Bill is a comprehensive solution to the pay television issue but it is an essential first step. It should be passed now so that the Government can go ahead in the recess without any more delay and set up the implementation process. If the Government does not act I will be introducing a more comprehensive Bill that I am working on now to set up a framework for the introduction of pay television in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The major issue in broadcasting is the future of pay television. Pay television means televised services for which a charge is made on the viewer. Viewers subscribe to services of their choice-movies, education, crafts, music, or whatever they want. The signal can be delivered by a variety of means including cable into the home, satellite, multipoint distribution or ultra high frequency but the service providers should be able to determine the technology to be used and the pace of its implementation should be determined by the market and not by government edict. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of taking a firm policy decision on pay television, as the coalition parties have done, the Government has had one inquiry after another, despite the fact that each inquiry has pointed in the same direction. That direction is to introduce pay television now. First of all, there was the 1982 inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, which was unequivocal in its support for pay television. Secondly, there was the 1989 Department of Transport and Communications report, which left no doubt of the Department's support for the early introduction of pay television. Thirdly, there was the 1989 report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which recommended that the Government should announce immediately an in-principle decision to introduce pay television into Australia. Yet despite these reports, the Government has had one review after the other. In fact, the whole communications area has now had more reviews than the Folies Bergere. There have been enough reports and it is time for some action. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be understood that a properly devised and implemented pay television system can exist side by side with commercial free to air television. Similarly, attempts in some quarters, notably in the Australian Labor Party Caucus, to bolster Telecom Australia's market dominance by giving it carriage of pay television is an extremely narrow view and will significantly delay its introduction. No-one is saying that pay television is simple to implement, but waiting for the easy solution is no solution at all. Meanwhile the Australian population is denied the wider choices and service which pay television offers and which independent research, for example by consultants BIS Shrapnel, shows that it would enthusiastically embrace. </PARA>
<PARA> International experience shows quite clearly that there is strong demand for pay television amongst consumers. There is no evidence that Australian consumers would be any less likely to embrace the service. Indeed, Australia can benefit from the experience of other nations. To delay a decision on pay television any longer would just be more of the same Luddite response-the response of those who are incapable of embracing any meaningful progress in the broadcasting or any other sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the House as the necessary first step in the implementation of change in this policy area. As I have said, the Bill will simply bring to an end the current embargo in the Radiocommunications Act on the introduction of pay television into Australia. Pay television is a good service, one which people want and which they will enjoy and benefit from, and it should be introduced to give a wider and greater choice to the Australian people as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Crimes (Protection of Australian Flags) Bill 1990. Originally I submitted this Bill to the House on 4 May 1989. At that time the Government refused to list the Bill for debate for the second reading despite a number of requests from the coalition side. Eventually, after some frustration, we raised this matter in the Budget session and unfortunately we were gagged-the Government refused to have debate on the Bill. I now re-introduce this Bill and hope that on this occasion the Government, having had time to reflect on its initial refusal to allow a second reading debate, will support this Bill on a bipartisan basis, as I have no doubt that there is overwhelming community support and support on both sides of the House for this Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The origins of the Bill lie in the actions of some rather thoughtless Australians who, in an attempt to obtain cheap publicity for their cause, insulted this country of ours by deliberately desecrating our national symbol, namely, burning our national flag outside Parliament House. I am sure that no reasonable person would want a situation to continue to exist whereby anyone may desecrate or otherwise dishonour our flag with impunity. Such behaviour is not tolerated in most other countries around the world, nor I believe should it be here. Do we have any less regard for our flag than do other countries? I think not. I believe it was only an oversight that such a provision was left out of the original Flags Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I believe the time is now appropriate to rectify the situation. Because the intention is that this be a criminal offence, I have decided to present it not as an addition to the Flags Act but as an addition to the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, if implemented and passed, will say that anyone who from now on desecrates or otherwise dishonours the Australian national flag or an Australian ensign or who without lawful authority burns, mutilates or otherwise destroys our flag shall be deemed guilty of an offence and subject to a penalty of $5,000 or imprisonment for two years, or both. That is broadly in line with penalties that exist in other countries around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe our flag has a very proud history. Since it was originally designed and accepted at the beginning of the century, our military personnel have fought under it in two world wars as well as in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. We will all as school children remember very fondly the flag-raising ceremonies we used to observe each morning before school started. It would be very tragic if, every time some unwashed, ignorant demonstrator wanted some cheap publicity shot, he or she were allowed to mock every decent tradition in our country by burning our flag. I believe that 99.9 per cent of Australians find this type of behaviour totally offensive. I would expect unanimous support from both sides of the chamber for this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Flags Amendment Bill 1990. On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, it is my pleasure to present this Bill to the chamber and I look forward to the opportunity to debate it in due course. I have no doubt that all honourable members-at least most of them, certainly all on our side-will have little problem in supporting it. As my colleagues in both the Liberal and National parties have said on many occasions, we are vary staunch supporters of the Australian flag. A similar Bill will be presented to the Senate shortly which will reinforce that view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose behind this Bill is to make it impossible for this Government, or indeed any government, to change the Australian flag without first having a referendum of the Australian people. We think that this is a perfectly reasonable and perfectly sensible thing to do. We believe that no government in Australia should have the right to change our great flag without first referring that question to the people and to have a full referendum. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, it is the Australian flag that we all see as a symbol of pride and as a symbol of our national unity. It has served us very well since Federation in 1901. While I accept that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has said in latter years that this Government has no intention of changing the flag, I have to say that the Liberal and National parties have grave doubts about the sincerity of the Australian Labor Party when it comes to making these sorts of statements. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give a couple of very sound reasons for those doubts. The first is that the Labour Party has, at annual conferences, passed resolutions calling for a change of the Australian flag. Until this Government came to power those sorts of resolutions were binding on the Labor Party and were normally expected to be carried through. It may well be that sometime in the future the Labor Party will again force its elected members of parliament to take notice of its conferences and to go ahead and enact conference resolutions. That is the first reason why we in the Opposition believe that this Bill is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason is that it is not just at annual or biennial conferences of the Australian Labor Party that resolutions of this kind have been passed and disparaging remarks made about the Australian flag. In fact, we only have to look to the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), to see that he has made some rather disparaging remarks in another place for which he should hang his head in shame. In 1981, he is reported in Hansard as having said that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we can do rather better than the present undistinguished and undistinctive bit of cloth which we have inherited from our colonial past and which manifestly does not set anybody's pulse racing in the community at large except, perhaps, the occasional Returned Services League blimp or a proportion of the tory backbench opposite. </PARA>

But it seems that he is quite unrepentant. Let us look at some more of his comments. In 1987, in the lead-up to the bicentennial year, he was quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Maybe the solution is for us to get on with the task of choosing for ourselves before 1988, a new, genuinely homegrown flag of which we really can be proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) congratulates all concerned on the completion of the F/A-18 construction program;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) notes that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the program was completed on time and on budget;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the Australian Industry Participation Program was completed in accordance with the original timetable and that standards of quality were extremely high; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the primary construction commenced by the Government Aircraft Factory (GAF), which delivered the first aircraft to the RAAF in 1984, and Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA), which delivered the 75th aircraft on 12 May 1990, was efficiently managed despite the changeover from GAF to ASTA; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) compliments the staff and management of GAF, Department of Defence Support, Department of Defence, ASTA and other Australian participants upon the success of this program. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of putting this motion on the Notice Paper was to pay tribute to those people who were involved in the initial FA18 program and were, basically, the Government's defence aircraft industry from the Second World War until about two or three years ago when a private corporation, Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd (ASTA), was set up to take over the Government aircraft corporation and run it as a commercial unit. </PARA>
<PARA> Two weeks ago the last FA18 aircraft was handed over by ASTA to the Royal Australian Air Force, completing a program which was stated to be on time and on budget. That program was divided between two quite different organisations. The majority of the completed aircraft were, in fact, delivered by the new private corporation, ASTA. The initial planning, negotiations and the setting up of production lines, techniques and tooling were undertaken by the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) at Fishermens Bend and at Avalon-which is now in the electorate of Lalor. The aircraft industry and other sections of Australian industry also played a major role in that program. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to draw attention to the successful manner in which the program was implemented and to other successful programs which, over a long period, were carried through by the former Government Aircraft Factories and resulted in products as good as, if not better than, the initial products on which they were based. </PARA>
<PARA> The FA18 was probably the most ambitious defence contract ever undertaken in Australia. It certainly was the most complicated. It was agreed upon at a time when, I think, Mr Killen was the Defence Minister and the processes continued during the period that Mr Sinclair, I and Mr Beazley were Ministers. There were obviously problems with that program, but they did not prevent successful completion of the program. Australia is the first country in the world to have been allowed to construct its own aircraft at that level of technology. I believe that the Australian program reflects credit on everyone who was involved at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The GAF was wound up during the period of that construction. A number of the people who were involved in that organisation and did not transfer to the new corporation had previously been involved in other programs. The Mirage program was undertaken through GAF, the Nomad aircraft were designed and constructed through GAF and the Canberra bombers were built by GAF. Its predecessor, the Department of Aircraft Production-which I think was founded by one of my predecessors, John Dedman-produced 7,000 aircraft for the Australian defence forces during the Second World War. One has to say that that task was probably not as technically complicated or as difficult as the production of the 70-odd aircraft which were produced in the most recent program, and certainly one would expect that it was not as expensive. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of those programs met the technical requirements and jumps in technology. Despite periods during which loss of skills was inevitable, because military aircraft in Australia do not have continuous production lines and there is not always another aircraft to carry on with, the organisation was able to carry through its programs, successfully complete them and turn out a product which I think all involved would say was second to none, given the numbers of aircraft that were constructed and the difficulties under which they were built. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to mention names. I know most of the people who worked at the Government Aircraft Factories in Avalon over a period of years. I am not as well aware of the people who worked at Fishermens Bend. I think some mistakes were made in management. Some policy decisions not taken by the organisation had an influence on it. I think some of those mistakes are very evident today. A larger amount of investment in the FA18 program, which involved upgrading the facilities at Fishermens Bend, should have been spent at Avalon, where an airfield existed, space existed and a self-contained aircraft construction industry could have been developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Fishermens Bend, the traditional construction site and location of the former Commonwealth Aircraft Factories, is restrictive in that larger aircraft cannot be taken to the facilities there. The Westgate Bridge causes some problems in getting aircraft in and out of the field, as do a number of buildings near the field. I was advocating as early as 1969 that the Fishermens Bend facility should be sold and the money used to develop the aircraft industry on one site where it had room to develop, where it had its own airfield and where there was adequate airspace. Nevertheless, I think the industry has a fairly good record of performance and production. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the Government Aircraft Factories and the aircraft construction industry at a military level in Australia has been a stop and go-type operation. There has never been a period where the next work load was on the horizon when the previous aircraft were being completed. The FA18 program is one of those types of operation. With the last aircraft rolling off the production line, there is no major employer of those skills in Australia on the horizon. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has managed to continue because it has been able to undertake tasks which were less than a comprehensive aircraft construction program. It has built wings, perspex, windows for Boeing and has filled a number of orders of that nature. However, governments have insisted-I have to say that all the programs have been committed by conservative governments since World War II-on a major proportion of the construction of aircraft for the Australian defence forces being undertaken in Australia. The notable exception was the F111, which was purchased while it was on the drawing board. Ultimately it arrived and it is still in service nearly 30 years after it was originally ordered. Whatever task has been placed on the industry it has been able to perform. One has to say that those in the industry were and are extremely dedicated. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the role of GAF in the FA18 program and the aircraft industry in post-war Australia and its successor during World War II should be noted. Many people who gave a lifetime to that industry did not continue on into the commercial area when it was taken over by ASTA. I think those who have had ministerial responsibility would have to agree that the industry was probably carrying too many overheads for a successful commercial operation. ASTA gives all the impression that over the years it will be a strong and viable industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that its facilities are still split between two sites, one of them, in my opinion, being unsuitable for any significant aircraft activities-that is, Fishermens Bend. Those decisions were taken in good faith. The dislocation that would have taken place for people at the Fishermens Bend site would have been great but, at the end of the day, it would have been of benefit to the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also would have been prepared to second the motion because there are no differences on either side of the Parliament about its contents. It is what the motion does not say and the background behind the maintenance of an aeronautical industry in Australia to which I want to address my remarks. I will also say a few things about the original development of the tactical fighter force (TFF) program-the implementation of the various concepts that led to the adoption of the FA18 as the preferred tactical fighter for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF)-and address some of the problems for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding the workmanship and the quality of those to whom the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has referred, there is no dispute. Without doubt, Australian technicians at Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) and Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd (ASTA) have done an outstanding job in the fulfilment of not only the F18 program but also each of the earlier programs in which they have been involved. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that everybody needs to understand is that everything in defence is not capable of fulfilment within the framework of a one-year program. It was for that reason, when Allen Fairhall was Minister for Defence long ago, that we introduced the five-year development programs. We had a rolling program to which capital could be committed. The work undertaken in the TFF program, which led to the seventy-fifth F18 finally being delivered the other day, goes way back. This rolling concept of preparedness for the future is one of the obligatory parts of trying to ensure that one has an adequate defence capability and, of course, that one uses that capability in one's own domestic manufacturing capability. </PARA>
<PARA> It worries me that with the delivery of this seventy-fifth F18 we are now getting to the point where aeronautical engineering, design and manufacturing are in the doldrums. That is no good from the point of view of Australia; it is no good from the point of view of those who are obviously involved in the industry in the honourable member's electorate; and it is certainly no good, for Australia's defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition, when in government, had a series of programs all of which were designed to provide for the future. For instance, in the development of the TFF we selected the F18 ahead of the F16. We decided that the F18 was an aircraft that would fulfil the requirements of the Defence Force and enable us to develop our manufacturing capability. To my mind, what we should have done was look at where we were going from there. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the decisions of the previous Minister for Defence and present Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) with which I find myself in total disagreement was the fact that early in the days of the Labor Government he decided that he would no longer proceed with the concept of developing a basic training aircraft in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the coalition we set up a committee. We tried to involve the widest possible range of people, including former Air Force personnel. Jack Davenport, a distinguished wartime pilot, was appointed chairman. We brought in a range of advisers from the Air Force, other members of the Defence Force and people from industry. All of this was designed to produce an aircraft which could be designed and manufactured in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course it is difficult maintaining and developing a design capability in a country such as ours. We understand that to develop an F18 in Australia is beyond our capability. We have seen the problems that the Israelis are having in their quite different defence circumstances in developing and adaption of the Mirage. What I am worried about is that this Government needs to start projecting its understanding of industry, its requirement for the defence forces, beyond today. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of aircraft requirements for the Australian Defence Force, we have some manufacture and assembly requirements for the Black Hawks and the SeaHawks and there is going to be some involvement in repairs and maintenance of the F18. Fortunately, the latter will be minimal. One of the successes of the F18 program is that the requirement to send the aircraft back to the factory is very slight. It has a wonderful performance record. It would be far better it we could have developed another forward construction program, not just in utilising a design or picking up the offsets that might be available from Boeing or one of the other civil manufacturers-important though they are-but in trying to ensure that we had a future aircraft industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Most honourable members and those who are listening to this debate will be aware of what happened to the Victa airtourer. The design was very good and it was acclaimed as being entirely suitable for general aviation and training purposes. The Victa airtourer was sold to New Zealand and we then bought it from New Zealand. I am not against anything being manufactured in New Zealand-indeed, I am one of those who promote a commonality of Australia and New Zealand in many fields-but I am concerned that today's motion is a requiem almost to the Australian aeronautical design and manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not feel like adopting requiems, particularly when it involves secondary industry, which creates employment and the generation of opportunities for Australia to participate in what we all see as a changing Asian world. What we should be doing is developing an Australian capability to design and manufacture here so that we can sell to that Asian world of which we hear such a great deal. We do have people who are highly skilled. We do have an opportunity to sell our technology and know-how to Asia. We do have a capacity to assemble the F18 well, as the motion suggests, but to design and manufacture in a whole range of other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the trainer for the RAAF, the Government, having spent about $80m, said that it was going to buy a Swiss design, which was going to be manufactured in Australia. Although buying a Swiss design was bad enough, that is not my point. My point is that we want to be able to design as well as manufacture, to utilise Australian skills and give encouragement to Australian aeronautical engineers; not to be somebody's echo or shadow but to be able to perform for ourselves. Why should we be second to anybody else in a field in which, we have capability, where we can send our people not merely to procure design from overseas but develop that capacity here?</PARA>
<PARA> Other countries showed interest in the trainer. Indeed, I remember Air Marshal David Evans commenting that there was quite considerable interest in China. It thought the design we had was better than anything that it had or anything that was available elsewhere. What did we do? We decided to buy a Swiss aircraft; we ordered the PC-9. It is a beautiful aircraft. I am told that it has a capacity beyond the original design requirement. But sadly it also had to be significantly modified. I am told that modifications were required to the landing gear and that, as a result of that, modifications to some part of the wing in order to accommodate those changes to the landing gear. I am not sure of the cost of it, but I am told that it was in the tens of millions of dollars. So what did we do? We scrapped a committee's work which had produced a design, which was the product of assembling all the best intelligence we could and a representation of the best people we could, in favour of buying a Swiss aircraft which was overdesigned and had to be modified. That again cost us millions of dollars, and we lost the capacity not only to export but also to retain the opportunities for employment of Australian design capability. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that is the way Australia wants to go. I prefer to see Australia as a first-class country, not just a country importing technology and design and denying Australian aeronautical engineers and our technicians the opportunity to utilise to the highest degree, their own quality and training within Australia. Of course, our own aeronautical engineers are largely leaving Australia. They go overseas so that they can participate in fulfilment of their technical qualifications by joining Boeing or British Aerospace. They go overseas because there is not the opportunity here. I do not agree with that, and it seems to me that this resolution should rather be directed towards encouraging future design capability as well as manufacturing capability in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that worries me is on a wider front. We have read that the new Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is going to set up a new inquiry into force structure. On this side of the House, we have been very critical of the neglect by Minister Beazley of the human relations side of the services. We are equally concerned about force structure and the degree to which Australia's defence capability cannot be seen just as mirroring the reduction in threat between the superpowers. Of course, everyone in his right mind in Australia supports the reduction in tension between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States. We all support the progression of disarmament in conventional and nuclear weapons, but what we ought to understand is that Australia's situation is not the same. Indeed, one of the great achievements of Australia in the defence field is that, in spite of our not having a defence threat-and thank God we have not-we have been able to develop a force structure and program over the course of the years through successive White Papers which had enabled us to mount a reasonable competence.</PARA>
<PARA> I am worried that the Government seems to be retreating, because it says that the defence threat is not so great, from the strategic reality of the world in which we live. Sadly, the threat in the Pacific is still quite acute, although of a low level character, as Dibb himself reflected in his Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities. Part of my worry is that, with the events that are occurring in the Pacific Islands, in Bougainville, in the Philippines and Cambodia, someone in Australia, in accepting that there is a reduction in the threat environment embracing the superpowers, believe that we can forget about a defence capability. I am particularly worried, therefore, in any review of force structure that might be embarked upon by Senator Robert Ray, as the new Minister for Defence, that we are going to see a further deterioration in our deterrent capability within the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA> There are two elements in relation to the Australian Defence Force, and one of those elements is manpower. A great deal has been said by the spokesmen on defence on the Opposition benches with respect to fall-out of skilled people, who are leaving the services to go into civilian life simply because of the attraction that now exists in pay and salary elsewhere. It could be that, because of rising unemployment and difficult conditions in the private sector, there might be a lessening of that fall-out, but it is real, and the Government has to address the human and management problem within the Defence Force to ensure that people do not continue to leave the services for the wrong reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The second element is in the equipment field, and I am particularly concerned about a number of aspects there. For example, although the avionics upgrade program for the F111 is now in the pipeline, I would be concerned if it were allowed to slip, because as far as I am concerned the F111 and Australia's submarine force are the two principal deterrent weapons that Australia possesses. I am concerned that the Government, for example, is going ahead with the frigate program which seems to me strategically to relate back to fighting a war in the manner of World War II. Stand-off missiles and smart weaponry and modern weapons tend to be far more capable of operating against, for example, surface warships from a distance without the launching platform even being visible. It worries me that, in the way we are going in a force structure review, we are forgetting that we have a couple of particularly competent elements already in our force. The FA18, of course, is a part of it, as is the F111. I hope that in any Force structure review the avionics upgrade program for the F111 is not allowed to slip in any way. That program has to be at the top of our priorities in defence expenditure because, to my mind, the problem of the strategic situation around Australia is such that we cannot afford not to maintain that defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The success or failure of the Defence Force will be tested when it has to be used. If Australia is sufficiently strong for other countries to look at us and say, `We are not going to launch any sort of attack that is going to prejudice Australia's interests for fear of a retaliation', our Defence Force will have succeeded; and for that reason, in the general field of the activities of ASTA, the GAF and our manufacturing industry, we need to make sure that we maintain our priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Real problems are emerging around Australia of inadequate training areas affecting the equipment and hardware of the Defence Forces. For example, the Salt Ash weapons range is affecting the survival and continuation of the Williamstown base where the FA18s are now flying. Of course, as a result of urban extension, Salt Ash, like many other weapons ranges, has a large number of people living around it. We have got to start relocating some of those weapons ranges. We need to do it now, not to wait until it is too late. We need to make sure that we can keep that hardware and software in perfect condition and train our people accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> I totally endorse this resolution, but I suggest to the Government that the time is appropriate for us to have a much wider defence debate, and since Senator Ray is committing the Government to an upgrade of our force structure I would like to see an opportunity given in this place for us to debate some of the implications and consequences of the sort of defence equipment decisions which the Government has made which have destroyed Australia's capacity for design and construction rather than encourage it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For 50 years the flame of freedom and the love of democracy has been kept alive in the Baltic states. Despite the domination and tyranny by the Soviet Union of the Baltic states, the love for democracy and the wish to be free in the people of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia have remained. It is with great pleasure that I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) deplores 50 years of gross violation of human rights and forced exile in the Baltic States;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) recognises the legality of the Declarations of Independence of these nations and endorses their stand for democracy, human rights and self determination;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) strongly condemns the threats of violence and the economic blackmail by the Soviet Union against these nations;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) calls on the Soviet authorities to abandon the blockade of vital raw materials to Lithuania and to allow the immediate resumption of oil, gas, food and medical supplies;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) urges the Soviet Union to recognise and respect the Declarations of Independence; and</PARA>
<PARA> (6) requests the Australian Government to establish diplomatic relations with Lithuania. </PARA>
<PARA>On 11 March the courageous declaration by Lithuanians was that they were absolutely free and independent. Through their democratically elected parliament a decision was made that they no longer wished to continue the practice of domination by the Soviet Union of the previous 50 years. In fact, in 1919 Lenin himself wrote the Baltic states out of the Soviet Union. Lenin himself took the step of saying that these states are different and separate and are not part of the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the infamous Ribbentrop Treaty of 1930 that annexed the Baltic states. Hitler and Stalin, faced with the circumstances of the time, agreed that those three free, democratic states, should be annexed into the Soviet Union. That decision by Germany and the Soviet Union before the Second World War was renounced recently by Mr Gorbachev as being an improper use of power. Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania have taken the lead within the Soviet republics of declaring their independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The wish for freedom, the move for human rights and the establishment of democracy have been kept alive in the Baltic states by academics, dissidents, scientists, strong Christian communities and by ordinary people. It is a natural inclination of mankind to be free and under a democratic system. The seeds can lie buried for years but eventually they will emerge when the opportunity arises. I wonder how many Australians would be prepared to carry the same commitment forward through 2 3/4 generations-a belief passed down from one generation to another-that the right of freedom is the right of our nation. I believe that we would, and we should pay tribute to the leaders and the people of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is incredible that, in spite of the statements made by Soviet leaders, a blockade was established which will enforce the restriction of basic goods to Lithuania. I believe that blockade must be removed. The Australian Government, through its Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), can do nothing but seemingly wave feathers. A statement issued by the Prime Minister on 20 April 1990 concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's earnest hope that this issue can be handled peacefully, with sensitivity, and with respect for human rights. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the best the Australian Prime Minister can do in these circumstances. There is not one word about the blockade; not one word about the use of paratroopers and force; not one word about dragging soldiers out of hospitals or the display of tanks outside the Lithuanian Parliament, while the Parliament was sitting. Can any Australian contemplate a display of force outside this place by an invading or dominating power while the House is sitting? The representatives of the people, properly elected, in Lithuania were deciding the future of their nation and, at the same time, there was a display of force-intimidation-by tanks in the main street outside the Lithuanian Parliament. All the Prime Minister can say is that the Government `earnestly hopes'. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a most blatant stand-back from a world force that needs initiative and commitment from the Australian Government. There is not one word in any of the statements by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) or the Prime Minister that Australia condemns the use of force, condemns the intimidation and condemns the blockades that are in place. Australia should be taking initiatives in these areas-not standing back and failing to have any independent or self-generated views on these matters-and be prepared to accept the weakest of the weak from around the world as a policy which it must adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> The oil, gas, food and medical supplies have been cut off-that happened in the last week of April. Recent reports indicate that in Vilnius the situation is serious-homes are without hot water and transportation systems are grinding to a halt. The blockades are biting. The British and the French have adopted fairly stand-back attitudes. The British Government, through Mr William Waldegrave, said that existing viable states with control over their external policy and over their territory will be recognised by the British Government. President Mitterrand says that Lithuania is an inseparable part of the Soviet Union. The United States of America has adopted a slightly stronger stance on this issue. The Lithuanian President has appealed to the West for support and help with basic goods. The Australian Government and the Australian Prime Minister have said nothing. They have said not a thing about Australia's attitude, nor have they said any word of condemnation of these practices. In fact, it is impossible to gain entry for major goods through the ports due to customs control by the KGB in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, but we can take strong steps in support of the freedom-loving Balts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union is a crumbling empire. Its days are limited. Georgia, the Ukraine, Armenia and Azerbaijan-all of these independent republics-are now starting to feel a drive towards freedom and democracy. They are making claims against the central Government. The risk that will be faced by the world and the Soviet Union is that there will be a disintegration, with possible bloodshed and military activity. The cohesion of a federation through this period is significant, but it is not so significant that Mr Gorbachev or anybody else should be propped up by the Western world by feint condemnation of his activities. Mr Gorbachev needs to be supported against the militants in the Soviet Union by strong statements and commitment by the West. It is a time for the West to be strong rather than weak. I believe that there is unanimity here in this Parliament and I look forward to the agreement of the House to this motion that is before it-that we condemn, deplore and take action to bring about a attitude among Western nations. Australia is a middle ranking power and has a very important role to play. It is not a role that can be played by France, Great Britain or the United States. It is a role that is distinctly the role of a middle ranking power. That role is to strongly express condemnation, and take actions to so bolster the attitudes of the major powers that they will not feel reluctant to take positive action. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe some of the misleading statements of Gorbachev need to be checked. His claims of openness and movement towards the West are completely misleading when judged against the actions that he has taken against Lithuania. He stands condemned for that. I believe those statements are probably as misleading as the statements we have had in this Parliament from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in regard to the Australian economy. I believe we need to urge the Soviet Union to recognise by statement that there are elected governments in the Baltic States; that they are practising democracy; that they have representative parliaments and that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are on their way to freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, Australia's role is vital. I notice in the Prime Minister's statement and in the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade that for years Australians have recognised the independence of the Baltic states. In fact, it is not so many years ago that the Australian Labor Party did not recognise the independence of those states. It was Mr Whitlam's Government which recognised the de jure control of those nations by the Soviet Union. He reversed years of standing policy and the Labor Party cannot run away from the fact that it is not so long ago that it recognised Soviet control over the Baltic states. The Government needs to reassure the world that its stance is solid and sound, and that it is not harking back to the Whitlam period by taking a weak and equivocal line against the Soviet Union for its treatment of the Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians as a people-and certainly members on this side of the House-have never accepted the Soviet rule of the Baltic states. We are not assisting Gorbachev by wringing our hands and saying that it is too difficult, they ought to get together and talk, and it is only by talking that they will resolve it. Australia needs to take positive action. We are making a far weaker response than the responses we have made to any recent world events, starting in 1986 with our response to the invasion of Czechoslovakia. It is a far weaker response than the tears of the Prime Minister in response to the situation in China; it is a far weaker response than our attitude to South Africa; and it is a far weaker response than practically any response on foreign affairs issue that this Government has taken up in the cause of freedom loving people seeking to have a democracy and seeking to establish human rights. We are in an ideal position to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> As a nation we appear to be concentrating on the irrelevant; we seem to be strong on peripheral issues; and we have a Prime Minister who wants to be loved and a Foreign Minister whose acerbic intellectual utterances leave nothing to be understood as a positive line or a commitment to the real needs of the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the initiatives the Australian Government should be taking should include establishing parliamentary task forces to those Baltic states, to bolster and support them in their claims for democracy. We should be encouraging an exchange of bureaucratic and private enterprise expertise and economists to assist them in these early days of their democratic growth. Those sorts of exchange programs are positive programs that are not an affront to the Soviet Union but are constructive and supportive of the independent nations now in the Baltic area. We are a middle-ranking power and we can take this initiative. We can establish an avenue for the medical supplies that are not reaching Lithuania. It is a simple thing for Australia to take that initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia can establish and recognise diplomatic missions of all types in this nation: the African National Congress can have a diplomatic mission here, the Aboriginals can have an embassy outside the Parliament and be recognised by the Government, and the Palestinians can establish a force within Melbourne, Sydney or Canberra and be acknowledged by the Australian Government. But, for fear of affronting the Soviet Union, we cannot-we dare not-allow the Lithuanian people to establish a consulate in Australia. That is a simple initiative; it is a recognition that takes it in a positive way right up to the Kremlin's front doors. It is the way in which a middle-ranking power should be acting in support of those people who have spent generations of punishment, tyranny and death for ideals they believe in. I wonder whether the Government has ideals that it believes in in this area. I know that the Parliament has, and I look for the support of members on the other side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion, in essence, expresses support for the efforts of the people of the three Baltic republics of the Soviet Union to create independent, democratic states. It refers in particular to Lithuania, the community whose efforts have proceeded furthest in this direction with its premier drawing near head of state status when travelling abroad. In general, I support this motion with only minor reservations about the speed of its implementation and some of its interpretations about the activities of the present Soviet leadership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should begin by pointing out to this House that events in the Soviet empire have excited considerable interest among electors in Adelaide, my seat. Some of the suburbs of that area were developed at the time of heavy east European migration about 40 years ago. As a result, many communities still have their population and cultural centres in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> Since my election in March there has been a spate of activities in support of Baltic state and Ukrainian independence. They have been orderly and very well attended and I have had the privilege of addressing some of them. Next month I will speak at the special Baltic rally in Victoria Square and attend the service at St Xavier's Cathedral. Shortly I will be presenting to this House some petitions on behalf of the people of the Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note in passing that their peoples arrived here in circumstances not unlike those of contemporary political refugee communities, including the Vietnamese, and note that very few members of the Australian community today would say that those political refugee communities that we received 40 years ago have not made a valuable contribution to Australian development. I hope that the same treatment and reception will be accorded to our contemporary refugee communities, including the Vietnamese. I have said to these communities what I now intend to say to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> We are witnessing-and here I agree substantially with what the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) said-the dissolution of the last great European colonial empire-one that masked its mission, not by the `white man's burden' or the `New Order', but by the ideology of communism. Much of this empire was acquired by the military conquests of the tsars and then liberated only by simultaneous defeat and revolution in the tsarist, German and Austro-Hungarian empires after the First World War. The post-revolutionary communist regime in Moscow then set about reacquiring the territories that had been lost by the tsars. </PARA>
<PARA> This Soviet reconquest of the old empire included the Baltic states, which were effectively free for only two decades up to 1940. It is quite true that after that reconquest they experienced gross violations of human rights but, sad to say, in this respect they differed very little from the other republics of the Soviet state, and then from the surrounding territories. </PARA>
<PARA> In the post-war world the Soviets acquired new territories, partly for strategic reasons in eastern Europe, and treated them in a very similar fashion. Unfortunately in the 1970s they then set about establishing new client and puppet regimes in the Third World with similar kinds of domestic arrangements in a manner rather reminiscent of previous European great powers and with an imperial military capacity to match. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1980 the Soviets hit a crisis of sclerosis and overextension and in the latter days of Brezhnev the potential of their planned economy and depressed society was exhausted and their material output actually shrank. They were no longer able to support a superpower military machine which absorbed a huge percentage of their gross domestic product-on estimates which have been arrived at more recently, it is now estimated that they spent up to a third of their GDP on defence-and were no longer able to subsidise the client regimes which they had acquired and which were costing enormous sums of money. The living standards of the Soviets declined, although not those of the Soviet ruling elite, the nomenklatura. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union faltered through a five-year political crisis during the early 1980s of a dying Brezhnev, a dying Andropov, and a dying Chernenko. Gorbachev is the first healthy, modern Soviet leader and he is the first to seriously address the problem of an empire in decline. He may be, in a comparative sense, the de Gaulle of Russia and, like de Gaulle before him, civil war and palace coups always threaten. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fashionable, and it is also present in this motion, to decry and criticise Mikhail Gorbachev. I will not do that. It seems to me that he has faced very squarely the Soviet's strategic and economic problems and, when faced with the hard choices concerning the dismantling of the Soviet imperial regime, he has taken the hard choice. During the last five years Gorbachev has dismantled the entire Soviet Third World empire, with the arguable exception of Cuba. He has bilaterally agreed to intermediate nuclear arms reduction deals with the United States, and he has unilaterally demobilised much of the Soviet conventional weaponry. I believe that we are about to see a breakthrough-possibly a huge breakthrough-in strategic nuclear arms negotiations and corresponding reductions. When confronted with intractable problems, or seemingly intractable problems, of reform in the so-called people's democracies of eastern Europe during last year, Gorbachev watched them blown away by people's revolts and, in a couple of respects-probably Romania-it was the Kremlin that in all likelihood instigated these revolts. </PARA>
<PARA> I am making this simple point: the behaviour of the Soviet leadership in recent years gives some cause to believe that the Baltic states will not be treated in the 1990s as the Ukraine was in the 1930s, with horrendous loss of life, as Hungary was in the 1950s, when a Western supported, on Radio Free Europe-at least vocally supported-revolt was put down with tanks, and as Czechoslovakia was in 1968. Why then is Lithuania different from East Germany, which will have gone from a garrison State to dismemberment in a period of 12 months?</PARA>
<PARA> It is different in this sense: it is the first republic of the Soviet Union to take advantage of the right enshrined in the Soviet constitution for any nation within the Soviet Union to secede, a right withdrawn after the 11 March Lithuanian independence declaration. As such, it is a new test case for the Soviet leadership. They have stopped to take stock, as they have on all the previous reforms over the last five years, to have a look at the situation and to decide which way to go. All of us in this House hope that they will lunge the right way. The question that the honourable member for Mitchell and I appear to be in disagreement about is how we can help them lunge in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> In early 1990, Lithuanians held free elections in what is one of the richest of the Soviet republics. It also has amongst the fewest ethnic Russian settlers. The winning parties campaigned for independence, quite openly, and the Supreme Council elected during these free elections voted for independence on 11 March by a majority of 127 to nil. It is true that Gorbachev has declared that to be illegal. It is also true that Moscow has imposed a partial blockade. However, we should bear in mind that, by the historical standards of Soviet behaviour, these are both very minor reprisals. They have to be put in the context that when confronted with the possibility of the dissolution of the East German state last year-which was a similar test case, but now one that has been passed-Gorbachev was reported to have said that if he allowed the dissolution of the East German state and German reunification, he would be replaced by a marshal in the Kremlin. I have little doubt that the same kind of re-evaluation and argumentation is taking place in the Kremlin now. </PARA>
<PARA> The question arises: what should this House do? I agree entirely that we should caution the Soviet Union to use conciliation and not to use force in its dealings with Lithuania. We should aspire to the eventual establishment of diplomatic relations with an independent, democratic Lithuanian state. Since this motion proposes no strict timetable for the evolution of these events, I support its intent. </PARA>
<PARA> I differ from the honourable senator for Mitchell in a couple of other respects. In the world of practical diplomacy, it is often unwise for a medium power to act unilaterally in a region far from its shores. It is often easy; but it may be unwise. It may be also unwise for any ally to take precipitate action on the dawn on a superpower summit at which this issue is clearly going to receive some attention. The United States has wisely adopted the reverse posture of its ill-fated diplomacy of 1956 over Hungary. The United States is now talking softly and carrying a big stick. These messages are critical. In 1956, the West encouraged a revolt in Hungary it could not and did not support. The United States is not talking about winning the cold war but is soberly going about the business of making the new peace. It is a lead that deserves followers. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the sentiments of this motion, but I urge that we act in parallel with the United States while the conjuncture of circumstances continues to point to the evolution of an independent Lithuania by the mid-1990s. If these circumstances change, then so might we. At this point we should not overindulge with rhetoric we cannot back up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I second this motion moved by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). I most certainly support the spirit of the motion. I was interested to hear both the speech of the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) and other statements made by the Australian Labor Party over the last year or so in relation to the Baltic states, and in particular in the last three months. It highlights the fact that the Labor Party is at last beginning to change its position on this issue. Obviously, we welcome that change although, as the honourable member for Adelaide has pointed out quite clearly to the House, it has occurred with some reluctance and with a good degree of reticence. The approach of the Labor Party to the understandable aspirations of the Baltic states to re-obtain their freedom is an approach of going softly. That is not the view of this side of the House; but all I can say is that we welcome the change of heart of the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, like every other member of the House, have been pleased to observe the very substantial developments that have taken place in the Soviet Union in recent years. I note-I know the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) will be the first to agree with this-that it is no longer appropriate for Australia to describe the Soviet Union as the `evil empire'. It is important that we continue to encourage the process of political and economic reform as initiated by President Gorbachev. I believe that that is a process which will never be turned back. The Soviet Union is now chartering that course and, regardless of future positions of personalities in that country, that course will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in this context it is disappointing to observe the attitude of the Soviet administration towards the renewed plea for freedom from the Baltic republics. As the honourable member for Mitchell has pointed out, we on this side of the House-we differentiate ourselves from our political opponents here-have always deplored the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union. The history of Lithuania, as one of the three Baltic states, stands as an excellent illustration of how we view this. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1920, the Lithuanian Government signed a peace treaty with the Soviet Union-a peace treaty which was initiated by Lenin himself-in which the Soviet renounced all territorial claims against Lithuania. It was in 1939, when the Soviet Union did its dirty deal with the Nazis in the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, that this commitment that had been made by the so-called hero of the Soviet Union, Lenin, was simply repudiated out of the worst kind and the most immoral kind of political expediency. Consequently, in June 1940 a Soviet puppet government was established in Lithuania and that country then proceeded to go through, as did Estonia and Latvia, 50 years of oppression. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the Liberal and National parties have never recognised these actions by the Soviet Union. It was a matter of great shame for the Australian people when the Labor Government in 1974 decided that it would recognise the incorporation of the Baltic republics into the Soviet Union. It is a matter of great pride on this side of the House that the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, reversed that recognition as one of the first acts of the Fraser Government early in 1976. This is something that I am sure the Baltic states communities in Australia, as well as people concerned about the issue around the world, will not quickly forget. </PARA>
<PARA> The people in the Baltic states have lived for 50 years under oppression from Moscow. It is worth pointing out that it is alleged in that period some 300,000 Lithuanians were either killed or deported to some parts of the Soviet Union. The Soviets have also done what they can to try and Russianise the Baltic states by bringing in populations from Russia to replace those who have been deported. Therefore, it was with that as a background a very exciting thing for all Australians who have continually been concerned about this issue-not just during periods of expediency, but continually have been concerned about this issue-to observe in February and March this year the elections that took place in Lithuania, where three-quarters of the seats in the Lithuanian Parliament were won by supporters of the independence movement.</PARA>
<PARA> The new parliament-the Supreme Council of the Republic-subsequently passed a declaration of independence by 127 votes to nil, with only six abstentions. So even those members of the Supreme Council who were, in principle, supporters of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were not prepared to vote against that declaration of independence. It is worth noting that. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual, it was this side of the House that immediately applauded that particular decision of the Lithuanian Parliament. The then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Coalition Parties join with Lithuanian Australians as they celebrate Lithuania's historic declaration of independence. </PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Minister for foreign affairs and trade, Senator Hill, said on 12 March in Adelaide:</PARA>
<PARA> Today's declaration of independence by the Parliament of Lithuania marks an end to over 50 years of political subordination. The Coalition welcomes today's announcement and is happy to re-affirm its support for an independent Lithuania. </PARA>
<PARA>We did not get such strident and strong statements from members of the Labor Party because, as we know, they have always been a little reticent about this issue, but we certainly did on this side of the House and we are proud of the strong support that we gave to that declaration of independence by Lithuania. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well known that the Soviet Constitution allows for the independence of republics. It allows for what they would describe as the secession of republics. Article 72 of the Soviet Constitution provides for that right. It was a concern to many of us that the Congress of People's Deputies decided, after the declaration by the Lithuanian Parliament, that it would change the rules of secession to provide that the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union would have to agree to that secession with a two-thirds majority. Of course, that Congress, as anybody who understands the Soviet Union is well aware, is dominated by the Russians. So that consequently has made the principle quite clear as far as President Gorbachev and the administration of the Soviet Union are concerned-that republics are allowed to secede, but that in practice they have created circumstances where that secession is almost impossible to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion also condemns the Soviet blockade against Lithuania. Again, that is something which we on this side of the House have done very enthusiastically as well. It is important that the Australian nation recognise that the Liberal Party and the National Party condemn in the strongest of tones the simple fact that the Soviet Union has decided to introduce sanctions against a republic which has declared independence. It does one thing. It is a concession by the Soviet administration that, effectively, Lithuania is now an independent state. The whole concept of introducing sanctions against one part of one's own country clearly makes no sense whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union and President Gorbachev will win the respect of the world if they allow for the independence of the Baltic republics. I conclude by reminding the House of what the Economist magazine on 21 April said:</PARA>
<PARA>For all the admirable things he has done, Mr Gorbachev does not deserve the West's support at any price. Nor will allowing the hardliners to win on Lithuania help him defeat them on equally tricky political and economic reforms. Mr Gorbachev has won respect as a promoter of change. He loses it when he becomes a blocker of change. One day Lithuania will get its freedom-</PARA>
<PARA>so will Estonia and Latvia-</PARA>
<PARA> Better to hand it over amicably sooner than to relinquish it bitterly later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House commends the Government for its support of Community Legal Services and urges that further funding be allocated to this cost effective method of providing legal services to the community. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to the motion, I should indicate that shortly there will be a meeting between the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and representatives of community legal services touching upon the future funding of those organisations and their relationship within the overall legal aid system. So it is very appropriate that at this time I have the opportunity to draw to the House's attention the very effective and cost effective way in which community legal services operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Effectively, they are the third arm of Australia's legal aid system. They complement the services provided by the legal aid commissions and the private profession and can be characterised by their commitment to providing free legal services-mainly through the use of volunteers-seeking reform of defective laws and administrative practices and practising preventative law through community legal education by running workshops and producing publications. As well as that, they broaden community participation in law by encouraging participation and control in the running of the services by community groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the community legal services in fact predates the establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office in the early 1970s. The first community legal service opened in Fitzroy in December 1972 and was closely followed by a centre in Springvale, Victoria, located in the electorate of the present Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). The establishment of the Fitzroy Legal Service was the impetus for a new wave of thinking about the provision of legal services and led in turn to advocacy for a Commonwealth legal aid scheme and the production of what were at the time historic documents, the Fitzroy publications in relation to legal aid. They publicised and promoted to the community knowledge of our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA> Community legal services started with different objectives and a different philosophy from the Australian legal aid organisation. What the community legal services aim to do is to encourage a greater involvement in the law by the people they serve by greater participation in the process and greater self-reliance in solving one's own problems through self-advocacy and a greater knowledge of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members of this House will be aware, as an outcome from that early initiative a large number of alternative dispute settlement options have grown up from the work of community legal groups. The advocacy of community legal centres has led to not only the establishment of the Australian Legal Aid Office and the response at that end-that is the provision of legal services-but also a community response which has led to the establishment of different forms of tribunals to deal with the problems faced by those in the community who are in a position where they have to seek redress, in particular for relatively small matters which, of course, is our fate in the majority of cases. Although we are all aware of the possibility of major litigation occurring if, for example, we are injured in an industrial accident or subjected to some catastrophic event, the sad fact is that most of our disputes will tend to be of a relatively minor nature-disputes with neighbours, bad debt, consumer remedies, problems with debt, and the like. The community legal services have long advocated the establishment of effective community based dispute settlement mechanisms which have now been established in many States through organisations such as the small claims tribunals, consumer affairs tribunals, and also through the Commonwealth administrative law procedure-the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal-all of which have been designed to make relief accessible to the ordinary citizen at a low or minimal cost. </PARA>
<PARA> In legal proceedings before courts, it is always the case that cost is a concern to those who are involved. Community legal services have been able to provide access to self-advocacy skills to a whole range of people who would otherwise be denied legal service. They have also provided occasionally the means of direct representation, although that is by no means the most effective or most important part of the service that community legal services provide. What we have, therefore, is a development of community legal services which in fact meet the needs of community groups and individuals by a unique combination of advice and referral, or, indeed, direct representation. </PARA>
<PARA> Community legal services do not limit their activities to those direct representational roles. Probably the most important role they have is in relation to legal education. They have sponsored a wide network of publications which are designed to popularise the law and make it available and accessible to all within the community. Probably a common complaint about the legal system is that it is isolated from the ordinary public and that many in the community are not aware of their legal rights, and when it comes to enforcing what remedies may exist the ignorance in relation to those procedural questions is even more profound. It is not the ordinary citizen who is best able in those circumstances to protect his own self-interest. It tends to be the large corporations, the supermarkets, governments or large business concerns which are able to retain firms of lawyers ready to respond to their needs and to act effectively in their interests. Arranged against those more powerful interests the individual often finds himself or herself in a situation of powerlessness. </PARA>
<PARA> The community legal services mechanisms, by their law handbooks and publications which have identified citizens' rights and provided a clear and accessible set of explanations to members of the public as to how they can avail themselves of those legal rights, have been made more familiar and accessible, and a far extended range of people within the community have been able to have some effective redress for their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Community legal services are the only part of the legal aid system which pursues what we might call a pro-active model of service delivery which looks beyond the limitations of individual case work. To limit legal aid services to traditional legal representation fails to address the broader economic, social and political inequalities which create and perpetuate many of society's injustices and hardships. </PARA>
<PARA> In focusing on community legal services it is appropriate to note that their performance has recently been the subject of a national review. The national review is being conducted into the delivery and effectiveness of legal aid throughout the Commonwealth. It is being conducted by the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee. I understand that it is due to present its report to the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, in a relatively short time. I understand-this is from information supplied to me-that the outcome of this review will be to again confirm the effectiveness of community legal services and to make the obvious point that they are not only effective in terms of delivery of service but they are a very cost effective way of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently there are approximately 100 community legal services in Australia. They spend just under 3 per cent of the legal aid budget. But their impact in terms of the overall delivery of legal aid throughout this country cannot be underestimated. They provide free a competent, effective service and play an important part in terms of the delivery of legal aid services throughout our community. Commonwealth funding to them for the 1989-90 fiscal year was $2.517m, a 6.87 per cent increase on funding for the previous year. That is less than three per cent of the overall legal aid budget. It is estimated that the community legal services assist over 100,000 clients a year through individual casework and thousands of others are helped through community legal education and other community legal service activities. I certainly believe that when the review goes before the Ministers for justice shortly it is important to reflect on that important role and for this Parliament to commend the community legal services for the contribution they have made to the delivery of legal services in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also insert a small personal comment here. My own involvement in legal aid spans two short periods. First, I worked as the principal solicitor for the Aboriginal Legal Service in New South Wales. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Snowdon" NAMEID="IJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for being kind enough to say that. Prior to my taking the job it was held by the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner). It has been seen as an interesting career path for those who have held the position. Certainly my own experience in the work of Aboriginal legal aid in New South Wales was one which has shaped my thinking in relation to the delivery of legal services to the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the Aboriginal legal services are not strictly modelled on the community legal service structure they do have a close working relationship with community legal organisations in the local areas which they serve. I had a very close working relationship with the Redfern community legal service which is responsible for some of the most prolific and important publication initiatives in the area of legal education in this country. As well as the mainstream legal publications, the law handbooks and the like which Redfern has produced, it has also produced a large number of very popular and accessible publications designed to educate young people and people who would not otherwise be responsive to the ordinary, somewhat turgid, legal publications by the use of comics and other highly visible legal education materials. In that way it has been largely responsible for a growth in the understanding of legal rights and responsibilities amongst many young people and also the spread of consumer awareness and knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Redfern has published manuals about what to do if one is involved in a motor vehicle accident. It has published manuals about what to do if one is affected in one's role as a consumer, whether one might have bought a car which is defective or has been subject to some problems in relation to shoddy goods. Those are very important but simply written publications which expand the community's understanding of and effectiveness in utilising legal rights. </PARA>
<PARA> After my period with the Aboriginal Legal Service I worked for a short time as the legal officer for the Hobart community legal service. It is a relatively small service on the national scale but size is not really a mark of effectiveness. Through a network of over 45 volunteer lawyers and an equal number of community workers and law students the centre has generated an effective legal advice service for two evenings a week, seeing well over 1,000 clients annually. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the important point about the voluntary participation of lawyers and community representatives. That is really the strength and backbone of this network. It is something that is very important and is why the service is delivered so cost effectively. The success of the service lies in the ability of a small number of paid employees to generate a much greater amount of volunteer assistance. I pay proper tribute to the enormous amount of work which has been put into community legal services by the more progressive elements of the private legal profession and, of course, to the many community volunteers. </PARA>
<PARA> The community volunteers are also an important element. Trained lawyers are not the only professional people within our community who have a legitimate interest in demythologising the legal system. The community legal service has a place for lay volunteers, for social workers, for community workers-for non-lawyers to involve themselves in finding the best and most effective answer for a set of problems, which may not be a legal answer in the strict sense; it may not involve court procedures. It may involve negotiations; it may involve counselling; it may involve a whole range of different responses which are more appropriate than proceeding through a court. Through that involvement of community volunteers and community participation in the management of legal services, the community legal services are not only cost effective but also more grassroots in their response to the problems that people have. They are often more effective in providing practical, down to earth and effective advice to those who come to those centres. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks today by noting that the opportunity is now before the House to express a view in relation to the value of community legal services. I hope that when the representatives of the National Association of Community Legal Services meet with the Attorney-General and with the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) next week, they will be able to develop and expand on the points I have made. I am hopeful that the remarks made in the House today will be heeded by both those Ministers in terms of making sure that those community legal services are adequately funded for the work they do in the future. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity of making these remarks. I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not in principle opposed to the tenor of this motion. The Opposition has frequently voiced its support of the legal aid system. However, I note that on 16 May in this House the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) indicated that about $120m in total is spent by the Commonwealth on the provision of legal aid. If we take into account that on top of this amount there is a further considerable contribution by the States of between 40 and 45 per cent of the cost of legal aid, the magnitude of community legal aid financing becomes obvious. I believe it is imperative that, when such considerable sums of public money are being spent, the system operate at maximum efficiency-administration-wise and delivery-wise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over recent years there has been a shift in emphasis from publicly funded private professional legal aid service distribution to community legal service delivery. Whilst in no way detracting from community legal services, I feel it is important to recognise the valuable contribution made by members of the private profession in the administration and delivery of legal aid. I am pleased that I am supported in this regard by the honourable member for Capricornia, who quite rightly indicated to the House-with leave, I will quote directly from Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . if it were not for the early initial actions of the legal profession we would not have had any sort of legal aid system. It was the lawyers who gave of their time and provided their services, one might say on the cheap-certainly cheap in terms of price but not in terms of quality-to assist those people in need. </PARA>
<PARA>I indicate to the House that not only did the early actions of the legal profession greatly contribute to the delivery of legal aid but also that contribution has been maintained and greatly expanded. It is no secret that a large number of members of the legal profession throughout Australia are not only being grossly underpaid for the services they provide on behalf of the respective legal aid commissions, but on numerous occasions are also providing legal services in their offices, without any charge to the Commission. I am sure the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) would appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members may be aware, I was a barrister and solicitor prior to the recent election and I specialised mainly in criminal and family law areas. For want of a better description, I was doing nuts and bolts legal work. That involved a great deal of contact with that section of the community who are either socially or economically disadvantaged. Honourable members of this House would know the large number of people who are presently in that position. </PARA>
<PARA> In the city of Ballarat, the profession maintains a weekly evening free legal service. It is also actively involved in the duty solicitor service at the Ballarat magistrates court. This work is carried out by members of the profession, both willingly and without fuss. I am not able to say whether that situation is the same across Australia. The other free legal services offered by the members of the profession are at the Sebastopol community health centre, the Wendouree community health centre and citizens advice, and they are also actively involved in the community legal service. I hope that honourable members will appreciate that in rural and regional centres there is a sense of community spirit in the profession. That is a community involvement and obligation that is unwritten and, to a large extent, unfunded. </PARA>
<PARA> A large number of community legal services have been set up across Australia, particularly in Victoria. From a Victorian point of view, the most easily recognised would be the Springvale Legal Service. I can describe the service provided at Springvale in only the most glowing terms. Indeed, the manual produced by the service is widely utilised not only by members of the community but also, I suspect, by a large number of members of the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that limited legal aid funds provided by the States and Commonwealth are properly utilised, it is essential that the setting up of community legal centres be motivated by the need for such a service rather than being motivated for other reasons. I believe that the establishment and funding of community legal services should be undertaken only when those services cannot be provided by a community of private members of the profession or where the community demands on such professionals are so great that they are unable to provide a proper service. I have no doubt that in some suburbs of Melbourne, Sydney and, I suspect, Adelaide and elsewhere there is a significant commitment on members of the private profession whereby they simply are not able to meet the demand. In other areas, members of the private profession can certainly meet that demand and are doing so very effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment and funding of community legal services should be undertaken only with a great deal of caution. The rationale for the provision and establishment of community legal centres should not be based on population but rather on the availability or otherwise of proper legal services. That is what this motion is about: the proper provision of legal services to the community. It is a fact of life that the demands of the legal aid dollar far outstrip the availability of that dollar. In light of that indisputable fact, it is imperative that every dollar is very carefully managed. As the honourable member for Capricornia quite rightly indicated to the House on 16 May, there is an abuse of the legal aid system whereby funded actions are pursued for vindictive reasons and not in pursuit of proper justice. I believe we should be very careful to avoid further repetition of that. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also been said in the House that legal aid should be given to the needy, not the greedy. Both I and the Opposition fully agree with that. It is also imperative to ensure that proper decisions are made as to whether a person should or should not be funded. These decisions must be left in the hands of capable and trained professionals. Capable and trained professionals are far better able to judge what is and what is not appropriate for legal aid, as opposed to unqualified and untrained personnel whose motivation no doubt is well placed but whose judgment may be potentially misguided or misplaced. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion may be construed to indicate that community legal service centres are the most cost effective-I emphasise `most cost effective'-method of providing legal services. If, indeed, this is the inference, I seek to take issue with the honourable member in that regard. I do not believe that I am in any way biased when I say that properly organised and community minded private professional groups can provide an equally or even more cost effective service. There must be room for both groups to provide legal aid delivery. It would be a sad day when one was supported to the detriment of the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion does not state what the level of funding should be, and that causes me some concern; nor does it indicate where this extra funding should be directed. If the funding is to be used to strengthen the service provided by existing community legal centres, I have no concerns. If, however, the honourable member proposes a vast expansion with new centres, I caution the House in the terms I have alluded to previously. The establishment and funding of community legal centres must be pursued for the right reasons and must not be motivated by an anti-private profession view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that honourable members realise that the necessity for legal advice is not restricted to normal business hours-my personal experiences and those of my former colleagues support that. I am not being melodramatic when I say that it is not unusual for a private legal practitioner in Ballarat to be woken in the early hours of the morning by someone desperate for advice and, in many cases, desperate for consolation and support. This has happened to me and to many of my colleagues on numerous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of funding constraints, I believe it is unlikely that the community legal centres across Australia would be able to provide this service. I therefore caution the House not to kill the goose that `saves' the golden egg, or, more appropriately perhaps, the golden dollar. It is a matter of great pride to many members of the private profession that they are able to assist the community in many ways. Their motivation for such assistance is compassion, not remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that causes me great concern is the desperate situation presently being faced by the people of Ballarat and people in other centres in my electorate. The reality is that this Government's handling of the economy is such that rural and rural regional centres of Australia are presently suffering a significant economic decline. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) and I went to Maryborough last Wednesday to visit a factory that had previously supported the community. It was empty, the machinery having been moved out. There was an air of desperation throughout the Maryborough community and the streets were empty. It was a very sad visit for me. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to walk into this House-dare I say strut into this House-making inane comments such as, `Everything is on track'. </PARA>

Perhaps it is time that he left his ivory tower and visited centres in the electorates of Ballarat and Bendigo so that he can see for himself what is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My comments may not appear to bear relevance to the matter we are talking about, but they are relevant to the extent that enormous demands are placed on the legal community in Ballarat to provide support and assistance for those great numbers of people who are unemployed and fall into the economically and socially disadvantaged category that I was talking about before.

<PARA> That the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) supports an independent and free Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns the Soviet Union for its campaign of intimidation specifically against Lithuania;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) calls on the Soviet authorities to abandon its blockade of vital raw materials to Lithuania and to allow the immediate resumption of oil, gas, food and medical supplies;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) calls on the Soviet Union to accept the declarations of independence by the Baltic Republics and to facilitate a peaceful transition to their full autonomy; and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) calls on the Australian Government to ensure that the Australian people's support for the people of the Baltic Republics is heard in Moscow. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, it is pertinent that the House consider this motion at this time because it is a matter of very considerable moment that these three formerly independent republics, incorporated as they were into the Soviet Union, are moving to a situation in which they may once again, in reality, be independent nations. But it is not a path that is easy; it is not a path without very considerable difficulty for the people of the Baltic states; and it is one on which the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States of America is very much predicated. </PARA>
<PARA> At this very time the President of the United States of America, George Bush, is about to meet with the President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the position of Lithuania and the other Baltic states is a matter that will be on the agenda for those discussions. We know from news reports that President Bush has said that he will tell the Soviet President that the Soviet Union's crackdown on Lithuania, in particular, makes it politically difficult for him as President of the United States to follow through on his offer of trade benefits and other economic assistance to the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a concern, I believe, amongst a number of people in the Baltic states and their supporters in countries such as Australia that the United States was putting greater emphasis upon improved relations with the Soviet Union and less upon the claims that the Baltic people have for independence. I think that, in that sense, the fact that he is raising these matters is an advance, and a very useful advance. </PARA>
<PARA> The President has said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is one (issue) that is troubling that I don't want to sweep under the rug, and that is the question of the Baltic states and the difficulties with Lithuania. I have to have him-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Gorbachev-</PARA>
<PARA>understand the constraints on any US President until self-determination is visible and forthcoming there. </PARA>
<PARA>So, that is a very important and pressing matter and it will be raised in those discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure that honourable members always readily appreciate the historical background in relation to the incorporation of Lithuania and the other Baltic states into the Soviet Union. In a sense, I think, we very often saw over time the refugees who settled amongst us as extremists, as people who were not really reflecting the views of their compatriots in the countries from which they fled in the 1940s. I find it fascinating, I must say, to look at the way in which these matters are developing and how the views that are held amongst people in Australia from the Baltic states are now coming through with clarity in the Soviet Union itself. </PARA>
<PARA> For a long time the very basis upon which the fate of these nations was determined was not the subject of any widespread discussion or awareness in the Soviet Union. It was largely hidden from view. I think it is appropriate that at this time, more than any other, we give practical support to the peoples of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia lest this opportunity be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go through the historical background. The modern state of Lithuania was created in 1918 with the Declaration of Independence on 16 February 1918 by the Council of Lithuania and the creation of a provisional government. Free and democratic elections were held in April 1920 and the first Lithuanian Parliament of 112 members was then formed. On 12 July 1920 the Lithuanian Government signed a peace treaty with the Soviet Union in which the latter renounced for all time any claims to Lithuanian sovereignty or its territory. The Soviet Union recognised the Republic of Lithuania as a sovereign state, with the capital Vilnius. The treaty was signed by the founder of the Soviet Union, Lenin. Of course, other countries recognised Lithuania and in 1921 it was admitted to the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say, having visited the Soviet Union-Vilnius and the rest of Lithuania in particular-that when I hear of Vilnius as a capital I readily visualise what I saw of its institutions, of the civilisation and of a country that had enormous potential, as so many of the states around the Baltic have demonstrated, but which had been hamstrung economically by its incorporation into a much larger state without the vitality that Lithuania had demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA> Lithuania and her sister states, Latvia and Estonia, enjoyed 22 years of independent statehood, during which time they saw rapid progress in the areas of their economy, education and cultural life. They had in place prudent policies which at that time were followed and their countries prospered. One could see that, as I did, in the way in which those communities had developed. One could see the very high standard of housing. </PARA>
<PARA> One interesting observation was to go past, as I did when I went for my early morning jog around Vilnius, the large number of very big homes, substantial homes. What surprised me when I looked at them was that beside each of them was a large number of letterboxes. What had actually happened was that over time those substantial premises had been subdivided, turned into tenements, and they generally demonstrated the lower standard of living that is now available within that state than that which was enjoyed at the time they had independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The fate of Lithuania and the other Baltic states was sealed with the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The pact divided east Europe between the Nazi and Soviet spheres of influence. Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, the Baltic states, were assigned to the Soviet Union in the infamous secret protocols which were attached to that pact. Of course, each of those countries was initially forced to accept Russian military bases on its soil. When that was completed in 1940, we had governments which then responded to Soviet invitations to join the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> The international community condemned those actions and did not recognise those governments or the legality of that incorporation. That has been the position of the Opposition in Australia. The incorporation of those states has been a matter which over time has been the subject of some discussion and controversy here. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 50 years of Soviet occupation the economies of each of those countries went into decline, large numbers of people were either killed or assigned to labour camps in various parts of the Soviet Union and a large number perished in Siberia in particular. We had a situation in which many people left those states over concern at the way in which the incorporation proceeded to change each of those countries culturally and otherwise. We have also seen very serious damage to the environments of those states and claims for compensation are raised from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been interesting that this year, for the first time, we have seen free elections in those countries. Lithuania in particular elected a supreme parliament of the republic. Candidates endorsed by the popular grassroots movements, the SaJudis, won over three-quarters of the 141 seats in the parliament. The main plank of that party was the restoration of Lithuania's independence, and that has been repeatedly stated by its candidates. We had then, after debate in the first session of the new parliament, the declaration of restoration of independence to the Republic of Lithuania being adopted by 127 votes to nil, with six abstentions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in that context that we now have the reaction of the Soviet Union to those claims for independence. It has been of considerable alarm to me and my colleagues that the Soviet Union has not responded positively to that quest. In fact, the claims have been rejected by the Soviets and the Soviets are seeking to have the declaration of independence overturned by the Government of Lithuania and each of the other states. The Soviets are also seeking to have them negotiate a form of plebiscite at a later point in time. It is doubtful that the majority that the Soviets want to see obtained in that regard would be obtained because they are claiming that very large majorities have to be obtained for those matters to be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have read through the news reports of late, what has been of considerable concern to me has been the effect that the steps that are being taken by the Soviet Government is having in the Baltic states. The effect is very considerable. We have had a situation already in which heavily armed paratroopers have occupied a number of public buildings; there have been significant military parades through the streets of the major cities; we have had young people who have refused military service in the Soviet army being taken away; and we have had a situation in which there has been the imposition of an economic blockade. With the exception of some natural gas-16 per cent of the requirements-no raw materials or any other goods supplied by the Soviet Union are entering the Baltic state of Lithuania at this time. Factories are closing down because of lack of fuel and raw materials. Fuel, food and other essential supplies are strictly rationed. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a matter of very considerable concern. I was in Lithuania in the middle of summer and hot water was not available in the hotels. Hot water generally has to be supplied through a common system available to the whole community. Of course, at times other than the middle of summer it would be much more difficult and would impose very considerable hardship upon the peoples of Lithuania and each of the other Baltic states if those supplies were not readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a form of coercion which ought to be resisted. It is not a matter which can be left without international penalty against these steps being taken by the Soviet Union at this time. It is important that this Parliament call upon the Soviet authorities to abandon their blockade of the supply of vital raw materials. It is important that this Parliament demonstrate and accept the declarations of independence by each of those Baltic republics. I think it is appropriate that this motion be passed and the Government ensure that the support of the Australian people is heard in Moscow, is heard in the Soviet Union, so that there is a clear understanding that the people of the Baltic republics are not at this time seen to be on their own and without significant international support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this grievance debate I would like to bring the attention of the House to an issue that is currently of great concern to Australia; that is, the immigration policy of the Hawke Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a time in this country when any critical remark on immigration had one immediately labelled as a racist; but, thanks to Senator Peter Walsh and the recent article he wrote for the Australian Financial Review, this is no longer the case. Australia generally accepts the need for an intelligent and informed debate on this vital area of public policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that the needs and aspirations of Australians are in fact being ignored by the Hawke Labor Government, and its immigration policy is in a shambles. The Saulwick poll published in the  Age on Monday, 14 May of this year gives some indication as to the current community concerns about Government policy. The survey highlighted the fact that 46 per cent of Australians believe the current intake of 140,000 per annum is too high, and 19 per cent want no new migrants at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this public concern, we have the situation in which the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who is also Chairman of the Federal Labor Caucus committee on immigration, is calling for an even bigger intake. He suggests that the figure should eventually grow to as high as 170,000 migrants per annum. The honourable member for Calwell apparently bases his call on yet to be released economic statements that he claims show the economic benefit of migration, and his feeling that if Australia had not had the benefit of migration for the last 30 or 40 years it would be an insular, tiny country with a mono-culture and a weak economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not had the privilege of seeing these reports, and I would certainly not dispute the view of the honourable member for Calwell, of the benefits of elements of our previous immigration policy. What I am disputing is where we need to go in terms of policy direction in the future. I might add that, whilst not doubting the accuracy of the Saulwick poll, I will be undertaking an extensive telephone survey on this issue and related immigration issues in my electorate of Deakin in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other aspects of this Labor Government's immigration policy which are patently out of step with community feeling. Furthermore, these aspects of immigration policy out of step with community aspirations are imposing significant problems and costs upon our society. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer, first, to the business migration program-BMP for short-which was introduced to attract migrants with successful business skills, experience and financial backing. The scheme has had problems since it commenced and, despite recent minor tinkering, these problems continue today. </PARA>
<PARA> As recently as last Sunday the prestigious Melbourne newspaper Sunday Herald published a fairly detailed story alleging there are a number of companies and individuals in Taiwan submitting fraudulent applications under the BMP scheme, and these applications are being accepted. The Director of Immigration Intelligence, Mr Peter Sealey, has said he will begin an immediate investigation after he sees the relevant documentation. I suggest the Director also speak to any responsible Australian banker who handles the funds these migrants are meant to invest. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure the Director will find, as I have, that those funds which are not used in property speculation are often returned to their country of origin as soon as the migration formalities are completed. </PARA>
<PARA> It also has to be pointedly asked: Whilst the Government boasts the BMP scheme brings in $1.5 billion a year, how much money is actually used to create jobs? I am pleased to see, I might say, that my earlier warnings about BMP rorts are finally having an effect, with the Intelligence Director now admitting that some of the BMP agents being used have been less than scrupulous. </PARA>
<PARA> The BMP scheme is not the only scheme being rorted. The English language intensive courses for overseas students scheme-the ELICOS scheme-which was introduced in 1986, has been a continuing problem since the day it started. Indicative of this is the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (DILGEA) joke that the acronym ELICOS would more appropriately stand for `English language students intending change of status scheme'. </PARA>
<PARA> DILGEA has advised that in 1989, 27 per cent of ELICOS students overstayed their visas to become illegal migrants, compared with only 8 per cent of ordinary visitors to this country. In addition, DILGEA has advised that it is very hard to find these ELICOS students once they decide to become illegal migrants because of the breakdown in communications between the various coordinating bodies; that is, the Department of Education, Employment and Training, the overseas student offices and the various DILGEA State offices. The clever ELICOS student, I am told, can delay becoming an illegal migrant for some time simply by applying for a further visa on the ground that he or she is not yet fluent in English. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the pressing issue of illegal immigration. The Hawke Labor Government claimed in January of this year that there were only 60,000 illegal immigrants in Australia. This understates the real and alarming figure, for the Department only counts as overstayers those who remain in Australia for three months longer than their visa allows. DILGEA's latest unpublished and internal figure for overstayers or illegals is 119,900. I should also point out that this figure only includes those people who actually submitted paperwork on their arrival, and tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government in recent time has amended the regulations relating to illegal migrants. However, this may be aimed not at tightening them up, as the community would reasonably expect, but at relaxing them, much to the pleasure of some ethnic lobby groups. These are the groups Senator Walsh would deservedly blame for the blow-out and cave-in sequence that characterises the immigration policy of latter years. For instance, illegal migrants who have been caught by DILGEA now have an extra five days to apply for an entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA> In another problem area, Australia will shortly be faced with the problem of a further armada of boat people-this time mainly from Cambodia. These people are now paying, according to the Melbourne Age of 24 April of this year, up to $5,000 for a ride to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Our northern neighbours have adopted an interesting, to say the least, response to this armada. The Malaysian Government simply helps them on their way. A report in a respected Asian newspaper, the Straits Times, of 3 May last states that the Malaysians have pushed away 47 boats carrying 2,268 people since the second half of February 1990. The report says that this brought the total number of boat people rejected to 6,067 since May of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Indonesian Government, according to its Foreign Minister, Mr Ali Alatas, remains committed to helping these people. Nevertheless, it would seem that some of the bureaucracy there is more intent on providing them with maps and helping them to leave. </PARA>
<PARA> Once these people reach Australia they can expect to be deported, but only after a long and expensive stay, as the present policy usually allows for an appeal process which can take up to six months to exhaust. It is estimated that it costs the Australian taxpayer $150 per day to keep an illegal immigrant in detention, and I have not included the cost of the legal aid provided to help these people to stay in Australia. If these people remain in custody for six months, they will cost the taxpayer $17,000 per person. Some, of course, remain in custody longer than six months. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem I would like to highlight is a problem emerging in New Zealand which has consequences for Australia. New Zealand is currently an easier entry port for migrants from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia. In 1989 New Zealand accepted 55,755 migrants from Asia. The authorities there have found in the last 18 months that some of these migrants are in fact members of the notorious Triad criminal groups. As the law stands in New Zealand at the moment, the only police checking conducted for citizenship is a check of local records and, if those records show a no trace, no checks are conducted in the migrant's country of birth. Once equipped with a New Zealand passport, our laws provide no substantial barrier to migration to Australia. Organised crime will exploit this weakness in our immigration policy. I am told that it is already aware of it and has made use of it. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, we have a situation in which the Australian people want a more manageable immigration program and the Hawke Government, under pressure from the ethnic lobby, simply wants more migrants of any category. Furthermore, a number of the immigration schemes introduced by the Hawke Labor Government are being blatantly rorted. This is a fact the Australian public is well aware of. Yet the Government, under pressure from the ethnic lobby, is relaxing the regulations necessary to stop these rorts. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I return to the Age Saulwick poll. The survey found that a solid 62 per cent of respondents wanted as migrants those people with skills that would benefit this country. I believe that if we built our immigration policy around this category of immigrants we would have a more productive, stronger and cohesive nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to use my time in this grievance debate to express concern at the tide of the current debate in relation to the issue of alcohol abuse in central Australia. My speech in this House on this matter has been prompted by a press release put out yesterday by the Northern Territory Chief Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The focus of the current debate is the very obvious behaviour of drinkers in and around Alice Springs. As a resident of Alice Springs, as a citizen of the Northern Territory, it is a subject in which I have a great deal of interest. The behaviour of many of the people who are visible drinkers in Alice Springs has been the cause of concern for all sections of the Alice Springs community. Indeed, it is an issue which is subject to discussion right throughout the Northern Territory. However, it is important not to accept the typecasting that has been portrayed of Aboriginal people, who are the most visible people in the community in relation to alcohol consumption, because of the aberrant behaviour of a very small minority. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there have been times when individuals and groups in the community have used the issue as a mechanism to attack Aboriginal people. That is a matter which causes me a great deal of concern and, at times, anger. It needs to be made very clear that alcohol consumption amongst Aboriginal people is generally less than it is for the non-Aboriginal population-a fact not widely recognised nor widely publicised. There are, proportionally, far fewer Aboriginal drinkers within the Aboriginal community than non-Aboriginal drinkers within the non-Aboriginal community. Aboriginal people recognise that the behaviour of this small minority of their number-those people who imbibe regularly and, in fact, overindulge and behave in an aberrant way-is unacceptable not only in their eyes but in the eyes of the whole community. But the situation needs to be put in context. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal people have responded by proposing solutions which generally have gone unheeded and which at times have been ridiculed by the Northern Territory Government. Recently the Northern Territory Government's Chief Minister, Marshall Perron, decided to participate in a public meeting in Alice Springs around this issue. It was attended, I might say, by the shadow Minister. After that meeting, the Chief Minister proposed a number of solutions which, by and large, demonstrated his and his Government's complete incapacity to understand or address the issues involved. Rather, they chose on the whole to blame the victim. </PARA>
<PARA> He also used this public meeting as an opportunity to give a number of very responsible Aboriginal organisations in and around central Australia and leading Aboriginal individuals a belt around the ears in a way which, to my mind, demeaned his position as the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and, indeed, showed that he had no real comprehension of the wide-ranging and representative nature of these organisations and the very responsible role they play within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, he attacked the role of Tangentyere Council. I have spoken in the previous Parliament about Tangentyere Council and its role in and around Alice Springs. Mr Deputy Speaker, if, in your new role as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, you visited Alice Springs in the near future, I would be pleased to take you around and show you these organisations and introduce you to those people who run them. You will see very quickly, in a very short space of time, how responsible they are and what valuable public services they fulfil. These community councils-Tangentyere perhaps prime amongst them-have been expressing their concern about alcohol consumption amongst a small portion of the Aboriginal community in central Australia for a number of years. Indeed, they have been putting solutions on a regular basis to the Northern Territory Government, but on almost every occasion these proposals have been ridiculed; they have certainly not been accepted. The combined Aboriginal organisations of Alice Springs, of which Tangentyere forms a part, put up proposals recently which included setting up social clubs to control drinking, which would provide for a range of organised activities to move the focus beyond just drinking. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Government has recently approved a lease for one social club. Tangentyere has agreed that additional leases are necessary to cater for different tribal groups. Secondly, it has argued for the provision of transient camps for people coming into town so they do not contribute to overcrowding in the camps. Thirdly, it has suggested the establishment of proper Aboriginal controlled counselling and rehabilitation services. </PARA>
<PARA> Only one of the ideas of the social clubs has been taken up by the Northern Territory Government. The others have been pooh-poohed by the Northern Territory Chief Minister and his ministerial colleagues. That is a matter of grave concern. The one positive response to come from the Northern Territory Government has been to accept, at last, the need to consider reducing hours for takeaway liquor outlets and fostering the development of the very successful neighbourhood watch program. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Chief Minister's other proposals are potentially dangerous and, in the end, possibly very divisive. He is arguing for tighter legislation to enforce the existing two kilometre law whereby police have the authority to confiscate all liquor in the possession of a person consuming liquor in a public place. This legislation was introduced in the first instance to try to remove from the public gaze Aboriginal people who have no other place to drink but in public places. The proposition put forward at the time was that if this law were enforced it would remove Aboriginal people from the central business district and away from the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that whilst this debate has been taking place and whilst allegations are being made about the behaviour of Aboriginal people in and around Alice Springs, and particularly in the central business district around the Todd Mall, which is a focus of a lot of public attention-and it is a place which I will be happy to show you, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you visit Alice Springs-alcohol related complaints made to the police by the mall traders, who are the people with the most interest in how people behave themselves in public places in that area, have comprised only 5 per cent of the total complaints. I am not sure that that indicates that alcohol consumption is not a grave problem in Alice Springs. But what I do think this statistic, if it is correct, does indicate is that whilst the consumption of alcohol by some people is important, in terms of the priorities of those people who work in the mall-that is, the Todd Mall traders-it is not the key issue in terms of public behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chief Minister has approached the Federal Government with the proposition that all Department of Social Security recipients be compelled to collect their cheques in one place. I have some grave concern about that proposition because it ignores a number things. We should consider whether the public interest argument should be applied not only to Aboriginal people but also to the wider Australian community. Mr Deputy Speaker, at the beginning of my remarks I drew your attention to the fact that a larger proportion of non-Aboriginal people drink than do Aboriginal people. Although a significant proportion of the non-Aboriginal population are also Social Security recipients and perhaps, dare I say, also drinkers, he has directed his argument at Aboriginal people. He has not said that this matter should be canvassed throughout the community. He has not said that a social security recipient who happens to move from one town to another should be stopped from collecting a cheque because he or she drinks in a hotel. He has not asserted that. But he has asserted that Aboriginal people in central Australia should not be given any assistance in terms of collecting their cheque unless they live in a home community. That is a proposition which I am afraid I cannot accept. </PARA>
<PARA> This also demonstrates the Northern Territory Government's lack of awareness of the present social security arrangements. This Government has already put in place a split cheque arrangement which is primarily aimed at protecting families in these sorts of circumstances. There is a capacity already to issue split cheques where one of the spouses-the breadwinner, if you like, or the person who is the nominee for the receipt of cheques in a family unit-is irresponsible or does not live at home. This is to ensure that the other spouse and the children are adequately catered for in terms of social security arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> That, I think, portrays and demonstrates what this tactic is all about. It is not about addressing the issue of Aboriginal alcohol consumption, the problems of unemployment in Aboriginal communities and the other range of social problems that confront Aboriginal people. It is about blaming the victims and putting them out of the public gaze-putting them back into their home communities and perhaps creating public disruption. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, time has just about run out and I will have to sit down. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend you to read this information and the debates which will ensue in the Northern Territory Parliament. I would ask you to take an interest in this subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am extremely pleased to speak in the Grievance Debate. I will do what I usually do-I will talk about Tasmania because that is where I come from and that is where the electorate that I represent is situated. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of my former colleague and my good friend, the former member for Denison, Mr Michael Hodgman, who was also the Minister for the Capital Territory. I am sorry that there will be no fireworks today, Michael, but I will do my best to project what I believe is an immense problem in the electorate of Franklin. I think it is indicative of the situation all over Australia that we have a crisis with our elderly in Franklin. I think we should be doing more, all of us, as politicians, about this problem. Forget about the politics-let us get involved in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People have contacted me on many occasions during my 14 years as a parliamentarian seeking my help to get their elderly mother or father into a nursing home. I have always gone through the normal procedures-leaving it to the assessment committee to determine where that person should be placed-in the hope that everything would be done according to merits of the case. But, regrettably, I have found, of late, that a person either has to have a few bob extra or be a Catholic or a Mason in order to get into a home. I do not like that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> My attention has recently been drawn to the case of a 93-year-old lady who unfortunately broke her hip. She was placed in the Royal Hobart Hospital. Although she is receiving the best of care in this very good hospital, I wanted her placed in a nursing home where her children could visit her and take her for a walk in the garden-a place where she would have the decent amenities of life that are due to her as a woman who has worked hard most of her life. But, regrettably, she has been in the Royal Hobart Hospital for four months. </PARA>
<PARA> During that time I continually approached the assessment committee. I kept asking, `What are you doing about it?'. The committee kept telling me that there were no nursing home beds. And, of course, we in the political arena have to believe what we are told because we cannot do everything ourselves. I received a lot of calls after a radio program in Hobart during which I really jumped into the fire and said that I was very unhappy about the situation and that I wanted to find out exactly what was happening in Hobart in relation to nursing home beds. The situation is the same in every electorate in Australia, incidentally. </PARA>
<PARA> I received a lot of anonymous phone calls-a lot of calls from people involved in health. I thought, `I will check up on a lot of these matters', and I did. I looked very carefully into the nursing home bed structure in Hobart. To my bewilderment I found that there were 46 nursing beds vacant at St John's Park hospital, which is the largest nursing home in Tasmania. I tried to ask why this elderly 93-year-old woman was in an acute hospital bed when she could have been placed in that nursing home. The answers that I got were not satisfactory. The answers that I got from the Minister in Tasmania were not satisfactory either. I do not think he was aware of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> I checked very carefully into St John's Park and I found that the lack of morale down there is absolutely terrible. There are too many chiefs but not enough Indians-not enough people doing the dirty work; not enough people doing the lifting; and not enough people doing the cleaning up. There is an acute concentration on what is called `career structure'. The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), who is a doctor, would understand what I mean about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that we have to have trained professional people to look after the sick and needy in Australia. But we have gone overboard. We are forgetting that people who are elderly need all the help and attention that can be given to them. They need to be lifted, they need to be cleaned up, they need to be kept alive and they need to be kept happy in their environment. But I think St John's Park has completely gone off the track. It seems to have been advised by people who seem to think that one needs about 10 certificates to be a good nurse. That, regrettably, is the direction that St John's Park has followed. </PARA>
<PARA> I also found that about 85 per cent of the $16.5m dollars that is spent on St John's Park each year is going into salaries. I believe also that on a pro rata basis it is the highest cost nursing home in Australia. I do not think it is doing the job that it should be doing. I cannot understand why, when 46 nursing beds have been kept vacant since December of last year, it cannot take a 93 year-old-woman, plus others, who are wanting beds. I am only talking about the ones that we know about. There are many lonely, elderly people out there without sons and daughters, without any politician to go to, who are looking for help and attention in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> We know all about hostel accommodation. We know that the concentration is on hostel accommodation. We know that it is argued that people should be looked after at home. But somebody has to do that. There is an acute shortage of people to go into homes to help these elderly people. I think as politicians we should address this matter very carefully. We have a growing elderly population in Australia and I do not think that we are doing enough about caring for them. There seems to be a hell of a lot of talking and a lot of cover up in terms of the amount of funds that we direct into this area. But when we get down to the nitty-gritty, such as the example that I have quoted, we start to realise that there are problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in Tasmania should have a good look at St John's Park because it is symbolic and systematic of the problems all over Australia. This nursing home, which is funded by the Government to the extent of $13.5m, and other nursing homes should be looked at very carefully if we are going to give our elderly the best care and attention that is humanly possible. Somebody has got to do the work. </PARA>
<PARA> The other complaint that I have concerns an interview in respect of the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd which was shown on the Jana Wendt program the other night. I thought to myself that we cannot have it both ways: we want to employ people in Australia but we are not prepared to talk about the cost of exporting cars. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been talking to a person in Tasmania who has done extremely well. This man, who last year received the Australian Small Business of the Year award from the Treasurer (Mr Keating), manufactures winches and windlasses in Australia and exports them to countries like America and Sweden. He competes against the Taiwanese and everybody else who can make cheap winches. He makes a quality product. The only way that he can put them on the market in America is by receiving an export award. I will read a letter he wrote to me because it expresses exactly the point that I am making. In his letter, he is saying, `If you want me to stay in business, if you want me to employ Tasmanians, if you want to get the economy right, well listen to me and you will understand what I am about'. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to express concern about proposed changes to the Federal Government's Export Market Development Scheme and to outline how these changes would affect Muir Engineering. </PARA>
<PARA> As you may be aware Muir Engineering produces Winches and Windlasses for markets in Australia and Argentine, Austria, Bahrain, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Greece, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Noumea, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA>Not bad for a small Tasmanian company. Who said Tasmanians cannot do it? They can do everything. They can even produce good politicians like me and the previous honourable member for Denison. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 8 years participation in the Export Market Scheme has been a critical factor in our export operation. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Federal Government changes the Scheme in line with recommendations arising from a recent review by the Hughes Committee, our company will be forced to wind back its export activity and the production levels needed to sustain it. </PARA>
<PARA> We will have to reduce our export promotion activities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This young Mr Muir goes all over the world selling quality products. The components are manufactured in Tasmania. The winch that he puts together is comparable with any winch in the world. His letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The specific Hughes Committee recommendations opposed by Muir Engineering and other exporters represented by the Australian Export Action Committee, include:</PARA>
<PARA> Cutting of the grant role from 70 per cent to only 50 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> Raising the entry threshold of expenditure from $10,000 to $50,000;</PARA>
<PARA> Excluding companies who have received eight grants. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Federal Government will look at this matter very carefully. Muir Engineering is a good firm with a good product. It is employing Tasmanians at a time when, after being cut back by $440m by the Hawke Government, Tasmania is in strife. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say to the former member for Denison, who is in the gallery today, that his flamboyance and histrionics are missed. He provided us with some light entertainment but we do not miss his hyperbole. One morning a week or two ago I had occasion to listen to talk-back radio in Western Australia. As is the way with such programs, I listened to an endless number of anecdotes from various people who were concerned about health policy and, indeed, the structure of our health care system in this country-anecdotes criticising the Government for being uncaring, public servants for being lazy, politicians for not listening and local councils and administrators for fiddling. Indeed, the people who spoke felt that someone else had got a better deal than they had. I understand this is part of our democratic process; and perhaps it is a very important part. But rarely does one find that such debates on talk-back radio are particularly balanced and rarely, of course, do the people who are involved have to deal with particular problems and face up to the difficulties that governments face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That morning on the Des Guilfoyle show concern was expressed about waiting lists and the cost of treatment for those with insurance and without insurance. Indeed, there was some debate about alternative medicine and speculation about particular treatments that had been available in the Perth area. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of comments could be made but I think some facts need to be taken into account by the population. If there is to be a meaningful debate about health care policy in this country we need to understand some home truths. It is not for the Government to tell everybody that the system is right and fixed and okay. But it is appropriate for it to lay out some of the parameters within which decisions can be made in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have a perfect health care system. There are difficulties in our hospitals and they do not run perfectly. Waiting lists are a cause of concern for many constituents-any member of this place would know that. But as somebody who worked in the hospital system throughout the 1970s I know perfectly well also that waiting lists are not something new. They are part of the efficient running of a hospital system. We cannot afford to have large numbers of hospital beds not being utilised. The occupancy rates in our public hospitals are very high and one of the reasons that they are able to be run efficiently is because there are waiting lists. Nobody who needs emergency treatment or urgent treatment misses out in our country, and we need to understand that. It is a fact that there are problems but the solution of them is not simple, and I will speak about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern about the private hospital system and the fact that it is under-utilised. Indeed, this is one of the wheelbarrows that is being pushed by the Opposition. But even in discussions with the private hospital sector, the two crucial things that affect private hospital beds being used are the cost of those beds-that is, the fees that are charged by the hospitals and the fees that are charged by doctors above and beyond the schedule fee-and doctor convenience. It is more convenient very often for the doctor to put the patient in a public hospital and do his surgery there. So, large numbers of private patients are in public hospitals being treated by private doctors. Those are things that in fact the medical profession can impact on. </PARA>
<PARA> Many doctors would say that the level of the schedule fee does not enable them to live in the lifestyle to which they are accustomed. I am a believer that it is a fair fee. I believe that there are difficulties with a schedule fee-for instance, the amount received by an ophthalmologist for surgery that can be done in 10 minutes is much more substantial than the amount received by a general surgeon performing bowel surgery, which may take much longer and, of course, requires much more after-care. So there are problems with the relativities. But I believe that, in general, the structure is fair. Indeed, some of the problems that exist in private hospitals are a result of exorbitant charging by doctors, and this can have an impact. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that the general health care system is relatively efficient, no-one would disagree that it can be made better. But what the public and people on both sides of this House have to understand is that we have a mixed structure of health care-there is a private component and a public component. The principal component is the public component. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have a better health care system that functions more efficiently, there needs to be more money spent and that money needs to be injected either by the private sector or the public sector. This is a very simple proposition but it is very true. One of the former shadow Ministers for Health, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Wilson Tuckey), came up with a proposal some time ago which had some merit. But the bottom line was that people were going to have to pay more. The public in Australia need to understand that if they want a better system they will have to make a greater contribution, privately or publicly, to that system.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason that the honourable member for O'Connor's proposal hit the fence was that basically it said that the wealthy will have to pay more and the well will have to pay more. That was untenable for the Opposition and, therefore, it failed. There is a belief out there that we can have a better system which can cost us less. That is a logical inconsistency-it is absurd, it is nonsense and it cannot be delivered. The Government understands that; the Opposition understands it but is not willing to say so. I think it is necessary for us to understand that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Other people say, `Well, okay, we will have more private health insurance if the Government provides a rebate. But, again, this is logically inconsistent. A rebate from the Government is public revenue forgone. If the public sector raises less money, the private sector raises more and we are left with the same amount. If we want to improve the system, we have to, as a country and as a government, make a decision to allocate more resources. Individuals have to allocate more resources through the private system or we have to allocate more resources through the public system. There is not a magic pudding out there from which we can draw funds that will improve the system. Indeed, that is something that needs to be understood. </PARA>
<PARA> Continually in this place we hear criticism of the Government for its role in monitoring the extension of health care services and the increase in services. The medical fraternity has an endless agenda of treatments and new therapies that it is continually putting forward. Those treatments are invariably recommended by doctors as being good and worthwhile. It is a reasonable thing for the Government, which is responsible for expenditures on those items, to have some assessment of their efficacy, their effectiveness and whether or not they are appropriate. And, indeed, it would be irresponsible of us if we did not do that. One of the great strengths of our system is that it is universal. But it is also important for us to take note of the fact that it is appropriate for the Government to be looking at new treatments and to be making thorough assessments of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Pharmacy is an issue that reared its head during the Federal election. Indeed, pharmacy and the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is the fastest growing area of health expenditure in this country. It is the fastest growing area in the total health budget. It is appropriate that the Government look at the reasons for that. I believe that there are three possibilities for remedying the position. One is to change the prescribing habits of doctors, and we have envisaged taking this step. Too many patients receive too many drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> We can also start to charge pensioners and concessional patients who presently receive their medications free or at a reduced amount. Indeed that is something that governments have to consider. In any reasonable and sensible debate about the issue, that has to be put forward as one of the options. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that we can do is look very closely at pharmacists' remuneration. Indeed, this Government has a significant mandate, following its success at the last election, to do so and to make significant changes in the way in which we remunerate pharmacists. </PARA>
<PARA> A whole bundle of issues is involved in the health care debate. But the fundamental thing I want to put forward today is that there is no magical, simple, quick fix. It is going to require a reallocation of resources. If we want to improve the system we are going to have to spend more money. That money has to be put in either by the public or by private individuals-that is the choice that we face. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very prescient prediction of the honourable member for Perth. All of us, and in particular the broader Australian community, are deeply concerned about the future of our country-where we will end up as a country by the year 2000. My grievance today, though, concerns a particular issue of my portfolio responsibilities of trade and the lack of very real concern that is shown by the media in Australia for so many issues, including international trade issues, which are absolutely fundamental to the future of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In itself, it perhaps does not matter what the media is or is not interested in, but the Australian community is not being educated or having issues brought to its attention as sometimes should be the case. There is no better example of this than the current round of global trade negotiations, which is known colloquially as the Uruguay Round. This is a subject which gets scant coverage in the media. I doubt that it is ever covered on television; it is very occasionally covered on radio; and it is from time to time covered in the back pages of newspapers. And yet, I know that nearly all members of the House would agree with me that this is an issue which is fundamentally important to the future of our country. It is an issue, therefore, that the public ought to be given more opportunity to think about and understand. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know now that in Australia we are going through one of the three great crises of our history since European settlement. We also now know that the only way we are going to get out of the economic crisis that we are in is to trade our way of it. There is no alternative. Adopting a whole lot of voodoo economic solutions such as using monetary mechanisms and playing with the exchange rate will not work. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the only way that we will get out of our problems is by trading our way out of them and that, in turn, raises two issues for us. The first is the issue of the competitiveness of our industries. This issue is widely debated within the Parliament and within the broader community and is covered by the media. But the second and almost as important issue is the access that we have as a country to various markets around the world. That is a vastly important issue to us as a country; and it is one that, I am sorry to say, is continually being ignored by the media-in particular, the television and radio media-in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The current Uruguay Round-the multilateral trade negotiations-is, amongst other things, about this whole issue of access to markets and having a level playing field, particularly for a small country like Australia, in the global trading environment. Australia is blocked out of a whole range of markets. As a result, serious costs are being imposed on our people. Our living standard is being reduced or held down because of our exclusion from markets. The best known example is our exclusion from the European Community's agricultural markets. We could sell beef to the European Community competitively. European consumers could buy our beef much more cheaply than they can beef produced in Europe. Our exclusion is reducing our living living standards as well as reducing the living standards of the European Community. One has only to look at the quotas of beef allowed from Australia into the European Community and compare them with the amount of beef we are able to sell to markets like Japan, Korea, Taiwan or even the United States, which does have a limit. But the fact is that the policy of the European Community is seriously reducing the living standards of our people. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to coal. The fact is that we can sell coal substantially more competitively into the European market that can almost any other country. Certainly, our prices are more competitive than the prices set for coal produced by the Europeans. If we were allowed free access to the European Community coal markets, in particular the West German and the British coal markets, our national income would increase by about $2,500m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is a matter of real importance to us as a country that we work to try to get access to these markets. It is also important that the broader community understand why their living standards are being held down and what this Parliament is trying to do to ensure that some of those obstacles to their higher living standards are actually removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also, in passing, mention the other very important aspect of international trade negotiations. I refer to the issue of dumping onto third markets, in particular by people such as the European Community, with its common agricultural policy, and the United States of America, through what is called its export en- hancement program. These issues are vastly important to living standards in this country. They are issues, I am sorry to say, that the media, with the exception of the specialist journalists who cover these issues, does not seem to understand or does not seem to be interested in. Let me say that the specialist journalists do a very good job but they are few and far between. </PARA>
<PARA> The media is more interested in personalities: in who likes whom and why, whether a woman is in a position or a man is in a position to do something, whether somebody gets up early or late to go to work in the morning, whether people go jogging, or whether they drink orange juice for lunch. The media is less interested in some of the really fundamental issues that will affect the future of this country. I hope in time it will start to concentrate more on them. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Uruguay Round is concerned, we have gone to great lengths on this side of the House to welcome the Government's commitment to a successful outcome to the multilateral trade negotiations. There has been a strong degree of bipartisanship because both sides of the House recognise that global trade liberalisation, rather than just regional arrangements, is going to be fundamental to our economic prosperity. The fact that there is bipartisanship on these issues means that as far as the media is concerned they are, therefore, of no interest and, by implication, of no relevance. I think that is a real concern. </PARA>
<PARA> We supported the Government's initiatives in establishing, and continuing to work through, the Cairns group. We have supported, on the whole, the Government's promotion of an agenda in the multilateral trade negotiations for the liberalisation of agricultural trade, mineral services and intellectual property. The alternative for us if the multilateral trade negotiations break down is that we will end up in a world which moves increasingly enthusiastically towards trading blocs. We already have the European Community and the USA-Canada trading bloc, which could in time incorporate Mexico and perhaps go even further. We have the evolution of a Latin American trading bloc. The Association of South East Asian Nations could become, in time, some sort of a trading bloc. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem for countries like Australia and New Zealand is that we are geographically out of the way and do not naturally fall into any of these circumstances. So, in a sense, for political reasons alone, we need multilateral solutions to these trade problems and not just some sort of move towards trading blocs, which will be the result if the multilateral trade negotiations break down. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the public ought to be aware that by the end of this year the Uruguay Round will have to be completed. We are reaching a critical stage in those negotiations. Only this week, at almost this very moment, a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is considering some of the issues which will form part of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. The Australian public, however, is barely aware of these momentous events and the dangerous position in which we stand with the prospect of the negotiations being successful or otherwise being so delicately balanced. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a strong measure of bipartisanship on these issues. But I would like to express the concern of the Opposition that the Government is seemingly beginning to buckle in these negotiations by already talking about how it expects the multilateral trade negotiations to fail. This is transmitting the wrong message to the other partners in these negotiations. It is, therefore, undermining bipartisanship on this issue. What the Government should be doing is building up its campaign by saying that no agreement at all would be better than a bad agreement. It should be ensuring that that position is one taken by the Cairns group and that it helps us fulfil our objectives in these vital negotiations. I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the media, and the public through the media, will become more aware of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw the attention of the House to two continuing consequences of Australia's past involvement in that unhappy war in Indo-China which finished in our withdrawal 15 years ago: a rather squalid regime in Vietnam badly needing refurbishment; and a large community of ethnic Vietnamese in Australia badly needing our compassion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our participation in the second Vietnam war from 1960 to 1972 was a minor contribution to that large tragedy, although it produced for Australia a relatively major upheaval, the political consequences of which are still being played out and about which I would like to speak later. But that larger tragedy has left one of the last unreconstructed Leninist-communist states in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vietnamese economy is a mess, particularly when contrasted with the dynamic growth of neighbouring market-based economies. The reasons for this are diverse: economic and political isolation; wars waged by geopolitically embattled, paranoid Hanoi; a corrupt and inefficient system of state planning; a despotic regime, stifling the capacities of a gifted people; some catastrophic weather amplifying the damages of war; and then the withdrawal of Soviet subsidies over the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> These conditions are not unlike those which preceded the processes of democratisation and liberalisation which have occurred during the last year in eastern Europe and, indeed, are now occurring in the Baltic republics of the Soviet Union itself. There are now some signs that Hanoi is eager, even desperate, to change its own situation. It seems it is considering pursuing democratisation and demilitarisation as a prelude to restoring diplomatic relations with Washington and joining the regional community of nations in their drive for prosperity and liberty. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Australia, as a small, unthreatening democracy with a sound and likely successful track record of pursuing a diplomatic resolution of the Kampuchea problem, should assist in this process. The Vietnamese delegation here earlier in May was clearly both impressed and bemused by events in this chamber. The concept of a loyal Opposition is central to parliamentary democracy and that concept has reached its maturity in this House where both sides clearly comprehend its contours. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that an all-party delegation should offer to visit Vietnam to discuss widely, openly and frankly the means for establishing a similar democratic system in that country as a step to assisting its reconstruction after half a century of war. But also, this assistance should be offered only as Hanoi shows its willingness to assist in the resolution of the Kampuchean impasses and its willingness to reform its regime. </PARA>
<PARA> This absence of reform has driven hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese into a modern diaspora-with nearly 150,000 in Australia and many in my own seat. Few are here voluntarily but most have taken the earliest opportunity to become Australians. Anyone in the education system will know that it is only a matter of time before Vietnamese Australians contribute their share, and probably more than their share, of the top achievers in the many fields of human endeavours that are open to us in this free society. Fields that presently appear as exceptions due to difficulties of language or stature will be rapidly rectified by settlement and diet. As a nation we cannot afford to have this process arrested by yet another damaging debate about immigration and multiculturalism-a debate which can easily acquire a racist hidden agenda. I have no complaints at all about a debate concerning the impact of population levels on the environment, on the balance of payments or on the urban infrastructure. I do and will object to sub rosa complaints about the impact of supposedly alien communities on the `one Australia' presumed to have preceded this era. We have to survive for as long as there is an Australia in the Asia-Pacific region. We have to co-exist with non-Anglo-Celtic nation states, some of which will be and some of which already are richer and more powerful than us. We also already have a multicultural Australia and no number of `Asians Out' signs on Adelaide walls will disguise the fact that already about 5 per cent of my constituents are of Asian origin, and that percentage is considerably higher in the schools. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, honourable members, let us try to assist the reform of Vietnam in order to stop the repression which has driven so many of its people on nightmare journeys into permanent exile, some of them to Australia. But until that is achieved, let us display all the compassion and tolerance towards our residents of Vietnamese origin that they were denied so recently in their country of origin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose it is a rarity that anybody stands in this grievance debate and actually grieves. I have spoken in this debate before but this is probably the first time that I really feel grief. In general, I feel grief about the deaths of 59 people who have died on the Pacific Highway since last October. In particular, I am feeling grief for Mrs Alison Pilkie, who died in the bus accident at Berowra last Monday. Eighteen people were injured in that accident; 10 were from my electorate and were admitted to hospital in Sydney. I certainly extend my sympathy to those who were injured and I wish them a very speedy recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I would like to speak briefly about Alison Pilkie, who is survived by her husband Bob, son Grahame, daughter Jan and four grandchildren. This quite remarkable woman lived at Wauchope in the Hastings Valley. Her service to that community was such that she is going to be incredibly missed. I last saw her a few weeks ago at the Wauchope show, of which she had been honorary secretary for 22 years. This was a quite outstanding period of service. As well, she was on the committee of the Hastings Court Aged Peoples Homes for nine years and a member of the Country Women's Association for 22 years, holding the office of president on several occasions and most other offices as well. She gave 15 years of service to the council of the technical and further education (TAFE) college in Wauchope and for five years was secretary of that council. She was on the State selection committee for TAFE college principals; she had been involved with Meals on Wheels since 1981; she was treasurer and past president of the Wauchope Hospital women's auxiliary; she had 15 years service with the show society women's auxiliary, of which she was treasurer; and she was secretary of the Central Coast Agricultural Show Society group, having been a member for 10 years. For many, many years she had been a member of the Wauchope women's bowling club, of which she was president, secretary and treasurer from time to time; she was also involved with the Wauchope race club. It is just so absolutely senseless that people like Alison and others should have died on the Pacific Highway in the last year and the last decade. I just want to say goodbye in this fashion to Alison Pilkie, a wonderful woman, a charming woman, a great Australian who, right up until the age of 68, had continued to serve her community in this outstanding fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like, too, Mr Deputy Speaker, to extend my sympathy to the families of Nicholas Spanos and Stephan Melrose, who were murdered by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Roermond, Holland, earlier this week. And I certainly join with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in condemning this disgraceful murder of two young Australians. I believe that this form of terrorism is totally unacceptable to all Australians. I know that the vast majority of Australians of Irish descent share those feelings and, like the rest of us, are dreadfully upset about these IRA killings. I must say that I believe that the regrets of the IRA are a gratuitous insult to all Australians and all decent people all over the world who reject terrorism as an arm of political activity. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to commend the Netherlands Government for forming a task force of 45 police to try to solve the crime and catch the killers and also for providing a 100,000 gilder reward, which is the equivalent of about $70,000 Australian dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Government of Australia to supplement the reward offered by the Dutch Government with at least $100,000 as a reward from Australia for the apprehension and conviction of those murderers. The indiscriminate murder of Australian citizens anywhere in the world is totally unacceptable and I believe that we should show that we care. I know the Prime Minister will not be with us today, but I would urge the Minister representing him to take on board the suggestion that Australia should also provide a reward to get those killers. Regrettably, probably we will never have to pay it. Nonetheless, I believe that it is very important that Australia, as a nation, should show that it definitely cares. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to remind the House that next week is National Respite Care Week. I suppose, unless we are in the situation where we have members of our own family in need of respite care, it will not mean a great deal to us. Yet, all members of this House and this Parliament should be aware of the pressing need for respite care in so many areas around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose there are two significant situations in which respite care is absolutely vital. One is the community based respite care for people with disabilities where youngsters or older people with disabilities are taken into somebody else's home for a day or for a weekend just to give a little rest, recreation and recuperation for the family members who are caring 24 hours a day. That sort of activity is covered by Interchange Respite Care Inc. It is interesting to note that at the present time 140 coordinators of respite care are at a conference in Coffs Harbour seeking to improve the way in which they can deliver that care. I think it is very significant indeed that people are giving this care on a voluntary basis. It is a shining beacon within Australian society that so many people, right around this country, are prepared to go out of their way to look after others and to provide that respite for the carers. </PARA>
<PARA> The other situation is that of people who are caring for the frail elderly and those suffering from Alzheimer's and related diseases. There is a desperate need for community care in-house units so that people can be taken out of their homes to give the carers some additional time together. I know in Coffs Harbour, the Addards organisation is desperately seeking to get a six-bed cottage to provide that sort of respite care. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who are caring are faced with frustration, with desperation and, ultimately, with despair unless they can get some time off. This is why I say to this House that the Government and the Parliament as a whole must do everything possible to try to provide additional funding for in-house respite care for people right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the final point I would like to raise concerns a drug called Eldopil Eldepryl, which is also known as Deprenyl. This drug is used to treat sufferers of Parkinson's disease. As honourable members would be aware, Parkinson's disease is a steadily progressing disease for which there is no cure. But various forms of therapy can improve the condition. This disease affects mainly elderly people and currently available therapy has limitations. Eldepryl is a new therapeutic agent that has been shown to provide significant benefits in conjunction with other available agents. But in Australia it is only available on a very restricted individual patient usage scheme which limits the access for patients. </PARA>
<PARA> Eldepryl is available in most major countries throughout the world. It was available in the United Kingdom in 1982 and, since then, in most other European countries. It became available in the United States of America and Sweden in 1989. I believe there is no reason why it should not be readily available in this country. I ask the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) to try to accelerate approval of this drug so that those people suffering from Parkinson's disease in Australia can get the relief that this treatment certainly offers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to talk about a matter which has received much attention from the media in recent times. I refer to the debate, or the so-called debate, on immigration. I want to concentrate today on one aspect of this matter-the comments of the originator of this current debate. Senator Peter Walsh, having been a member of the Cabinet and not having made much of a contribution in the immigration debate at all, felt free, once he had left the Cabinet, to write an article entitled `High Immigration at our Economic Peril' in which he attacked the immigration program and made a number of claims about the impact of immigration on our society and on our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing that I want to say about this is that the claims made by Senator Walsh were based on factual errors, and I will go into that in some detail. They were based on a complete misunderstanding of the process of policy determination in the immigration area-this relates to the Government; and they were also based on the expression of a number of dubious opinions with respect to the connection between the economy and immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the claim by Senator Walsh, that, in fact, the Government in the last seven years has been determining immigration levels more on the basis of blow-outs and cave-ins, to use his words, and his consequent claim that it is a remarkably fortuitous outcome that, if the 140,000 program is about right, it was a result of the blow-outs and cave-ins, are absolute and utter nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the immigration program of this Government has been determined in a systematic way through a very detailed process-a process, I might say, in which Senator Walsh did not feel that he needed to participate in. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the House an example. The most important determination of the immigration program probably since the war was made as a result of the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies-the FitzGerald report-that came down in June 1988. The Government and the immigration and ethnic affairs Caucus committee had a large number of meetings and discussions in which determinations were made as to how to respond to the FitzGerald report. There were many, many issues to work out; a whole new system of immigration to put into place; a whole new determination of the question of the total numbers of immigrants and the classification of immigrants. There were 22 meetings of the Caucus committee between July and November, when the final determinations were made. There were witnesses before the committees; there were all sorts of discussions with departmental officials; there were endless discussions with the Minister; there were discussions amongst the members of the committee; and determinations were made. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of that process there were some disagreements between the committee and the Minister. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) therefore determined that I, as chairman of the committee, should go to the Cabinet to present-there was agreement on about 85-90 per cent of the issues-the case of the committee vis-a-vis the Minister in respect to the other 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> At that meeting many of the members of the Cabinet were present and many made a contribution. The total contribution of Senator Walsh was reported to me to be the following comment: `I don't agree with immigration'. That was his total contribution. After all the work which had been done by the Caucus committee, the Minister and the officials, that was his total contribution; that was the extent to which he participated in the immigration debate within Cabinet. He then comes up and says, `The immigration program is totally an accidental result of cave-ins and blow-outs'. What absolute rubbish and nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very seriously concerned that, notwithstanding the fact that this has been pointed out, the media persists in the claim that in fact what Senator Walsh had said about the determination of the immigration program is correct. Many weeks later, on Friday, 25 May, an article headed `Immigration Plot Thickens' appeared in the Australian Financial Review. All of these conspiracy theories and so forth about the immigration program are based on the assumption that what Senator Walsh had said in that article is true. In fact, it is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The immigration policy of the Government has been determined over a large number of years through the full participation of the Caucus committee, through the full participation of many other members of the Australian Labor Party in Parliament, and, I might say, through a very healthy debate with the Opposition in this chamber. To suggest that the outcomes were some accidental fallout from cave-ins and blow-outs is doing an injustice to the Australian Labor Party. Senator Walsh is doing an injustice to his own Cabinet colleagues. He should in fact retract that statement and I call on him to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the immigration program over the years has been determined on the basis of a determination by the Government to increase the number of skilled migrants. There is no doubt about it. In 1983-84 we had a low level of immigration. It was determined that, in order to help Australia out of the recessionary situation that existed at that time, we needed more skilled migrants. Indeed, it was true that there was some increase in the family reunion program. But the major increase-the huge increase-was in the independent skilled migrant program which was intended directly to assist in the building of Australia. There was also an increase in the business migration program in which people were able to come and bring at least $500,000 each to Australia. In that situation, therefore, where there was a conscious determination by the Government as to what the immigration program would be, it is an utter nonsense to talk about the program being an accidental consequence of blow-outs. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, in this article the senator maintains that another reason for the so-called blow-outs is the cave-ins by the Government to the so-called ethnic lobby. I have often asked, `What is this so-called ethnic lobby?'. It is assumed by Senator Walsh that people with a so-called ethnic background-that is, people with a non-English speaking background-have overwhelming importance in government and are overwhelmingly represented. One only has to look in the House of Representatives, where out of 148 members of Parliament only five have a non-English speaking background. That is far less than the proportion of such people in the total population. The same story occurs throughout all the senior positions in the community. In addition to that, in terms of the actual power of the so-called ethnic lobbies, the Office of Multicultural Affairs has carried out a detailed study of the extent to which they make representations to government members of parliament, Ministers and other bodies. It is overwhelmingly true that the extent of that representation is far lower than that of groups which represent Australian born citizens. So the claim that people of an ethnic or non-English speaking background have an overwhelming influence or an excessive influence in the Government is utterly refuted and false. </PARA>
<PARA> The same is true in respect of ethnic leaders. For example, it was claimed by Senator Walsh that ethnic leaders have an excessive influence on the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). This is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> To his credit, the Prime Minister has worked out correctly that every Australian is to be treated equally and every group in the community is to be given access to his office. Just as the Prime Minister is prepared to listen to groups such as the Returned Services League that are opposed to immigration, he is prepared to listen to groups that may be in favour of immigration-not merely, I might say, ethnic groups, but also employer organisations and even sections of the trade union movement. In this context, therefore, the assumption that there has been an excessive influence and that the result of the immigration program was due to this excessive influence is a nonsense and is refuted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of week ago I raised a number of issues regarding the Jericho Shire Council in Queensland and the flooding of the town of Alfa. There have been incredible responses to my allegations about the positioning of a levy bank in the town. The Shire Council called a public meeting to discuss the allegation on Wednesday 23 May 1990. After the meeting the Council faxed to media outlets in Queensland a document purporting to be a record of the resolutions passed at the meeting. The Council alleged that the townspeople of Alfa called for my resignation and that of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls). This Council allegation was totally false. Councillor Roley Roberts from the Jericho Shire Council and a coordinator of the public meeting has admitted publicly that the Council misrepresented to the media what occurred at the meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any council elected by the people, for the people, must be accountable. The actions of certain members of the Jericho Shire Council are contemptible. The honourable member for Kennedy has written to the Queensland Government demanding that the Council be sacked and that the whole sorry, sordid story be referred to the Criminal Justice Commission. I fully endorse the honourable member's call. But this is not all. I have more information about the past shady dealings of Council members. It just so happens that the new Capricorn Highway comes into Alfa at the corner of the leased block of land that was so conveniently protected by the levy bank. Land was resumed for this in 1985, the lease bought in 1986, and the Shire Chairman in the early 1980s Councillor Eddie Hock, seriously expects us to believe that he did not know what the Main Roads Department was planning.

One of the many issues that the honourable member identified for consideration was `the capacity of our infrastructures to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century'. I would like to inform this House and the honourable member for Lalor that in rural Victoria, and especially in the northern fringe suburbs of Melbourne which form part of my electorate, the infrastructures are at best run down, and at worst, non-existent. Often services are only continuing to be delivered by the sheer dedication and goodwill of local people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of foreign land ownership has come to a head in my electorate on the Gold Coast with the realisation dawning on local people that the giant Japanese finance house Nikko Securities has built an $11m tourist resort at Merrimac for the apparent exclusive use of the company's 12,000 workers. The resort was approved on part of a 105 hectare site by the Albert Shire Council as a tourist facility in May 1988 after some members of the Council expressed concern over whether it complied with the Council's town plan. By definition, a tourist facility in that town plan requires access to the general touring public. However, a number of local people who have sought to make reservations have been turned away and there is apparently a permanent `no vacancy' sign there. It is true that the nearby state school has access to the resort's facilities-that is, its pool and tennis courts-but I believe that this is compliance with the letter rather than the spirit of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have not yet had a proper assessment of the impact of violent videos on the community. It is something that we ought to be examining. I find it particularly distasteful that every time someone is arrested he seems to feel it necessary to pull his jumper over his head on his way into court. I do not want to see him; I do not want to see what he looks like; I just want such people to be tried by due judicial process. They seem to live in some sort of fantasy world in that they find it necessary to pull some clothing over their heads because they think that we might want to see them. If they have committed the violent crimes for which they are about to be tried, I do not want to see them; I simply want to see them dealt with very firmly by the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point I wish to make-it is one I have raised before-is a concern I have with the development of Australian football at the national level. I contrast the phased and sensible development of Australian rugby league and its successful endeavour in Melbourne last night, where local competitions are not damaged and players are paid, with the significant mismanagement and mishandling of Australian football in which States like Western Australia, for example, are not represented on the administration of Australian football in Melbourne. It really is the Victorian Football League under another name. What also concerns me is that players are not being paid and many clubs like the Brisbane Bears, the Sydney Swans and the West Coast Eagles are technically bankrupt. I believe we need to examine this matter seriously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to call on the Government to set up a royal commission, as requested by the New South Wales Government, in response to collapsing public confidence in some of our fundamental institutions. In the last decade we have seen State governments and their associated law enforcement bodies sink in a mire of corruption. We have seen this in New South Wales and Queensland, and now Victoria and Western Australia are teetering on the edge. The Federal Government so far has been free of these sorts of charges. If the present refusal is adhered to, in the face of the appalling events of the last decade at Griffith and Bungendore, and now with the murder of the second highest law enforcement officer of this country, in common with the stench that hangs over the New South Wales police, the Australian Federal Police and the National Crime Authority (NCA), I am afraid that the Federal Government is going to suffer the same fate as the others.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last two-week parliamentary sittings the Opposition came in day in, day out, bringing forward matters of public importance (MPIs) on the economy and telling us that we were in a technical recession and that we were heading for doom and gloom. It did a great disservice to the Australian community and the Australian people. The economic data that came out yesterday showed that the Opposition was wrong. I said, in speaking in the MPI on Thursday 17 May, that we should state the facts clearly and not jump to conclusions. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and many who sit behind him have been jumping to conclusions and have been trying to paint an excessively negative picture of the Australian economy. This is in itself doing damage. I ask the Opposition, especially the Leader of the Opposition, to now withdraw those comments and to look positively at economic development and the economy.

Can the Minister confirm that the national accounts data, together with the increase in the foreign debt announced today, mean that interest rates will remain high in the foreseeable future?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that yesterday's results in relation to the national accounts were a great disappointment to the Opposition and to various other doomsayers around the country who believed that this represented an opportunity to proclaim a recession. The figures that have come out bear out very much that the Government's Budget strategy is on line-that is, that the economy is slowing; that, whilst the economy is slowing, we are not in a recession, technically or otherwise; and that we are getting the right structural change through the improvement in net exports. In those circumstances, the Government believes that the national account figures for the March quarter are confirmation of Government policy and indicate no need for change in that policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the future for monetary policy, the Government has previously indicated that as the various reductions in interest rates earlier this year feed through they will provide some alleviation to those who have been bearing the burden of high interest rates. There is still some room for that process to continue and at this stage I would not expect there would be any loosening of monetary policy in the near future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Can he inform honourable members what progress is being made by the military regime in handing over power to a democratically elected government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. The Australian Government has strongly supported the democratic reforms in Myanmar and has noted the holding of national elections on 27 May, which was the first time in 30 years. Although counting is still continuing, there is little doubt that the National League for Democracy has scored a major success. As of yesterday the NLD had 67 officially declared seats and has claimed unofficially that it has won 366 out of a total of 485 seats. This result would give the National League for Democracy at least 75 per cent of the seats in the National Assembly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The strong support which has been shown for the NLD is testament to the courage of the people of Myanmar and is a further condemnation of the attempt by the military regime to intimidate and harass its political opponents through widespread arrests and detentions.</PARA>
<PARA> However, to the regime's credit, the elections appear to have been conducted in an open and orderly manner. The Australian Government has called on the military regime to recognise and respect the result of the elections and move quickly to hand over power to a new democratically elected government. A high level of support for the NLD adds increasing urgency to the need for the regime to immediately release Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the NLD, who has been under house arrest since July 1989, as well as the NLD chairman, U Tin Oo, and other political detainees.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government believes that the elections provide a real opportunity to achieve political and economic reform and national reconciliation in Myanmar. The key question must now be the transfer of power to a democratic government. As yet, the military regime has given no firm indication as to how it will adhere to its public undertakings to hand over power.</PARA>
<PARA> We understand that the NLD may soon be entering into negotiations with the military regime on the formation of an interim Administration and the drafting of a new constitution. The indisputable result of the elections underlines the need for a quick transfer of power and in accordance with the expressed wishes of the people of Myanmar. In conclusion, in a year which has witnessed massive advances in freedom and democracy, we hope that Myanmar will not be the least among the nations in this respect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen various reports suggesting that Australia has changed its policy of recognition of Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem and that Australia's criticism of Israel for allowing settlement of Soviet Jews in east Jerusalem represents `a tough new line'. It is not correct to say that Australia has changed its policy on Jerusalem. Australia, in common with most other countries, has never recognised Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem. In 1948 the United Nations General Assembly resolved that Jerusalem should be placed under a permanent international regime. Australia voted in favour of that resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Arab sector of Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the 1967 war. Israel immediately legislated to incorporate the Arab sector into a reunited Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, and on 30 July 1980 the Israeli Parliament enacted a basic law proclaiming Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital. These decisions have not been accepted by most countries, including Australia. The 1980 proclamation was rejected by the United Nations Security Council as a violation of international law.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia, in common with most countries, continues to have its Embassy in Tel Aviv rather than Jerusalem. Australia believes that the status of Jerusalem is a matter for decision in the context of an overall Middle Eastern peace decision. Australia opposes Israel's establishment of settlements in any of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem, as contrary to international law and an obstacle to peace.</PARA>
<PARA> I just note on this matter that, in a question without notice to the Senate last week, Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, said that Australia shared the concerns expressed by a number of other countries that some new Soviet Jewish migrants to Israel had been allowed to settle in the unoccupied territories and that the Israeli Government is apparently willing to allow an increase in these numbers. Senator Evans added that it was obvious that continued movement into the occupied territories, including east Jerusalem, does not encourage Palestinians to pursue negotiations towards a dialogue with Israel.</PARA>

Mr Speaker, I categorically reject the claim that the Government has reduced the income of all woolgrowers; the market has. All the Government has done is put in place a correction. One could equally argue with the facts available to us that the Government has saved the industry $600m in stock losses through interest payments on the stockpile through time. The price the stockpile has been bought in at is not the price that the market puts on it today. The ultimate cost can be calculated only once we know by how much, and when, the pile is eliminated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Leader of the National Party is presumably talking about the suggestion in some areas-particularly among some of those whom he sits next to-that we are in the depths of a recession and that this is the cause, it is claimed, of the collapse of a large number of businesses. What he should have done, rather than join his colleagues in anticipating what would be in the national accounts figures, was study those figures yesterday for as long as it took him to appreciate that a very strong contribution is still being made from the gross operating surplus from companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the position as revealed yesterday on an annual basis, but taking the last six months, we find that the percentage change in terms of company profitability was still a moderately strong 7.5 per cent, but that comes on top of periods of nearly 22 per cent six months before and, in the previous two years, 19 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. In other words, there has been a very strong performance in terms of private companies and their profitability.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unclear at this stage whether one can draw that conclusion. It is certainly true that in relation to the most recent figures there has been a very strong contribution from the profitability of mining companies and, indeed, from wholesale and retail companies. There has been a smaller contribution in the area of manufacturing and in the category which is variously called `other selected industries' but which includes construction, transport, storage, entertainment, recreational services and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there is an inclination to assume that all small companies are doing poorly and all large companies are doing well when, in fact, that is not the case. Small companies that are involved in some of these well-performing sectors are obviously doing well and making a contribution to the overall level of company profitability. Clearly, there are other sectors where companies in general are not doing so well, and I dare say that some small businesses in those sectors are not doing as well as others. It does not really help to try to say that all small business is doing badly, or all small businesses are going bankrupt. Indeed, what we know is that if one looks at the series which track bankruptcies against economic activity, one can see that bankruptcies are not a good measure of what is happening in the economy as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> This is just an attempt on the part of the Opposition to deflect attention away from its crass mistake when it tried to wish Australia into a recession over the last few weeks, just as it tried to wish Australia into a change of government a few months ago. And, of course, on both counts it failed, and failed dismally. No-one was more disappointed than the Leader of the Opposition and his Treasury spokesman when the national accounts figures which came out yesterday indicated that there was not the recession, technical or otherwise, that they had been prophesying-not weeks or months before, but just days before. Indeed, on the day of the release the shadow Treasurer was still forecasting that in an hour's time the figures would reveal that the country was in the depths of a recession, a recession which the Leader of the Opposition had prophesied just a few days before would be a long and deep recession.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition does not yet appreciate is that the figures that were released yesterday in fact indicate what the Government has been saying for some time; that is, that there has been, and indeed should be, a slowing of spending in the domestic economy. We have seen spending come down from 11 per cent to 0.5 per cent, and yet that has not resulted in a recession because there has been a corresponding reversal in the contribution coming from the export sector. Whereas in March 1989 the annualised figure was a net reduction from the export figure of 6 per cent, there is now a positive contribution of 1.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> So what we are managing is a reduction in domestic demand, which is precisely what we wanted to achieve, without producing the kind of recession which the Opposition so dearly wanted, because in the end the Opposition has no policy prescription for Australia except to plunge it into a recession.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, and acknowledge his and many other members' longstanding commitment on health issues in this House, particularly anti-smoking campaigns. It is true that today is World No Tobacco Day. There are 167 member nations of the World Health Organisation that recognise this in bringing the attention of their citizens to the diseases which are caused by tobacco consumption. The theme this year is childhood and youth without tobacco. Mr Speaker, I thank you and your colleague the President of the Senate for allowing a display to be available for the public on the first floor of Parliament House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should stop for a moment to consider what World No Tobacco Day is really saying. Cigarettes and cigarette smoke contain 43 known carcinogenic agents and are by far the major cause of drug related deaths. In Australia this year 18,000 Australians will die tobacco related deaths. The honourable member for Gippsland and a couple of others on the other side think that this is a joking matter; it is not a joking matter.</PARA>
<PARA> If present trends continue, 256,000 Australian boys and 159,000 Australian girls now under the age of 14 will not reach their full life expectancy because of tobacco. The World Health Organisation has estimated that 150 million children alive today will eventually die of tobacco induced disease. I think that those of us who are serious about this issue will recognise that for Australia to lose 18,000 people this year through tobacco-related deaths is an incredible indictment of many facets of Australian life. The Government's commitment to a safe environment for our children is to produce an environment free from tobacco smoke and, importantly, free from the pressure to start this deadly habit.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a strong record of commitment to a smoke-free environment. There is a ban on smoking on domestic flights, which is extended from 1= September 1990 to the domestic component of international flights. There is a ban on smoking in Commonwealth buildings and on all federally registered coaches. There is also a strong record of this Government's action, in conjunction with State and Territory governments, for people to resist the pressure to smoke. That is through the NEADA campaigns. Those campaigns have been targeted at young people. It is very important to note that there has been a $1m extension to the `Smoking. Who Needs It?' campaign. This is not just an important domestic issue; it is an important international issue as tobacco cartels extend their pressure for people to take up cigarette smoking-in particular, in the countries of Asia and Africa. I thank the honourable member for Perth and others in this House who support the Government on this very important matter.</PARA>

<PARA> Australia will continue to be a leader in negotiating the strengthening of the Montreal Protocol and in supporting developing countries in their efforts to meet their obligations under the treaty. It is now essential that we pursue an agreement for a complete phase-out of CFCs and an almost total end of the use of halons by the year 2000. Additional substances which have a low but significant ozone depletion potential will also be addressed at that meeting. Australia is in a very strong position to demonstrate to other developed countries how these objectives can be achieved at a national level.</PARA>
<PARA> There are still some problems in working out ways to assist the developing countries in meeting their goals. Australia is committed to the concept of burden sharing and urges all developed countries, especially the United States, to recognise and accept their responsibilities in this area. Unfortunately, there has been some backsliding on the part of a few key developed countries on the inclusion of new ozone depleting chemicals in the Protocol.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. Her interest in these matters is well known as a member of the Government Members Defence Force Action Committee and also as a leading woman in this Parliament. It is a fair question why women in the RAAF will not be allowed to fly the FA18s, given the fact that we decided yesterday that they would be allowed to join the RAAF Roulettes aerobatic team and that they be allowed to fly Macchi jets. Indeed, members of this House have been flown around in the Falcons by a woman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The short answer is that we have not let women engage in flying combat aircraft. Yesterday I announced that all three Services would open combat related roles to women-that is, those duties which require a person to work in support of or in close proximity to people who are performing combat roles. That work is performed in circumstances which quite undeniably involve the risk of being killed or injured by an enemy. People doing that work may be inadvertently drawn into combat. Their primary role is not to close with and destroy the enemy. That is the distinction in the policy which applies to all three Services in the Australian Defence Force and which I took on the recommendation of the Chief of the Defence Staff and after examination by the chiefs of the individual Services. It was taken with the primary objective-this is a point I stress-of giving women a broader range of quality career opportunities in the armed services, commensurate with those they enjoy under this Government in other walks of life. It will have a major influence on the range of trade and professional skills that they will be able to develop and as well as that on their future promotion possibilities to some of the higher positions that require combat or combat related experience as a prerequisite.</PARA>
<PARA> The policy has required all the Services to consider the particular operational circumstances that they will face and under which they will have to admit women. The Royal Australian Navy, for example, has decided that women can serve on all Navy ships with the sole exception of submarines. That exception is made basically because the amount of room for providing appropriate facilities on submarines does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Army has decided to provide progressively further opportunities for women where this can be achieved without detriment to operational effectiveness. They will be excluded from armour, artillery, infantry and combat engineers at this stage. The Royal Australian Air Force has decided that women will be excluded only from operating combat aircraft which have offensive capabilities and from being airfield defence guards.</PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Australian Navy has a situation where persons performing combat related duties are all in the same boat as persons performing combat duties. Navy had the choice of continuing to exclude women from warships or accepting that if making combat related duties available to women were to mean anything they would have to be posted to warships and there is no practical reason why any restriction should be placed on the types of duties available to women at sea. That means that they may take primary combat roles. I am glad to say that that decision has been taken willingly by the Navy.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Chiefs of Staff will review the implementation of these new arrangements each year and review the entire policy in June 1993. That policy review, in answer to the honourable member, will certainly include consideration of the general exemption under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 for women in combat roles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some very esoteric arguments going on about what is the necessary extent of compensation to be provided if one were contemplating the introduction of a consumption tax. We on this side of the House consider this to be a somewhat irrelevant argument, in the sense that we are not proposing to introduce a consumption tax. These are questions which the honourable member for Flinders has to address himself to because he is the one who is running around Australia proposing that there should be a consumption tax introduced into this country. If he wants to indulge in a debate with Dr Morgan or with anyone else, that is entirely up to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He has to remember that, if the primary objective of his consumption tax is to increase savings, the only way he can increase savings is to undercompensate those who are on the lowest levels of income in order that the highest income recipients can increase their contribution to savings. That is the essential dilemma that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has to contend with. He is trying to work out a package which undercompensates the poorest people in the community in order that he can provide a gain to the most wealthy in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> That is an argument he can have with his colleagues. That is an argument which we would be delighted for him to have with the electorate and with the people of Australia. We have examined this proposal and have rejected it, basically because the tax reforms which we have brought into effect over the last few years render the possible benefits from a consumption tax entirely marginal because of the way in which the tax system is so much fairer now than when we inherited the ramshackle system from our opponents opposite.</PARA>

What action will the Government be taking to increase drug treatment options for people with AIDS?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="942" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The availability of drugs, particularly the quite important drug AZT, is of considerable concern to people who are concerned about AIDS, particularly those who are most affected. The Government established the National Centre for HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research in Sydney to enable the centre to coordinate the participation of major treatment centres and AIDS related drug trials. The specific drug raised in the honourable member's question is currently approved for marketing in Australia for use in designated AIDS units and for the treatment of adults with severe symptomatic HIV infection, namely, AIDS or advanced AIDS related conditions. The cost is met by the Commonwealth and the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a decision in the United States in March for the broadening of the availability of the drug in Australia on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration. The core of the question goes to the mechanism for changing of the approved use of AZT. I ought to explain to the House, because it is quite important in terms of any criticism that may come, that that process involves the proprietor of the drug-in this case, Wellcome Australia Ltd-being required to apply to the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) to vary improved indications for use. At its meeting of 8 March 1990, the Australian National Council on AIDS (ANCA) resolved to encourage the company to expedite such an application. I am disappointed that Wellcome has yet to submit such an application to ADEC, despite repeated indications over several months to the Department of Community Services and Health, to AIDS organisations and to the media that such an application was imminent. ADEC, which is part of the responsibilities of my colleague the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, has indicated that it will streamline its requirements for assessing an application regarding AZT and it has an independent assessor on standby to consider the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> This is an issue that would certainly be resolved if the company were prepared to take that step. A number of other relevant drugs in use or being trialled overseas have also shown some promise in progress of the AIDS virus. I am as anxious as those affected by AIDS that we use every available drug that is likely to be efficacious. I have suggested, Mr Speaker, that ANCA might establish a special task force to look at the question, whether we can speed up the process of approving some of the more efficacious drugs. I thank the honourable member for her question.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suspect that the honourable member for Flinders ought to consult with the honourable member for Bennelong because he, after all, was the Treasurer during the time that there was a massive explosion in the area of tax avoidance. If the honourable member for Flinders wants any advice about that matter he should, perhaps, talk to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I actually have not read what Dr Morgan had to say, but I rather suspect that he has not taken sufficient account both of the base broadening measures which the Government has brought into effect and of the considerably increased compliance activities which have been undertaken by the Government. It is, of course, true at the margin that there will always be a small degree of tax evasion. If people are not paying income tax-avoiding or evading their responsibility to pay income tax-and if there is consumption tax, of course, that consumption tax might pick up some small contribution which has otherwise not been paid. That fact has never been denied by us in the White Paper we produced on taxation reform or, indeed, by the Treasurer in more recent times. The real question is: Is the extent of tax evasion and avoidance such that one should engage in such a massive reconstruction of the taxation system in order to bring about that change? Our conclusion has been that, as we have so thoroughly improved compliance and as we have so thoroughly extended, through base broadening, the effect of the existing taxation arrangements, that issue is scarcely relevant in the consideration of a consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA> I might say that if that is the last card that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has to play and if the only case for his consumption tax is now one which rests on the importance of improving the compliance of the taxation system that is just evidence of the paucity of his argument. What people have to recognise in the end is that his argument is not about trying to improve the operation of the taxation system generally. He essentially wants to introduce a consumption tax so that he can hit the poor in order that he can advantage the rich. That is the only consistent point which underpins his argument-an argument which he is loath to own up to, and so he will discover all these other red herrings and irrelevancies in order to avoid and to disguise his real purpose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only excuse I can think of for the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is that he increases his majority at election time. There can be no excuse for not giving a Minister notice of a question like that. I am not sure of the detail of the particular attributes of the BAC146 that the honourable member outlined as a preface to his question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is however an aircraft which has been noteworthy for the silence of its operations. It is a very good neighbourly aircraft in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA> There are many more issues involved in the question of the curfew at Sydney Airport than that which the honourable member outlined, not least the fact that we are required, I believe, to operate on a considerable basis of trust with the people in the neighbouring communities to that airport. Something like 86 per cent of the people who are deleteriously affected by aircraft noise in the whole country happen to reside around Sydney Airport. No government in the past and no government in the future can approach questions of noise limitation at Sydney Airport without bearing that in mind. There is a question as to the tolerance limits of the population and that is very important. That will continue to influence the Government's attitude when it considers issues such as the curfew at Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of the additional runway at Sydney is one which the Government has well and truly taken on board. Sometimes Opposition members like to chant about its position on the third runway at Mascot, but let me say this to them: if we had gone down their road of a close-space parallel runway, we would have spend about $300m on a proposition which would have improved movement at Sydney Airport by a factor of about 22 to 30 per cent, if that. We would have spent huge sums of money putting ourselves in a position where there was enormous community dissent at the course of action we had pursued if we had gone down the Opposition's road and produced virtually nothing at the end of the day. The proposition which is now under environmental study-if it is to proceed-will significantly improve the usage of Sydney Airport in ways that could never have been contemplated in the propositions put down by the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's position is to proceed with that, but it is also mindful of the environmental legislation. If one assumes that one can set aside environmental legislation which obligates governments to make determinations in accordance with at least an examination of what an environmental impact study is, one knows nothing about the way the legal processes are working in this country. Walk aside from an environmental study or render it bogus by some hasty action and we will not be starting any runways at Sydney Airport. Honourable members opposite should remember, when they come into this House and debate these matters, that, firstly, their own proposition was lousy and they cannot clothe themselves in any decent cloth on micro-economic reform in that regard-and, secondly, our proposition is being dealt with appropriately in accordance with Australian environmental legislation and all the other considerations that ought to apply to this.</PARA>

These claims have been made by the shadow Minister for community services and aged care, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), and also Mr Peter Boardman, political and publicity officer for the Private Geriatric Hospitals Association of Victoria (PGHAV), now known as the Australian Nursing Homes Association (Victoria). These claims are untrue, as I have amply demonstrated by the implementation of the aged care reform program and other examples. It is worth noting that the PGHAV largely represents a section in the nursing home industry in Victoria that, despite a large number of homes of high and acceptable standards, has a disgraceful record over many years in many homes when it comes to responsibility and care for the aged.</PARA></TALK.START>

The exact nature of business tomorrow is to some extent dependent on matters that the Senate is considering over the next couple of hours.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's analysis of yesterday's national accounts figures have led the Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to the not surprising conclusion that the Government views its economic policy as being right, as being on track and, therefore, it must be maintained. That reaffirmation of the Government's general policy position then led the Acting Treasurer to the obvious point that interest rates would remain constant, and that there is no immediate prospect of a fall in interest rates in Australia. As was made clear at Question Time today that is very much the Government's position, although the Acting Treasurer was presumably embarrassed by the fact that this is as clear a breach of promise as one will ever get-the Government made many promises during the election about a fall in interest rates and that, obviously, is not coming to pass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the next quarterly account figures will not be released until the Budget it is clear, therefore, that during the winter months the Government will not be changing economic policy. In fact, as it is now undertaking the final work on the preparation of the 1990-91 Budget it is obvious that yesterday's figures, in the Government's mind, will confirm the accuracy and correctness of its policy stance and, therefore, will be embedded in that 1990-91 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In raising this matter of public importance today the Opposition has directly joined issue with the Government on its basic assessment, and I take the opportunity of canvassing some of the reasons why the Opposition takes a different approach. After making some general remarks I want to focus on some of the key issues, namely: investment, growth in the government sector, corporate profits, inflation and productivity. My colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) will dispose of any inaccuracies in the Acting Treasurer's contribution and further substantiate the Opposition's case by examining--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Dawkins" NAMEID="9E4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be an easy task, and I am glad the Acting Treasurer has admitted that. Among other things, the honourable member for Berowra wants to look at private sector demand which is a key feature in the current economic debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason why many people were surprised at the figures yesterday is simply that most people did not believe them. They did not believe them because they felt that those figures contradicted what they see in their everyday lives. They see shops empty and unable to obtain tenants and they know that businesses are going broke-there are corporate corpses littered across the Australian economic landscape. People know as they go shopping in the supermarkets that their own standards of living are falling and I think many people now have a feeling that Australia has lost its sense of direction. I think today's figures will confirm that view. They come from the same source as yesterday's figures-the Australian Bureau of Statistics-and will show our debt climbing through $156 billion, a huge increase in our foreign debt, adding to that general perception that people have that our country is facing a period of economic malaise. </PARA>
<PARA> Economists are having a debate about whether the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is right to say that a recession is risking bankruptcies, rising unemployment and falling asset prices, or whether the Australian Statistician's definition, the technical definition of two negative quarters of gross domestic product, is right. Quite frankly those arguments about jargon are absolutely irrelevant for most people because they sense that the country is not well managed. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we should not rely too heavily on one quarter's figures, I think the national accounts figures yesterday raise some significant questions. It should be said that there are a lot of one-off figures coming out of yesterday's national accounts. Some are as a result of one-off events, others because of an element of volatility in the figures. I must say, in line with the general view by most commentators, that the figures may well be distorted by those one-off or volatile intrusions. </PARA>
<PARA> The one-off factors include the end of the airline pilots dispute, giving this quarter a better look than the previous quarter at the time of the airline pilots dispute, or strike; the distortion caused by the fiasco of the luxury sales tax, which members are all aware of; and, of course, the problems with the Victorian motor registry. There was also a shaving of the 1.8 per cent growth as a result of the 0.5 percentage points which came from private non-farm stock accumulation, which is likely to run down in forthcoming quarters, thereby depressing that later growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The government sector was of particular interest. Government sector investment is fairly strong but, as the Australian Statistician points out, one needs to be very careful and cautious about those figures because of the way in which they are collected. Of more concern was the big jump-a figure of 11.9 per cent over 12 months-in government final consumption expenditure. That is a very critical point in the whole set of figures because when one takes out the high figures on the government side-in other words, the strength on the government side-then clearly the conclusion is that private sector activity is suffering a decline, which is consistent with the general view that the coalition has been putting on the economy recently. My colleague the honourable member for Berowra will pick up that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the opportunity of saying to the Acting Treasurer that I think the Commonwealth would be right to require some sharp cuts in recurrent expenditure from the States at the forthcoming Premiers Conference, but it would be wrong to assert that the blame lies entirely on the States when there is still a lot to be done by way of reducing government expenditure at the Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA> Of particular concern yesterday were the investment figures. The relevance of that is the Treasurer's view on the J-curve-honourable members can go back over the quotes and the circumstances and they might remember the J-curve-which is that we will see a build-up in imports, but there is nothing to worry about because they are capital imports: the machinery will be put into the factories and they will produce export goods and import substitution goods and in that sense, by that method, through an investment led recovery we will work our way out of our economic problems. The J-curve theory is five years old this coming October and it has not brought the rewards that the Treasurer has hoped for it. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the investment figures, we see that all is not as it appears according to the Treasurer. He exaggerates two things: both the quantity of investment and the quality of investment in the Australian economy. Firstly, in respect of quantity, it is the old trick: one hunts around for the figures that best suit. The game is up on that one. If we look at current prices, we see that things are not nearly as bright as the Treasurer would have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is even cause for further concern on quality, a point made by Senator Walsh recently and reinforced by Senator Button. The fact is that in investment there is government investment and private investment. Private investment is not so bad, but there is a big drop in government investment; and that means a big fall in investment in structural goods, roads and other public infrastructure. If we take the latest figures, again reflecting the real Achilles heel of the Government's economic strategy, we find that private investment has dropped 8 per cent over the year and that, within that, equipment has dropped even further to 13.5 per cent, thus showing, revealing and exposing the weakness of the Treasurer's argument on investment. He talks much about building our capital stocks, but if we look at the comments of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development comments we see that there is a weakness in that argument as well, because the OECD, in its very critical survey recently on Australia, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the increase in capital stock in 1988 and 1989 appears to be concentrated in market services . . . In contrast the gross capital stock is rising by only 2 to 3 percent in manufacturing and in commodity exporting industries (agriculture and mining combined). While the recent rise in capacity in the traded goods sector is difficult to judge, on balance, it would appear that some further expansion is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>So even where we have some private investment there are real questions as to where that investment is going and whether or not it will provide us with the capacity to boost our exports and substitute for our imports. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of profits-here we have another one of the Government's key arguments-we heard the Acting Treasurer mouthing the rhetoric at Question Time today. Again, those figures clearly were inflated by mining company profits. I also say in respect of the more general proposition of the Treasurer that all is not what it seems. The Treasurer boasted about profits, as a percentage of gross domestic product, being at an all time record; but he omits that this is a gross figure. As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development again pointed out, if we take out the rates of interest and taxes the net profit has not increased at all-again giving the lie to the Treasurer's boast.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of inflation, the private consumption deflator-the Government's own preferred measure-shows an increase from 6.4 per cent to 6.9 per cent. This parallels what everybody knows-that the recent consumer price index (CPI) showed another rise to 8.6 per cent. If one is not an economist, one should go to one's local supermarket for evidence of that fact. Whilst the GDP per hour worked index is not a perfect measure of productivity, it is a pretty rough one. It shows a pathetic 0.3 per cent rise over the 12 months. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A rise of 0.3 per cent. At a time when our international competitors have got positive rates of productivity growth, that reveals one of the structural defects in this economy-that we have been unable to pick up productivity and thereby underpin a rise in people's living standards. The OECD revealed a telling point on page 52 of its report. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the comparative performance of Australia in terms of productivity levels is not good, especially in manufacturing and electricity generation--</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very useful point which leads me on to some of the solutions and why we say that there is a problem in terms of structural defects in the economy. It leads me to make the point that in many areas we need to do much to improve competition in product markets and to improve the productivity of various industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Acting Treasurer that, rather than being lulled by these figures into a false sense of security, the Government should take the opportunity of a quarterly breathing space to implement some major reforms. Labour market reform should be very high on that list. It is absolutely essential for the future efficiency of our economy. If we really want to do something about people's living standards, then the Government has to abandon one of its central policies-the low-wage policy. To do that, we need structural change in the labour market. We need an enterprise focus in industrial relations and we need to do something about the Industrial Relations Commission, so that the orders of the Commission will be required to be complied with-instead of the mickey mouse arrangements that we have in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government ought to get on with privatisation. There are a number of industries and businesses which the Government owns. Governments are not good at running businesses. Let me give an example in regard to Victoria. Victorians will know that governments are not good at running banks. Look at the State Bank and the Tricontinental Corporation Ltd as two glaring examples where the Government should not be in the business of banking. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at shipping and the waterfront. I am glad that Senator Collins is at least one of the few Ministers with a sense of urgency-and so he should be. His resignation is sitting in the Leader of the Opposition's bottom drawer. He should have a sense of urgency not just for his own political skin but because this country needs real reforms in both shipping and the waterfront. There is also the third runway at Sydney. I am glad that the third runway got a mention at Question Time. The whole history of the third runway has been a farce. This Government cancelled the decision that the last coalition Government took to undertake the construction of that third runway. </PARA>
<PARA> There ought to be a change in the stance of policy. I have given a number of examples-labour market reform, privatisation, et cetera. There should also be, following that, an opportunity for a change in the mix of public policy. Once micro-economic reform is undertaken, one is in a position to take the weight off monetary policy, thereby leading to sustained reductions in interest rates. We need cuts in Government expenditure and we need the adoption of a determined anti-inflation policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much yet to be done. The Treasurer may be in Paris buying a new summer suit while the Australian electorate is looking to fairly hard times. I think the Government does have a responsibility to act on the political mandate it gained at the last election. As the Acting Treasurer knows, there are signs the Government has not taken this seriously and it should do so now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was not the speech that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) hoped that he was going to be able to make today, the day after the release of the national accounts figures. What he had hoped to be able to do was to latch on to some figures, which he expected even an hour before their release. He expected to reveal that Australia was in the grip of a recession, a recession which was described just a few days ago by his Leader as a deep and possibly prolonged one. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said, `let there be no doubt that this recession has been engineered by the Government in a blunt attempt to reduce our current account deficit'. So the speech that the Deputy Leader hoped he could have made would have been a speech which danced on the failure of the Government's policies as revealed by the national accounts figures. Of course, he was massively disappointed, as was his Leader, that the figures released yesterday did not in fact reveal that Australia was in the grip of a recession. He was embarrassed to find that any interpretation of those figures, whether he wants to accept them, believe them, or disbelieve them, is entirely consistent with the Government's view that we need to restrain domestic expenditure-that has happened-that we need to boost the contribution from net exports-that has happened-and that we need to avoid a recession-and that has happened. In other words, there has been a considerable turnaround in the level of national expenditure-that is, the size of the domestic economy. That has slowed dramatically over the last year or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well, there has been a similar turn- around in the contribution from net exports to gross domestic product such that, whilst GDP has come down, its components have shifted from being over-reliant on domestic demand and insufficiently dependent on the export sector; a change is taking place and a greater contribution is being made by the export sector. It is precisely what the Government has been saying for months and months, ever since it became clear that the level of growth in the economy was too strong for domestic production to be able to be sustained without resorting to very significant and unsustainable levels of imports. There is no acknowledgment in the speech that we have just heard that there might remotely be some consistency between these figures and the fact that the Government's policies are having the effect which we prophesied they would have. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, far from fulminating, as I know he would have preferred to do today, has had to put together what ended up being a pretty tawdry speech-one which was long in criticism of the Government and very short in prescriptions of what needed to happen. What is happening to the Opposition is that as every day goes by and as the Government's program is demonstrated to be effective and as the Government continues its program of micro-economic reform-an issue to which I will return later-and as the Government is able to get the runs on the board, more and more pressure is going to be put on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and his Leader to come up with some kind of plausible critique of Government policy. But more importantly than that, they are going to have to put together some kind of plausible alternative in terms of what this country needs. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Deputy Leader is struggling with at the moment is a declining credibility. His credibility in the brief few weeks that he has been the shadow Treasurer has been reduced almost to nothing. He has discovered to his surprise that he can no longer get away with ranting and raving as he has in his previous shadow portfolios. Now he has to put a bit of substance into his speeches. </PARA>
<PARA> I was hoping to get a bit of substance out of the Deputy Leader. In the end he returned to his old habits. Whilst desperately trying to restore or create some credibility he had to take a sideswipe at the Treasurer, who is absent from Australia. The Deputy Leader and his Leader decided to display their vituperative remarks just at the time the Treasurer left the country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition not once in this session of Parliament has directed a question to the Treasurer. Yet as soon as the Treasurer's back is turned, as soon as he goes off to one of the most important international conferences in the international calendar, the Leader of the Opposition finds his courage and decides to attack the Treasurer, an attack which was continued here today by the shadow Treasurer. This is the behaviour of a pair of cowards who have no prescriptions and who can only attack the Treasurer in his absence. </PARA>
<PARA> I am going to turn to what purports to be the areas of substance in the contribution from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Firstly, he talked about the fact that there is too great a contribution from the public sector in relation to the growth in domestic product. The first thing he should remember is the caution that the Statistician directed him towards, that is, that quarterly figures on public sector activity are notoriously unreliable in the sense that they flay around considerably. What we need to do in this area is measure what contribution has come from the States and local government area and what contribution has come from the Commonwealth. When looking at the Commonwealth we need to look at that portion which has come from its business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The best measure of the Government's expenditure is not the national accounts but, rather, the Budget figures. We know that growth in spending by the Commonwealth on its own general purpose activities has been slight. In the last couple of years it has been negative. In more recent times there has been very little growth indeed. We did not have to search the national accounts to find that out. It was possible to discover that within the Budget papers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader should also recall that within that section of the national accounts dealing with public final demand are the Government's own corporations. That includes Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines Ltd and Telecom Australia. Is he really suggesting that those corporations, during this current period of investment by everyone else, should not be restrained from undertaking their own investment, either supported by borrowings or from retained earnings? That argument frankly falls to pieces. There is no argument to say that the Commonwealth has been making an undue contribution to growth through its own expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader then went on to investment and tried to paint this picture of investment falling apart. I have a small document which I wish to table. I hope that the Deputy Leader will read it. It shows that there has been some slight downturn in private fixed investment. It is coming down off a very high level indeed. We are now seeing, after the reduction, as a percentage of GDP, that business fixed investment is running along in total at about 13 per cent of GDP when the long-term average is between 10 and 11 per cent. If we go back to the period of office of the people on the other side of the House we find that it was as low as 9 per cent during that particular period. What has undeniably been happening is that there has been a burst of investment activity which has been unparalleled in the last 20 or 30 years. This is investment in constant prices. That is the appropriate measure when trying to look at the question from an historical perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the question of plant and equipment investment we see the same kind of picture where although there has been a slight reduction we are still running at the level of 8 per cent of GDP when the long-term average is around 7 per cent of GDP. It cannot be argued that the level of investment is still not very strong. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has only to go back to the capital stocks figures released last Friday, which reveal that the private stock of plant and equipment capital grew by 6.8 per cent in 1988-89 and the stock of buildings and structures grew to 6.2 per cent--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that he has referred to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report. He has had to scour the OECD report to find some tiny measure of qualified criticism of this Government. Any fair person reading the OECD report will see it as a very substantial endorsement of what this Government has done over seven years and of the present policy stance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On this investment front, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is trying to say that, just because we are adopting policies which have the effect of restraining the level of investment a little, this is tantamount to a collapse in business investment. Nothing could be further from the truth. He ought to go back to what happened in the period just before we were elected, the period of the last Government, when it demonstrated its great skill at creating a real recession. They are the circumstances in which investment really does fall to pieces. That has the effect of removing the capacity of the economy to respond later when economic growth is restored. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has failed to understand that the great challenge confronting Australia is to put behind us these periods of stop-start, of boom and bust, and rather be able to sustain a period of growth. The only way in which we will do that is if we can support a continuing period of investment and, more importantly, a wages policy that will actually work. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's criticisms concerning wages policy relates to productivity. He ought to know that productivity has been growing in this country even though there has been a considerable growth in the labour force generally. Normally in Australia's history, we find that productivity growth occurs when unemployment is highest. But we have seen productivity growing during a period of labour market expansion-something which the Opposition can only envy rather than emulate. </PARA>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Flinders talks of prescriptions about what needs to occur, he refers to a few old issues which the Opposition has been retailing, issues which the Government has primarily put on the agenda. These are the only issues which the Opposition can point to in terms of what needs to be done now. He has the gall to mention, as his first proposition, wages policy. The Opposition simply does not understand that the major reason we are not in a recession is that we have been able to restrain wages growth in this country during a period of relatively strong demand. Under any other policy-and most particularly under the policy advocated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-in a period of even half the level of growth that was sustained a year or so ago we would have seen a massive wages explosion followed by an explosion in inflation which could have been contained only by driving the country into a recession. Again and again the Opposition is driven back, inevitably, to this one solution-its only policy plank: create a recession; that is the only way in which it will solve the problems of the country. </PARA>

That easing, on top of a significant commodity price boom from the December quarter 1986, led to the overheating of the economy in 1988 and 1989, and that led, in turn, to the very high, murderous and destructive interest rates that we have had to contend with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was an election led messing up of the economy. There is no justification in the charge that the Acting Treasurer has levelled that the Opposition is `disappointed' at yesterday's national accounts figures. He has tried to make out that we are `mortified' that there is no recession in the technical sense. Yet if one looks behind these figures at everyday experience, it is only a question of degree as to what one calls a recession. We already have liquidations, record levels of bankruptcies, falling asset prices and rising unemployment. Indeed, these things fit precisely the sort of definition of a recession that the Treasurer himself has advanced. But I will not go into the semantics of the word `recession'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to look at yesterday's figures a little more closely. The Acting Treasurer made the point that the Opposition would not concede that, in fact, there has been some change in net exports and that this was a very good direction for policy to take. True it is that it is a good direction. The trouble is that it has a very small effect-I will come back to this later-as compared with the massive deterioration in the net export sector in 1988-89. That deterioration amounted to 4.4 per cent of gross domestic product. That is a minus 4.4 per cent element, while we now have this element of correction in the March quarter of 0.3 per cent. The whole point is that policy, in some respects, might be moving in the right direction, but it is moving too slow in the context of the situation in which we find ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Treasurer came close to describing these national accounts figures in the way the Treasurer described the December quarter figures-as a `beautiful set of figures'. Is this a beautiful set of figures? If one looks at the private sector of total demand-the technical jargon is `gross domestic expenditure'-in table 3 or table 8, one can see that the element in which there is an increase in private sector final demand, consumption, is entirely offset by other elements, particularly investment expenditure or capital expenditure on equipment. This gives an absolutely flat level of spending for the private sector as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The table shows an increase of almost one per cent in government expenditure and overall a 1.6 per cent increase in spending. The other 0.6 per cent is made up of increases in stocks. That reflects the very flat level of spending. Firms have not sold them so they have built up. Also there is the statistical discrepancy. It covers the Statistician's errors and omissions. The statistical discrepancy is up about 20 per cent. We have, if anything, a statistical discrepancy-led expansion of demand! In fact, it is ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> So, in the private sector, there is an absolutely flat level and that, when taken with the falling capital expenditure projections which I mentioned a moment ago, is the factor that will govern employment. Virtually the only net positive increase is the just short of one per cent increase in government spending as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, rather than doing something about curbing its own expenditure, has succeeded, through murderously high interest rates, in bringing private sector spending to a flat and, in the immediate future, falling level. If that is what the Government is trying to do and if that represents a set of beautiful figures, it has another thought coming. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday the Australian Bureau of Statistics made a statement on private capital expenditure. The fall-off in actual spending on equipment before all the adjustments was 23 per cent. From the December quarter to the March quarter there was a falling off of 23 per cent. With adjustments the figure is 10 per cent. That is still a very large downturn in the vital equipment that is needed to increase output and productivity in the export or import replacement area, which is where we want it. </PARA>
<PARA> The so-called investment boom-or, let us say, investment phase-that the Treasurer talked about--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A damp squib? Let us say that it is certainly bust. It is doubtful how far, even in the buoyant phase, business investment has been in the right areas. With continuing high inflation, high interest rates, volatile exchange rate and this Government's tax system, the fact is that too much investment has gone in the wrong direction. There has been too much `short termism' with investment going into office blocks, shopping complexes and so on outside the tradable goods area and not into the vital export and replacement area. That underlines the enormous hidden cost of the continuing high level of inflation in this country and the importance of combating inflation as the No. 1 objective of policy which most responsible commentators, but not this Government, have increasingly come to recognise. In fact, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia has led the charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My final point is the figures show that, despite the very small contribution to net exports, imports continue to rise. I believe that that underlines the nothing short of diabolical trouble in which this country finds itself. Despite the flat private sector demand, imports have continued to rise over this period. There is an overall deficit in the balance of payments of $17.6 billion to date, tending to $20 billion, which represents about 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product. That percentage is higher than last year's figure. That has occurred over a period when export prices were still buoyant, although there is some slippage of them now. What would be the likely outcome under the Government's policies if we did not have the current terms of trade situation? We are in an extremely difficult position. All we get is complacency, an attitude of, `She's all right' and `Everything's on track'. Yet we are in a vulnerable and exposed situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last two days we have heard a lot of the word `flat' about an economy which apparently is no longer recessed but flat. We have certainly heard two very flat contributions today. The speech by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith)-was the flattest speech I have heard him make. He normally comes in here with a bit of fire in the belly and puts on a fairly good performance. But if ever we saw a man who was disappointed, a man whose script has been taken away from him, it was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday morning, about an hour before the national account figures came out, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was still out there in the media preaching doom and gloom, recession, that the figures were about to come out and confirm what everyone knew-that is, the economy had fallen into a deep hole and deep recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the figures showed nothing of the sort. What they show is that Government policy is working, that in this country we needed a slow-down in terms of economic growth, that we needed a slow-down in terms of expenditure, and that we needed increases in gross domestic product. That is what the figures show. The Opposition was very disappointed because it wants Australia to be in a recession, firstly, because it believes that it is politically advantageous to it for Australia to be in a recession and, secondly, because it understands recessions. Opposition members are masters of recessions. They are the people who have caused recessions in this country. They know that recession is their only tool, weapon, to combat Australia's economic problems. That is why they are disappointed that Australia is not in recession and that is why we have seen this extremely flat performance by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The national account figures show that the Government's policy is broadly on track. What is important about that is that the Government has in place a consistent set of policies. In terms of wages policies, we have a mechanism through the accord which enables the Government to aim for and achieve a wages outcome. The Opposition says, `That is terrible. This accord, this great regulation of the labour market, is the first thing we will get rid of if we attain government'. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet during the election campaign and since then the Opposition has not been able to come into this House and face the Australian public and give an indication as to what its wages policy and the wages outcome would be. The famous `Who's to know' response from the then Leader of the Opposition-the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)-when asked about the outcome of the Opposition's wages policy has gone down in history. He was being honest because the Opposition had no idea what the outcome of its wages policy would be. </PARA>
<PARA> We have put in place a very tight fiscal policy, but the Opposition says that it is not tight enough, that we should be cutting back more. Yet when the Opposition went to the people a few months ago in the election it did not propose a tighter fiscal policy. What it proposed was unfunded tax cuts. It proposed a return of capital gains tax to the rich. That is what the Opposition proposed in terms of fiscal policy. It proposed no substantial cut at all. Yet this Government has reduced the size of government expenditure from about 29 per cent of gross domestic product to just under 23 per cent. That is the largest shift in terms of government spending which this country has ever seen. It means that all governments in this country, including State and local governments and local authorities, are making no call whatsoever on savings in this country. It is important that that important matter is understood, because that has been one of the principal reasons why we have seen such strong investment growth in this country over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition can decry this and say, `Well, it is in the wrong places', or `It is not strong enough'. But the fact remains that business investment over the last number of years has been at record levels. In fact, in many ways, it was at too strong a level because, combined with high levels of private consumption, it was adding significantly to our trade imbalance. That level of business investment, as with the level of private expenditure, had to be reduced, and that is why the Government has a tight fiscal policy, a determined wages policy and also a tight monetary policy in place. </PARA>
<PARA> We comprehend what this country's problems are and what needs to be put in place. We will not accept that a recession, that putting a country into reverse, is an acceptable solution. That is not a solution which this Government will accept. We will not accept huge numbers of the unemployed bearing the sole burden of our economic restructure. The Opposition might accept that quite happily, but the Government will not. What we are after is some form of equity, some sharing of the sacrifice, and we have seen that through the implementation of our policy prescription, through the wages accord and through keeping a real level of wages. Wages may not have kept up with inflation, but at least there has been an equitable sharing of the burden of the restraint in wages policy. We have seen that through the restructuring of the taxation system; that it is no longer simply a matter of choice for people whether they pay tax or not. We have seen it through the introduction of the capital gains tax, through the change in the business taxation system and the removal of double taxation on company dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Opposition's stated policy, and continued stated policy, is to say, `Well, we do not like the way in which all investment is going; too much is going into property and not enough into productive enterprises'. Yet the Opposition sat on the treasury bench year after year and allowed the double taxation of companies to continue, and it goes to the public advocating the abolition of the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> If there was any single measure which distorted the way in which investment was occurring in this country, surely, it was the lack of a capital gains tax, because that simply provided an incentive for people to be able to put their money, their investment, into items which produced no real productive gain for the country but gained them paper money without the payment of tax. The Opposition says, `Well, we do not think there should be such a tax. We want to give all that money back. We want to remove that tax'. Yet the Opposition has the nerve to come in here and say that there should be a change in the mix of Government policy. The Opposition bases its argument on, `We really do need to be a bit hairy chested now and bite the bullet and go on and introduce the consumption tax'. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no single item which has damaged the Deputy Leader Opposition more than this question of the consumption tax. When he was running for Leader of the Liberal Party, the key plank in his program was, `I have a good command of this. We have to take the tough decisions, and I am the leader that can do it. Let us stop pussyfooting around and get into a consumption tax'. It has been haunting him ever since. He would like to be able to back away from it, abandon it, but he knows that he cannot. He has been forced into proposing and continuing to advocate a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has already demonstrated that there is no net economic benefit at this stage from introducing a consumption tax and that, through the reform of the taxation system, the imperatives that were there in 1984-85 are no longer there. I would be very pleased and delighted if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would go to the Australian public at the next election on the argument of introducing a new tax. He would be a very brave Deputy Leader indeed and would prove that he is pretty hairy-chested if he went to the Australian public advocating the introduction of a new tax; or if he proposed that it be compensated through reductions in income tax rates, which would not be evenly distributed to lower income people. I challenge him to do that because I know what the result will be. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is still the shadow Treasurer in a couple of years' time-on his current performance one would have to doubt that-that would be the end for the honourable member for Flinders as regards his ambition to be Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 1, clause 2, line 8, leave out ``1 May 1990'', insert ``9 May 1990''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment to the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill that was proposed by the Senate would have the effect of removing clause 2 of the Bill which specifies its commencement date. The effect of this amendment is that, by reason of subsection 5 (1a) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the Bill would come into effect 28 days after the the date of royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA> This position is unacceptable to the Government, for the following reasons. First, it creates a great deal of uncertainty and difficulty for the motor vehicle industry. It was to avoid such confusion that the Government adopted the approach of specifying the commencement date for the measure. Secondly, it is contrary to the accepted practice that sales tax measures have effect as soon as practicable after their announcement. Had the Parliament been sitting when this announcement was made, the Government would have proposed that it take immediate effect. This is the usual practice with a sales tax announcement made in the context of a Budget or economic statement. It has been the established practice of past governments, irrespective of their political persuasion, to propose immediate effect so as to maximise the revenue gain if the announcement is a revenue raising measure. </PARA>
<PARA> Conversely, a reduction in sales tax that is effective immediately confers the benefit as quickly as possible. To do otherwise would introduce significant market distortions by encouraging taxpayers and their customers to delay purchases when tax is to be reduced, or to bring forward purchases when an announcement foreshadows a future tax increase. The date of effect that results from the amendment proposed by the Opposition in the Senate-that is, 28 days after the amending legislation receives the royal assent-would have a significant effect on the revenue to be raised and seriously confuse and distort the market. For these reasons the Government is disagreeing to the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in the interest of reducing the uncertainty and confusion the industry now finds itself in as a result of the stand taken by the Opposition, the Government is prepared to compromise by amending the commencement date for the measure to the day the amending legislation giving effect to it was introduced in the Parliament. However, I note that in the circumstances under which this measure was announced the Government considers the original approach to have been the appropriate one. Nevertheless, for the reasons I have outlined, I have moved an amendment to alter the commencement day from 1 May 1990 to 9 May 1990, the date of the introduction of the Bill. Accordingly, 9 May 1990 will be the date of effect for the increase in the rate of sales tax on luxury vehicles from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say I am disappointed in the contribution by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean). He has simply read a speech given to him by people in his Department and it seems he has not bothered to inform himself of the facts. He asserts that the procedure adopted by the Senate would have led to uncertainty but fails to understand-perhaps because he is a new Minister and a new member of this Parliament-that the date of royal assent, in fact, fixes the date of the coming into operation of this new law and it is the Government that has, within its own hands, the fixing of the date of the royal asset. His whole argument falls to the ground and his claims about uncertainty can easily be demonstrated, as I just have, as simply not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He talks much about former practice. Of course, it was this Government that announced its intention in the middle of an election campaign. The fact is that this is an example of the Government's competence. The whole measure has been a fiasco from start to finish. Never before have I seen the introduction of a tax Bill by an intending government-a political party-during an election campaign handled so incompetently. It is no good the Government attempting to shift the blame. The blame is very much in its own court and it has to wear the consequences of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's view is that the whole measure is flawed and I have advanced the very detailed arguments for that proposition during the second reading debate. It represents a big boost in protection at a time when there are claims that the Government is going the other way. What a joke it is that the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), a speaker on the matter of public importance, said that the Government is opposed to a consumption tax and here it is, introducing one. Of course this Government has introduced and massively increased consumption tax since 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced the proposal by press release, the intended commencement date was 1 April. This was later changed to 1 May, but the legislation was not introduced into the House of Representatives until 9 May. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition announced from the outset its total opposition to the proposed changes to the sales tax laws. In addition, we have opposed its retrospective commencement. In setting a retrospective commencement date of 1 May the Treasurer has acted in breach of the Government's own Cabinet handbook rules. Moreover, the Treasurer's penchant for retrospective legislation has been targeted for criticism by the Law Council of Australia. The Government's legislation has caused a legal dilemma for car dealers because of the current statutory prohibition on the collection of sales taxes in excess of prevailing rates, currently 30 per cent on luxury cars. This measure increases the figure from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's recent statement that the Australian Taxation Office will waive any legal penalties for breaches of this prohibition just shows a clear contempt for the laws of the nation and of the Parliament. The Treasurer is not entitled to tell people they can just disregard laws to suit his administrative convenience. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, the Government has attempted to hide its mismanagement behind a smokescreen of claims that these are Budget Bills and, by tradition, they are entitled to have retrospective operation. The Government has chosen to overlook the fact that the measure was announced during the election campaign and, therefore, was not part of the annual Budget. It has also overlooked the fact that Budget Bills have retrospectivity only to the date of introduction and not earlier, as proposed in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's inept handling was highlighted when the Australian Democrats joined with the coalition to do the right thing in the Senate, clean up this legislation and delete the 1 May commencement date-a position, I might say, endorsed by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills which is chaired by the Government's very own Labor Senator, Senator Barney Cooney. He is to be commended in this case for saying what was, in fact, clearly the right thing. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the case serves to illustrate the kind of problems which `legislation by press release' can create and why, therefore, the practice should be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the Democrats have backed off-done another backflip, or somersault-and lost the courage of their own convictions. They voted with the coalition on the amendment and now have done another one of their famous deals with the Government to extricate the Government from a mess of its own making. They have now agreed to the 9 May start. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole fiasco could have been avoided had the Government acceded to the coalition's call for an extended May session sitting of the House of Representatives. It sat only seven days out of seven months; it is no wonder there are problems if the parliamentary timetable is pushed by the Government. The Government stubbornly stuck to its original proposals, pushed a lot of legislation through by guillotine-from memory, this measure also had the guillotine applied to it-gagging debate as it did on a range of measures including sales tax Bills. This is about as clear a case of government incompetence when it comes to dealing with taxation law as one can imagine. The Government has been shown to be inept. The response from the Minister, just reading out the words given to him by his departmental minions, is not good enough and is clearly to be seen through by anybody who has followed this debate closely. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the coalition will not oppose this amendment, but we will continue to voice in the community at large our opposition to the general measure. It will not bring forward the revenue that the Government hopes it will and I think it deserves to be condemned. The Opposition will not oppose this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>Very briefly, the Senate, in dealing with the package of sales tax Bills, also requested the House of Representatives to amend each of the Sales Tax (Nos 1 to 9) Amendment Bills-these have the effect of imposing the tax at the 50 per cent rate on certain luxury motor vehicles-and the amendment removes the commencement clause from each Bill. The effect of this amendment would be identical to that previously outlined in my comments on the Bill we have just dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> The request for amendment of these Bills is also unacceptable to the Government for the reasons outlined in my earlier comments. The Government is not agreeing to this request, but is moving an amendment to the commencement provision in each Bill so that the Bills will take effect from 9 May 1990. This means that the 50 per cent rate of sales tax for luxury vehicles will commence to be imposed on that date. </PARA>

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>As I explained to the House a couple of weeks ago, the purpose of the Occupational Superannuation (Reasonable Benefit Limits) Amendment Bill 1990 is to amend the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to implement changes to the reasonable benefit limits. The Bill was passed through the House on 16 May 1990 and by the Senate last Monday, 28 May 1990. The Bill has been returned to the House because the Government moved amendments to the Bill in the Senate and those amendments were passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments were necessary to correct minor defects in the drafting of the Bill and these defects were discovered by the draftsman after the Bill had passed through the House. Those defects were in those provisions of the Bill which would allow the making of regulations to require certain information to be supplied to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner for the purpose of determining a person's reasonable benefit limit. The provisions as previously drafted appear not to be wide enough to allow the prescribing of all the information required for that purpose. The amendments now proposed to the Bill correct these defects, and I commend the Bill to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill 1990 consists of about three lines. It is designed to repeal the Airlines Agreement Act 1981, the Airlines Equipment Act 1958 and the Independent Air Fares Committee Act 1981 and to make some subsequent amendments to other Bills. In many respects this Bill is one of the most significant pieces of legislation in the history of Australian aviation because it is the final instrument that will get rid of a regulated airline service within Australia with the advent of the deregulation of Australian airline services on 31 October this year. In that respect it is significant, but it is significant that Australia has finally taken this step more than 10 years after the United States, five years after New Zealand, and quite a number of years after the Canadians and the Europeans, who have already entered the road of deregulation of their airline services. The Government cites this as one of its major planks in terms of micro-economic reform in Australia-and well it can be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage we should reflect on the history of aviation in Australia. There is no doubt that the two-airline agreement, which is approaching 40 years of age, was designed to provide Australia with a stable airline service. We could go well back into the history of the old Australian National Airlines, the advent of its takeover by Ansett Airlines of Australia and the difficulties in the original establishment of Trans-Australia Airlines. It was really this instrument that did give stability to the airline services through the late 1950s and into the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it would be fair to say that by the time the 1970s came along, the two-airline agreement had well outlived its usefulness. I suppose that if we look back at the more recent history and the decision by the then Fraser Government to move towards deregulation we can see, through a number of reports that were set up by various governments, the effect the two-airline agreement has had on domestic aviation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The original Bill that came in which set the path towards deregulation of Australia's domestic airlines was the Airline Agreement Act 1981. It was ratified by the coalition under the Fraser Government and basically retained the longstanding airlines agreement between the Commonwealth, Ansett Transport Industries and the Australian National Airlines Commission, which is now known as Australian Airlines, with some modifications. During the 1950s and 1960s public perception and government policy saw the existing agreement as the best vehicle to provide services and reasonable fare pricing. But during the 1970s and into the 1980s the two-airline agreement came under increasing pressure as the public no longer saw the duopoly as acting in their interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The public rightly thought that this meant that they were paying far too much for their air fares. The 1981 agreement provided that three years notice be given from January 1987 at the earliest for the Act to be terminated. That provision was activated in June 1987 by the present Government, with 31 October 1990 set as the date for termination. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision must be seen in the context of preceding inquiries into domestic aviation in Australia, commencing with the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review that was commissioned by the then Minister, Mr Peter Nixon, which reported to the Government in 1978. It acknowledged that changes should be made to allow for greater competition, but at that time regarded the two-airline agreement as the system most suited to Australia. The Government then also appointed the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares in 1981, which was known as the Holcroft inquiry. It is regarded as something of a catalyst for the changes in domestic aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Holcroft report described the two-airline policy and stated objectives of increasing competition as two apparently opposed concepts. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The interplay of market forces is either directly vetoed by these arrangements-that is the two-airline arrangements-or can only be shortlived because any disruption of the status quo in one area will automatically necessitate compensatory adjustments elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government was also moving to ensure greater commercial orientation for Australian Airlines and other publicly owned enterprises at that time. Following the dissolution of Parliament in 1980, 1981 really became a watershed for domestic aviation with the Australian National Airlines Repeal Act introduced to provide Australian Airlines, which was then Trans-Australia Airlines, with the opportunity to proceed on a commercial footing and to free the Government from direct control of the airline. The Airlines Agreement Act of 1981 was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> This significantly reduced government regulation of industry was intended to encourage more competition between trunk operators and non-trunk operators. Some of the changes included the third operators being given general consent to import turbo-jet aircraft, without policy restriction. We also saw airfreight deregulated. Scope was provided for regional and commuter operators to provide services between trunk ports. Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia could compete in the area of discount fares. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministerial authority over domestic air fares was transferred to the independent committee and an air fare structure was established to avoid cross-subsidisation from long-haul to short-haul, and full-fare to discount passengers. We well remember in this House the very great arguments that were undertaken at that time as to whether or not we should proceed so slowly towards deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the intervening years of 1981-87 Australia witnessed many substantial changes. We saw East-West Airlines entering the market in a limited, but effective, assault on the major operators. It was able to reduce prices which were either matched by the majors or countered by the offer of even more attractive discounts to passengers. Even though it was not a direct party to the two-airlines agreement, East-West Airlines enjoyed some of the benefits of a regulated environment which, in turn, assisted it with fare pricing, market share and profitability. East-West was purchased a few years ago by Ansett Transport Industries. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, Australia felt the effects of the tourist boom. Regions such as Cairns and the Gold Coast entered rapid development phases, with tourism the driving force behind economic growth. Another thing happened: Australians became more willing to travel by plane for their holidays and the issue of air fare pricing became hotly contested in the public forum. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 we saw the Independent Review of Economic Regulation of Domestic Aviation report-the May report. It was commissioned because there were mounting concerns that inefficiencies were rife within the airline industry. The May report noted that the major airlines showed little initiative in offering new fare types more suited to consumer needs and budgets. In particular, the absence of off-peak discount fares, which had the potential to stimulate tourist travel, was criticised. </PARA>
<PARA> May argued that the system favoured business travellers at the expense of recreational travellers. The May report was also critical of the air fare settings endorsed by the Independent Air Fares Committee, which applied identical formulae to light traffic regional routes as those applied to heavily trafficked capital city routes, thereby mitigating possible fare reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> The May report also argued that the two major airlines deliberately sought full-fare, high yield, frequent flier business travellers to the detriment of the lower end of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> The report argued that neither airline had very much to gain from attempts to increase market share and develop new markets, as any gains under the two-airline agreement must be shared 50:50 with the competitor. The consultancy work by Travers Morgan Pty Ltd for the May Committee determined that the duopoly partners operated at labour productivity levels some 35 per cent below the norm of a large sample of overseas airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Travers Morgan also found that despite the inefficiencies of the airlines, they had been provided with conditions conducive to greater profit levels and more stable financial environments than those available to other airlines overseas. This was being achieved, according to the May findings, despite underutilisation of the demand for air travel in Australia. May also found that usage of air travel was well below that of the United States, and that the market potential has not been maximised through offering innovative fare packages. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, May attributed the inefficiencies of domestic aviation, public disenchantment, higher profitability, lower productivity and cross-subsidisation to the two-airline agreement. It was following the May report in January 1987 that the Government took steps to cancel the two-airline agreement as from 31 October this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that in that history of the two-airline agreement we come to the point where we must decide exactly what we are going to see in terms of a deregulated airline system in Australia from that date of 31 October this year. There is a real concern in the community that the deregulation of Australia's domestic airline industry will come with a whimper rather than a large bang. There is a real concern that many of the benefits that have been touted as flowing from deregulation may in fact not happen in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This has occurred for a number of reasons. In particular, there has been an inability of most of the new operators actually to get off the ground. That has happened for a number of reasons. They have had difficulty raising the finance to be able to equip themselves to compete with the two major carriers. Falls in household disposable income, the high rate of business failures and across-the-board economising have reduced demand for air services. If we look at the statistics that were provided this week by the Department of Transport and Communications, we can see that usage of the domestic airlines is a little above 80 per cent of the figure that it was this time 12 months ago. The present economic climate is certainly not conducive to the entry of new carriers in numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that a major contributing force to the situation in which possible new carriers are having difficulty in raising funds can be laid fairly and squarely at the airlines dispute of last year. While the dispute may have cost the Commonwealth something in the vicinity of $70m it has cost the two major domestic carriers-Australian and Ansett-a great deal more than that. Neither airline is indicating just what its losses might be, but it would be fair to say that industry reports indicate that the loss by Australian Airlines is well in excess of $250m and by Ansett Transport Industries in excess of $175m. The plain fact is that anybody who is looking at investing in airlines would be fairly scared at the moment with those figures about. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another reason and this has also been cited as one of the reasons why one of the more prominent major players in a new airline in Australia is not proceeding at this stage with the establishment of another carrier. That was the situation regarding the terminal space which has been under examination by the Trade Practices Commission. While there is a lot of talk now about access being made available to the airlines, I think there is some doubt within the money markets as to just how fair dinkum the Government and the operators of the present airlines are in allowing proper access to any new carrier that might be able to get off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> There would seem to be really only one carrier that may have the possibility of getting off the ground in the next 12 months and that is the airline Compass which is headed by Mr Brian Grey. I am sure any fair-minded person would wish Mr Grey well in his endeavours to try to get some real competition into the industry at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other areas, too, that are causing concern to potential operators. One is the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. We heard the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) today give us the most incredible tirade on how it was all our fault on the Opposition benches that the third runway was not going to work and was not going to go ahead. In actual fact it was the coalition that gave the go-ahead for the third runway to be undertaken in Sydney from 1984 and, if the Government had not knocked back that plan, that runway would be operational now. If the Government does in fact decide to proceed with the third runway, we will not see that in operation in Sydney until at least 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> There has to be that sort of cooperation between the Government and the operators, and indeed the whole community, for Sydney Airport to reach its true potential. There has to be that widely spaced runway, the upgrading of the equipment and a major reformation of the air traffic control system in Australia if people are going to see the benefits of deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Already we are reading press reports that Ansett in New South Wales is looking at providing services under deregulation that will completely avoid Sydney. That is probably a good thing in terms of the Australian travellers, but in fact we must realise that Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is the real hub of Australian operations. Something like 75 per cent of the fleets of the domestic airlines pass through Sydney Airport between 6 and 9 a.m. every day. More than 60 per cent of international visitors to Australia pass through Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. That situation must be resolved in a hurry. Otherwise, we are going to damage our overseas reputation very much indeed, and we are not going to have a fully efficient domestic airline system. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other difficulties that I think is facing the prospect of new carriers coming into the market is that Ansett and Australian Airlines dominate the market. They hold the present market share, they have the infrastructure and they have the onward connections. Threats have been made, especially by Ansett, that any new carrier that might enter the system is going to have to have long pockets because they will drive it out of the market. That is what competition is all about. We hope that in the long term Australian travellers will see some major reforms and some major fare innovations following deregulation on 31 October. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is very difficult to try to compare the Australian market with that of the United States, there are a couple of parallels. Prior to deregulation, about 20 per cent of American citizens used their domestic airlines for their major travel. Since the advent of deregulation, that figure has now gone up to 68 per cent of the population now using domestic airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> A very interesting study has been undertaken by the University of Mississippi. Apart from the fact that the Americans did get cheaper fares from deregulation, there were many other benefits. I know that the Pacific Highway, Mr Deputy Speaker, passes through your electorate. One of the things that happened in the United States that can be directly attributable to deregulation is the fact that the road toll declined because more people used the airways instead of road transport. The airways are very much safer than driving on the roads. There has been a real decline in the number of people killed on United States highways. The other thing was that there was an appropriate reduction in many areas in the amount of money that had to be dedicated to road spending. That is directly attributable to deregulation as well. </PARA>
<PARA> There was another point, and I think it is a point that we should well make here. In the United States, the airports themselves are fairly independent. One of the difficulties that we have in terms of deregulation in Australia is that the Government aerodromes all come under the auspices of one body, the Federal Airports Corporation. While we have moved to convert the Federal Airports Corporation into a fully established government business enterprise, that does not necessarily provide us with the sort of competition that is probably required to encourage new carriers-and indeed the existing carriers-to put on services which may be cheaper, especially into certain areas. </PARA>
<PARA> During my speech just a couple of weeks ago, I referred to what can happen if airports are put into a competitive situation. I hope that, as the ongoing process of deregulation evolves in Australia, we will not give that away either because that is a very real way of making sure that we can get some efficiencies in the system and that we can get some competition into the system. Hopefully, that would be passed on to the Australian travelling public in the form of lower air fares. </PARA>
<PARA> What is going to happen in Australia after 31 October? It would seem at this stage that we will be stuck with the two major carriers-Australian and Ansett. There is the possibility that a little later on a third carrier may come into the system. But there are still so many constraints on the industry in terms of the infrastructure and in terms of the procedures that perhaps not very much is going to happen at all in terms of benefits to the Australian travelling public. I express some concern that the established carriers seem-to me anyway-to be taking up that old philosophy that was mentioned in the May report of going for the top end of the market. In other words, much of the concentration will still be put into the business traveller rather than looking for the have-nots in our community who have not been able to travel and who cannot afford to. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that a new carrier can get off the ground that would make air travel around Australia cheap enough for all people to share in it. I also express some concern that, when deregulation comes, although there may be some fare innovations at different hours of the night, there may also be some major restrictions in services. I think people should be aware that that could well be a consequence of deregulation. Obviously, the established carriers are going to look at the profitable routes. The Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne sectors will be served very well and other capital cities will probably receive `adequate' services. We could well see a drop in the nature of the services to Hobart and a possible reduction of services to areas such as Darwin and Mount Isa which truly depend upon air services now. It is not for me to say that I believe there should be some regulation to provide those services, but people should be aware that the major carriers under this system have the possibility of reducing the number and type of services that can operate into those ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The airlines have already put the Australian travelling public on notice regarding that. They have said that they will look at getting out of some of those thin routes. What could that mean? It could mean an innovation that could be of advantage to Australians-a situation where horses for courses could be established. There could be the emergence of a number of regional airlines that would probably do very well. In the New South Wales context, that is probably already happening where carriers such as Hazelton Airlines and Kendall Airlines are now getting their equipment right and are preparing very hard indeed to go into a deregulated market. I pay tribute to a carrier like Hazelton, for example, for what it has already done and for the benefits that deregulation can bring to some of those country areas, especially in western New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned that, while jet services and big aircraft services may not be operating to some of those major ports to the extent that they are now, what has happened, for example, between Dubbo and Sydney is one of the most exciting aspects of deregulation. Hazelton has moved into that route and has virtually knocked Air New South Wales out of it. Dubbo was subjected to a Fokker F27 flight in the morning and one at night. Hazelton is now virtually running a shuttle service between Dubbo and Sydney, using Dubbo as a hub. I think it would be fair to say that most people in western New South Wales recognise that that innovation has done a great deal in reducing the distances and reducing the time that is required in travelling between their country centres and the capital city of Sydney. While we might see some change of equipment, I think that in terms of the emergence of these new regional carriers some exciting concepts could be available for a number of these country centres. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think we should ever forget that the original thought and intention of deregulation was to provide competitive services for all Australians. We should never forget that in this country only 16 per cent of Australians have travelled on an aeroplane. There is a sense of expectation out there in the community that air fares will drop dramatically. I just hope that that can happen. I hope that even though we may have a Clayton's deregulation come 31 October the decisions that will be taken by the Government in terms of making sure that terminal situations are right, that airport infrastructure is right and that there are absolutely no impediments to any new carrier getting into the marketplace will ultimately see the advent of new airlines coming into Australia-new airlines that may not take the same form as the present carriers but can provide much cheaper travel for a whole new holiday market. That has very great implications for Australians. It has very great implications for the tourist industry, both within Australia and from overseas, because we are still regarded as one of the most expensive countries to move around in. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that the Government, come 31 October, will not just say, `Well, deregulation is here. That is it. We have done our best'. We have to make sure that we proceed along the road in opening up every possible form of competition we can to make sure that Australians do get a fair go in terms of the cost of their air travel. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disappointed in the Minister's statement of a few weeks ago when he ruled out the possibility of Qantas operating on some domestic routes. If nothing does happen after 31 October and we are stuck with a status quo where the two major carriers continue to rule the airwaves at the prices we have I see Qantas as a possible lever of opening up competition. People will argue that Qantas would have the prospect of driving either one of the other domestic carriers off the route altogether. I do not think that that is true. There is certainly a good prospect of Qantas being able to operate on some of those internal routes, especially between areas such as Sydney and Cairns, providing innovative fares for holiday travellers. I do not think we should lose that particular thought as a possible option of providing further competition if it does not happen in the domestic sense. </PARA>
<PARA> My appeal to the Government would be to maintain a monitoring of the situation, to ensure that any encumbrances to new industry are removed and to make sure that we do not ultimately just have that Clayton's deregulation and that there be full moves for fully competitive air fares that will at last provide some innovation for Australian air travellers and for visitors coming to see us from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Opposition welcomes the Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill 1990 as the final instrument in introducing deregulation into the Australian domestic airline system on 31 October this year. We hope that we will see some benefits. We have some doubts under the present circumstances as to just what will happen but we hope that even though as we enter that deregulated phase it will not be the end of Australians trying to be innovative in themselves and providing the best possible means of air transport at the best possible rates for all Australians and those who visit this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill 1990. I do so for quite a number of reasons. The contribution made by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) was, as ever, well researched and contained a number of issues which are worthy of consideration. I feel sure that there are honourable members on both sides of this Parliament who would endorse some of those sentiments, perhaps not all of them but certainly some of them. I would like to take up one or two of these as I contribute to this debate this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is fair to remind honourable members at the outset that this latest legislation is part of an ongoing process that the Hawke Government has been involved with-that is, in bringing a great deal of reform, particularly micro reform, in the area of transportation, especially in the aviation industry. The honourable member for Fadden referred to the establishment of the Federal Airports Corporation as a government business enterprise, hiving it away from control by government and asking it to operate in a totally deregulated environment almost where little government control and regulations over its operations are brought to bear. That was certainly part and parcel of the Government's commitment to looking at the aviation industry. I think it will be an effective tool. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the honourable member's point about the establishment of some of the facilities at different locations around Australia but with regard to Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport I think he also must recognise and concede that a lot of work is going on there at the moment, consideration is being given at all terminals in respect of access to other airlines, and the problem to which he has alluded in his contribution today may not become as great as perhaps he is worried about. </PARA>
<PARA> Micro-economic reform is the buzz word at present. It is the buzz word involving economists, people in Australia who believe that at this point in time the Australian economy needs some sort of kick-start in that regard. Again I simply remind those people who are concerned about this that it has been an ongoing process in aviation. This legislation will simply continue that process and take it one step further. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation also brings into clear focus the concern that many people might have-that concern may have a philosophical base-about the role that governments play in the provision of some form of infrastructure in a country or whether or not it is the role of private enterprise only to be involved in that. What we have seen in Australia over a long period is two major domestic airlines come into existence and prosper under the various route systems which they have developed right around this country and the services that they have provided. What we will see now is an environment created where other airlines, providing the capital infrastructure and the other costs associated with the establishment of an additional airline will allow them, can come into the system. It is all well and good to talk about the fact that we hope the legislation will allow this to happen. It is like anything else: if we do not create the environment in the first place to allow other airlines to come in they are not going to come in. If the Government steps in and continually says, `We are going to allow only two airlines and that is all there is to it on domestic routes' then certainly competition is not encouraged in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> From a purely philosophical base, which I am sure most honourable members in this place would entertain, it will create the environment whereby we can get a degree of competition. The end result of that, as the honourable member for Fadden said, will hopefully be lower air fares. The people of Australia, the travelling public, will benefit. Whilst we are talking about the travelling public of Australia and those who use the airline system, we must also remember-the honourable member for Fadden used the statistic of only 16 per cent of the Australian public ever having been on an aircraft-that the regular fliers make up about 5 per cent of Australia's population. It is not really a concern to the masses out there. I also take the point that if airline fares are cheaper because of competition being introduced and if the airline companies themselves are offering some sort of package deals on holidays in Australia then that will benefit people who in the past have not been in that market. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to see at present that one of the major domestic airline carriers-I think it is Australian Airlines Ltd from memory-has announced that it will slash in half air fares between the major cities of Australia. I am sure that that will encourage a lot of people who perhaps in the past have not thought about travelling to do so. We should not forget East-West Airlines Ltd and Air New South Wales which are offering discount fares in the marketplace, albeit not on a jet aircraft, albeit that it takes a bit longer to get between point A and point B. Those sorts of air fares and fare deals are in place now. One hopes that come 31 October, the suggested commencement of this legislation, that that will be translated into even greater savings. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take the point that was raised about regional airlines developing and some of the smaller centres perhaps not being serviced by jets because it is no longer profitable for those airline companies to operate into them. That is a decision entirely for the companies involved. That is a decision that they will make based on, I would imagine, strong, proper and good economic rationale. At the end of the day it will be based on the profit motive and the figures that turn out in their balance sheets at the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> If a route is not profitable any more, we cannot really blame the airlines for not going in there. On the other hand, a degree of social responsibility would suggest that people in outback and rural Australia need to have an efficient service, preferably by air, to get between where they reside and the capital cities of Australia to which they want to go. To that extent, the regional services-Hazelton Air Services was mentioned, and there are many others around Australia that are growing up-will continue to contribute a very important and significant service for rural Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The infrastructure that has been purchased for those people is looking ahead; there is some vision from those people as to what will happen. I commend them for it. I think it is appropriate. I think that all honourable members in this place would see that the airlines have looked ahead, and have had a degree of vision. Certainly, that degree of vision has been coloured by what the cash register will turn over at the end of the financial year-and many of us would say, `Why not?'. That is fine, so long as a service is being provided. </PARA>
<PARA> I take exception to one comparison that was made in the contribution by the honourable member for Fadden; that is, the size of the United States market. This happens quite often in a lot of debates when people compare Australia with some other country. They look at Australia, with a population of 17 million, and at the United States, with a population of 230 million or 240 million people. Quite clearly economies of scale are involved in the United States which cannot possibly operate in Australia because of its very nature of scattered urban and rural developments-three-quarters of Australia still lives in that crescent between Brisbane and Adelaide around the coast. Those areas are serviced adequately now by the airlines that are in operation. As I have suggested, and as the honourable member for Fadden has suggested, regional airlines will probably pick up the other areas. That is fine. That is the existing situation. It has been appropriate to meet the needs as they are now. But we cannot compare that situation with that in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States the developed areas are much more widespread, for a variety of reasons. Over a long period urban centres have grown up in different parts of the United States because of airline deregulation and so on. Major hub centres have been established right around the United States for the major airlines, whether they be in Charlotte, Chicago or wherever. The United States airlines have had the opportunity to tap into a market where many people have a greater capacity to pay because of deregulation, because there are more airlines, because the competition is tougher and because the air fares are lower. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of those airlines offer very relaxed, no-frill services. It often amazes me on those occasions when I travel from Sydney to Canberra, which is a 22-minute flight, that the airline attendants go to the trouble to serve refreshments. If that sort of service were being offered in the United States, I imagine that passengers would not be given much at all. In some other countries, passengers are probably given a doggie bag containing their lunch-no matter how far they are travelling. The point is that all of these companies will have to reassess not only their capital commitment but also the service component they offer. I suspect that it is that service component that will start to sort out the different airlines that may come into the system from those that are already there. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no secret at the moment that both Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia are involved in a great deal of cutthroat competition. For example, recently one of the executives from Ansett came to survey me-I think Ansett is surveying all members of this Parliament-as to how that airline was going compared with Australian Airlines and whether any services could be offered that would be an additional inducement to fly Ansett rather than Australian Airlines. That has been occasioned by the fact that Ansett is not going as well as Australian at the moment, particularly in the business market. The business market, which the honourable member for Fadden referred to, is the dominant one. It is the one that the bickies come from for the airline companies. Clearly they are pitching their sales at that level. I am just not convinced at this stage that the concern in the community is perhaps as large as it may have been. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting factor in respect of the airline problem of last year is-as, I think, the honourable member for Fadden said-that 80 per cent only of the pre-problem capacity of the airlines has been reached. One thing that apparently has happened as a result of that is that a lot more business people have suddenly found fax machines and the telephone-they have probably seen the Telecom Australia advertisements on television-or companies have suddenly realised that there is a bus or a car that can get people to and from their destinations so that they do not have to spend money on their executives flying between Melbourne and Sydney or Sydney and Brisbane or wherever as frequently as they did before, making some savings for the company but at the same time impacting on the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Those sorts of anomalies must also be taken into consideration when we are looking at ways to explain why airlines are performing to the extent they are at the moment. I also believe that many of those services that I have mentioned will at the end of the day be determined by the demand that is there. Again, I use the example of Canberra now. Many honourable members will know from experience that pre-problem there was a variety of aircraft flights between Sydney and Canberra at nearly all times during the day, most of them jet services. If we look at the airline timetables that are around at present, we will see that there have been some significant changes. There are two jet services in the morning and a couple of jet services in the afternoon, but the rest of the flight times are taken up by East-West or some of the other minor airlines operating between Canberra and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a problem in that, if we do not get on a 9.45 a.m. flight from Sydney, the next one leaves at 1.10 in the afternoon and arrives here at about 1.45. There is a fairly significant gap which at this stage has not been met by the airlines. The reason it has not been is that demand in the past has not been there for it to be. The people who come to Canberra quite regularly-the people in the bureaucracy, members of parliament, the lobbyists and so on who would be the major users-want to have that ability to pick and choose when they come. But if at the end of the day those services are not making the dollars for the airlines, they will not bother. So the flying behaviour of people will change and be occasioned by the airlines' schedules as they are brought out. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of problem to which the honourable member for Fadden was referring when he was talking about Mount Isa and other isolated communities, which are major service centres but which, it would seem at least, may have to resort to having a regional airline service look after them, rather than the major airlines with jets. Again, all of that will be determined by, firstly, the level of demand for the service and, secondly, whether the airlines are prepared to bear some sort of a social cost in just keeping the airline on anyway. Maybe the airlines could balance having a jet go to Mount Isa with the fact that they have 10 or so running between Sydney and Brisbane. The airlines may still make their money on those routes and the bottom line profit at the end of the day, once they take out a social cost of providing a service to Mount Isa and the isolated communities, may still give a reasonable profit. Perhaps that is not the sort of thing that people would do. Nevertheless, it is a reasonable suggestion that some people might like to act on. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will certainly do what the Government set out to do; that is, to regulate the airlines. It will provide the environment, the atmosphere, in which the airline companies, as they exist now, and those that are proposed in the future-there has been speculation-will be able to create a degree of competition. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, what warrants careful watching in this whole exercise is the issue of the Prices Surveillance Authority monitoring air fares and the Government not being involved in controlling them and having to approve increases or decreases in air fares. That is something which the Prices Surveillance Authority must give consideration to. If we are to provide that environment where fares are lower, or the environment where there is competition which should translate into cheaper air fares, we must be certain-I think we would be derelict in our duty if we were not certain-that those benefits will be passed on to the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to encourage people to use the airline systems. We need to see the airlines offering attractive packages which could involve travelling to holiday destinations and giving a stimulus to the tourist industry in this country. I am sure that the sorts of packages which the airline companies should start to think about now will ultimately have an effect on whether people choose to holiday in Australia or whether they choose to go overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the thing that really galls many people in this place, representing constituents as we all do, is the fact that many people can travel from Sydney to Fiji and spend seven or eight days there for about half of what it would cost them to fly between Sydney and Perth-in the same country-in which case they would be seeing part of their own country. So I hope that with deregulation comes a variety of holiday packages that will encourage people to see Australia first and to use the airlines as a first step in getting to all of the tourist destinations and, of course, giving that much needed boost to Australia's tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House is worthy of support. I am pleased to see that the Opposition is giving it its total support this afternoon. I look forward, as I am sure many honourable members do, to its implementation on 31 October. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill brings about the long awaited demise of the iniquitous two-airline policy that has seen Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines Ltd lead a cosy, inefficient life at the expense of Australia's air travelling public for nearly 40 years. As the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) has mentioned, the legislation is, therefore, more than welcome. But at the same time it requires that we take a serious look at the sincerity of the Government's commitment to competitive domestic air travel. There is great cause for concern that various arrangements will remain in place under this Government that will inhibit the operations of new entrants to the domestic air travel industry and so reduce competition in the manner of the outgoing two-airline agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has shown, on numerous occasions, its determination to prop up Australia's two inefficient airlines-one government owned, the other in the possession of Sir Peter Abeles, the good mate of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). The pilots dispute saw this Government providing an enormous taxpayer funded compensation package to the airlines to subsidise their, and the Government's, inept handling of that dispute. The true extent of this package is yet to be fully accounted for or explained. In addition to these subsidies, the Government has licensed exorbitant increases in air fares over the past year through the agency of the so-called Independent Air Fares Committee (IAFC). In July 1989 the IAFC raised air fares by 7.5 per cent-as if they were not already high enough-and again, at the beginning of this year, the Committee awarded the airlines a further 5 per cent increase. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Jull" NAMEID="MH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr Jull</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was cynical.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was more than that: it was grossly irresponsible. We have seen a hike of 12.5 per cent in domestic air fares in the short space of six months. As if that is not enough, the duopoly now has before the IAFC an application for a further 10 per cent increase. We can have reasonable confidence that the IAFC will grant that, or a goodly portion of it; so we are probably looking at something like a hike of 22 3/4 per cent in domestic air fares in this country in the space of 12 months under this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Jull" NAMEID="MH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He eventually said that there was no dispute. The Committee defended its January rise by arguing that it was necessary in order to assist the airlines to recover from the pilots dispute-that was the basic reason for the hike in January this year. To compound matters, the press release issued by the IAFC on 23 January this year argued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It was reasonable for a proportion of the additional costs already sustained (and continuing to be sustained) by the airlines . . . to be partially recouped through a fare increase. </PARA>
<PARA>But the Committee failed to carry through the logic behind that January fare increase to its obvious conclusion. Once these additional costs-and we have not been told what the costs consist of or amount to-have been met and the airlines return to normal operations, surely that January increase should be discontinued, in July this year. If it were given on the basis that it defrayed costs incurred by the airlines during the pilots dispute, and if the airlines are correct in their claim that services are back to something like normal, that 5 per cent should surely be deducted. It is a period almost equivalent to the term of the dispute and, surely, over that time-given that the schedules are back to something like normal-the airlines would have made up that 5 per cent. So if the Independent Air Fares Committee, as its last act, knocks 5 per cent off the airlines' claim and discounts it, that will be something. If it treats the 10 per cent claim with the disdain it deserves, the airlines will not get a damned thing, and that will be the best contribution that the IAFC has made in its long existence. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, we have had from this Government, through the agency of the IAFC, arbitrary fare hikes to underwrite the continued inefficient operations of the domestic airline duopoly. Obviously it was important to maintain the maximum possible degree of service during the pilots dispute. Even today there is evidence-in the form of heavy bookings, changed flight schedules, delays and the like-that services have not returned to normal despite the claims of the operators. </PARA>
<PARA> But the fact is that new and independent operators are promising to reduce air fares by between 20 per cent and 50 per cent following deregulation on 1 November. This suggests to me that Ansett and Australian, rather than being awarded further fare increases, should have been forced to cut their exorbitant operating costs in order to pay their own way through, and as a consequence of, the pilots dispute. Keeping fares down should have been the overriding criterion observed by the IAFC. </PARA>
<PARA> To give an example: Southern Cross Airlines, which hopes to be one of the new entrants after 1 November, plans to employ half the number of personnel per fleet aircraft that either Ansett or Australian does. No wonder Sir Peter Abeles thinks that labour costs are one of the reasons deregulation will not deliver the expected benefits. He is speaking from his own sorry experience. In reality, however, the scope for forcing efficiency gains on Ansett and Australian has obviously been great and opportunities have been missed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill means that the sham justifications of the so-called Independent Air Fares Committee will soon be a thing of the past-and good riddance. But the vision many of us have for a new, competitive domestic airlines industry is apparently not one that is entirely shared by this Government. We are hearing statements from the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) and others which suggest that deregulation will not be all that it is cracked up to be. We need to ask them why. </PARA>
<PARA> This week the Minister revealed his view, which is that in 10 years time it is likely that there will still be two dominant airlines in Australia, after a competitive shake-out of the industry. Sir Peter Abeles has been smugly threatening that only one airline-presumably his own-will survive deregulation. His best case prediction is for a short and sharp involvement in airline efficiency brought about by the new operators, followed by a return to a two-airline system. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a common view, it seems, on the part of major players in the industry and the Government that, while some improvements will result from deregulation, the number of major operators will not increase beyond the present two and fare discounts will not be great. While this legislation should bring about some of the desired benefits, obviously the greater the number of major operators the more competition and the more benefits, such as lower air fares, there will be. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all familiar with the problems faced by domestic and international aviation in Australia, most notably the problem of the small size of the passenger market. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), who has just spoken, referred to that. But it only makes it all the more imperative that deregulation provides for the maximum number of operators and the maximum amount of competition. Increased competition will reduce fares which will, in turn, increase the market size-if not immediately then certainly over time. Half-hearted efforts at deregulation will increase the capacity of Ansett and Australian to squeeze the new entrants out of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> So we need to ask: To what extent is the Government adequately providing for the new entrants following 1 November? It is not enough for the Government to pontificate on the problems of domestic aviation and treat a possible return to a de facto airline duopoly as a fact of life when measures can be taken now to ensure that this does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Most notably, the Government has failed to provide adequate facilities at Australian airports for the new operators and that is because of its grant of 30-year leases to Ansett and Australian on existing airlines terminals and surrounding areas. </PARA>
<PARA> While these arrangements require the airlines to provide a number of gates for prospective new entrants, these gates will not be enough to cater for the extra services the new operators would like to provide and are capable of providing. These terminal leases also cover a wide range of other important airport services, such as check-in and baggage handling facilities-important in terms of what a new operator might look for and his ability to make use of adequate facilities of that kind. The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has no plans to construct new terminals for common users. </PARA>
<PARA> Already, Capitol Airlines has deferred by six months its plan to begin flying in Australia, citing a lack of terminal space as one of the reasons for its decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Fadden agrees. The existing facilities are clearly inadequate on the basis of existing demand, never mind the requirements of the new entrants and, hopefully, a tourism-driven increased market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also need to look at the performance of Qantas Airways Ltd in providing for improved access to Australia by overseas tourists. Again my colleague the honourable member for Fadden mentioned Qantas in a particular context. I want to add another. In providing for improved access to Australia by overseas tourists, Qantas can play a role. These tourists, apart from making important contributions to the Australian economy and balance of payments, could also generate a sizeable market for air travel within Australia. Yet foreign carriers are turning away thousands upon thousands of potential tourists from Australia each year due to their inability to negotiate additional services into and out of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Such additional services should, if wanted by Qantas, include reciprocal rights for Qantas. But there is no excuse for turning away millions of dollars in foreign exchange for the sake of protecting Qantas's market share. Qantas should instead be made to compete for its share to a greater extent than it does now. </PARA>
<PARA> The end of the two-airline policy is something that is particularly welcome for the people of Western Australia. More than any other State, Western Australia has suffered from the artificial isolation imposed by outrageously high air fares on domestic routes. </PARA>

For many Western Australians and Western Australian businesses, travel to the east has been a luxury only rarely indulged in. Deregulation of domestic air travel is too important to be done half-heartedly. The key to successful deregulation is competition. Without it, the whole exercise will be barely worth while. What do we see from this Government? Not a whole-hearted effort, I suspect. This Government has a lot of explaining to do as to exactly how it intends providing for the greatest possible number of operators following the demise of the two airlines policy at the end of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill is supported by the Opposition. It is comforting to be debating legislation that has the support of both sides of the House. Already this Government has put in place the framework for deregulation of the Australian industry. It has been a topical issue for a number of years in this place and indeed in the community. As has been suggested, the two-airline agreement has been in place now for nearly 40 years and has represented, particularly over the last 20 years, a considerable straitjacket on the airlines industry in this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government established the Federal Airports Corporation which controls major airports and, for the first time, put the control of those airports on a commercial footing. The suggestion by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) that we should privatise I think begs the question: What private owner would inject large amounts of capital into the airports on the belief that perhaps some new operators would begin to use those facilities? I would have thought that would be an extremely risky prospect for any private owner of an airport and I would be very surprised that one would want to take on such a project. </PARA>
<PARA> I am well aware that the Federal Airports Corporation is very concerned about the provision of adequate facilities for any new operators, but that is something it is addressing. The belief is that it will be possible for new operators to have adequate access to facilities and, as they grow, airports can grow. I doubt very much that any private owner of such an enterprise would be interested in injecting large amounts of capital in such a way on the prospect of future operators taking over. </PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority has been set up, again, as a government business enterprise-at arm's length from government-to look after the areas of air traffic control, flight advisory services, communications, navigation and surveillance and rescue and firefighting at airports. This is a critical part of maintaining Australia's very sound safety record in something that would be understood and seen by the public as paramount and very important to future deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also taken action to repeal the Customs Regulation 4n which relates to control over the import of aircraft. We understand very well that it would be appropriate, and will be appropriate in the future, as was suggested by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), that airlines have horses for courses: planes that carry appropriate loads and have fuel efficiencies and ranges that are appropriate to the particular function for which they will be bought. Any expansion of regional airlines would see such new aircraft being bought, and the repeal of this regulation is important for the development of such regional airlines, should new operators wish to take that course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation puts in the final part of that framework; that is, the Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill ends the duopoly. The reason this is occurring now is that three years ago the Government had to flag its willingness to end the two-airline agreement because of previous legislation passed in this place by the Opposition to set it in concrete. I believe that the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), who I notice is sitting opposite, was one of those members who crossed the floor in 1981 opposing that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Many hairy-chested members of the Opposition were opposed to the continuation of the two-airline agreement, a number of them from Western Australia. But when it came to the vote being taken at that time, unfortunately, two or three were not present. Had they also crossed the floor, the legislation would have been defeated, but some of them were appropriately not available and not present to vote on that day. A few crossed the floor and made a big splash in the newspapers in Western Australia, but the end result was that the old regulators of the Liberal Party decided that the two-airline agreement would stay in place. Many members from Western Australia made loud noises about how heinous this was, but in the end they got rolled in the party room. As a result of what happened back in 1981, we have had the two-airline agreement in this country for the last nine years. I believe that the honourable member for Tangney was one of those members who did vote with his feet on that occasion, so I will not for a moment suggest any cynicism in his motivation at all, because he has been a consistent supporter of a deregulated airline industry. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the concerns from Western Australia is whether or not this move will bring about cheaper air fares. There has been a great deal of talk about new operators, wide-bodied aircraft with large numbers of seats and cheap fares, which are very attractive propositions to Western Australians. They tend to be isolated from the eastern States.The distances they have to travel to make contact with other parts of Australia are very substantial. But there is a belief that there will not in fact be any significant improvements in the cost of air fares for Western Australians, because the very profitable parts of the airline industry in this country are the hops between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. I share those legitimate concerns of Western Australians. I hope, although I am not overoptimistic, that we will see significant and massive improvements in the price of air fares from Western Australia. I hope that that will be the outcome in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fadden mentioned that perhaps deregulation will begin with a whimper rather than a bang, and his crystal ball gazing led him to believe that, because of infrastructure problems, difficulties with financing and, indeed, the tremendous hold that the two airlines presently operating have, new operators will find it very difficult. I do not doubt that what he said is correct, but our experience of deregulation of the banking industry suggests that an overzealous approach by bankers and financiers, and certainly a number of entrepreneurs, brought about a great deal of asset value inflation in this country and some cavalier takeover bids. Our experience of deregulation in the financial institutions and industry suggests that perhaps a more circumspect approach is appropriate. I hope that those new operators considering their position take that sort of approach, because I do not believe that large borrowings in the present environment and a cavalier approach to getting involved in air travel is necessarily a formula for long-term success. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that, via very healthy competition and over a long time and a period of osmosis, we will see a more efficient allocation of resources in the airline industry, more competition, more appropriate use of new aeroplanes, perhaps-as a result of all those things-a promotion of air travel in this country and, in the long-term, more realistic and appropriate fares for all travellers. That is a hope that we have, but I do not think anybody in this place is in a position to suggest that they know or can be assured of the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin suggested that the Independent Air Fares Committee had been derelict in its duty and that some of the recent fare increases had been unrealistic. I put the view very strongly that, had the Opposition's preferred policy been pursued and the pilots had been successful in their claim for a 30 per cent increase in wages without a productivity component, the airlines could not in any way have been able to reduce their fares. I suggest that perhaps they would have gone to the tribunal asking for even greater increases. Whenever we canvass the pilots dispute in this place we are left with an Opposition which, de facto or in any other way one wants to look at it, supported a massive increase without productivity for air pilots. I believe that was quite unconscionable. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the legislation provides an environment in which the airline industry can grow and develop. It can no longer be claimed that this industry is overregulated or in any way constrained, as it was 10 years ago. It represents a further brick in the wall, a further opportunity for us to develop more efficiency. I hope that that efficiency and flexibility will improve over the next decade so that, as we move into the twenty-first century, we will see the most efficient allocation of resources and the most flexible airline service that we can have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on the Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill is now fundamentally a non-contentious debate because, as has been noted by several speakers, the Opposition is supporting the Government's legislation. I rise to speak very briefly not to advance new arguments but simply in a very personal sense to mark the occasion; and I do so with a combination of satisfaction and excitement and a good deal of sadness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel satisfaction and, indeed, excitement because with the passage of this legislation we are now on the threshold of deregulation. After October the ground rules will be fundamentally-I hope forever-changed in respect of the aviation industry in Australia. For the first time in 40 years there will be the very real possibility of competition. There will be new entrants into the marketplace. More fundamentally than that, there will be the circumstances which will allow the possibility of new entrants, and that is one of the main thrusts and edges to competition. Whether there is actually a third, fourth or fifth operator is not the fundamental point; the fundamental point is that the ground rules will be changed in such a way that it will be possible for there to be new entrants into the market. What the market throws up in years hence, who am I, among any, to predict but certainly it will be a more open and competitive market. </PARA>
<PARA> As consumers we stand the chance of experiencing an aviation industry which for the first time in 40 years will be run in the interests of consumers and the travelling public, not in the interests of the aviation companies themselves and certainly not in the interests of government or bureaucratic regulators. For all of those reasons I experience some satisfaction and also some excitement, but it is tinged by a sadness for the very fundamental reason that these changes come 10 years later than they could have come, and I would go further and say 10 years later than they should have come. </PARA>
<PARA> In his contribution on behalf of the Opposition our shadow Minister for aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), went through the history of the debate about aviation regulation and aviation deregulation. I do not want to rake over those coals because in the period between 1979 and 1981 they were very hot coals indeed. The Liberal and National parties were in government and a major debate occurred within Government about the merits and demerits of deregulation. This was occasioned by the then possibility, in the 1979-1980 period, of a government, if it wanted to, giving five years notice, as provided for by the then legislation, to deregulate the aviation industry. But the Government at the time decided that it would not opt for that course, that it would extend the two-airline agreement, which underpinned the duopoly between Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australian Airlines (TAA), or Australian Airlines Ltd as it subsequently has become known, for a further five years and that there would be a notice of termination of three years. </PARA>
<PARA> As I look back on that period now I can understand that the protagonists and opponents on both sides had their hearts in the right places, as they saw the situation then. Those who were arguing for an extension of regulation and an extension of the two-airline agreement-the duopoly-had a genuine belief underpinning their view that perhaps Australia was not ready for competition. They genuinely believed that our market was too small and we would be disadvantaged by competition. They genuinely believed that we could not handle an aviation industry where there was even the threat of new competitive players. There was genuine concern about how safety would be maintained in a more competitive environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, as I look back, those arguments masked an outrageous cross-subsidisation of fares in the aviation industry. We were advantaged by inquiries into the industry which documented the extent of that cross-subsidisation. Without being able to turn up, at ready notice, the full reports of the time, I can say that the Sydney to Perth route was documented by an inquiry-a government sponsored inquiry-to be subsidising the short routes by $8.8m per annum. This sort of outrageous internal cross-subsidisation was striking at the interests of consumers in the outlying areas of Australia. Basically, the arguments supporting re-regulation at the time masked a regime of outrageously inflated air fares generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The origin of the agreement, if one delves into history, really goes back to Reg Ansett, later Sir Reginald Ansett, and his attempts to protect his fledgling airline, Ansett, from the predatory competitive behaviour of a government owned airline, TAA, in the wake of the out- rageous behaviour of the Chifley Government which wanted to bring about an aviation industry where there was only one airline, and that was the government airline. Sir Reg Ansett was fighting for survival against that predatory threat. It was the agreement between the Menzies Government and Reg Ansett which basically gave rise to the two-airline agreement, with the essential ingredients of five years existence for the agreement at the time and a five year termination clause. </PARA>
<PARA> I have carried in my memory a story of a lunch that I attended with my good friend the then Senator Withers from Western Australia in the boardroom in Melbourne of Ansett with Sir Reginald Ansett. I have not wanted to tell the story for many years because Sir Reginald Ansett was still alive, but he passed away as long ago as December 1981 and I feel relieved of the obligation to keep it to myself. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a very enjoyable lunch. As one person who was campaigning vigorously for the re-regulation of the industry because he had not been able to move from his mind set about his company being affected by the government operator, he was, of course, lobbying the likes of me and others who were violently opposed, and have always been violently opposed, to a regulation of an industry of this kind in this way which we are now tearing up, I hope, for all time. </PARA>
<PARA> Across the lunch table I said to Sir Reginald, `Sir Reg, I understand your desire to have an agreement which lasts for five years to give you some security and some time for planning purposes, but what is the point of the five-year termination clause?' He put down his knife and fork, looked across the table, and said to me, `My boy, that is to give me time to change the government.' If it was not so serious it would have been funny. </PARA>
<PARA> The last time that we were in government and we had the opportunity to deregulate the industry, when Liberal Party policy advocated that we deregulate the industry, we found incredible resistance within the Government and, certainly, within the bureaucracy. The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth), the previous speaker spoke about an occasion on which some members of the Government back bench crossed the floor. Those on the back bench on the Labor side of politics never experience that because they get expelled from their party if they stray outside party rules or do not adhere to the Caucus or, in this case, Cabinet, decision. That does not happen on our side of politics because we have a greater freedom of thinking and action. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that seven people crossed the floor. I said I wanted to speak personally and, basically, I want to mark the occasion on behalf of those who are not here any more. Ten years is a long time, and as I look around the chamber at those members here now I see there is only one, apart from me, who was here for that debate. The honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free) was in the chamber. Time moves on and many members are no longer here. As I mentioned, the honourable member for Fadden spoke on 3 June 1981. He was then the member of Bowman. He must take great satisfaction in being able to stand at the dispatch box now and speak on behalf of the Opposition as the shadow Minister for aviation, in support of legislation on which he crossed the floor. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) who spoke prior to the honourable member for Perth was another one of those who must take great satisfaction because he also crossed the floor. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who is not in the chamber and who has not spoken in the debate, was another. I want to mark the occasion on behalf of the then honourable member for Perth, Ross McLean, the then honourable member for Moore, John Hyde, and the then honourable member for Canning, Mel Bungey, who were also part of that core group that was so opposed to the re-regulation of the industry that they took the extraordinarily difficult step of standing out publicly against the government they supported because they believed it was not being faithful to policy as determined by the grassroots organisational wings of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a very stressful time. Honourable members who want to understand just how stressful it was need only look at the Hansard record of the debate. The Government won the debate by one vote. I can recall that it was able to win it by one vote because we had a very persuasive Whip who persuaded one of our number who might have been one of the seven to absent himself from the chamber. It was a very heady night indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak for those who are no longer here when I say that 10 years is a long time, but that it is possible, with persistence, to overcome ignorance; it is possible, with persistence, to re-educate people in economics and the way in which market forces can operate and benefit the Australian community; and it is possible, with persistence, to overcome some very big and very entrenched vested interests. Change takes a long time in the public policy sense but, above all, one needs persistence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this rare occasion when legislation is supported on both sides of the House, I would have resisted the temptation to speak about the role of the Opposition in the dreadful past associated with the two airlines agreement, but the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) encouraged me to make at least a couple of observations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first observation is that it is much harder to make decisions when in government than espouse philosophies when in opposition, as those opposite found a decade ago. While there may have been 10 members or seven members-whatever the number-of the Government of the day who felt so strongly in their conviction for Liberal Party policy that they were prepared to cross the floor, the fact of the matter is that, when last faced with an opportunity to do it, those opposite were just not up to it. Many of the people who preached competition and the free market back in the heady days of 1980-many of them were strong advocates-are now proposing the same policies. But when it came to the crunch, they just were not up to it. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, when faced with its first opportunity to free up the system, has had to face up to the same steady stream of lobbyists at Parliament House from 8 o'clock in the morning until midnight banging on the doors and giving all the reasons why this should or should not happen. It has been able to face this issue and say, `Yes, we are going to deregulate', and has opened up a whole Pandora's box of subsequent issues that will flow on and will need to be tackled. </PARA>
<PARA> The observations I have just made I would not have made, had the honourable member for Tangney not decided to have a cheap shot about members of the Labor Party not being able to cross the floor of the House and being locked in in some way or the other to positions that bind them. All this wonderful freedom that he espouses is terrific, provided it leads to something. In this particular case the fact of the matter is that it did not lead to anything, except another 10 years of the two-airline agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of talking up of the perceived benefits of dispensing with the two-airline agreement. Those who espouse the free market and all this sort of stuff will be cut out there talking these things up. I think all members from both sides of the House who are now in support of this legislation ought to be very careful about the expectations we create out in the community. I have in my electorate many people who work at Tullamarine Airport, and I am very conscious at the moment of a fair degree of insecurity on the part of those people who are employed in the industry about where things go from here. They have just been through the traumatic experience of the pilots strike. The pilots dispute, which was very heavily promoted and encouraged on the Opposition side of the House in the name of freeing up wages policy, cost many people, the ordinary workers in this industry, a lot of trauma and financial expense. Now that we have come down the road of deregulation, the talking up of competition and the talking up of all the opportunities that it will create, I think, need to have some sobriety about them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me flag some of the things that I think the Government and the Opposition need to carefully work their way through as a consequence of freeing up. The first is obviously the maintenance of standards. Many of us have been to the United States in recent years and we have seen real questions about the maintenance of standards. There will no doubt be great pressures on the Government from the airline operators to free up standards in one way or another so that they can reduce costs and, in the process, deliver those fare reductions that are one of the supposed outcomes. My own view is that standards will be maintained and that, despite what comes to us from all sorts of quarters, the Government will have to be quite determined about this issue of maintenance of standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of terminal space. The House, when it met a couple of weeks ago, passed legislation dealing with the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation, in which we allowed further freeing up of the way airports operate. We now find ourselves having either to arbitrate in some way or to work through the process of how the new entrants to the industry deal with the process of terminal space and with the competition with the players who are already in place. I have no doubt that the existing airline operators will be jealously guarding their access and their schedules and will not be making it easy for the new entrants. One way or another, if a perceived benefit of freeing up is the entrance of new operators we in the Government, in particular, will have to tackle the issue and make sure that these things happen. </PARA>
<PARA> We will have to be careful about the way our airports relate to the communities around them in the new deregulated atmosphere, because the very great temptations and pressures that are constantly on those who crew aircraft, particularly, include where they fly, how long they are in the air and the shortcuts they take when they take off and land. We are under constant pressure about things like aircraft noise and directing aircraft down the proper routes that guarantee that their noise footprints remain within boundaries. I have no doubt that, as competition comes in and we are under more pressure to reduce costs and provide fare reductions, we will find an increase in complaints from people around airports. </PARA>
<PARA> That will require the Government to ensure that the interests of people who live around airports are maintained during this freeing up process. In other words, if we give an inch, the operators will want to take a mile. Somebody will have to impose the standards and will have to ensure that the regulation of those standards is maintained. Of course, that will lead us into debate in this House and obvious opposition from the other side of the House. It will be said, `Now that we are freeing things up and we are getting rid of the two-airline agreement, what are we doing reintroducing people who are imposing standards? Where is the free market?'. We are going to go down all those paths; one can see them developing. </PARA>
<PARA> We are doing well in the Parliament by shaking ourselves free of this two-airline agreement. It is a symbolic thing; but it foreshadows something else that I have great concerns about. In many areas of this economy we have duplication of resources. Those duplications have come about in the name of competition. While it is not specifically to do with airlines, let us look at the crazy situation that we have at the moment. We have 2,000 trucks a night running up and down the road between Melbourne and Sydney parallel to a standard-gauge railway line. This is because of the original breaking down of the rail monopolies which were enforced by State governments of the day leading into the 1950s. They were broken down in the name of competition. </PARA>
<PARA> What developed was a highly competitive, grossly cross-subsidised road freight industry. This has led to the winding back of our rail resources-all in the name of competition. I am saying that yes, the breaking of the two-airline agreement is long overdue. It has always been in place for the wrong reasons and it was left in place by the former Government for the wrong reasons in 1980. The fact of the matter is that as we go down this path of freeing up competition in our economy-micro-reform, as some call it-we need to be very careful about what our objectives and expectations are, and ensure that we are not just entering an even worse form of competition for competition's sake, which in the end produces more outcomes that the government of the day will have to tackle further down the road. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying to the Parliament that I am totally supportive of this legislation. I have always felt that the two-airline agreement was a nonsense. I am totally supportive of it; but I am supportive of it for quite different reasons than those of people who preach that we need to have more competition in our economy and that we need to free up that competition. In this particular industry, we have had develop a form of structured competition which became institutionalised. Our economy has paid many penalties for it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other demands that is going to come on us through the freeing up of this operation is the economic use of the capital equipment in this industry. We are one of the few countries in the world that do not have a 24 hour aviation industry. In case my colleagues from New South Wales suddenly recoil in horror at my observation, I make the point that while we continue to operate the curfew on Sydney Airport, we have the situation all around Australia of very expensive capital equipment sitting on the ground and not being used. That is a cost we pay because we operate airports with lots of houses around them. My solution to that is to get on with Badgerys Creek as quickly as we can. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to free up competition in this industry and if we are going to expect new operators to buy new aircraft, to come in and commit themselves to a highly competitive industry, we cannot expect them to sit around with those new aircraft on the ground between eleven o'clock at night and six o'clock in the morning. On the one hand we are expecting the industry to produce more jobs, lower air fares and more efficiencies; on the other hand we have to face up to the issue of 24 hour operation of airports around Australia. I am foreshadowing that as another one of the implications down the road of this drive for competition for the sake of competition and the micro-reforms that go with it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some very hard questions that are going to be opened up during the next three or four years flowing from this decision. I have no doubt that there will be little constructive input from the other side of the House. Instead, we will have the usual chanting of rhetoric with very little policy substance to back it up. The legislation that has come into the House today is to be welcomed. It is welcomed on both sides of the House. It is long overdue; but it does not necessarily mean that the problems of the aviation industry are now going to go away. It opens up a Pandora's box of new issues that will have to be considered by the Parliament. I hope that they will be considered maturely and that the solutions will be developed in a manner which is as bipartisan as the passing of this legislation in the House today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I commence my remarks in relation to the Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill, I take the opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) on his speech given earlier this afternoon. The honourable member for Fadden-the Opposition shadow Minister for tourism and aviation-in the presentation of his speech was able to demonstrate to all honourable members the great depth of skill and understanding that he has of the aviation industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a depth of skill and knowledge which contrasts rather dramatically with that of the new Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), who has had his security rug, so to speak, of his defence forces cast off him and has come across to this new portfolio. Over the last few week, since he has been in charge of it, it has been interesting to note the amount of confusion, chaos and contradictory statements that he has been making on a range of issues that relate to his portfolio. This is in contrast with our own shadow Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The present and new Minister for Transport and Communications has got himself into such difficulty that at times his office has even had to issue statements that the Minister was quite obviously confused-for example after doing an interview on Channel 10 the other Sunday. These observations from the Minister's own office indicate the plight that the Government is in over the whole issue of transport and communications. </PARA>
<PARA> In this particular legislation before the House, the Government is doing something which is worthy of support from this side of the House. We would like to see so many of these decisions by the Government handled better and sometimes done in different ways. But as a general rule, this legislation is one which we believe will deliver significant, long-term benefits to the Australian economy, to the aviation industry of Australia, and also to our tourism industry-and therefore to each and every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> It is historic legislation. It changes a duopoly situation which has occurred for 30 or 40 years now in the Australian aviation industry. It is an agreement which has virtually removed all possible competition from the aviation industry in Australia. It is an agreement which, as the times have changed, has drawn a great deal of criticism from the community and caused a great deal of concern from people who are genuinely interested in a proper aviation industry and in having a blooming tourism industry and a developing and growing economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The two-airline agreement has, particularly in recent years, not served the best interests of Australia and indeed has worked against the best interests of Australians. It has helped to create inefficiencies within our existing aviation industry, to protect the two major airlines from competition, to buffer them from the commercial reality of the day, and to push up the cost of air transport in Australia. It has helped to reduce the potential that our tourism industry has, and it has helped to reduce the performance of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Wherever one looks around the world, competition is the buzz word. We heard the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) speaking just a few moments ago on this legislation. Reading between the lines of what the honourable member was saying, he really is somewhat reluctant to accept this legislation; he accepts it because it is the will of his Party. But people like him, of course, cannot quite grasp the reasons why the world recognises today that competition in all facets of economic life, and indeed in all facets of life, is a healthy and a much needed thing. Competition is something which this two-airline agreement has denied Australian air travellers. It is the only way in which we will have a better aviation industry, and the only way that we will have a tourism industry being properly serviced by that aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence of inefficiency existing within our aviation industry is there for all to see. I well recall on one of my first trips to the United States in the early 1980s seeing advertised air fares between San Francisco and New York. Going on a Friday afternoon from San Francisco and coming back on a Sunday afternoon from New York to San Francisco was advertised at that time for $99 return. I am from the small country town of Young in the south-west of New South Wales, and we had an air service that took us to Sydney. It cost just over $100 return from Young to Sydney on the airline. There was no variation in the price between high demand periods and low demand periods, and the distance between Young and Sydney is a fraction of the distance between San Francisco and New York. To compare a similar distance in Australia, say, between Perth and Sydney, I think the air fares between Perth and Sydney in those days were three or four times that particular price which was being offered in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that is asked, then, is: why is it that the air fares in the United States and other countries can be so much cheaper than they are in Australia? The answer, of course, is that there is more genuine competition existing in places such as the United States than we have here in Australia. It is that competition which ultimately best services the needs of the individual traveller, and it is that competition which the Australian traveller has been denied. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight we have had this legislation come into the House and many people would say, `Hip hip hooray! We are now going to have competition.' But we must ask ourselves how much competition is this legislation, and the Government's method of implementing it, going to actually deliver to us? As the honourable member for Fadden and other speakers from this side of the House have pointed out, we are not going to see the full potential of extra competition occurring because of the way in which this Government has implemented its policies on the aviation industry. For example, the 30-year terminal leases that have been offered to the two major airlines-Ansett and Australian-are certainly going to limit the full potential of competition that can occur in our aviation industry over the next few years. The lease agreements for the terminals in the major airports throughout Australia certainly give a competition edge and a great advantage to the existing major airlines. Any new airline that hopes to create a service will find that the terminal space that it will have available will put it at a distinct disadvantage compared with the major airline operators. </PARA>
<PARA> One could say that this is a rather cunning way of reducing competition for Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines. I think many on this side of the House would say that is the case. Certainly many people in the community would say that that is the case too, because the very restrictive nature of those terminal lease agreements will make it very difficult for new players to enter the marketplace on the same level playing field as the two major airline operators operate on at the present time. That is one of the aspects that causes people from this side of the House to have some concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Other aspects that cause us some concern are the Government's attitude towards the operation of our airports and its attitude towards the privatisation of its own airline, Australian Airlines. The new Minister for Transport and Communications has ruled out all possibilities of the privatisation of Australian Airlines as he has done also with Qantas. In the process, he has put forward these rather interesting and unusual proposals of quasi-equity being offered for airlines such as Australian Airlines and Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody in the industry who would be considering investing in airlines such as Australian Airlines and Qantas would laugh at the proposals that have been put forward by the Minister because they are simply unrealistic and would not present anything like an attractive option for anybody to invest in. So privatisation is off the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> Privatisation of airlines such as Australian Airlines would certainly create more competition in the marketplace. It would make Australian Airlines a more viable airline operator. It would, I think, lead its management to be more competitively orientated to give it a better position in the marketplace and to ensure that it is providing a better service to the travelling public. The Government's refusal to allow privatisation is reducing competition in our airline industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the current attitude that the Government takes towards the Federal Airports Corporation by not freeing up the operations of our airports more is a further hurdle to increased competition in the Australian aviation industry. There is no doubt whatsoever that, if one sees what is happening in the other parts of the world where deregulation of the ownership of airports has occurred, there is a great deal more activity being created at those airports through their increased capacity, new runways and the generation of more traffic. </PARA>
<PARA> All of a sudden we are seeing in other countries around the world local authorities taking control of their airports. I was at the Denver airport not so long ago. Denver airport, as I understand it, is owned and operated now by the Denver City Council. Because it takes a direct interest in the promotion of tourism and economic activities in Denver, it is pouring a tremendous amount of money into the redevelopment of the Denver airport. Because of that, air traffic is increasing dramatically. It now has international airline and international traffic status. As a consequence of that, traffic from all over the world is coming to Denver airport and the economic circumstances surrounding the Denver business community are looking up. This is coming about because the Federal Government in the United States took the attitude of de- regulating the ownership of airports and letting local people take over the running, operation and ownership of those airports. The attitude is that, if the local people want to spend the money on upgrading the terminals or putting in new runways or promoting their particular district, let them do it. This will create competition, more economic activity and better services to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> That has happened overseas and I believe that is what should be happening here in Australia because there are airports in Australia which are totally undercatering for the needs that they have to face today and certainly in the future. The Northern Territory Government has been for years calling for the Federal Government to give it a chance to develop the Darwin Airport. If it has to wait in a long queue for Federal Government money, it will be years before it gets what it believes to be adequate funds to spend on that airport. Because the Territory depends so much on tourist income, the Northern Territory Government says, `We want to spend the money because we believe it will create a very good return on our investment. It will create more jobs for the Territory and more economic activity.' Yet the Federal Government will not let it do this. </PARA>
<PARA> The same can be said of the Alice Springs Airport and the airports at Coolangatta, Perth and so on. There are instances well and truly documented today throughout Australia where, if local ownership were offered to the local community for a particular airport, that airport would be improved significantly by the local people to the local people's advantage. That is something that should be occurring here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> About 60 per cent of all international visitors arrive through Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. Sydney airport, as has been mentioned by so many people-today it was referred to in a very good question asked by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell)-is one of the great disgraces of Australia. Why is it a disgrace? Because this Federal Government is playing politics with it. This Federal Government refuses to allow a third runway to be built without the most incredible, intricate, detailed and delaying tactics being applied. Everybody in Sydney knows that a third runway is the best, most viable and cheapest option for Sydney's airport and its future development and growth, except the Federal Government. Because it is worried about the hide of the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), the Federal Government is doing everything that it can to delay the development of a third runway at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA> These days we hear the Minister for Transport and Communications redefining what he thinks is micro-economic reform. He says that micro-economic reform is all about taking the national interest into account. He says, `We are not just going to blindly go down the path of deregulation and micro-economic reform all over the place just for the sake of deregulation and creating micro-economic reform; we are going to take the national interest into account in all of these instances'. He might be taking the national interest into account when it suits him but if he took the national interest into account he would have that environmental impact study completed by now on the third runway option for Sydney airport. He would have the earth moving equipment rolling in to start on the job today. In the national interest it would best serve this country to have a third runway built at Sydney airport as quickly as possible. All of the talk about Badgerys Creek will not solve the immediate and medium term problems that face our aviation industry and our tourism industry as far as Sydney airport is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point so well highlighted by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in Question Time today relates to the curfews operating on airports, such as Sydney, throughout Australia. Today with the modern technology of jet aircraft there is no need for curfews to operate at Sydney airport or at other airports. The technology today is such that these aircraft operate with very low noise pollution levels. As such they should be able to operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Because the Federal Government is taking politics into account wholly and solely in its assessment of what is best for Sydney airport and what is best for our aviation industry it is refusing to take into account the developments and advances in technology of jet aircraft and is denying those very low noise pollution aircraft to operate 24 hours a day. As a consequence every Australian is paying the price for having a less efficient and less competitive airline industry operating; this Government treats politics first and the national interest second. </PARA>
<PARA> They are some of the concerns that many people have relating to the aviation industry in Australia. We certainly believe that it is a step forward to do away with the two-airline agreement. It will lead to more competition even though we will not achieve the maximum amount of that increased competition. I believe it will lead to better services being provided by the two airlines. No longer will we see the two airlines put their prices up on the same day by exactly the same amount. No longer will we see the two airlines operating exactly the same schedules. We will see some improved competition, with the industry trying to target the consumer market much better than it has done in the past. It is a step forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is denying Australians, and the aviation industry in particular, the full opportunity of having a more competitive industry because of its refusal to properly privatise airports throughout Australia, its refusal to privatise airlines such as Australian Airlines and Qantas, its refusal to get on with the job of building a third runway at Sydney airport and its refusal to recognise the need of putting the national interest first and politics second. If it puts the national interest first it will do all those things that the honourable member for Fadden and I have mentioned this evening because that will deliver better economic circumstances for Australia and better services for the travelling public and will create more jobs in this country through the development of such industries as our tourism industry which has been very much hurt by this Government's attitude towards aviation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on your election to your office. It is pleasing to follow the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) in this debate. We are dealing with the Airlines Agreement (Termination) Bill 1990 which does away with the two-airline agreement. It has been said that this is micro-economic reform. Of course, that is quite right. When we are discussing the virtues of what the Government has done and what the Government should be doing, as the Opposition proposes, we ought to reflect a little on history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> You can be forgiven for thinking, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Opposition has a long and virtuous history, particularly in this area, a principled position which it has consistently maintained. That begs the question of who really entrenched this two-airline agreement, this duopoly. It will come as no surprise to learn that it was the Opposition, when in government, that was not able to bite the bullet. It succumbed to vested interests, succumbed to big business, by entrenching the two-airline agreement. It now wants to jettison its history, its past actions, and come to this Parliament and say, `Look, we have clean hands; we can do it and we do it better'. The Opposition has a miserable record. It has nothing to be proud of. I do not believe that the Australian people should accept what it is saying on face value. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last election the shadow Minister for aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), talked on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program about the third runway and what the Opposition would be doing about Badgerys Creek. I think it is important that it be read into the record of Hansard because not only did he pledge the maximum possible development of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, which is political speak, Opposition speak, for no Badgerys Creek, but he said that if it had to look for a second Sydney airport then the whole site selection process would be up for grabs again. This Government has taken steps to actually cut through 30 years of indecision. It set up a site selection process, developed environmental impact statements and selected Badgerys Creek as the site of Sydney's second airport. The Opposition was going to jettison this during the campaign. I was pleased to listen to it. We ran some stories locally to highlight what the Opposition thought of the western suburbs of Sydney. They felt that the western suburbs should be denied. The point I am making is that the Opposition can change track very quickly-particularly during election time-and actually give no warning of it at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore seemed to take umbradge about the service being offered by my colleague the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) to his constituents. He seemed to find fault with the action of the honourable member for Barton for wanting to consult his constituents and wanting to reflect their needs and aspirations, not only in civil aviation but in every respect. This somehow places the honourable member for Barton under some odium. I have nothing but admiration for the honourable member for Barton. Because of the service he provides his constituents he consistently gets re-elected when the Opposition is always writing him off and saying that it will win the seat from him. He wins because of that very thing. As a matter of principle I want to say that I am not ashamed to stand up here and say that I am happy to reflect the needs and aspirations of my constituents. I think that that is my role. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, what the Opposition fails to understand about the position of the honourable member for Barton, is that not only has he got that fundamental principle about elected representation right, but he understands the dynamics of the urban environment: Mr and Mrs Average Householder are becoming more and more concerned about what is happening in their street, in their neighbourhood, and in their city and we cannot just ride roughshod over citizens. I want to demonstrate the rectitude of what the Government is doing in the current third runway dispute; that is, it will satisfy itself, having made a commitment for the third runway,that it is environmentally sound. It will not ride roughshod over the physical environment of residents surrounding the airport. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate we are always desperate for jobs. That is fair to say. I have said that previously. We had the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd mini-steel mill proposal. I was in favour of that, subject to satisfactory environmental safeguards. The point I want to make is that there developed a group of residents, the Rooty Hill residents action committee, out of a small village, if you like, that not only banded together and fought the council, albeit unsuccessfully, in the Land and Environment Court, but is raising over $100,000 to pursue that interest. That is the commitment that these people have to that issue. I commend them for it. I commend the organisers behind it. I commend the executive for the work done. I think we will find that this action will prove to be a model that others will follow. Companies and even governments will no longer believe that they have the right to move into an area, set up any industry and have little regard for people's lifestyle and for what they are doing to the environment. That is what separates the Opposition and the Government on the third runway issue. We are not prepared to say that environmental laws mean nothing, that we will override them, and that this will be done, whether it is good or bad for people, in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Free) sitting at the table. He is a keen advocate of the Badgerys Creek airport. We are not ashamed to say that we believe that that is a viable solution to Sydney's airport needs. In fact, we will be delighted to be with the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) later in the year when he turns the first sod at the general aviation airport there. We have to be frank. We have some expectation that the third runway environmental impact statement may fail and that we will have a domestic or international airport at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make the point that that site is well away from any existing houses or residences. It will not have that same noise effect. If it did, I would say that my friend and colleague the Parliamentary Secretary and I would be in a difficult position because we can certainly see the dramatic impact that it will have in our region on tourism, on the construction jobs, on permanent jobs and on jobs through industries relocating. </PARA>
<PARA> What would we do? Given our actions in the past, we would be very sensitive to the needs of our constituents and their concerns about the environment. We have always been consistent. I deprecate this approach that being a good member in the Australian Parliament somehow means that we sacrifice our electorate, disregard our constituents' concerns and override them-that it does not matter what we do to them; that we can just override legislation, override their needs, and override their concerns. Well, this Government is not like that. We are not likely to be like that. The Opposition still has to learn some lessons. </PARA>
<PARA> I was talking about micro-economic reform. Unfortunately we have wanted to move faster in this area. As I said, it was the Opposition that entrenched this legislation. In 1987 we gave three years' notice of the termination of the agreement. We believe that there will be significant benefits flowing from these changes. The people who tied our hands were those opposite, who are currently saying, `You are not going fast enough; you have to do more'. </PARA>
<PARA> Micro-economic reform is important-very important. We have in other areas a track record not of rhetoric but of actually doing things. I point out that one of the significant changes we made in communications was contained in the May 1988 statements. Not only did we strengthen the carriers but we introduced significant competition. We have to ask the pro-competitive mob opposite: what did they do in government? It is true to say that they were always fond of consultants. It is true to say that they were always fond of reports. But what did they do? I ask the shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), who is sitting at the table and who is a former Minister for communications: in his term of office what did he do? One might say the Opposition's great enterprise, its great initiative, was Aussat, which is currently haemorrhaging at a rate of knots. This Government is in the dilemma of how to stop the haemorrhaging. That is the only thing those opposite ever did: they put up a loss making statutory authority-and a spectacular loss making statutory authority at that. </PARA>
<PARA> I was trying to talk about micro-economic reform and how this Bill fits into it. Much as we are very concerned about restructuring the economy and introducing micro-economic reform in aviation, in communications, on the waterfront and in land transport, what purpose does this serve? It is important for the Government to do it, but it is more important to do so by example than by the hard dollars it puts into the economy. We still need private enterprise to be making the decisions, to be replacing the imports and to be exporting more in economic terms to get us out of the current situation. Micro-economic reform is very important, but it is secondary to what is actually happening in private enterprise. I do not know that we have always been as well served as we might by private enterprise, particularly when organisations are able to go to Opposition parties-as they did-and lock in duopolies that, it is agreed, do not service the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> In the last Parliament the honourable member for Gilmore was shadow Minister with responsibilities for land transport. During the last election he was on record as saying that the coalition would be spending more money on micro-economic reform in land transport and that what we really needed was a gold-paved Pacific Highway which would solve our micro-economic agenda there. He said that the Opposition would spend its way out of the problem and might even lift the excise duties. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore talked about putting politics first and the national interest second. That is what he said a number of times about this Government. I say to him that he was guilty of that in the last election. He has done it repeatedly and he continues to do it. The reality is that the road crashes by and large are not caused by poor roads. We have only to look at the recent spate of bus crashes. It is not the roads that are being found guilty or are being prosecuted; it is the drivers or company practice. The honourable member for Gilmore would do better to support the efforts of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) in trying to get the coach industry and the truck industry to introduce the reforms that are needed, such as speed limiters installed in vehicles as a control measure on the driver. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the more important reform in this area and the reform that may reduce the number of accidents is putting tachographs into vehicles. Tachographs are not so much a control on the driver as a control on the company. If the company is forcing truck drivers and coach drivers to drive for too long, that fact comes out in the tachograph. If drivers are not having their rest breaks and they are not permitted to have them, that information also comes out in the tachograph. Tachographs are a control on the companies-that is why they do not like them. I think the honourable member for Gilmore ought to be pursuing measures such as speed limiters and tachographs that really do tackle the issue of driver related accidents and that would reduce the number of accidents. We ought to do something. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is terribly misleading to suggest to the Australian people that there is an endless amount of money that can be spent on our roads and highways-that there is no limit-and that will then reduce the number of accidents on our roads. I put the proposition to honourable members that if we accepted this fact we would be talking about billions and billions of dollars. Who would argue if we had perfect roads and no accidents? Who would say that we should not spend the money? But, of course, that is not true and it is morally dishonest. It is putting politics first and the national interest second for Opposition members to run around the countryside saying this, as they have done in the past and are currently doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that my time is running short and I had better conclude my remarks. I support the micro-economic reform agenda of the Government. The Government has an agenda and, more importantly, it is implementing it. Indeed, in this area-this classic case of micro-economic reform-where the Opposition talks so much about what it would like to do and what we should be doing, Opposition members are the ones with the dirt on their hands. They are the ones who by that dirty deal done so long ago, entrenched the duopoly and prevented competition in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that this Bill will pass because it has the support of the Opposition, yet concern has been expressed in the community about safety issues under the new environment. I am very pleased to say that the Government has already acted and has established the Civil Aviation Authority-the regulator-which has the prime responsibility for enforcing air safety standards. There will be no compromise on safety issues in Australia and the proud record that we have will be maintained in the new environment and under the new regime. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that this Bill receives a speedy passage and I hope that succeeding Opposition members who speak on this Bill may express a smidgin of regret about their former actions, may acknowledge a slight degree of embarrassment and perhaps feel a minuscule bit uncomfortable about their actions in the past in entrenching this agreement and not allowing the Australian people to benefit from competition in this area. I am very pleased to speak on the Bill and I support it. My only regret is that we might have done this years earlier but for the actions of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price)-a person who, I might say, brings to his job and to this debate a great deal of experience in the realm of the aviation portfolio. He is someone who has expressed his interest in this area through his involvement in the relevant committees of this Parliament, particularly in the policy committees of the Government. I would like to applaud him for the interest he has taken. I was not too happy about the note he slipped me during Question Time, but nevertheless I am sure I can talk to him about that at some later stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My contribution to this debate will be aimed fairly and squarely at the two-airline agreement. As I am sure previous speakers in this debate have said-and it is something which I think needs to be emphasised-a range of people across the broad spectrum of the Australian community will benefit from the changes which this Government is implementing. As well as the airline companies themselves, their clients-the aviation users-will also benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> For too long this country has been hamstrung by the regulated airline industry. Domestic interstate aviation has been hamstrung in this way for about 40 years. But at last this cosy policy is going to disappear and it will bring with it significant benefits to the Australian community. I hope we will see, among other things, an increased responsiveness by airlines to consumer needs. I have travelled regularly by air-from my point of view too regularly-over great distances, and I am used to the very good services which have been provided by Australian Airlines Ltd and Ansett Airlines of Australia. I point out that we do not all live, as the majority of honourable members do, in the urban areas of Melbourne and Sydney, where there is a very regular service to and from Canberra. Unlike many other members and like my counterparts in Western Australia and those from the more remote areas of north Queensland, if I do not get on to a plane first thing in the morning to get back to Alice Springs or Darwin, I do not make the flight. </PARA>
<PARA> The connections that have been provided over the last 18 months have facilitated access to Canberra in a way not available to me as a member of parliament for a short time prior to that. It was a regular occurrence for me to travel from Alice Springs and have to overnight in Sydney in order to get to Canberra. That is now no longer the case. I hope that when we get the open airways in operation after 31 October we will not see a diminution of those services, but an increase in the quality of service from the competing airlines. There is no doubt, in my view, that Australian and Ansett have-at least in terms of the Northern Territory-provided very good services. I certainly hope that we will not see those services drop off as a result of deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time we can expect a reduction in costs. Again, the public purse will benefit from that. Simply by looking at the size of this Parliament and at the number of people who travel by air on a regular basis, I can see that a benefit will accrue directly to the Australian community. We will see a wider range of fares and types of services, increased competition in pricing, greater economic efficiency in the industry overall and the continuation of Australia's peerless and world renowned safety record. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard that as extremely important. It is a compliment to the airlines, to the department responsible for civil aviation and to the other agencies involved that we have that reputation because we have seen safety as a primary consideration. At the same time as we have provided safety, we have given a high quality of service. I am sure we will not see-as some of the doomsayers have predicted-a fall-off in the quality of service and a depreciation in safety standards as a result of deregulation. I do not believe that will happen and I am firmly of the view that the commitments given to the Government by Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines and their impending competitors are such that we can look forward to that safety record continuing after deregulation of the airlines takes place on 31 October. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of ancillary services associated with the deregulation of the airline industry which will also benefit. But most significant in my view, and something which this Government has done to complement the deregulation of the airline industry, has been the establishment of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC). I know that that does not sit well with the Opposition. I know that during the lead-up to the election the Opposition was threatening to privatise the FAC. I hope it is rethinking that, because it would be to the grave detriment-in my view at least-of the Australian community, not least the people of northern Australia, particularly Darwin. I say that with some knowledge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I will not detain the House too long, but we do need to fill up a few minutes tonight and there is something that can be said about what was, before the sitting was suspended for dinner, a very extensive debate on this historic piece of legislation put in place by the Government which effectively repeals the system of regulation which has governed domestic aviation for the last 40 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did detect from all the Opposition speakers a view that what was being proceeded with here was a form of Claytons deregulation. What absolute nonsense. It is not possible for a government, at the conclusion of a period of regulation of some 40 years-regulation that the Opposition put in place and maintained-to overnight create a totally level playing field for all the would-be competitors. When the United States went through its process of deregulation a similar situation existed. Of course, all the airlines that were in the system and beneficiaries of the period of regulation started out ahead of their potential new entrant opponents. In all cases that head start included a fleet in place, a substantial skilled work force and maintenance bases. For a fair proportion of them it also included access to terminals via leasing and other arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in Australia is no different. Deregulation does not of itself create an even playing field and nor could it. The point is that there is now opportunity. Even though any competitors coming into the field have to come in against two very well-established carriers in a very small market, they do come in with some advantages. They do not have a pattern of staffing arrangements, for example, built up over years and well entrenched in the industrial system to confront them as they set about preparing their work force for that period. Another advantage they have is that they can cater their fleets for the anticipated level of demand of the aviation system and not be encumbered with a fleet based on other assumptions. These advantages probably do not of themselves outweigh in any shape or form the advantages that Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines Ltd already enjoy, but it would not be possible for the Government to create circumstances for them that would. </PARA>
<PARA> Before this deregulation process was entered into there were leasing arrangements which would have taken the airlines through the first few years of this period of competition totally in control of the terminals in the main airports. Their leasing arrangements permitted them to do that. The process of negotiation between the Government and the airlines on new leasing arrangements, whilst extending that period considerably, nevertheless made those airlines concede at the outset positions for their competitors, and their competitors are taking advantage of this. Indeed, announcements were made by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) only a few days ago establishing access for two of the new entrants to those terminals. That will be very much to their advantage over their other competitors among new entrants. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Government is not standing still on that matter either. We created major new opportunities for the development of aviation infrastructure, in part at least to support these new initiatives, when we decided to establish the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) as an entity separate from the Government. This has enabled that body in effect to go off-budget-to establish its financial base-and, in the process of going off-budget, engage in a massive and overdue expansion of the aviation infrastructure in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of that expansion will permit the development of hard standing areas for new entrants. The FAC is well aware of the fact that it has substantial responsibilities to ease access to new competitors in the domestic aviation system for competitive purposes and is looking, if you like, at what might be termed cut-price terminals in order to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of this debate people sneered at the option of cut-price terminals, but I ask why. When deregulation occurred in the United States, various airlines such as People's Air-I think that is what it called itself at one point-had a system whereby passengers went and effectively collected their luggage from the aircraft. People were prepared to put up with a degree of inconvenience for a substantial reduction in air fares. Why should we consider that the situation will be any different here?</PARA>
<PARA> It is not to be assumed that because we have entered into a period of deregulation absolutely every new player will provide a similar standard of service that has been provided by the long-standing participants in the system with somehow a massive reduction in costs. Those reductions in costs have to come from somewhere and those sorts of terminal operations will obviously be involved in part of that cut-price air fare activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody assumed, when this Government finally bit the bullet and decided to deregulate after years and years of regulation in the system before us, that what would happen would be some sort of big explosion of competition on the day of deregulation. To try to set up a community attitude that this will occur is simply inviting the community to believe a nonsense. Under any set of regulatory or infrastructure arrangements that simply would not occur. As I said, it did not occur in any of the other countries that went through a similar process of deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises a point about the existing airlines that have been participants in the system and will continue to be. It is very important that we do not operate here on the assumption that in bringing down air fares and expanding the aviation market, which is one of the major objectives of the process of deregulation, these airlines bear no responsibility in the process. They have been the beneficiaries of a regulated system for a very long time. They have an obligation to provide a wider variety of services, including cheaper services, to the aviation customers of Australia. That point ought to be made repeatedly. Also, it should not be assumed that the only participants in the expanded competitive aviation system need be those attempting very early to replicate the activities of the two major participants. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to look at what will happen with regional airlines and the opportunities for regional airlines to carve out for themselves new niches. There is every evidence that some of our regional airlines are preparing to take advantage of those opportunities. The situation will be far more complex and the results far more varied than the rather simplistic analysis that came from Opposition speakers in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate I was criticised for ruling out domestic competition from Qantas Airways Ltd. People who seriously think that there would be any new participants in the system were the Government to decide to turn Qantas loose over the most lucrative routes in this country in a domestic flying context would really have to have rocks in their heads. Basically, if we put Qantas on, we might well get cheaper air fares but we would have no competitors in the system. Very quickly we would have a one-airline or a 1 3/4-airline policy in this country. Placing Qantas in that position would be the daftest possible thing that one could do. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion is made, `Well, let's operate Qantas in a limited way. What a hopeless failure the Minister is for not addressing the competitive possibilities of this and how much better it would be if we looked at using Qantas in a limited way'. It was this Government in 1988 which restored Qantas's interline rights, which were withdrawn by the previous Government in 1975. This initiative allows Qantas to carry international visitors over domestic sectors, including to and from Cairns, at very attractive fares and is a boost to the tourism industry. So we have taken steps in that regard which our opponents were not willing to take. But that is not unique. Virtually the whole of this deregulatory activity on out part has been done in a way that makes this Government's record unique when compared with that of previous Australian governments addressing the issue of aviation deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an historic piece of legislation. It does turn upside down the way in which domestic aviation has been conducted in this country, and the results of this legislation really do defy prediction. It would be a particularly brave person who came into this debate arguing any certainties about what was going to happen on any particular routes and the prices charged for those routes which will be flown. It is simply not possible to make predictions about that, but one can point to certain factors that will encourage the competition. I will go over them again. Two of the most viable new entrants will have access to existing terminals. New entrants will have access to other facilities made available by the Federal Airports Corporation, which simply could not have been made available if the Government had not taken the decision to effectively corporatise that part of the old Department of Aviation's activity. We will have two airlines competing in this system who are well capable of providing a more innovative array of air fares and services than they have thus far provided. That was made evident to the airlines by the type of aircraft that they were using during the pilots dispute. In so far as the Government can responsibly act to create the right conditions for competition, this Government has done so. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not be taking absurd steps which will, in the end, cut off our noses to spite our faces, like sending Qantas across our domestic aviation routes in competition with the local airlines. It is a very easy, catchy sort of thing to state. All I can say is that one has two sets of responses from anyone who knows anything about it. One response is from people such as the new entrants who say, `Do that and you kill us straight away'. The second response is, `If you really and seriously believe that Qantas ought to be able to do that, how about giving us rights to compete with Qantas in the international aviation market'. Of course, that would be an absurdity. One cannot conceivably license all the new entrants and the old entrants in the domestic aviation system to operate internationally. Again, we would be a unique country were we to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The trend internationally is for international airlines to buy into each other, to establish a position in the marketplace which combines several sovereignties. Not from one sovereignty does one create several airlines competing with each other and with everyone else. Qantas has got enough competitors internationally. In charter flights and other operations, I think about 30 airlines operate one way or another into this country. That is about as deregulated a market in international aviation terms as one could conceivably have. So to add another three or four operators to that market in order to create a level playing field for Qantas in domestic competition would create an aviation absurdity. We will not do that, despite the fact that the Opposition spokesman on aviation suggests that we should. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring back to the Federal Airports Corporation that we have established. It is going to have an enormous responsibility and so far, as I have said, it looks very much as though it is accepting that responsibility. On the international aviation sector, this Government has been most encouraging of competitive activities. We have adopted a far more liberal approach in the negotiation of bilateral arrangements internationally. We have adopted a far more liberal approach than that of our predecessors when it has come to the question of international inbound charter flights; so much so that for the first time in this country, albeit on a seasonal basis, we have a regular international inbound charter service which is very substantially aiding the development of our tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank all honourable members who have participated in this debate. It was certainly a worthy debate to have, given the historical significance of these events in establishing for the first time in Australia a deregulated domestic aviation market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few comments about the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1990, but my principal comments will be directed to the second Bill, the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990. One can say in as compressed a form as is necessary that the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1990 lays down with a trowel yet another thick layer of bureaucratic control and red tape which will do nothing to improve the efficiency of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and will just add to the complexity of that labyrinthine piece of legislation we know as the Broadcasting Act. The Bill will do nothing to implement the promise made after the 1987 election by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to redraw the Broadcasting Act in such a way that it can be understood and used. The Bill, therefore, takes us, in reality, one step further away from implementing the Prime Minister's empty promise. In fact, as honourable members will all realise, this promise was one of the matters that the Prime Minister felt moved to remind the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) of when he wrote to the Minister a few weeks ago with his riding instructions, and that letter, of course, has now been made available to the public. We take the opportunity of reminding the Minister that that promise is still unfulfilled and that it is time to get on with the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will be moving a second reading amendment to this Bill which sums up our attitude to it. It may be appropriate, at this stage, to inform the House of the substance of that second reading amendment. It will be to the effect that we are not prepared to give this Bill a second reading, and we deplore the Government's hasty and ill-conceived attempt to bestow a vast new range of unpredictable and unnecessary powers on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in a desperate attempt to divert attention from the Government's failure to introduce meaningful reforms. We say that is the case, despite the Prime Minister's promise made in 1987 after the election-to use his words-to `urgently reform this nightmarish legislation'. We agree with the Prime Minister in his description of the Broadcasting Act and we want to encourage the Government, by moving this second reading amendment, to get on with the job of reforming this nightmarish legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is what we have here-an attempt to divert attention, under the guise of legislative activity, away from the shambles that broadcasting has been allowed to descend into under the present Government. No matter what area one looks at, it can only fairly be described as a shambles. If one goes through every area of the industry the conclusion one comes to is virtually the same in every case-decay, disorder, lost investment, the ruin of people's careers and, worst of all, no improvement in overall services being provided for the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Radio is probably the worst example. The conversion to FM and the way it has been handled by the Government has virtually ruined AM radio broadcasting in places like Melbourne. We see the successive turnover of broadcasting licences in a city such as Melbourne at what seem like ever-diminishing values; and we see a succession of what are now becoming human tragedies where employers-no doubt through the exigencies of economic circumstances which are being forced on the licensees as a result of Government policy and its implementation-terminate employees' contracts en masse with careers ruined; concern and worry is being visited upon employees in the radio section of the industry and they do not know what lies ahead of them or, indeed, whether they will have any careers. That is the situation that comes about at least in one area-FM conversion in the radio field. </PARA>
<PARA> In other areas the whole process has been frozen and locked into litigation. Aggregation in television has bogged down. There is still the refusal to take any action to introduce pay television. There is utter confusion particularly, apparently, in the Minister's mind about foreign ownership rules on television, and so it goes on. There is review after review and report after report but the one common thread that runs through the whole industry is that the Government seems quite incapable of taking the positive decisions that have to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an utter disgrace and the Government should be ashamed of the way in which it has abrogated all responsibility for this industry, and the way in which it has contributed by its own actions to the problems besetting the industry. One often finds in industries really serious problems that come about as the result of economic forces, or as a result of events occurring beyond this country. But in this industry-and virtually in the whole communications field-if one can point to a problem today, it is almost always a problem which has resulted from direct government action and action taken by the present Government itself. In fact, it is a direct result of the doctrinaire approach which the Government has taken in this whole field. That is really what we are faced with in this situation. It is an irony-I will come back to this-that in the case of the Broadcasting Amendment Bill the Government is seeking to divert attention away from the shambles, a shambles of its own creation, by the appearance of a flurry of legislative activity. </PARA>
<PARA> I say it is an irony because what the Government is doing with respect to this Bill is to lay more regulation, more bureaucracy and more red tape on to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by giving it more intricate powers-more powers which it is presumably expected to exercise-to reach into fields hitherto not recognised as areas for the Broadcasting Tribunal to delve into, even to the extent of exercising control over the activities of third parties.</PARA>
<PARA> It is an irony that that is the theme and thrust of the first Bill and yet, lo and behold, the Government turns around and in the second Bill, the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2), introduced for the first time this session, says there is too much bureaucracy in this area, too much red tape and the Tribunal is taking too long; the Tribunal is getting bogged down in bureaucracy and the excessively detailed regulations and obligations imposed on it, we will take a knife to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The two are utterly inconsistent and no explanation has been attempted to be given by the Minister as to why the Government has taken this diametrically opposite approach in the two Bills that we have before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the situation with respect to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill that was introduced in the House of Representatives before the last election, which lapsed when the House of Representatives was dissolved. It is a Bill which has now been brought back with very little amendment. A couple of minor amendments have been made, but apart from that it is the same Bill. It is a regulatory Bill. Let there be no mistake about it whatsoever. It is an excessively regulatory piece of legislation for which there is no need and we will be opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2), I have already said that it is a great irony, for which no explanation has been given, that in contrast to the first Bill this Bill tries to remove some of the red tape in other areas of broadcasting and in some other areas of the Broadcasting Tribunal's functions. The fact that there is such a great contrast between these two Bills shows, we believe, just how devoid the Government is of any consistent and rational policy on broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA> The first Bill, as I have said, imposes more red tape; the second says that there is too much red tape, so we must get rid of some of it. That is why, with one exception, we will, for consistent reasons, be supporting the second Bill which is before the House. As I have said, there is an exception and the exception is an important one which I will elaborate on later. Not only will we be opposing part of the Bill; we will also be moving some amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say at the outset that the bulk of the second Bill, in fairness, is sensible. This is the so-called efficiency package designed to improve the efficiency of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The Tribunal has become bogged down with work caused in part by the frequent sale and resale of licences. It has also been burdened by the requirement that it monitor even the most minute share transactions involving licensees. The thrust of this second Bill is to streamline the procedures of the Tribunal so that it can get through its work faster and concentrate on matters of greater public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, the Bill will apparently reduce by 90 per cent the number of share transactions that currently have to be approved by the Tribunal. There will be only a limited number of transactions which, henceforth, will have to be taken to the Tribunal, and that is a step forward. Secondly, the Bill puts time limits on the Tribunal within which it must complete its hearing. It will be an interesting exercise because it will have power to extend the time that it has, but it will have a discipline imposed on it being obliged to give reasons in writing for the extension. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also removes the requirement for pre-notification to the Tribunal of share transactions. It will reduce to a minimum-and a commendable minimum-the requirements for notification of the Tribunal of some other transactions. These changes that I have referred to so far will lessen the bureaucratic role of the Tribunal, and we are happy to support them for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA> To move into another field, the Bill also makes a change to the prescribed interest test in its application to television licences. Whether or not a person has a prescribed interest is important, and many consequences flow from it. Whether or not a person has a prescribed interest in a radio or television licence determines whether he may own or control another licence; it determines, in some cases, whether a transaction has to be notified to the Tribunal; and it also determines whether the rules on cross-media ownership and control are activated. So it is particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA> For television, the prescribed interest is 5 per cent, and for reasons set out in the second reading speech it is felt that that 5 per cent threshold has been set at too low a level. We are told that some support is gained for this view from the fact that few transactions, if any, which involve between 5 and 15 per cent actually confer control. It is felt that, in all the circumstances, it would be desirable to raise the prescribed interest threshold from 5 per cent to 15 per cent equity or voting interest in a licence. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment should allow more investment. It removes an impediment that seems to have no sensible basis for being there in the first place, and it will probably reduce the bureaucratic Tribunal control over some transactions. We support those amendments that are being made by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are interesting to the close observer for another reason-the Minister's recent curious qualification to his announcement that there would be a 20 per cent limit on foreign investment in television licences. The qualification, which I have described as curious, was that loans would apparently not count towards the 20 per cent. Such a qualification would seem, on the surface at least, to negate the limit on foreign investment, for a company with perhaps 90 per cent of its funds in the form of foreign loans would not necessarily have more than 20 per cent of its shares owned by foreigners and it would not exceed the limit. </PARA>
<PARA> One has often pondered the reason for that qualification and it would appear from this Bill that the reason is now clear, or at least there is a clue to the reason. The Act provides that a prescribed interest in a television licensee is held if the person holds more than 5 per cent of the shares of the licensee, but it also provides that a prescribed interest is held if the person holds more than 5 per cent of what is called the financial interest in the company. Financial interest is defined to mean shares or a loan. That is the Act, but the Bill then comes along and deletes the financial interest test so that the test will henceforth be whether the person holds more than 15 per cent of the shares only, and he will not have a prescribed interest solely because he has made a loan to the licensee which he could have had previously-a loan which is more than 15 per cent of the financial interest in the company. </PARA>
<PARA> It looks now-and the Government will have to do some explaining about this, not the least to its own Caucus, I would have thought-as if, when the foreign ownership Bill is drafted, it will say in substance that foreign owned shares of more than 20 per cent will be outlawed, but foreign loans of more than 20 per cent of the funds of the company will be legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is not to be the case, perhaps the Minister will tell us before this whole area sinks into a complete fog of confusion. The Minister's staff member was kind enough to tell the world the other day that the Minister was confused, and it was very apparent that he was. We believe it is time that this confusion was cleared up because investment decisions will have to be made, and presumably before the legislation is introduced and passed in the Budget session. So let us bring an end to this confusion. I think more light is thrown on it by looking at the small print of the Bill that is before us tonight, but it simply highlights the need-if there were any more need for it-for clarification of where there is presently, judging from the Minister's statements, regrettably, confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other provisions in the Bill which are worthy of comment without detailed discussion. One of them flows from a Federal Court decision in the News Corporation Ltd case-a decision which talks about control. The Bill seeks to give a more workmanlike definition to control, and there would seem to be some sense behind that. Given that we have a Broadcasting Tribunal and a regulatory framework, it is desirable that the Tribunal have some clearer guidelines, and the Bill is a step in this direction. So we support that amendment to the Act also. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of licence renewals, in substance, without going into it in too much detail, we are faced with a situation where the Tribunal apparently is bogged down in its licence renewal hearings, and it has deferred for up to two years 40 per cent of licences that are due for renewal in 1989-90. That is obviously not a very healthy situation. The Government's solution to this is, in effect, to extend the life of licences from three years to five years-quite a significant change. </PARA>
<PARA> To put it frankly, we would be opposing this change were it not for the fact that the amendments, so we are told, will not prevent the Broadcasting Tribunal from using the power it has under the Act to examine issues of importance during the term of the licence itself. The Tribunal will still be able to examine, even during the five-year period, those matters of importance that arise. The Tribunal also has power to renew a licence for a shorter period if it believes this is desirable. We, therefore, support this amendment provided that it is understood that the use of this extension of licence periods will be monitored-and it will be monitored by us and, I hope, by the Government-and provided also that it is understood that we are reserving our right in the future to make any other amendments that may be needed if licensees abuse the considerable privileges that they are being given by this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining area is one where we do have strong objections and will be opposing specific clauses of the Bill and moving amendments. Our concern arises from the proposed new sections 89a (14) and (15) and 89ea and the definition of `networking agreement' in clause 4. There really is on our understanding of this-and I hope we will get a more detailed explanation from the Minister than the one in the second reading speech-no justification for these new provisions at all, and that comes from concern expressed not only by the regional television stations, but also by other observers of this field. </PARA>
<PARA> To put it in a very generalised way, if one looks at the proposed new sections, one sees that what they do is to take out of the operation of the ownership and control provisions control of an otherwise independent licensee that might come from networking agreements, which, of course, are part of the mechanisms that operate in the television industry between networks and regional stations today. The amendments also take away the requirement that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation must consent to, and approve of, those networking agreements or some arrangement which flows from them. </PARA>
<PARA> We asked the question, by way of opening, why it is being done. There is no adequate explanation in the second reading speech of why it is being done. Indeed, the second reading speech, I regret to say, can only be described as less than frank. If we look at the second reading speech on this area, it is quite disarming. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> Recent legal advice indicates that arrangements between licensees who are affiliated to networks for the purposes of distribution of programming could breach the 60 per cent population reach television limit or associated cross-media limits. Clearly such arrangements between licensees are to be encouraged to make possible economies of scale in the production of programs and to support the Government's policy for equalisation of television services in regional areas of eastern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a very disarming statement and gives the appearance that these are amendments which will do nothing other than improve the equalisation program for the benefit of all. But when you look at the small print-that is exactly what is being done-the changes being made are really far more substantial than that. In some cases they are quite retrograde and that is the case for several reasons. I will refer to them in general and then in the committee stage I may have to say some more about them. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, we start off with the position I have described in the second reading speech. As I have said, we are told in the second reading speech that there is legal advice that arrangements between licensees who are affiliated to networks for the distribution of programming could breach the 60 per cent population reach for television. Therefore, it is said that this has to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> It raises the question as to what is the point of the 60 per cent audience reach rule if it is simply going to be reversed. On the surface it would seem that such arrangements would breach the 60 per cent rule and support for that view is obtained from the opinion of the Solicitor-General. What is the point of the 60 per cent rule? There is no explanation to this at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is simply going through this amendment to perpetuate a fiction because it is going to say, `Yes, the 60 per cent audience reach is being broken on any sensible test. Therefore, we will simply pass an amendment to say what clearly exists does not exist any more'-as if we can do that sort of thing by legislation. It does not solve anything. In fact, it creates, as I say, a fiction and probably a greater problem than we had before. The second thing about it-this is relevant to the amendments to section 89a of the Broadcasting Act-is that it removes the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal supervision, which is one of the safeguards for the regional television stations. </PARA>
<PARA> I say at this stage that I certainly do not stand here with a brief for the regional television stations. But that requirement for consent and approval by the Tribunal which was in the Act is now, in effect, being taken out. It was very important then and very important to those who look to regional television stations as a representation of local interest in their television programs-local interest in both senses of the word. That is being negated by these amendments to section 89a. It is a monumental omission from the second reading speech, disarming as it is on the surface. It is just omitted from the speech. It is a momumental change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is negating the provision in the Act that the Tribunal has to approve those arrangements. It is negating that and thereby laying the foundations for the regional television stations to become slaves to the networks. It is contrary to advice that was given to the Minister-I will refer to this in more detail later-that this should be done. I might refer to it precisely at this stage because it is no great secret that some advice was given to the Minister which was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. One sentence of it is very significant. The officers involved apparently told the Minister that some powers could be given to the Tribunal to prevent exploitation of affiliates by the network services. So the view of the Department was, apparently, that one must continue to have regard to this danger of networks exploiting regional stations. Do we find that in the Bill? Of course not. We find in the Bill the complete opposite and we will-unless we are persuaded to the contrary by the Minister in this debate-have the result, if this Bill becomes an Act, of regionals being made slaves to the networks with no supervision or careful examination of rural and regional interests by the Tribunal. There will be none of that at all; it will all go by the board. That is a very significant change which should be argued for by the Government if it is going to persuade us to support it. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there probably is a need, it must be conceded, for some change to the law on this subject because it seems that, as a result of this confusion that seems to pervade the Government on the whole issue, a situation has arisen where there are conflicts in the law. It must be rectified, but not by this means. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, because time is running out, the fourth point about all of this is that these provisions that I am referring to now clearly will affect in one way or another the regional television stations and they should be consulted on the problem. Contrary to what was said in the second reading speech, as I understand it, they have not been consulted. If that is wrong, I hope that the record will be set right and we will be told that they have had consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly-and it is the pernicious part of the whole thing-the Government is changing the law while the regional stations are before the court with quite legitimate litigation. It is quite outrageous. This advice to the Minister that I referred to starts off by referring to this case. So the Government knew when it drew this Bill what it was doing. It knew that the court case was on foot and it lost the first instalment today in the Federal Court, as we know, when it tried to strike out their statement of claim and failed. But now it is passing a Bill saying, `It does not matter what the law was when you started this case off. It does matter about your trying to preserve your legal rights. We will cut you off at the pass and legislate out of existence your legal rights'. That is an absolute outrage. The Government must defend that and explain it, otherwise we will not accept the Parliament being used in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I must move the amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time before my time expires. I will ask my colleague to second it. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>``the House declines to give the Bill a second reading and deplores the Government's hasty and ill-conceived attempt to bestow a vast new range of unpredictable and unnecessary powers on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in a desperate attempt to divert attention from its total failure to introduce any meaningful reforms of broadcasting regulation despite the Prime Minister's unequivocal 1987 election promise to `urgently reform this nightmarish legislation' ''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support both the Broadcasting Amendment Bill and the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) and oppose the amendment. The member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) talked about urgently reforming this nightmarish legislation, One might well look at the legislation which was operating before 1983 when we had cross-ownership of radio, television and newspapers right throughout Australia. I take his own State of Victoria as an example where one network could control what most people read in the newspaper and saw on the television and at one stage, if they were listening to 3DB, what they were getting over on radio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We had the Melbourne Sun in the morning and the Melbourne Herald in the afternoon, channel 7 television and radio 3DB all proclaiming the same slant and same type of views. Things certainly changed not that long after 1983 when the Government came to power. It worked towards extricating Australia from this complex system of media bias and control so that people could not have that cross-ownership to this degree. It was a very important move. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies talked about this Government abdicating responsibility to the industry. There is every indication that the Government has been steadily unravelling an uncompetitive, unfair and unjust industry. What he describes as bureaucratic red tape in the first Bill-of course, he praises removing some of the red tape in the second Bill-is part of the very important process of ensuring that people, in the country or the city, are able to have their choice in radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA> He also raised questions about the Government's proposal for foreign control. I think it should be made clear that it is the clear view of all those who are involved in the policy making leading towards these Bills-and I am one of them-that if a loan has a tie with any control at all, it is regarded as foreign control. I will leave it to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) to explain that in more detail and to comment on his talk about regional slaves to the major networks. Certainly the regional stations were in a very good position some years ago when they could almost tell the networks what they were going to pay. Things might not be quite as easy now as they were then. There will always be pressures on the major networks, if they really want their programs to get out on air, to come to some agreement with the regional networks and not just dictate to them. I will leave that to the Minister to comment on. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing for me to do as a rural member is to point out some of the good things that have happened along these lines, particularly in the region of Eden-Monaro. Ulladulla had no radio. The Eurobodalla shire, with tens of thousands of people, extending right from Cobargo nearly to Nowra, had no Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio. Narooma had no radio. Bombala had no radio or television stations, and the Snowy River shire had no radio or television stations. There were not more than two television stations in most of the rest of the region and three at the most from Canberra. The area did have a very good, strong local newspaper network and independent papers which are better than ever today in both quality and competition. Today we have more of them. As well as that, we have a wide range of improvements throughout the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Radio 2XL, which certainly has a very difficult task of servicing a relatively low population and yet providing the services that people want such as local news, is expanding. It has had important applications which have been dealt with by the Government to ensure that the Snowy Mountains-Bombala areas are serviced, and it has ambitions for other areas. In 1983 Radio 2EC did not cover Narooma but now does. There is the ABC radio 2BA/CP which has now extended into Bombala, into the Eurobodalla shire and the southern Shoalhaven area. After many years of commitments by previous members that this area would be getting radio, it now has. I can recall saying to some of the departmental people that if we did not get ABC radio in the Eurobodalla shire before the next election, I would not be very happy at all, because the postponement had gone on for years. The Department and Telecom Australia did cooperate and we now have an excellent radio service which is well appreciated in the Eurobodalla shire and the Southern Shoalhaven area. We improved radio contact by the ABC with the Snowy River shire and Cooma-Monaro shire making it a truly regional radio, linking two very important tourist areas-the south coast and the Snowy Mountains. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we had Radio National. It went into Tomerong, and, just a few weeks ago, into the Eurobodalla shire, giving people not just one radio station-which they have never had-but now a choice of two radio stations from the ABC as well as commercial radio and community radio in a lot of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> We have radio 2ST which has now gained contact with the Milton-Ulladulla people and given them a choice between ABC and commercial radio. They also have an FM station there, which is certainly doing something about strengthening its signal. They need to have access to Little Forest Trig which is in a national park not far from Milton. </PARA>
<PARA> Next we have the important community radio stations-EAR, Shoalhaven and Goulburn. In community radio we still have Canberra Community Radio 2XX, 1PHR, and 2SSS which are servicing people through the region around Canberra. The station EAR, in particular, is something which has happened since the beginning of this Government and which services the Eurobodalla shire entirely. It is very well appreciated, particularly before the ABC was set up in the Eurobodalla shire. Because it serviced the area so well, became popular and became a broad spectrum radio station covering all local community interests, EAR is still very strongly supported and well listened to. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certainly areas for improvement. For instance, in television we have a proposal for a major transmitter on Little Forest Trig in a national park near Milton-Ulladulla for which people have been waiting years. They were told two years ago that there would be television there for them in the not-too-distant future. We expected that it would be up and running by March last year, but the National Parks and Wildlife Service felt that it would have to have an environmental impact statement into the proposal. It did. It took some months for it to decide that it would approve access. When it did approve access, the Federal Government had to have its own environmental impact statement because it was acquiring land in the national park. </PARA>
<PARA> We then found that there were some objections from the National Parks Association of New South Wales-not, I hasten to add, the local branch of the National Parks Association at Milton-Ulladulla; that branch totally supported the proposal. I must say that the Milton-Ulladulla branch is an extremely environmentally conscious and very protective organisation operating through the southern part of the City of Shoalhaven. They are very fussy people when it comes to talking about approval for something going on in a national park. They examined it closely and recommended that it be allowed to go ahead, but the Sydney office did not. I have heard that there may be some trouble between the National Parks Association and the Milton-Ulladulla branch over this. I point out to the National Parks Association that there is no local environmentalist who will support it in what it is trying to do. One reason is that it is not environmentally harmful to have the transmitter as there is already a road to the area and there is already Telecom provision in the area.</PARA>
<PARA> It also ought to be pointed out that there is no alternative site for it for the many thousands of people in the City of Shoalhaven and in the northern part of the Eurobodalla shire who want that choice of television. Some people have no television at all at the moment and they are entitled to it. When Little Forest Trig is up and operating and able to obtain transmission from the central stations, the people will have a choice of five stations. In addition, the service at Little Forest Trig will boost the existing services, particularly from Prime and Capital television stations, two of the new commercial stations in the Eurobodalla shire. It will boost their strength and power of the transmission and will assist many people. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the good things that has happened in the last few years through this Government has been the move towards more stations. This aggregation was opposed, particularly by some of the National Party of Australia members in this House. Today when we have three commercial stations and the ABC operating in the Eurobodalla shire, the Bega Valley shire, the Bombala shire, the Snowy River shire and parts of Yarrowlumla shire, it is very evident that no political party would dare oppose the results of our aggregation and say that it would remove the availability of these stations to local people. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other places in the region will have a choice of not only three commercial stations and the ABC but the Special Broadcasting Service will also be available to people. These regions include the Tallaganda Shire, the Queanbeyan City Council, parts of the Yarrowlumla Shire, the Cooma-Monaro Shire and, when it happens, the City of Shoalhaven. Some of these areas have benefited and some will benefit by having a choice of five television stations. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with this the Government has had positive policies to assist a wide range of people in the broadcasting area. I include people in the areas of emergency services-coastal patrols, State emergency services, ambulances, local government patrols and others-who are extremely important in times of difficulty such as fire, flood and other types of hazards and accidents. They are always there and almost every year they are needed in one area or another. We have ensured that these people have access to frequencies. We need to continue doing that as the population in these areas grows. </PARA>
<PARA> There are things that need to happen; I have mentioned some of them. We have areas such as Adaminaby, Jindabyne and Berridale that could have improvements made to their television. It needs to be said that there are people who sometimes come from a city, such as Sydney or Melbourne, to country areas and face problems. One gentleman who saw me in Berridale one day said, `I can't get the races'. I said, `If you listen to the ABC on a Saturday you should be able to get the races'. He said, `No, I want them every day, like 2KY'. I said to him, `A lot of the major metropolitan stations have to be paid by the TAB to put the races on every day and you will be particularly fortunate if Berridale is able to get the races every day, but what you can do is contribute to one of the television stations' teletext programs or take up some other program such as, if you get access to it, TAB information'. </PARA>
<PARA> We have areas such as Delegate and Captains Flat which still cannot get television and which still need television. I know that there are some people in Delegate who can get fringe television from Bombala. There are others who cannot get satisfactory television, along with people in the area of north Gippsland. There are still difficult inland pockets, both for radio and television, that have to be worked on. There are a few areas such as Merimbula where there are quite a few residential pockets which have trouble getting reception. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we continue working on those areas. It is important that we continue moving along the lines that the Government is taking by not only expanding services and improving the access of people to services, whether they are in the city or in the country, but also ensuring that through a wide range of measures we make sure that we do not have too much foreign control, that most of the control is in Australia. It is very important when looking at programs that we do that. We will not see any other country allowing foreign people to control what the people in their own country watch on television. It is particularly important that we keep doing that. It is also particularly important that we ensure that our television firms are able to afford to program so that their programs are culturally acceptable. That is why it is important that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has some power in assessment. If we do not do that we will find that standards will drop. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have to realise that in certain areas of operation deregulation is hopeless. Having seen the television programs in the United States one can occasionally find one spouse on the camera while the other spouse is reading the news, something going wrong and the spouse reading the news going crook at the person on the camera, telling them to get their act together. I have seen a family row on television simply because it has deregulated to the extent where anybody can run a little station. The same thing has happened on radio. We need to ensure that our standards are maintained. We can do that by giving as much freedom as possible with the correct degree of control-control over foreign ownership; control over program standards-and as much liberty as possible so that people can get as much choice as possible. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the objectives of the Broadcasting Amendment Bill amending the Broadcasting Act is to give the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal access to more appropriate remedies to solve particular problems in relation to commercial television and radio, the licensees and the general services provided. I want to use my time to talk about some of the problems that exist and the need for remedies. In doing so I welcome the amendments that will allow public licensees to broadcast community promotional material. This has been advocated for a long period. This Government has picked up this request and is acting accordingly. It will also allow public broadcasters to transmit sponsorship announcements when conducting test transmissions. Again, this is the sort of request that has come from community radio groups as they have been establishing their radio stations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been said in the introductory speech by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), the legislation is part of the Government's wide ranging reform program for broadcasting in Australia, a program that encompasses so many aspects that it would take almost a textbook to really go through and explain the ramifications and the consequences of what the changes will bring about. I suppose one could say that it will put a halt to what has been over many years, over decades, a race towards deregulation. We are now halting that on-going trend. I voice some concern that we do not put too many fetters on what was necessary regulation, that we do not remove all the controls. I know that there has been wide acknowledgment to free up the system. It seems to be an attitudinal thing in Australia today that regulation is a bad thing. I am not necessarily in agreement with that. When we look back to the quality of services and standards one only maintains the quality and standards if we have rules and regulations and thresholds that we will not drop below. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is the beginning of change. It is the beginning of a process of change that will affect ownership and control in this country. It will affect licensee allocation and licensee renewal. It will ultimately have enormous impacts on program standards. It is generally going to affect the community in terms of television and radio. It has that objective of trying to get greater efficiency, to get more responsible broadcasting in this country and, I would hope, a higher and better quality of delivery of service. We need the highest quality of service that is possible financially for all consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> The other emphasis seems to be the public interest aspect. Again, one must support this. I express some concern that whilst we move down this legislative track to bring about these changes and we talk about making sure that the majority of people in Australia have high quality radio, there are many people in Australia who have no radio or the service is so bad that they may as well not have it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether my area of central Queensland is peculiar in this regard, but if one goes to the coastal area of the Broadsound region constant complaints are forthcoming about the quality of television or the lack thereof of a television service and radio service to the point now that the Broadsound shire is planning to spend some $35,000 to get a dish to pick up satellite television. The point is that the region will not get television out of Mackay, which is about 180 kilometres away, it will not get television out of Rockhampton which is about 190 kilometres away, but it will get the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and probably Channel 9 out of Townsville. The high tech changes are going to help but it will not get the local television service. One might say that at least it gets something. The region will get the service only if it pays for it through local authorities or individually. </PARA>
<PARA> The same is true in the Callide Valley, represented by my colleague, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and myself. We share that area. There are many areas there that do not have a quality service. Many have no service. I suggest, as a member representing these people, that whilst we move down this reform track let us not forget that there are people out there who do not have the sorts of services that those in the provincial cities and the capital cities take for granted. There is a need for a constant reassessment of the needs of all people. We often talk about country Australians. We ought to bring a new emphasis to isolated Australians, because there is an isolated Australia. That does not mean a person has to live at Ayers Rock; that person can be a few miles from the coast in Queensland. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2K4">Mr WRIGHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the point. But there are people who live not far from the major provincial cities and who lack services. When it comes to radio and television, we take those services for granted, whether it be the news broadcast or whether it be for the racing that some want to listen to on Saturdays. They expect this. They demand it. There is an obligation on this Parliament to ensure that that service is provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time there is a danger in how far one goes in the provision of services. This is the other side of the coin. The commercial radio stations in my electorate are sending signals that, if deregulation moves to such an extent that there will be an unlimited number of stations starting up, they will be broke. Some have confidentially shown me their accounting figures. They have been willing to sit down and talk about their financial state. I certainly would not be rushing in to invest in some of the radio stations in that area because of the financial plight they now face. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we say. `Yes, let us understand that deregulation can bring about a new efficiency; it can bring self-responsibility; it can encourage self-setting standards; and it can do so much to achieve a better quality industry', at the same time we may see some detriments. I fear that those detriments shall be in my areas. My parochial role as a member of parliament is to represent those people, to represent the businesses which employ many of my constituents. So I signal that concern. </PARA>
<PARA> There are commercial radio stations, not only in central Queensland but in many parts of Australia, which are facing financial problems right now. Those of us who have had some involvement in the advertising industry-for some years I had a role in the newspaper industry-quickly come to realise that there is a limitation on advertising dollar. As we talk about three commercial radio stations in central Queensland because of the new policies that we are implementing, we will have television stations fighting for the advertising dollar. The losers shall be the local newspapers and also the local radio stations. </PARA>
<PARA> If we add to that problem by allowing more radio stations, one can quickly appreciate how difficult and disastrous the situation shall become-I am not saying may become; it shall become. There is a certainty about that. I would urge that, as the unnecessary regulations are removed, we give great emphasis to public interest. That public interest is not only quality but also comes back to just getting the service and to protecting-not unduly, but within the competitive system-our existing players. </PARA>
<PARA> I make my final remarks about the quality of service. I urge the Minister, through his department and through the Tribunal, to endeavour to carry out an ongoing assessment of what can be done to solve the problems in these regions. As I mentioned before, 20,000 people reside in the Callide Valley. One can only describe the quality of television and radio in that area at most times as shocking. So let us move down the track of high-tech, let us improve this quality service, but let us also remember that as we move into the twenty-first century there are people in Australia who are not even getting the basics, not even receiving those services that everyone else takes for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the legislation. I welcome the initiative taken by the Government. I welcome the courage, because it is difficult to bring about change. That is what this Government has been doing in the past 6 3/4 or seven years-bringing about change, initiating change, walking the tough road and making the tough decisions. Sometimes there are casualties. My fear is that as we deregulate, as we rush down that track, there shall be more casualties. I certainly do not want to see my constituents being those casualties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my regret that, unfortunately, the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1990 and the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 are hardly a step along the path to deregulation. Indeed, half the problems that our media have are a result of the way in which the Government has administered the legislation. Each of these two Bills, it seems to me, just complicates the general question of holding and maintaining licences within the Australian legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The product of the legislative intervention by the Australian Labor Party has been to concentrate to excess the ownership within each of the sectors. I see nothing in either of these Bills which will change that. Indeed, one of the Bills could probably be called the Bond amendment. I happen to have a great deal of sympathy for many of the difficulties that the Bond television and radio interests have suffered, in part because I think it is hard to divorce the fact that Channel 9 remains the most popular of all the television channels and the fact that it still is failing to make money. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, it needs to be understood that a few years ago-not peculiarly because of the legislation, which I understand was largely inspired by the present Treasurer (Mr Keating), but certainly in part because of it-there was a rash of takeovers. The rash of takeovers led to an escalation of the values of each of these stations and advertising revenue could no longer sustain their value. We all know the record we are approaching at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision announced by the new Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) really seems to be quite incredible, because he has suddenly decided that he will enforce the percentage of overseas ownership in a way which everybody has known has existed for about 10 years, on which very little action has been taken and which is specifically designed, as I would see, to make it very difficult for us to retain three major networks in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, the Government has proceeded to concentrate ownership and, on the other hand, it has said, `Yes, but we are not too sure whether that third licensee is going to be viable'. I am very suspicious of the reason that that 49.9 per cent of ownership in companies that are not directly owning the licence will reduce to 20 per cent. I think the product of that could well be that we will find that in many States we will have two networks. That is all a product of the way in which the operation of the legislation has tended to restrict diversity and competition, and the fallout has been in a whole range of areas. As latterly as this week we have the prospect of the former owner of the Channel 9 group taking over again. That is a matter of commercial decision and I offer no views on that. Indeed, I have always had a great respect for the contribution that Kerry Packer made to the television industry at the time he first took over Channel 9. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, there were problems with cricket. Let us face it, a good test match is far better than those one-day games; but that is a matter of prejudice too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having heard a little of the contribution of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), my concern is that we have a package of legislation which will not facilitate deregulation of the industry and which comes on top of a decision by the Minister in respect of overseas ownership based not on a rational assessment of how we can get diversity or competition or better viewer choice but essentially on a prejudice that the Minister has displayed, which I do not think will help with what the viewers want. It will not provide quality in television. It will not help his constituents or mine get better viewing opportunities. This legislation is in exactly the same domain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has gone mad on introducing legislation instead of trying to find ways by which we can get all this nonsensical extent of legal systems and paraphernalia within the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) simplified. It seems to me that we probably would have been better initially looking at those who are on the ABT. I have little regard or respect for the extent to which the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal now is so much of a legal body that the average Australian and certainly the average licensee spend so much of their time briefing counsel that they have little real opportunity to provide the quality of either television or radio that is really the object of the Act. When in charge of this area, I tried to delegalise it. I suggest that that would have been a far better course than these two pieces of legislation. If we try to remove a bit of excess legalistic paraphernalia, I think today we would have a lot better package of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing I would say about the two Bills is that they are going in the wrong direction. The second is that they will not in any way promote deregulation, in spite of the views of the honourable member for Capricornia. The third is that I really think that we have a number of very serious decisions that the Government has to address. Because I understand that the Government has now decided that it will produce another report about regulations for the industry, I suspect it might well have been better had we deferred these two pieces of legislation until we saw what that latest list of regulations would be. If we identify a few of the problems and ask whether this legislation addresses them, perhaps my point will be better understood. First, I do not like the general concept of trying to promote, within this legislation, what I would see as a device to overcome some of the particular problems that have appeared in the Bond ownership. That certainly seems to me to be the problem with this `fit and proper' definition. </PARA>
<PARA> As one who has looked at the `fit and proper' definition and understands the reasons for its insertion, I think we have to acknowledge that the character of that requirement came from another time. No longer is the individual, under the circumstances of the capitalisation of these stations, likely to exercise a great deal of influence over particular programs. That is not to say that a particular broadcasting entity should not be assessed as to whether or not it is fit and proper in the programs it provides. It might as well be promoting some sort of a criminal or quasi-criminal activity, or it might be promoting some sort of ideology or idiom or some other particular point of view which is not seen as contributing to the well-being of the Australian community. It might be pursuing excessive violence. It could be considered not fit and proper because of the character of the programs it pursues. So I can understand that there is a requirement for fit and proper broadcasting. But what has happened in one of these Bills is that, in trying to meet the particular difficulties that Mr Bond has suffered, the Government has given a little more discretion to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT), but I do not think it has really addressed the fundamental problem. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason I have reservations about the way in which the legislation has gone. Much as I would have liked to see that old definition removed, I query whether this is necessarily the right way to address the problem. As I say, there was less legalism about the ABT in the past. I think that we need to remove much of the mumbo jumbo that is now a product of the ABT. Indeed, I would like to see less frequent inquiries. I think that it would be far better if we maintained a format. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not the only thing that is in the Bill. The trouble is that the Government is giving excessive powers to the ABT. It is giving the ABT more power, not less power. I am suggesting to the Government that the solution is to give less power to the ABT. It has to try to get rid of the idea that the ABT is all powerful. The ABT has not produced the answers. Let us be realistic: the reason the industry is in a mess is that the ABT has failed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been responsible for the body and I know that the old ABT under Mr Jones was 10 times as efficient as this one. We had men like Mr Archer, who was a practical commercial journalist who had been involved in the industry and knew what it was about. What we have now is one of these jolly administrative tribunals and one has to be a lawyer to understand what the law means-and the Government is giving it more power. That is not the way to go. Honourable members opposite are mad keen on introducing more regulations on the pretence of deregulating. That is not the way to deregulate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We certainly did not think that the Labor Party deserved to win and we made some comments to that effect during the election campaign, as the honourable member will recall. We are in opposition and we regret it, but we regret even more the fact that the honourable member is sitting on the Government side-not so much the honourable member, but some of his colleagues on the front bench who do not deserve to have ever been appointed to the right hand side of Mr Speaker in this Parliament. But although I believe that, the Australian public regrettably does not, and so be it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My concern now is that we have to find a way by which we can provide more competition-which the Government's changes to the legislation have not done. We have to find a way in which we can provide better choices. Those of us who live in the bush would like to see a system under which the third station in an aggregated area will not go broke. Nothing under the Government's legislation is ensuring that. I would like to see a system under which, instead of that ABT looking at every nuance of the behaviour of people and determining whether they are fit and proper, we actually reduce the legal obligations for licensees to appear before the Tribunal constantly. We should be reducing the power of the ABT so that it becomes more of a reviewing body reviewing the operation of licences rather than legalistically setting up a formula which, quite demonstrably in this instance, the Government is modifying because it thinks that the ABT might take a decision which the Government would not think was correct. </PARA>
<PARA> I really do not think this legislation meets the general objectives that any sensible Australian would have: to get better viewer choice and try to ensure more competition. I think we have to look at a few of the fundamentals. I would like to get rid of the cross-media ownership restraint. As one who comes from the bush, I can tell honourable members that there would be no decent media in the bush if it were not for the fact that in the days when radio was first established the local newspaper proprietors invested in it. When television was established they became involved in television and because they had the right background, the electronic media in the early days in Australia developed quickly and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is a much wider subject than all of this and that is the extent to which people get the same news broadcast throughout Australia. Syndicated journalists whose views are most important than even those in the ranks of the press gallery in this place are adjudicating on the affairs of Australia. I would like to see a system whereby there is competition, choice and quality advertising, and no undue legal intervention. Nothing in this legislation gives me an assurance that there will not be such intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not know where it is going in the regulatory decisions it has advanced-whether in enforcing this 20 per cent overseas ownership rule or whether in the absolutely nonsensical decision by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) with respect to the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and National Mutual. The Government more and more seems to believe that the only answer to micro-economic reform is to produce another set of regulations. I do not think the Government knows where it is going and, sadly, the product of the legislation it is introducing is not going to increase the opportunities for people to get quality television and radio in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of other aspects of the legislation which worry me. The first is the fact that there is to be a requirement that, if there are significant changes, there needs to be more frequent reporting to the ABT. I cannot understand why that requirement is not in the form of the corporate legislation around Australia. In other words, if there is a change of general manager and the general manager is a person who is going to influence the programming of a station, why can that not be reported within 30 days, for example, as a change of ownership or membership of a company is reported? I think that if there is a change it should be reported, but if there is no change why have an obligation for three monthly reporting?</PARA>
<PARA> There are two other areas in the legislation that worry me. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) is not included in this legislation. I have great worries about the ABC. There are several areas of the ABC's operation that, under Mr Hill, have become excessively politicised. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned, for example, that there have been changes in some of the regional stations. I believe that regional ABC is absolutely essential. I happen to live in an area where I cannot get anything but the ABC. </PARA>

I would like to see the controls of the ABT, if they are to apply to commercial radio, applied to the ABC. I am quite sure that many of its programs would not meet those requirements. I think it would be a jolly good thing if the Government, in making the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal responsible for quality and standards of broadcasting and television in Australia, subjected the ABC to exactly the same controls.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have other worries about the ABC. I think that the nature of changes to the ABC has not provided the sort of diversity and quality that is quite apparent in the programs that for example, emanate from the parent, if one likes to think of it as that, of the ABC-the British Broadcasting Corporation. In spite of all its problems, to my mind it generates better quality programs. We still buy a lot of them. Most of us enjoy watching them. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether we have a particularly Anglophile disposition is not what it is about. It is about the fact that within the ABC there is an opportunity to generate that quality of broadcasters, of talent and of programs that used to be there but is not there any longer. If it were made the subject of some intervention by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, perhaps it could be achieved. However, it does not exist at the moment and it worries me. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that these pieces of legislation achieve what they are supposed to achieve. I think they are short term expedients to try to get the Government off the hook by a couple of devices. </PARA>
<PARA> To give another example of the ABC, I am very worried about what is happening to Radio Australia. Radio Australia happens to be one of the best contributions that this country can make to ensuring that countries in our region have some understanding of our country and culture and we can get a feedback from them into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, there are all sorts of financial pressures being put on Radio Australia. I was at the Australia-Japan cooperation meeting on Monday and the Japanese language broadcaster said that it is highly likely that the broadcast of Japanese on Radio Australia will be eliminated. That horrified me. One of the best ways we have of maintaining contact between Australia and the countries in our region is to ensure that we maintain Radio Australia, that we give it the funds to produce the programs that enable an understanding of the ways, the morays and attitudes of Australians in their countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Some years ago I was talking to a doctor who came from central Siberia in the Soviet Union and I was amazed that he spoke with an Australian accent. I said to him, `How the devil did you come to speak with an Australian accent?' He replied. `As a matter of fact, I learned English listening to Radio Australia.' That is the sort of thing that comes out of Radio Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to Mr Hill and the Government that if they do anything to eliminate the quality of opportunity and the diversity of programs, the foreign language parts of Radio Australia and its broadcasting, it would be diabolic. Those are the sorts of things I would prefer to see the Minister addressing instead of giving more legalistic powers to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and trying to introduce a device to get around the fit and proper definition within this legislation because of some unfortunate findings affecting Mr Alan Bond. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a real need for us to look at the whole field of television and broadcasting legislation. We want to have diversity and competition. We want to make sure that the concentration of ownership within each of the segments of the media is reduced, not enhanced. We want to make sure that there is once again an opportunity in regional Australia for quality television, quality broadcasting and diversity. A lot needs to be done in this area. I have absolutely no faith that under the present Minister, and certainly under the present Government, it will be any better than it has been over the last seven years. We all know that things are a lot worse now than when the coalition was last in power. </PARA>

I have not heard one objective commentator not ascribe the difficulties to companies over-bidding the licences when Channel 7, Channel 9 and Channel 10 were sold. That had absolutely nothing to do with the Government. We had no control over the prices they were prepared to pay. Is the right honourable member suggesting, therefore-if he is concerned about that and that is identified as the cause-that we should regulate the price people are prepared to pay?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tragically, it is true to say that the organisations go through trauma as a result of this profligate spending and purchasing, but the real losers are the employees of the organisation. Many have now been forced out of the industry. Of course, the supporting independent production houses are also copying it. It has been a savage blow to not only the networks but also their employees and, of course, the production houses. But it is not the Government that is responsible; it was the money that people were prepared to pay for these networks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the Minister have taken a consistent line-that is, the prescribed level of foreign interest in television stations is 20 per cent. It is correct to say that when the right honourable member for New England was a member of Cabinet when the Opposition was in government in 1981, that government specifically passed legislation that allowed networks to take the level of foreign ownership to 49 per cent. In fact, that could be increased by contriving further holding companies. It is true to say that that provision has always existed, and we objected to it. </PARA>
<PARA> What has triggered action by the Government is that one of the networks has about a 45 per cent ownership and others are very keen to get there. That does not cause the right honourable member any heartburn or concern. I believe that he is out of touch with the public and public thinking on this issue. There is a concern about foreign investment right across our industry and our economy and it is particularly sensitive in the media, particularly in television stations. </PARA>
<PARA> Any public opinion poll would applaud what the Minister is doing, but the right honourable member for New England says, `No, this is wrong. What we need to do is deregulate'. In other words, we have three networks, he is concerned that there may be only two, and presumably we should deregulate so there can be four or five. What would be the situation then? Australian production control would nosedive and things would get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Presumably, the right honourable member would have unrestricted foreign ownership operating. Foreign countries would love to set up an Australian network. They would love to buy an existing network. But would that be in the national interest? Is that what the people of Australia want to see? I think the answer to that, quite clearly, is no; they do not want to see that. They want to see the existing foreign ownership position of the Government maintained and the control provisions tightened. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, when looking at foreign ownership and control in this legislation, to take shareholding as a benchmark. We have done that. The level is set at a maximum of 20 per cent and, for any one holding, a maximum of 15 per cent. There are tracing provisions by which Australian companies with some foreign ownership will be counted in. However, the Bill strengthens other forms of control. It identifies other areas where the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) should be concerned. I quote from the Minister's second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The definition-</PARA>
<PARA>of control of a company-</PARA>
<PARA>covers situations where a person is in a position to exercise direct or indirect control, whether through the power of direction or restraint, over any substantial issues affecting the management or affairs of a company. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very strong provision. I would have thought that honourable members opposite, including members of the National Party of Australia, would be welcoming the Bill. I know of no brief in rural and provincial Australia that says that we want to see more foreign ownership of our television networks. It is certainly not the case in the metropolitan area. I thought that the National Party would take a very principled stand and support this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member for New England talks about the legalistic approach of the ABT. He thinks that one of the real problems is the ABT. He said that it is always briefing counsel; it is heading in the wrong direction. It is not the ABT that is being taken to the Federal Court all the time. When millions and millions of dollars are at stake, I guess it is not unreasonable, although one would not want to see it, that those companies are prepared to question and challenge each and every decision of the ABT right through the legal process. One cannot blame the organisation that is being challenged in this way, as the ABT is, for being overly legalistic. Those companies are exercising what they see as their rights. I suggest that there is a degree of frustration in what they are doing. They are trying to frustrate and delay the ABT. In fact, they are obviously succeeding in making it appear to be overly legalistic. But the ABT is not being over-legalistic; it is the networks that are taking the ABT to court. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member for New England said, `We want to have less frequent hearings', and this is exactly what the legislation provides. We have lifted the hearings from every three years to every five years and, where television licensees agree, one can have a concurrent hearing in one particular area. Instead of having three separate hearings, one can actually hear the three cases together at the one time. I suggest that that gives the public a greater opportunity to look at the quality of television services actually being offered in their area. I would have thought that this would be of fundamental interest to rural and provincial Australia. People do not want to check on how just one company is going; they want to check on how all three companies are meeting both the needs of their area and the degree to which they are putting in local content. I am surprised at the right honourable member for New England. I would have thought that he would have supported that rather than say that there should be less frequent hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not really understand in what way the right honourable member for New England wants to deregulate television interests any further other than acknowledging that the opposition has a position on foreign ownership which is totally different from ours. We see it as important to have an Australian culture that one can see and enjoy on television stations. In fact, if one talks to the network owners, they will say that it is the quality Australian products that rate highest. We want to maintain that, and we ought to have a right to continue to maintain it. </PARA>
<PARA> If the ABT is taken away, there would be no restrictions on the networks importing the cheaper overseas product. It would be very easy. The difference is maybe $400,000 per hour to $10,000 or $20,000 per hour. So it is very easy to up the amount of overseas product that we see on our television stations, but I question what that is going to do to us as a country and as a nation. I am proud to be an Australian; I am proud of our heritage; I am proud of our country; I am proud of what we value as Australians and the diversity we have here. I want to see that reflected in the network. Mr Deputy Speaker, have no worries about the people of Chifley. That is also very strongly their position, and I would not be game to adopt any other position. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member for New England mentioned a couple of other matters, and I will address those too. Firstly, I think that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) does a very fine job. I like talking to its Managing Director and am probably counted as something of an ABC addict. In Canberra, with its slightly larger population than Blacktown City, for example, but certainly significantly smaller than the region of the western suburbs of Sydney, we do not have a western suburbs television station. The ABC station down here in Canberra pumps out programs and local information; we do not have that. The western suburbs do not have an ABC radio station. I suppose, as much as those things are very desirable, we actually do not have any ABC journalists stationed in the western suburbs of Sydney. We have got newspaper journalists and other journalists located in the western suburbs of Sydney chasing western suburbs stories, but none from the ABC, and I think that is an oversight. </PARA>
<PARA> I specifically mention the situation of 2WS, which is a unique station in that it really does not fit into any particular model. It does not have a metropolitan licence, but, of course, it has a limited coverage over about 80 per cent of metropolitan Sydney. That station very much wants to be able to get an FM licence, and I can understand that. If one looks at the demographics of western Sydney, we are very much a young area with great wealth as regards the children of the region, and they are very much tuned into FM radio. But under the current situation 2WS has to bid for a full Sydney licence, knowing that it can get only about an 80 per cent coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the right honourable member for New England on the issue of FM licences that we have again had a situation where people have been prepared to pay-in this case tender-exorbitant amounts of money for an FM licence, to the extent that people are worried about the viability of AM radio; it is sending the radio stations broke. What does the Government do? Do we legislate and say, `You are not allowed to put that bid in because we think that that is wrong; we are going to deduct that bid and take $10m or $15m off it'? What do we do when we have businessmen who clearly can put their bids in but perhaps are not getting their underlying sums right reflecting those bids?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Menzies says that we have created the mess. We would much rather have the golden handshake approach-that is, we will get the list of applicants in, we will know who is a friend of who, and then we will tap one on the head and say, `Yes, your submission is best, you have got the licence'. It is an economic commodity, and it is fair enough that people should be paying an entry price. But what does one do when people are inflating their estimate of what their revenue is going to be and putting in inflated bids for entry prices so that they are putting the squeeze on the industry? Frankly, I do not know the answer. Perhaps the honourable member for Menzies is much closer to these businessmen and business practices than I am. I am always prepared to learn and try to understand, and perhaps the honourable member for Menzies will be able to help me out in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the point I am making is that 2WS is in a unique situation. It is true that it serves our community very well. It is very much committed to the western suburbs of Sydney and wants to remain so. It sees that, if it cannot move to an FM licence, it is going to lose that regional flavour which is so vital for it. The previous Minister for Transport and Communications, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), was looking at the problem, and I express the wish that the current Minister will also look at ways of resolving it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a question of coverage and price.

I think it would be arguably ridiculous to make someone who is only going to get a partial coverage pay 100 per cent of the entry price. I can see that the honourable member and I agree on that, and I am very pleased. I want to sum up my contribution on this Bill and say that I was privileged before the last election to have some involvement in it. I would like to sincerely thank the Minister for that. I think what we have done is very good-it is not the total answer, nor did it purport to be the total answer, but it is a package designed to bring some efficiencies quickly to the industry. It reduces the number of transactions that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has to monitor. It really does cut down the Tribunal's paper overload. The shadow Minister has been to the ABT and he knows just how much it is deluged with paper. We have tidied that up. All I am asking is for the Opposition to be gracious enough to acknowledge that. We have varied the prescribed interest. We have clarified control of the company. We have extended the period of licence renewals. We have also, under the new networking arrangements which are possible under aggregation, ensured that they do not breach relevant ownership and control limits. I sincerely would have enjoyed being involved in the more fundamental review. I know that that is in good hands and I will be, as I know the industry will be, positively awaiting the outcomes of that review. I support this legislation and I suggest that if the Opposition were fair dinkum it would support it too.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Broadcasting Amendment Bill and the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2). At the outset I pick up a few of the points that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) raised earlier tonight. It seems to me we were presented with a proposition which went something along the lines that this legislation was hasty and ill conceived; it was not going to eradicate any of the problems as far as the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) was concerned; it was simply an attempt to divert attention away from the real issues that affect the industry generally; and the industry was in decay largely because of the Government being incapable of taking appropriate decisions. I think that summarises some of the points.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Really, the honourable member for Menzies, even in his own contribution, contradicted that series of assertions that he made. The Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) is a real attempt to go to the heart of many of the issues that have been of concern to people both in the industry and outside in respect of the operation of the ABT. There is a provision which, according to the second reading of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), will remove something like 90 per cent of the matters that are dealt with in one area and extend the five per cent provision to 15 per cent as far as the review process is carried out. I really believe that is a very tangible step at this point given that this particular piece of legislation, as my colleague the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) outlined, is part of a total package that will eventually see a major stabilisation of the whole industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very easy to stand up and make the assertion that the industry has all sorts of problems, all created by the Government. I just do not think that is a fair proposition at all. Indeed, as one who has had a continuing interest in matters to do with the broadcasting industry generally, I think that defies any historical perspective; we should remember that the honourable member for Menzies and his colleagues were responsible for bringing in the 1981 legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member for Menzies that I believe that this legislation represents a balanced and realistic start to the process of both recognising the worth of constructive regulations where necessary and limiting them as far as is possible. At the same time, because of the practices which have occurred in media and which have led to the totally uneconomic propositions that have developed and that have affected so many people's livelihoods-and will continue to do so-these amendments are vital to get back a sense of rationality in that field. </PARA>
<PARA> Much was made earlier about the procedures relating to foreign ownership limits. Over the last few weeks, having been involved with that part of the decision and having talked about it to people in the community, I believe the community, as I perceive it, is very much in agreement with what the Government and the Minister have argued persuasively and effectively for. It ill-behoves the Opposition, in a situation which in many senses it created back in 1981, to now say that to try to apply these provisions effectively is somehow wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> We should be concerned about the national interest. We should be concerned about public interest. We should be concerned about the long-term good of our communications and broadcasting industry. The only way of doing that in my view, if we have a genuine commitment to Australian broadcasting, is to ensure that the processes we set in place-the powers we give the ABT, and the relevance of the ABT operations-are the subject of these particular provisions, and the ones that will inevitably follow later in the year. </PARA>
<PARA> It strikes me, having heard the debate, that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) argued that what we needed was to de-legalise the Tribunal. Anyone who has seen the history of the Tribunal would say that it has not really been the Tribunal's objective to create that; it has been created largely by the industry. This Bill seeks to address the need for the Tribunal to look at the substantive issues. Simply increasing the public hearing time from three years to five years surely opens up much of the flexibility that people in those areas would seek as a matter of course. </PARA>
<PARA> One then comes to issues dealing with the definitions of `fit and proper'. While I do not propose to go though those at great length I simply want to say that the whole process come back to things that have been talked about, such as community interest and concern. I think the tidying up of those provisions was vital and important. For the right honourable member for New England to have suggested that they really were not priority issues that needed to be addressed just does not take account of what has actually occurred in recent times as far as the industry is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk briefly about and follow on from some of the remarks made by my colleague the honourable member for Chifley. I want to look at the radio industry and our part of the western suburbs of Sydney and the particular needs we have there. It strikes me that as part of the total review there is a great need to look at the question of FM conversion. There is no dispute about that. We have been faced with, really, a situation where the need of our community to be more effectively accessed in terms of public information has been met only through the one commercial operation. Regrettably, much of the rest of the media has not given adequate coverage to the population of about 1.8 million people who live west of Parramatta in Sydney. That applies whether one is dealing with the commercial operators or the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), for that matter. We really have been sorely neglected in that field. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty occurs where there is a limited licence. It is easy to say, `Just have the FM conversion', but where there is a limited licence range, as 2WS has, there is a problem in terms of establishing the appropriate quantum for the value of that licence. It is not just a case of doing a simple exercise. It has to be fair and equitable to all those who are participants in that process. I think the only way of achieving that is to really address, in some considerable detail, the special relationship and the special needs that exist in urban areas in a broader sense. It may well be, in terms of the questions the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) raised earlier, that that needs to apply in provincial areas as well. I think that there will be adequate opportunity to view those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the community I represent is concerned, we need to have effective and diverse information readily available to us to ensure that we are in a position to carry that through, and it is something that we want to see the Government and the community at one on. The lack of access that we have to television services has riled many people from my region over the years. It is easy to say that the public interest components and the need for deregulation at all costs that the Opposition proffers on these issues is the way to reach some totally utopian position. There is no evidence that that actually applies in the broadcasting field; there is no evidence at all that that has been the case. What we need is to effectively target what we are trying to do and to realistically wipe out the red tape issues that are of concern with the ABT, but not necessarily to go to the final position that the honourable member for Menzies and others might advocate in terms of deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will speak briefly on a matter that was raised earlier concerning the ABC. I think that is an interesting area of debate. I think it is something worth looking at in the committee process. For all that, the service we obtain from the ABC historically in our area has been developing, despite the economic constraints that have applied. I argue that constructive debate about that process should be adequately pursued. I hope to have the opportunity to raise this matter with the Minister in the committee process and to develop that particular approach further. Before I turn now to a couple of specific provisions in the legislation at this point, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill makes provision for payment of increased salaries for parliamentarians and parliamentary office-holders, judges, secretaries to departments and senior statutory office-holders, following the disallowance of various determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal contained in its report of 23 May 1990 and its determination No. 17 in respect of offices in the Industry Commission. The effect of the Bill, by comparison with the provisions of the disallowed determinations, is to alter the commencement of several of the increases from 1 January 1990 to 1 July 1990-in other words, there will be no retrospectivity as the Tribunal proposed to decrease some of the recommended rises, and phase in most increases in two or three stages six months apart. The Bill also provides for linking the basic salary for parliamentarians to a salary level in the Senior Executive Service of the Public Service-the top of SES band 1. </PARA>
<PARA> At present there is a linkage between the salaries of judges of the Federal Court and members of the Industrial Relations Commission. It is proposed that this link be broken and that members of the Industrial Relations Commission have their salaries fixed in their own right. Salaries for judges of the High Court, the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court are increased 6 per cent from 1 July 1990 and 6 per cent from 1 January 1991. Salaries of the President, Deputy Presidents and Commissioners of the Australian Industrial Commission are increased by 6 per cent from 1 July 1990. Those for other judicial related offices are also adjusted. Salaries for secretaries to departments and senior statutory holders are increased by 19 per cent from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, basic salaries for members of parliament are linked by legislation to the top of the SES band 1. These consequent increases are phased in three instalments-6 per cent from 1 July 1990 and 1 January 1991, and with the balance of approximately 5 per cent from 1 July 1991. The Government accepts the Remuneration Tribunal's determination of entitlements for members of parliament. This includes the option of a private plated car offset by a $6,000 per annum contribution from salary or electorate allowance. For parliamentary office-holders, expenses of office allowances are incorporated in additional salaries and this total amount adjusted in the same way as salaries of other members and senators. The Bill also provides for the necessary appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that over the past few years there have been substantial changes in the nature and extent of the responsibilities of judges, senior officials and members of Parliament, including Ministers. The Government considers, however, that some greater measure of restraint is necessary, reflecting the restraint shown by other groups in the community. It is for these reasons that the Government does not propose to adopt the full range of increases determined by the Tribunal in order that the clearest possible consistency be maintained with wage and salary movements in the community at large. In this context, it is emphasised that the national wage guidelines are completely met by the proposals now included in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Remuneration Tribunal reported to Government on increases for Ministers. As with other parliamentary office-holders, the Government will incorporate expenses of office allowances for Ministers into their additional salaries and has decided that an ongoing link be established on the same basis as for parliamentary office-holders. That is, Ministers are to receive the same percentage increase in additional salaries as members of parliament, and phased in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The direct costs of the adjustments proposed, excluding indirect effects on costs of superannuation, et cetera, are estimated to be approximately $7m in a full year. These costs are significantly less than would have been incurred had the Tribunal's determinations been implemented in full. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not oppose the passage of the Remuneration and Allowances Bill 1990 through the House of Representatives. I say on behalf of the Opposition that this system, along with all other systems that have been adopted in the past to adjust these remunerations, is less than ideal. The fact is that the alternatives available, given the constraints of the existing wage fixing policies of this Government and in particular its bondage to the accord, would have been worse than what is proposed in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no embarrassment in saying that all of the salary and remuneration areas dealt with by this Bill are ones that lag significantly behind what on any objective analysis would be remuneration that the officers in question are entitled to receive. There is no doubt that over the last 10 or 15 years the measure of self-imposed salary restraint by members of the Parliament, at the behest of governments of both political persuasions, has been very considerable and has been greater than that exercised by other sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Any measurement will show that salary increases over that period of time have lagged behind increases in the consumer price index. There is, in my opinion, no perfect system for adjusting members of Parliament's salaries and remunerations. I have a view that it is something of an impossible dream to imagine that we can ever take politics out of parliamentarians pay rises no matter what system we adopt, no matter what time of the year or political cycle it is and no matter who happens to be in power. </PARA>
<PARA> I note an encouraging trend that is that there is a slightly less implacably hostile attitude in the community to the proposition that there should occasionally be some adjustments. But one should not get too carried away or excited about that. There is a mixture of feelings on our side about the linkage. It is true that having a linkage with the Public Service reduces in a very significant way the role of the Remuneration Tribunal. Those who see the value of the Tribunal will be concerned about that. But given the propensity of governments over the years to interfere with recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal, it may well be--</PARA>

<PARA> I would like to say two other things that relate to the philosophy that the Opposition brings to the fixing of pay levels in the Public Service. I have said on a number of occasions recently that it is absurd that we have such rigidity in our approaches to pay in this country-that some of the brightest and best people are leaving the Public Service and going into private industry. The levels of pay which are provided are still significantly below what those people are worth. The Secretary to the Department of Treasury is paid $126,000. The Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister is paid about the same. The pay that people occupying those positions could command in sectors of private industry would be well above that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also desirable in the interests of attracting the highest calibre of people to the judiciary that we continue to keep pay in those positions at a proper level. It is a remarkable tribute to the willingness of many people of ability that they offer themselves for public office in politics and also accept the judicial appointments. People of high quality come forward despite the fact that many of them incur a very significant financial loss. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by asking the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) for assistance in drawing my attention to that part of the legislation that deals with the question of dislocation allowances. It was my understanding that the measure would include a reference to that and my reading of the Bill suggested that it does not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We respect the fact that the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has outlined briefly in his second reading speech the full details contained in the Bill. I support the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and what he has said. There are just a few matters I would like to raise concerning the legislation and certainly the work that members of the Parliament do, particularly those of us who come from the rural areas of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If our minds go back in history, as the honourable member for Bennelong happened to remark, we will remember it is 12 or 15 years since the government of the day fully accepted the recommendations of the various tribunals. In fact, the Act was first set up in 1973 and came into operation in 1975. It was the Fraser Administration that first rejected the recommendations because of the economic situation at the time. In recent years, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of the Australian Labor Party has rejected them because of the accord and the arrangements that were actually made between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 a special inquiry was set up to look at the conditions and the remuneration of the members of the Parliament and also senior public servants. Once again, the Government has not accepted the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal. I think it is a very significant thing that the Minister has now presented to the House a Bill covering certain increases in salary and a change in assistance to our members of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is interesting to note that the honourable member for Bennelong remarked that we, as representatives of the people, have been rather poorly treated so far as our remuneration is concerned, compared with the Public Service and with the judiciary, and certainly when compared with private industry. I have here before me the 1990 awards which show that a judge of the Federal Court of Australia receives $142,000 a year, the same as a judge of the Family Court of Australia and the President of the Trade Practices Tribunal. The Chief Magistrate in the Australian Capital Territory receives $117,500 a year, and the Public Service Commissioner, $130,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that when we take on our responsibilities, having been elected by our constituents, it has been a traditional thing here in Australia that we have all felt a duty to make some form of contribution so far as our nation is concerned, particularly so far as the development and the administration of the government of the country is concerned. Unfortunately, we may have reached the end of that particular course; I think that we have. If we are to attract to the parliaments today the people that we would like to attract and which our constituents would like us to attract to this Parliament-from time to time they remark on this-we have to be prepared to pay people. The job of a member of parliament generally is a very arduous one. We know that we should be available for 365 days of the year, for seven days a week and for 24 hours a day. It might not be quite as bad as that, but that is what the people often expect if there is a problem. I heard an honourable member remark today in the House that he has received calls in the middle of the night relating to the Family Law Act. This is true; people phone us at any hour concerning the problems that they have. We should be readily available to attend to the problems that they have. </PARA>
<PARA> The dislocation from our families caused by our work causes us certain concern, as has been mentioned here tonight; so too does the work that we have to do-the correspondence, the running around our electorates, the travelling that we have to do, the committees that we are on, and our work here in the Parliament. We do not oppose what the Government has brought forward this evening because we feel that if the government of the day and our political parties are to meet their responsibilities, conditions have to be such as to encourage both men and women from all walks of life to come and serve the people within Parliament. It is with that background that I just wanted to say a few words to pave the way and to help ensure that we get the quality of members that we believe will ensure that the people's needs are represented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me first declare my interest as a woolgrower in the minimum reserve price legislation and then say to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) that I regard the manner of his behaviour in the last few weeks as having contributed to the significant buying by the Australian Wool Corporation in auctions where the market forces were not allowed to work. For him to say to this House, as he did at Question Time, that it is the market and not the Government that has caused losses to the Australian woolgrower is palpable nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, because of the high profile the Minister has taken, and by not negotiating, as he should have, with members of the Wool Council of Australia and the Australian Wool Corporation and by not allowing for deliberations in a way which would have ensured the sale of those 800,000 bales of wool without the intrusion of the Government and without the market collapse, there has been a significant turnaround from Australian Wool Corporation purchases of only 30 to 35 per cent of the wool on offer to the present situation, whereas of the last sale up to 95 per cent of the wool was bought by the Corporation. Firstly, let me say that it is wrong for the Minister to contend that it is the market rather than the Government that is causing the situation for Australian woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA> The second concern I have is that there were other ways in which I believe the problems in the marketing of wool could have been resolved. Let me briefly outline them. In my view instead of dropping the 870c price the wool that is in stockpile and now growing on the backs of the Australian flock should have been treated as we would treat a cattle herd or a flock of sheep in drought. We would try to sell the dry sheep and reduce the surplus numbers. I would have strongly advocated that instead of dropping the 870c floor across the whole of the clip that we should have eliminated all carding wools and eliminated bellies and if need be broken. We would have retained and maintained the 870c only on those wools that were fleece wools. If we had done so between 15 and 20 per cent of the wool would have been sold for the price that the market would have commanded and it would have enabled countries such as China to have come back into the market very much to the advantage of that market. The Chinese would have needed some fleece wools which would have supplemented the demand and again be very much in the Australian woolgrowers' interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I believe we could have done was suspended the 10c length and strength of stable test. Had we done it would have automatically reduced the 870c price to 860c. Thirdly, we could have adjusted the limits on the different micron counts of wool. As one who produces fine and superfine wool, I know those wools are in far better demand. By a slant we could have adjusted that fleece wool market. I believe we would have been able to maintain confidence in the AWC and avoided what I see is the appalling fallout of the Government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three other things that the Government could have done within its own capability. Firstly, it could have restored the 100 per cent Export Finance Insurance Corporation (EFIC) cover on wool sold to China and the Soviet Union. This Government has removed it. There is now an 80 per cent cover and there have been difficulties in the Soviet Union paying for wool purchased. If the Government had increased the EFIC cover from 80 to 100 per cent we would have been a lot better off. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we could have restored export marketing development grants (EMDG) to wool exported from Australia. That would have been a way by which we could have stimulated wool exports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not subsidies. The Government has just restored the EMDG scheme. It has done it for manufactures. It is failing. The percentage of manufactures exported are decreasing. We have to understand that it is only our commodities-even the Treasurer (Mr Keating) acknowledges this-that are holding our economy where it is at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, I believe we should have removed the tariff on processed wool which the Government has recently increased. How does it expect the textile designers, those who want to process fine wool in Australia, to work when the Government has a tariff on a product that is imported. They are the six steps that could have been taken. I believe that they would have been better than reducing the 870c floor price. I believe that the product of the Government's decision will be increased unemployment. It will be diabolic in many country towns around Australia. I believe that the Government and the Minister deserve to be condemned for the way in which they have attempted to manipulate the affairs of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia in an industry which is just so vital to Australia's future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to raise a matter of prime importance to women, particularly women's health, and that is the deep concern for breast cancer. Breast cancer kills and the figures are alarming. No woman is exempt from the constant threat. What is more alarming is that many women will experience this fear first-hand. Each year breast cancer kills 2,000 women in Australia while 3,200 have mastectomies, yet there is no readily available mammogram screening for women in rural areas. Through fear or ignorance many women fail to act quickly upon the detection of a lump which may then lead to surgery. The removal of a breast through cancer, or mastectomy, is one which many women find extremely hard to accept in our society. The emotional suffering they endure can be totally devastating and alter their lives dramatically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The removal of a breast is a drastic step, but one which must be taken upon diagnosis of cancerous tissue in order to save life. In many cases mastectomy surgery could have been prevented if a mammography screening program was readily available to country women, as they are to women residing in metropolitan areas. We should take a moment to reflect on the changes these women must adjust to after undergoing surgery, changes to their lives and to their families. They must face the world feeling they are not whole, their femininity has been taken from them and that their husbands may no longer be attracted to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Prevention or the early detection of any cancerous tissue through regular mammogram screening programs is just one important step on the road to better health care for all women. In my opinion a regular mammogram screening program is not only essential but is every woman's right. At present the mammogram screening technique is the only proven method for the detection of breast cancer. Mammograms should and must be made freely available to all women. In many cases this early detection X-ray not only could have prevented some of the major surgery performed but also saved hundreds of lives which were lost due to late detection. </PARA>
<PARA> My research indicates that a screening program implemented now for women in the over 50 to 64 years bracket could save 200 lives per year in South Australia alone. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in announcing the national program for the early detection of breast cancer, has made Commonwealth funding of $64m available over a three-year period. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, you may inquire as to why I am raising this issue. Every woman's prayer should have been answered with this funding. I say to you, Mr Speaker, no, because capital funding of $2.8m announced in December last year under initiatives to improve women's health services in some States has not yet been utilised. The $400,000 allocated by the Commonwealth Government to South Australia, for example, for a mobile breast cancer screening unit to travel to rural areas has not to date come to fruition. The State Government has not as yet provided the necessary funds to meet the operating costs of such a unit. </PARA>
<PARA> Women in my electorate and indeed any women residing outside the Adelaide metropolitan area are once again placed at a distinct disadvantage to their city counterparts. The $64m which has been provided by the Commonwealth Government under the national program for the early detection of breast cancer will mean nothing if State and Territory health Ministers do not act quickly to align this program with their own State health programs. I understand that there will be a meeting of health Ministers in June this year and that this item is on the agenda. I urge the Federal Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) to put as much pressure as possible on each State health Minister to implement this program as quickly as possible. It may well result in saving further loss of Australian lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do apologise, Mr Speaker, because that is an inexcusable mistake. I would like to join the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in his criticism of the Government's handling of the matter of the wool debate. As I stand before you, Mr Speaker, as a member of the House of Representatives, I am still somewhat in the dark as to what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has decided today because we have had another example of government by press release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am told-unfortunately it happened whilst I was attending to my parliamentary duties-that the Minister told all on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) today. That is very handy if one just happens to have all day to listen to the ABC. One would think that the Minister, particularly when he got a dorothy dixer on the subject, might have bothered to refer to what he actually said, even in Question Time, as much as I object to the use of Question Time for ministerial statements. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that irrespective of the Government's decision, irrespective of who will be proved right on the 870c floor price, the Government has handled this matter in a diabolical fashion because for a period now, which will eventually be a period of about three months, we have had a situation where there has been total uncertainty and chaos in our wool auction markets. That to me is the real problem. Today the State President of the Western Australian Farmers Federation said:</PARA>
<PARA>If a government had speculated as long about the value of the Australian dollar as it has about the value of Australian wool, it probably would not be worth anything by the date on which the Government eventually decreed what the price or the value might be. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government clearly cannot do it. Above all, markets require certainty. Although I, like many others, do not know the answer or the correct decision, the fact is that the Government's procrastination, the Government's waste of time-probably knowing what it would do all the time-has left the industry in a situation where nobody wants to buy our wool. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stand here, I am not sure, because the Minister has not done me, as a member of parliament, the favour of explaining to me in the appropriate place what the policy is. I understand that he has said that, whatever happens, the price will not drop below 700c. I support that remark because clearly the one thing the industry needs more than anything else now is to re-establish its credibility. The question is whether the Minister's word will be accepted by the market. </PARA>
<PARA> We have these particular problems. Let us look at the history of the matter. Literally weeks and weeks ago we had a great debate over what was an appropriate tax level. Then we had a debate over what was an appropriate level of international borrowing. Then we had the exercise of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and at the same time the exercise of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia. All the time the Minister sat back, saying, `I want the industry to make a decision on the price', whereas it had already done so and had told the Minister what it would be. It just happened to be the message that he did not really want. At this stage it was the Government's responsibility to do what it has the power to do: to fix it, and fix it quickly. Whether the Government is right or wrong is another issue. Only time will demonstrate that. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Government has messed it up by its handling of the situation. The Government has shown, as it generally does, a very poor management technique. If the Government was going to do all these things and had made up its mind to do it, why did it not act three months ago and let the thing happen from there?</PARA>

I would have thought that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), for instance, would have known very well that the action that the Government has taken is very appropriate. The interjection that I made in respect of why it was not done three months ago is perfectly valid. It would have been perfectly inappropriate for a government in caretaker mode at the time of an election to make such a decision. Members of the Opposition should understand that. If the agrarian socialists on the other side of the House do not understand that, perhaps they need more appropriate information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I rise tonight is that in 1911 King O'Malley, that redoubtable Federal politician from Western Australia, purchased three acres of land on behalf of the Commonwealth Government in the centre of Perth. In 1914 the development of the GPO building in the centre of Perth was commissioned. That building was finished in 1923. It is an outstanding example of early twentieth century architecture. The people of Perth understand and know very well that it is a significant part of the integrity of the city. It dominates the city square, which is known as Forrest Place, and the building is registered in the National Estate and is of great interest to the National Trust. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must agree. Australia Post has a charter to operate in a commercial way. Over the last number of years there has been great concern about the utilisation of this prime city site-indeed, the integrity of the building and the need to refurbish it, to restore it and to maintain it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many of my constituents and I were delighted recently when a deal which had been negotiated by Australia Post to sell the building to a shopping centre development fell through. It fell through because of economic circumstances, and many of us were very pleased that the proposal to turn this outstanding building into yet another shopping arcade in the centre of Perth failed on commercial grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> My inquiries have shown me that, in every capital city in this country, the central GPO building is still used by Australia Post. These buildings are viable because they are fully tenanted and are turning over significant revenue for Australia Post. Australia Post has three options in Western Australia. One is that it can attempt further to sell the building; I believe in the present environment that is not an option that it should be pursuing. The second option is that it can get a joint venture partner to provide capital which would enable it to refurbish the building and to lease it out. Of course, the third option is that Australia Post can go it alone. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly the view of my constituents and the retailers in the city that this prime site should be utilised effectively. It is their belief that this important building needs to continue to be used and to maintain a presence for Australia Post in the centre of the city. As my office is only a few hundred metres away from the GPO, I make the commitment tonight that, if the GPO building is refurbished and office space is leased, I will move my office into the central post office, hopefully on the ground floor in a prime site, because I believe it is important--</PARA>

This important building needs to be maintained. I might also say that a whole handful of senators occupy offices at the top of the government office building. The rarefied air seems to affect their thinking, I must say.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe there is a growing concern amongst many Australians about the extent of foreign ownership of Australian freehold property. In my electorate this is particularly the case. Recent figures released by the Queensland foreign land register show land valued at $12.3 billion is owned by foreign interests in the Gold Coast City Council area alone, which is only a part of the Gold Coast. Of these 1,411 hectares, 92 per cent is held by Japanese interests. The question must be asked, and is being asked, whether this full scale sell out to overseas investors is in the national interest. This is precisely the test applied by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) in its consideration of applications to acquire property. I wonder, however, how the Foreign Investment Review Board determines that this kind of investment activity is actually in the national interest. I understand the considerable benefits which have accrued to Australia in the past from foreign investment. However, I wonder at the wisdom of the full scale sell-off of Australia to foreign interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many people come to Australia intending to become Australian citizens. They purchase homes and businesses. No-one has any problem with that. What is being questioned is the sell-off of huge tracts of land with no Australian equity whatsoever. I have found that in raising questions about this issue, and indeed the closely related multifunction polis, one runs the risk of being branded as a racist or of being anti-foreign investment and therefore of acting against the best interests of Australia. There are certainly people who have a vested interest in participating in the foreign sell-out and I can understand them being reluctant to stand by and have their cosy little arrangements threatened, especially by a new member of Parliament. However, I believe my role here is to articulate the concerns of my constituents and I must do so without fear or favour. </PARA>
<PARA> There is of course a case to be made for the benefits of this type of foreign investment. In these desperate economic times the proponents say we have no choice but to encourage foreign investment at any cost. This is, however, only a short term expedient. There may be some short term job creation and balance of payments effects. However, what of the longer term? Where do we go when there is nothing left to mortgage? Some clear thinking is needed. We must foster foreign investment that is wealth creating for Australia as a nation. Since 1983 much foreign investment has not flowed into industry, particularly not into export industries. It has been consumed-it has gone down the plug hole. We have little to show for it. It is rather like borrowing to pay for a vacation: one have nothing much to show for it when one comes back. </PARA>
<PARA> The other concern I must express about the sell-off to foreign investors is the adverse effect this is having on the price and availability of property. There is also an indirect effect on rents, particularly in retail shopping centres which have been sold at inflated prices to overseas interests. I must say also that there is considerable concern about the vertical integration which has occurred in the tourist industry. Japanese tourists, for example, come here on Japanese aircraft, stay in Japanese owned hotels, shop only in Japanese owned shops. There is surely only a minimal, if any, benefit to Australians in this sort of arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The FIRB is charged with examining proposals by foreign investors for investment in Australia and determining that they are not contrary to the national interest. It is clearly not doing its job. It is a paper tiger. It does not apply its rules. I advocate a strengthening of the review procedures for foreign investment in Australia, particularly where the acquisition of property is involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this place to talk about Australian company law and the current predicament with the National Companies and Securities Commission and the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) proposals. I think we ought to make it very clear that a very serious situation has developed in the administration of company law in Australia. It has developed because of a number of situations but I think we ought to stress very clearly that the current proposals of the Federal Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), in cooperation with the States, to try to redress the difficulties that the High Court of Australia decision has brought for company law need support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very concerned that in Western Australia-and I understand in South Australia and Victoria-there is the possibility of the upper Houses of Parliament blocking what, in effect, will become a cooperative proposal. I am concerned because those upper Houses are largely unrepresentative. It is very important that we get in place at least some structure of company law that is national company law. At the moment we run the very grave risk of falling between the old cooperative scheme and the emergence of new Australian company law and the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some concerns with respect to Western Australia because, reluctant as it may be, the State Government is actually being drawn into agreeing to a national proposal-and it seems to me that a national proposal is essential. When one looks at the international stage-I think it is interesting to note at the moment that the Confederation of Australian Industry is sending a delegation to eastern Europe to look at trade situations-and reflects on what is happening in Europe in terms of the proposals for 1992 and the equalisation of company law and customs law, one can see that an effective international regulation of company law is moving very fast in Europe. It is a very sad comment upon Australia that we cannot even get our own States to agree upon the need for company law reform. In fact, we are now being dragged backwards by what I would refer to as unrepresentative upper Houses including the one in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very pressing need for reform in company law. Firstly, there is a need-particularly at the level of major corporations-for people to know what the rules are. Secondly, we need to address the fact that administration of company law in certain circumstances has left a lot to be desired. In my own State of Western Australia, in the minds of the average investor, a very serious situation has emerged. There is no redress when company directors engage in less than desirable practice or, in some circumstances, malpractice. This has created a crisis of confidence in the Australian stock market. At the moment it is very difficult to get people to invest in ordinary equities. The large institutions do so, but individuals are very reluctant to invest in equities. It is a very sad situation for many people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I direct people's attention to the Perth second board. It is a big day if there are more than 10 shares traded out of the 125 listings on the second board in Perth. That suggests that there has been a shortcoming in supervision by corporate affairs officers. If we are to have an effective stock market with people buying shares, people must have confidence in the system-and at the moment they do not, not only because of the events of October 1987 but because of the failure to follow up with proper law enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> A very clear practice now operates in several major corporations: when they are in doubt about a point of law they simply use shareholders' funds to brief counsel and lock people into interminable court hearings so that, in the eyes of the ordinary investor, justice is never done. I recognise that people have a right to appear before the appropriate court to try to settle matters, but we have deliberate delay. In the end the people who suffer are the ordinary shareholders, the Australian stock market and business generally. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia and across Australia there is a crisis in the administration of company law. Corporate affairs officers have been negligent in the way they have managed prospectus supervision in particular, and there certainly is a lot to improve in that area. We need a national approach to Australia's administration of corporate law. Sadly, at the moment we have a mishmash approach. I believe we can restore a lot of support for the administration of company law-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to pay tribute to a great Australian. It was recently announced by Premier Greiner that His Excellency the Governor of New South Wales, Rear Admiral Sir David Martin, will be standing down in the near future as the result of a serious illness. Not only does that tragic announcement leave with a very heavy heart indeed those of us who have over many years served alongside His Excellency, but his departure from public life will leave our nation that much poorer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir David could be described succinctly as a manly man and a friendly friend, not only by officers and sailors alike with whom he served over his 40 years of distinguished service in the Royal Australian Navy but by the many thousands of New South Wales people in all walks of life with whom he has come in contact over the last 18 months in his vice regal capacity. Sir David has always championed the underdog, he has always been scrupulously fair, he has always been prepared to listen and he has always done his duty with a degree of decorum and selflessness that is an increasingly rare commodity in our contemporary society. He supplements all of those attributes with another rare quality-a dry, incisive sense of humour, always to the point and very appropriate. Australians will miss his substantial contribution to public life. My family's thoughts are with him this evening and I feel sure that the House will join us in those sentiments. We wish Sir David, Lady Susan and their family a fair wind and a smooth sea in the months and years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I had the privilege of speaking in a grievance debate in this place in which I mentioned the attitude of the Northern Territory Government to the difficulties associated with alcohol consumption in central Australia, and in particular the attitude being adopted by the Northern Territory Government to the issue of alcohol consumption by some Aboriginal people in and around Alice Springs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said during that debate that a number of propositions had been put forward by the Northern Territory Government to resolve this issue. I would like now to relate what they were. The first was to introduce title legislation and enforce a two-kilometre law-a matter which I referred to today-whereby police have the authority to confiscate all liquor in the possession of a person consuming liquor in a public place. </PARA>
<PARA> Effectively, the legislation was introduced in the first place to stop people, as one would think, from drinking inside the two-kilometre limit. Its purpose, unstated, was to solve the so-called problem of Aboriginal people drinking in the riverbed. It did not work. In my view it was a very misplaced piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, what the Northern Territory Government now proposes to do is displace these people who have no other place to go. They do not have any legitimate places to drink. In most places they are not accepted into the establishments of Alice Springs and they cannot pass the dress regulations. What is being proposed now is to confiscate all the liquor they might have and, most importantly, to rigorously enforce that law. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, that would be a very detrimental step. What we ought to do is establish Aboriginal social clubs in and around Alice Springs to cater for the needs of these people. This is something that has been proposed by Aboriginal organisations in central Australia for some time but, by and large, it has not been supported by the Northern Territory Government, although belatedly it has indicated its preparedness to support the establishment of one social club. Whereas Tangentyere Council, which looks after town campers in and around Alice Springs, has proposed that there be a number of clubs to cater for the different tribal groups and thereby resolve some of the problems which come from the various groups mixing where alcohol is consumed. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional proposal put forward by the Northern Territory Government was to approach the Federal Government with the proposition that all Department of Social Security recipients be compelled to collect their benefits in their home community. I spoke about that today in this place and I do not intend to speak about it further. It was also suggested that extra police be deployed from time to time to resolve the problem. I do not believe that that is an appropriate course of action either. The Northern Territory Government also intends to ask the Alice Springs Town Council to enforce camping by-laws on council or crown land and remove personal effects which are abandoned in similar places. That would have the effect of basically taking away all the personal possessions of many of these Aboriginal people. To my way of thinking it would be crude to call it racist, but it is extremely divisive and it is something which ought not come from a person who masquerades or purports to be the Chief Minister of a Territory of this country-someone who has the responsibility for making and administering laws where 25 to 30 per cent of his population are Aboriginal. </PARA>
<PARA> He is embarking on a course of action the sum total of which would be to divide the community-indeed this would cause particular problems for the Aboriginal community-and isolate Aboriginals from the rest of the community. He does not propose that these laws, particularly the proposal to compel social security beneficiaries to receive their cheques in their home community, be extended to the rest of the Northern Territory community. He does not propose that the alcohol consumption problems of the Northern Territory community generally be addressed. He does not propose that any major rehabilitation effort be provided in terms of the alcohol problem that some Aboriginal people have. He does not propose to address the real issues involved in this debate. The way in which he has gone about this has been condemned by all involved other than those on his side. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year was a year which saw a lot of debate in this country about sustainable development in industry and a debate on the environment-how far we should continue with developing industry-and in particular it was related to the Wesley Vale pulp mill. I want to address that issue again in the Parliament tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> About a year ago a very important venture for Australia, which would have been the biggest industrial venture in Australia for many years, was actually stopped. This came about because the Government here did not have guidelines which were adequate to give developers in this country a clear view as to how to put together a proposal at that stage in Australia, particularly with the environmental debate as it was. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has got its act together in putting out guidelines for eucalypt pulp mills in the country. I congratulate the Government on doing that, because I think it gives a ground for industrial development to occur in this country. It is very important that projects such as Wesley Vale-future pulp mills in this country-are able to be developed so that some of out natural resources are able to be downstreamed and value added, because that is vital for the health and economic future and social stability of this country.</PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, particularly in regard to Tasmania, we have been waiting on a State government for almost a year that has had it on its agenda to put forward its own State guidelines, and still it has not done so. This will hamper development in Tasmania, mainly because there is now a government in power in Tasmania which cannot make decisions. At the last count it had set up 152 inquiries in 11 months. It is still trying to work out how it will go about doing things. It has sat on its hands on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> If the development could go ahead it would produce $350m worth of net export income and help reduce our overseas debt problems to the tune of $350m. Yet the State Government has sat on its hands in regard to this major matter in Tasmania. It has shown very little foresight in the difficulties of unemployment for many families. Although it debates the issue of the environment and protecting it, it says very little about the families that are affected, that do not have jobs, because it has not done its homework in regard to setting out the guidelines for a pulp mill in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> Those companies which want to set up such pulp mills do know where the Federal Government stands. They do not know where the State Government stands. It is time that the State Government set about publishing guidelines so that proponents of any future industrial developments in this line are able to go ahead with a certain degree of security and certainty that their project will meet the actual guidelines put down by both the Federal Government and the State Government. Therefore, I draw to the attention of the House the fact that in this country, at least federally, we do have guidelines, but within the State of Tasmania where there are proponents for pulp mills to go ahead no guidelines exist almost a year after the State Government came to office. </PARA>

<PARA> The changes to the amounts in the schedule on page 17 are to provide for the amounts for the Government Whip in the Senate, the Opposition Whip in the Senate and the Deputy Government Whip in the Senate to be the same as for the equivalent positions in the House of Representatives.
