<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. that ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. that the Convention's philosophy of parent/child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers;</PARA>
<PARA> 6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles;</PARA>

<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the destruction of the Ozone Layer by the chemicals Chlorofluorocarbons and Halons, which are widely used in consumer products and industry. We particularly draw your attention to recent scientific evidence that the destruction of the Ozone Layer is much more extensive than was previously thought, and the urgent need to rapidly phase out the production and use of these chemicals. This problem is most acute for Australia as we are close to the Antarctic where the ozone depletion is greatest, and because we have the highest per capita use of chlorofluorocarbons and halons of any country in the world.</PARA>

Moreover these outfalls act as Sydney's major toxic waste dump and the effluent contains industrial chemicals, heavy metals, organochlorines and other dangerous wastes. Low-level radioactive waste is also discharged into the Pacific Ocean from the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor via the Cronulla sewage outfall.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners thereby request that the House enact legislation to prevent the dumping of sewage sludge and industrial waste into Australian coastal waters from land-based sources and also the discharge of sewage effluent unless it is treated to remove at least 85 per cent of suspended solids and does not contain any radioactive, toxic or dangerous wastes.</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners further point out that this decision has not been adequately explained to the local community and furthermore the decision fails to recognise the growing population of the Shire. With the lack of bulk billing the many pensioners, chronically ill, unemployed and lowincome residents of the Shire will have to pay for their medical visits, claim refunds as soon as possible and then meet the cost of fulfilling prescriptions.

<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House that we, the undersigned citizens of Australia, here register our firm protest against the current form of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, which seeks to restrict as S2 and S4 poisons those traditional natural medicines which have been used safely for centuries. The effect of these regulations will be to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Restrict approximately forty or more major healing herbs and their homoeopathic derivatives as scheduled poisons, (eg: Comfrey) to be dispensed only by general practitioners, veterinary surgeons, dentists and pharmacists.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Prohibit manufacturers of traditional natural medicines from communicating any information regarding the use of their preparations to those specialised in their use-even in private or during an educational seminar limited to practitioners. This right to knowledge will now be exclusive to doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons and pharmacists.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Increase the cost of all natural therapeutic substances by imposing exorbitant registration, licensing and inspection fees.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Require wholesalers and manufacturers of herbal materials to meet the same standards regarding equipment and premises as large scale pharmaceutical manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA> If these regulations are allowed to be proclaimed, it will severely hamper natural therapy practice and deny the right of citizens of this country to choose the therapy they wish.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the House:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Set aside the passing of this legislation until thorough public investigation of the ramifications of the Act upon the natural therapies professions is carried out.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Carry out an impartial assessment of the effect of this legislation upon the rights of the individual to select the mode of holistic health care of ones choice, which is presently affordable and accessible to all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the eleventh ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation (AIPO) conference held in Singapore from 10 to 15 September, 1990. At the outset I should like to thank my colleague the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) for his attendance at that conference with me. I think I can say that we both acquitted ourselves well. The comments I shall make about the AIPO conference go to the manner in which the conference is run, for I believe Australian delegates could benefit far greater the next time the conference is held were AIPO run a little differently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope I am not being rude in suggesting to a conference we attend only as observers that the way in which the conference operates might be changed. Nevertheless, I had some good discussions with the Speaker of the Singaporean Parliament, Mr Tan Soo Khoon, and I have written also to the newly appointed Permanent Secretary-General of AIPO based in Jakarta, Mr Maramis. When Australians, Canadians and South Koreans attend AIPO they do so purely as observers and most of the discussion goes on between the ASEAN parliamentary members. Those who attend as observers are not invited to listen in to those discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems apparent to me that at the end of a week of discussions a number of resolutions are brought back to the final plenary session and voted upon. I am not suggesting that is not a useful process for those ASEAN parliamentary members, but it might be more useful, especially now that they have a permanent Secretary-General who could look at the business of ASEAN parliamentary delegates over the course of the year, to work in a slightly different manner. I offer these remarks to those future Australian observers who will attend AIPO conferences. It seems to me that it might be useful to remember that we do not go as representatives of governments but as representatives of parliaments. It is not particularly significant that we might debate resolutions, but rather that we might clear the decks of resolutions and set positions, nominate topics for debate and actually debate them and learn from one another. </PARA>
<PARA> AIPO, like a number of international forums that Australian parliamentarians attend, at times becomes a little too fixed and rigid in its formal debate. I am suggesting that we should realise that we do not attend as representatives of governments but as representing our peoples, that the force of resolutions is not particularly great because we return to our own countries with those resolutions as members of parliament, not as governors. If that is kept in mind, the next step might be taken of forgetting about the resolutions as such. </PARA>
<PARA> Right at the end of the conference I picked up on an interesting discussion between the Filipino delegates and the Singaporean delegates. The delegates from the Philippines were keen to set as a goal the establishment of an ASEAN parliament. The Singaporeans were a little more practical. They took the view, with which I agree, that an ASEAN parliament would not be set up in the near future and all of these resolutions need not be debated. Topics for debate could be set down across the course of the week and delegates could sit down and exchange views, get to know one another better and learn from one another, so that at the end of the day, when they return to their own countries, they can remember the discussions they had with Indonesians, Singaporeans and those from Thailand and elsewhere. They might thus keep their own parliaments better informed about the current debates in the ASEAN region. </PARA>
<PARA> I value the trip enormously. I value it because it taught me a little about how these things are run and might better be run and about how the next set of Australian delegates might learn when they attend AIPO conferences. The most valuable period for me, I might say, was the time I spent with Ministers of the Singaporean Government outside the formal sessions. The best discussions I had with members of the Singaporean Government were at dinners and lunches where an observing public might think we were having a good old chat. I spent all the time I could trying to understand how the Singaporeans manage their country, their environment and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> It really was very valuable to be there on the spot, observing, talking to key people in the Government. I would recommend to members of this Parliament who should have the opportunity in the future to attend an AIPO conference that they do attend, that they realise the importance of the ASEAN region to Australia and that they take the opportunity to speak to heads of governments in the country in which the AIPO conference is to be held. Next year it will be held in Thailand, so there will be a completely new set of ideas, institutions, and Ministers to meet. </PARA>
<PARA> I purposely wanted to leave with the House a rather detailed series of documents that came out of the discussions themselves because previously these documents had not been presented to the Parliament. The next delegates from Australia who attend IPO should have a look at these documents and get the flavour of the sorts of debates that ensued. I also hope that when I receive my reply from Mr Maramis the permanent secretary general of AIPO we might have a different way of operating next time and that rather than having a face-to-face one-off debate as the honourable member for Lyne and I did with other IPO delegates for about an hour and a half for the whole week, we might actually continue that debate throughout the week on topics of mutual concern. Those debates, in addition to the very valuable informal discussions that are had with Ministers from the country where AIPO is being held, will be a very powerful and useful exercise for Australian delegates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) in saying how pleased I was to represent this Parliament and Australia at the 11th ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Conference. It was most enjoyable indeed. It was enjoyable certainly to go to Singapore and I appreciated the company of the leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Petrie. I commend him for the way in which he conducted himself because I am sure that he did quite a lot of good for Australia and certainly the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important, as the honourable member for Petrie has mentioned, that we do report to the Parliament. There is a lot of interest so far as the Association of South East Asian Nations countries are concerned in Australia and our involvement generally in Asian affairs. I think that all honourable members are possibly aware that the six countries involved are Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. I feel that ASEAN has been successful. It has taken quite a long time to get off the ground, but members are now cooperating amongst themselves and they see themselves with a great responsibility so far as the future economy of the whole ASEAN region is concerned. They did point out to us over the period of the five or six days that we were with them that they are very dependent upon Japan and the United States of America, particularly, because they are the major countries with which they trade and from which they receive support. They pointed out to us that generally the trade of those six countries with Australia is on the basis of only 6 per cent to 7 per cent of our total trade in Australia. Naturally they want to use Australia more as a trading partner. </PARA>
<PARA> They spoke to the honourable member for Petrie and me concerning the education facilities that are available in Australia for their young people and emphasised to us that it was very important for them that we keep our doors open to their students to enable them to study here in Australia. Those are very important issues. I do support the honourable member for Petrie in what he said about the involvement of our Australian delegations in the general affairs of ASEAN. We respect the fact that we were only observers, but we were given the opportunity of being questioned by the representatives of those six countries--</PARA>

<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5J4">Mr SCHOLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the Procedure Committee's first report for the Thirty-sixth Parliament. It proposes some changes in the arrangements for the presentation and consideration of parliamentary committee and delegation reports on Thursday mornings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the second Parliament in which the House has appointed a group of general purpose standing committees dealing with a wide range of issues of public interest. The Committee feels that there are limited opportunities for debate on these issues in the general proceedings of the House and that committees are an important forum for putting forward ideas and proposals for policy development and for monitoring and scrutinising government performance. The work of committees forms a significant part of the work of the House and its members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Procedure Committee believes that the value of the work of parliamentary committees should be reflected in the provision of adequate time to debate the reports of committees. We recognise that, in order to promote worthwhile discussion of a committee's proposals, members must be given the opportunity to study a report before they are asked to present their views on its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The present arrangements, which flowed from two earlier reports of the Procedure Committee on Days and hours of sitting and the effective use of the time of the House and Improved opportunities for private Members: proposed sessional orders are a big improvement on the previous system of competing for time with government business-I might say, unsuccessfully. Nevertheless, the Committee felt that the time available for committees was still inadequate for the development of substantial debate and that committee reports were required to compete with private members' business for time. </PARA>
<PARA> The major changes which the Committee proposes are that the House meet half an hour earlier, at 9.30 a.m., each sitting Thursday; and that the routine of business begin with the announcement of petitions, followed by the presentation of committee and delegation reports until 10 a.m.; then the resumption of debate on reports presented on a previous day to continue until 11 a.m., when private members' business will be called on and will continue for the rest of the morning as at present. </PARA>
<PARA> In making these recommendations, we wish to ensure that the major part of the time set aside for dealing with reports is spent on significant debate rather than just the tabling of the reports. The proposed arrangements will provide less time than is currently available for the presentation of reports and statements on them, but will allow a full hour for debate each week on reports which members have had an opportunity to read and consider and on which specific motions have been moved at the time of presentation. This is achieved without any reduction in the time, from 11 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., presently allocated to private members' business. </PARA>
<PARA> We also recognise the difficulty which frequently arises at the end of a period of sittings when many committees wish to table reports before the long adjournments or dissolution of a parliament. We have proposed some flexibility in arrangements to deal with the fluctuation by a recommendation that the Selection Committee have the discretion to extend the time available for presentation of reports beyond 10 a.m. on the last two sitting days of each sitting period. </PARA>
<PARA> The remainder of the recommendations in the report cover associated matters, including the role of a selection committee and the arrangements for those occasions when the number of reports presented in the debate is small. The unique and successful arrangements for committee reports and what might loosely be termed private members' business on Thursday mornings have been operating now for two years. The modifications proposed by the Procedure Committee will improve the balance of business and allow more serious discussion on the valuable work of committees of this House. I commend the report to the House and I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Constitution Alteration (Alterations of the Constitution on the Initiative of the Electors) Bill 1990. This is the first of two Bills that I will present to the House providing for democracy in its truest sense, government by the people, which is in line, incidentally, with the trend to deregulation by ending executive government's monopoly on the use of referenda. The second Bill which I will present in the near future will provide for methods of making laws on the initiative of electors. The Bill I am presenting today envisages a new constitutional procedure. It would allow groups of electors to propose an alteration to the Constitution, have it put to the electors at the time of a general election and, if approved, to be put into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provisions of this Bill have been drawn with care to achieve the following aims: first, to enable the people of Australia to enshrine in the Constitution an express recognition of their right to initiate and determine changes to the framework of rules under which their country is governed. </PARA>
<PARA> The struggle between democracy and elitism is an old one and can be traced back to the beginnings of Western political tradition in ancient Greece. While democracy has made great advances in the last 150 years, Australia has regrettably fallen from the pre-eminent position it held toward the end of the last century. In the last 30 years elitism has fought back, aided by the growth of bureaucracy, academia and the complexity of society. As a reaction to this democratic regression, the ethic of participation has grown in proportion and the right of people to take part in all decisions that affect them is now inalienable. Any government or group that thinks otherwise does so at its peril. The elitist notion that the people as a whole are incompetent in matters of deciding public policy is no longer acceptable and any attempt to argue that the people are incompetent to vote on a specific issue in a referendum is in effect an argument that they are incompetent to vote at a vastly more complex general election. </PARA>
<PARA> Democracy is founded on the principle that a decision taken by the people as a whole will be right more often than a decision taken for them by any elite, no matter how clever that elite might be or in what manner it is chosen. The people of Australia have a right to participate directly in the government of their country and that right should be recognised in our Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bill provides for elector-initiated referendums in a manner that minimises the cost to the taxpayer. A question or questions initiated by a group or groups of electors would be presented to voters only at a general election.  Thirdly, the Bill provides checks and balances to ensure that the procedure is not abused or frustrated. The Parliament and the courts have a role in seeing that matters put to referendum on the initiative of electors will not mislead the electorate and that, if they are approved, they will be practicable and effective. Finally, the Bill gives electors a choice in how they could proceed. They could present a petition for a referendum to be held on the proposed alteration of the Constitution which they have drafted in complete terms, or they could choose to present a petition in which only the purpose of their proposed alteration is set out. The Bill provides for the necessary alteration to achieve that purpose to be prepared by the Government, if it is approved by the electors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill I now present and the second Bill, which I have foreshadowed, deal with the concept popularly known as citizen-initiated referendum, a concept in use in the government of a number of countries. My interest in the referendum as a tool of government is not merely theoretical. In my time as Mayor of North Sydney, some 37 issues were put to the people by referendum over six years with spectacular success. The level of participation in each referendum and the quality of the decision was high in every case. I am confident that if the people of Australia are given the opportunity to participate widely in the government of their country, then Australian society will benefit. I will reserve for my second reading speech my more detailed remarks on the provisions of this Bill and the objectives it sets out to achieve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in view of the recent dramatic improvement in the global strategic environment and of the importance of facilitating extension of those improved conditions to the East Asia and Pacific regions, this House supports the establishment of a Conference on Security and Cooperation in East Asia and the Pacific to increase collective security through negotiation of confidence-building measures and steps towards disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA>During the last couple of years, the global strategic situation has been transformed. The Cold War has ended; several eastern European countries have voted in non-communist governments; the Soviet Union is in political and economic disarray; the United States and the Soviet Union have signed several significant arms control treaties; a vigorous debate is under way within the US about the extent to which military expenditure should be cut and as to what size the peace dividend should be; western Europe is involved in the same process of cutting defence outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> US Secretary of State Baker set out `the architecture for a new era' for Europe in a speech in Berlin in December last year. Yet no architecture for a new era in the East Asian Pacific region has yet emerged. Both superpowers are, however, involved in non-negotiated force reductions in the Pacific. The US Defense Department said in April that the number of forward deployed personnel in the Pacific would be cut by about 15,000 from 135,000 during the next three years. Proportionately greater reductions in combat forces would be made during the following years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviets have withdrawn two squadrons from Cam Ranh Bay and there are no longer any submarines or large warships at the base. Moscow and Beijing signed an agreement in April cutting the number of troops on their border. One hundred and twenty thousand of the half million troops that Gorbachev announced would be cut from the Soviet Union's forces are to be from the East Asian theatre. The Soviet Navy is expected to decommission a substantial number of surface ships and submarines during the next five years as they become obsolete. Although these reductions have not been negotiated, it is likely that their mutuality has facilitated reductions by the other side. Nevertheless, there are only a few signs of reductions in military spending or of a collective approach to security in the East Asian Pacific region such as exists in Europe. What can be done to encourage such innovation?</PARA>
<PARA> Europe offers a precedent. A forum for negotiation of security measures has existed in Europe since 1973: the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The CSCE includes all the states of Europe except Albania, plus Canada and the United States-a 35-nation forum. The original proposal for such a conference was made by the Soviet Union. The West agreed in 1972 to preliminary CSCE talks when the Soviets agreed to start preliminary talks on multilateral and balanced conventional force reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> The first formal CSCE conference was held in Helsinki between 1973 and 1975, producing a non-binding political declaration outlining principles to guide relations between the states; provisions on commerce, industrial cooperation, science and technology, human rights and security. The most important and only obligatory confidence building measure in this declaration was the requirement that all countries give 21 days advance notice of military manoeuvres exceeding 25,000 troops. Invitations to observers to watch manoeuvres and more substantial notification requirements were also recommended. Regular reviews of the workings of this agreement were held before another major conference on disarmament in Europe was held in Stockholm. </PARA>
<PARA> The Stockholm Agreement in 1986 was a much more substantial accord than that settled in Helsinki. The agreement is politically binding and provides for notification of military activities involving more than 13,000 troops or 300 tanks; the extension of advance notification to 42 days; an exchange of annual calendars of notifiable military activities; mandatory invitations to observers to watch military activities; the right of on-site inspection; and the declaration relating to the non-use of force. Negotiations are currently under way in Vienna to extend the scope and nature of these confidence and security building measures and they look likely to be successful. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1986 Gorbachev floated a similar idea for the Pacific, `with the participation of all countries gravitating towards the ocean'. He made the inspired suggestion that Hiroshima be the location for such a meeting. He said, `Why should not that town-the first victim of nuclear evil-become a distinctive Helsinki for Asia-Pacific?'. The idea has great attractions. It would provide a context within which confidence building measures could be negotiated, leading in due course to serious disarmament negotiations. Great potential economic benefits are offered by disarmament. There could be a distinct growth of trust just from the increased transparency which confidence building measures create. Why, then, has there been no movement on this proposal so far?</PARA>
<PARA> There are many differences between Europe and east Asia and the Pacific. For example, it is not even clear which countries should be included. Presumably all of the east Asian countries, including South East Asian countries, plus Australia and New Zealand would be members. The United States would logically be a member since it is the dominant military power in the region; but should the South Pacific island states with their tiny forces be members? Latin America is a different region. Where is the cut-off point between east Asia and south Asia? Thailand would obviously be a member, but perhaps not Burma. If participation were on this basis there would be about 15 members. This is less than half the number of participating countries in the European conference-a distinct advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> A major difference is the pivotal role of the ocean in the east Asia-Pacific region. The cultures of the 15 countries are much more diverse than in Europe and there is only a limited tradition of diplomatic negotiation about collective security. Yet none of these differences seems likely to pose insuperable problems if there is the political will to strengthen common security in east Asia and the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> As the most powerful military country in the region, the agreement of the United States would be necessary for the effective establishment of a conference on security and cooperation in east Asia and the Pacific (CSCEAP). Yet, although the United States is actively involved in arms control and disarmament negotiations in Europe, it is apparently sceptical about similar activities in this region. Perhaps the major underlying reason for this scepticism is the military asymmetry in the two areas. In Europe, arms control was a means of redressing a military imbalance favouring the Soviet Union. Here it is the US which has military superiority. East Asia-Pacific arms control would require bigger cuts by the US than by the Soviet Union. The United States Navy, in particular, has been opposed to naval arms control, arguing that this would undermine its operational flexibility and curtail its strategic options. </PARA>
<PARA> Of other countries in the region, the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has recently called for just this initiative to establish a conference on security and cooperation in east Asia and the Pacific. Canada has proposed a north Pacific security cooperation dialogue which would have as its objective `the identification of issues on which North Pacific nations could make progress together'. </PARA>
<PARA> Canada has also proposed, more tentatively, the consideration of a Pacific adaptation of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to identify possible measures for cooperation in information exchanges, transparency in military manoeuvres, open skies regimes and dialogue on naval forces. China has demonstrated willingness to accept confidence building measures with the Soviet Union. Indonesia's advocacy of a South East Asian nuclear free zone and a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality is clearly support for a similar type of proposal for part of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese are opposed to the negotiation of confidence building measures until their conflict over the Soviet-held Northern Territories is settled, though there are some Japanese who think that the importance of this conflict has been overemphasised. Malaysia has explicitly called for confidence building measures in the region. The predominant concern of North and South Korea is with each other, and relations between the two countries are still extremely limited though improving. Philippine Foreign Secretary Manglapus has suggested a dialogue about security arrangements in the Association of South East Asian Nations region. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the idea of a CSCEAP realistic? It well may be. The current superpower rapprochement and the ending of the Cold War breaks a 40-year-old log jam. One of the lessons of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is the importance of taking swift advantage of improvements in superpower relations. The Helsinki Accord was completed at the height of detente. Gareth Evans, the Australian Foreign Minister, wrote recently:</PARA>
<PARA>A number of negative responses can quickly be given. Asia contains many different issues of contention and has many different ``fronts'', unlike Europe, where there has been a single East-West conflict. Asia is also a diverse region with little of the sense of common cultural identity and common diplomatic tradition of Europe. Still, it is not unreasonable to expect that new Europe-style patterns of cooperation between old adversaries will find their echo in this part of the world, and that imaginative new approaches to confidence building and problem solving can be found. </PARA>
<PARA>The Director of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency has said that the US is unlikely to lead in suggesting arms control in the Pacific but that:</PARA>
<PARA>We really look to our allies in East Asia to take the lead in pursuing measures that are in the common interest. </PARA>
<PARA>If he speaks with any authority then perhaps one or a small group of countries in this area could initiate proposals for preliminary discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference, which was proposed by the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and which met for the first time in Canberra last November, provides a fresh precedent in the economic arena for such a security initiative. There is already some bilateral and multilateral military cooperation in the region through joint exercises, consultation and invitations to observers. The least demanding way of beginning would be to establish a mixed commission of both government and non-government representatives. This would allow both Koreas to send delegates in the guise of academics, so ensuring their participation. </PARA>
<PARA> The goal of an Asian-Pacific security conference should be to increase mutual trust between the countries in the region. The negotiation of confidence and security building measures would be the initial task. Confidence building measures aim to increase transparency about military activity between countries by communicating information, increasing accessibility through, for example, on-site inspections, and by generally demonstrating that military activity does not have an aggressive intent. Successful negotiation and operation of such confidence building measures would create a firm basis for more substantial arms control and disarmament agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> There are already some confidence building measures negotiated elsewhere which have applicability to this region. An example is the agreements covering incidents at sea between the Soviet Union and other major states. Another is the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention, which provides for dispute resolution of overlapping maritime claims, though so far only three Asia-Pacific states have ratified the treaty. In June 1989 the US and Soviet Union signed an agreement to prevent and resolve peacetime incidents between their armed forces, which applies wherever their forces are stationed. A significant step would be multilateralisation of this type of agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> People who have a strong commitment to economic and social development and environmental conservation have the strongest motivation for the reduction of the military burden. We recognise the enormous cost in lost opportunities from military expenditure. It is therefore necessary for us to take an interest in these security issues and to give every encouragement we can to the introduction of confidence building measures as a prelude to effective disarmament. In any case reductions in military expenditure do not need to wait until such a conference is in successful operation. Economic development and security would be enhanced if countries unilaterally reduced their military outlays. This is a fertile time to advocate arms reductions. We must remember: more arms make our countries poorer, not safer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has moved this motion and brought the matter before the House today because it raises issues which are of fundamental importance to the security and, it is to be hoped, to the continuing peaceful nature of our part of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I was not in the House when the honourable member began his remarks but I gather from what he said that he was really using, to a very great extent, the material contained in his address to the regional conference of the Society for International Development in Jakarta. In fact, as I heard the latter part of remarks of the honourable member, he was quoting verbatim from that speech made in Jakarta in July of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time, we have had continuing developments in the region, and in the world, flowing from the very markedly changed geopolitical circumstances arising from the erosion or even the sweeping away of the old Cold War mentality. In fact, I drew some attention to this in my remarks on the debate on the Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade earlier this week. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is whether the region in which we are and which has been mentioned by the honourable member for Fraser today, really is in the same sort of situation as that other area on which the honourable member based his idea. That basis is, of course, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) arrangements and obviously we are not in a similar situation to Europe. The honourable member acknowledged that fact in his speech in Jakarta earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> In so many ways the situation in our region is different, and here I quote directly from a speech that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) made recently in Austin, Texas. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>In many ways the situation in this region is much more fluid and complex than that in the Europe-North Atlantic theatre. Asia is a diverse and non-homogeneous region, with little of the sense of common cultural identity and common diplomatic tradition of Europe. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Fraser used the same quote, exactly. However, the honourable member did not go on to quote other parts of the speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I can understand that because those other parts of the Minister's speech do not agree with the proposition that the honourable member put to the House today. I see the honourable member shaking his head but I shall quote him in just a moment to demonstrate what I believe to be correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, as the honourable member said, this proposition was floated in somewhat similar form by Mr Gorbachev in July, 1986, but even he acknowledged that it would be fairly difficult to translate a European situation to the South East Asia-Pacific rim area. </PARA>
<PARA> To get back to my comment about the Australian Foreign Minister's response to the proposition being put forward by the honourable gentleman, let me just read some of the speech that the Foreign Minister gave on 9 October, which has already been quoted by the honourable gentleman:</PARA>
<PARA>It cannot be assumed, against this background, that the global relaxation of tension will necessarily in itself lead to improved security in the Asia-Pacific region. As US-Soviet bipolar competition eases in the region, the interests and military capabilities of other major regional actors (China, India and Japan in particular) become more prominent. New strategic uncertainties may thus emerge, with a risk of generating new regional arms races. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia's judgment this situation calls, here as in Europe, for a common security approach with countries working to build multidimensional linkages of mutual benefit and interdependence, between old adversaries as well as between old friends. In the early stages, a sub-regional building block approach to security dialogue may be more effective than a region-wide approach.</PARA>
<PARA>In one sense that seems to underline what I am saying that the proposition which has been put forward by the honourable gentleman, according to our own Foreign Minister, is a bit premature at this stage. In fact, the Foreign Minister goes on at the next page of his speech to deal with that. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's interests are mainly focused on contributing to such dialogues around South East Asia and the South Pacific, although we also have a natural interest in security dialogues in North East Asia and the North Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the part that the honourable gentleman did not read out, but I will:</PARA>
<PARA>While it is quite premature at this stage to contemplate any kind of specific new security architecture for Asia or the Asia-Pacific, it may be that one day some kind of all embracing Conference on Security and Cooperation in Asia-built in some way on the still-evolving Helsinki CSCE model in Europe-will be seen as timely and appropriate.</PARA>

Anything that builds confidence, reduces tension and builds a security of relationships between different countries is to be applauded. But it is the timing of the issue with which I take issue with the honourable gentleman. I find myself in agreement with our Foreign Minister when he says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . it is quite premature at this stage to contemplate any kind of specific new security architecture for Asia or the Asia-Pacific . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. It is time all thinking nations stopped regarding war as a constant and unavoidable fact of life and death which must be accepted and around which a defensive or trauma minimising infrastructure must be built rather than as a social ill which is the natural consequence of unbridled acquisitiveness and abuse of power which can be negated or diminished by policy and action. Certainly armed conflict on an individual and social scale predates written history. But prehistory and recorded history abound with instances of rape of women and resources as the booty of war, institutionalised slavery, burning of witches-all constants in one era but unacceptable in another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are to make real progress in eradicating the social ill of war, particularly globally power based war, we must first acknowledge that war is only a constant for as long as world leaders allow or encourage it to be so. As humankind has become more sophisticated in the use of resources-in a technical though not environmental sense-armed conflict has moved from territorial and domestic bases, through local organisational and community groups, to an international strategy designed to bring power to politicians and money to manufacturers of and dealers in arms. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has referred to welcome moves in the United States, the Soviet Union and Europe to decelerate the race to unmitigated human disaster. Today's military situation, while it can certainly be said to be complex, should not be viewed as beyond the realms of human possibility to change, particularly given the human contrivance which results in perpetuation of a culture of war based on armed services, arms manufacture and aid funding to mop up its devastating effects, including agricultural projects which provide profits for the donors. </PARA>
<PARA> It is surely not pessimistic but an inescapable reality to observe that no sooner does one war exhausted region slump into an uneasy truce than another conflict is being conceived to take its place in the fabric or culture of war. And we all contribute, if not to its inception then certainly to its growth. If this were not so, world governments would not be so selective in their responses to appeals to assist regions in conflict, with the potential by their very presence to change the status of that war from regional to global. </PARA>
<PARA> So, while wars in the 1990s may be termed `internal conflicts', the power play is certainly worldwide. While the Cold War may appear to have been diminished, as suggested by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), there is still evidence that there will be, or there is always on the horizon, another regional conflict which is part of a global power play. Where has it really gone?</PARA>
<PARA> The effects of this situation are devastating. The link between war and socio-economic security is well documented, with 1989 military spending in the developing world approximately 30 per cent greater than spending on health and education combined. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1989 report of the United Nations Children's Fund points out that for almost 900 million people, approximately one-sixth of human kind, the march of human progress has now become a retreat. In many nations development has been thrown into reverse and after decades of steady economic advance large areas of the world are sliding backward into poverty. It is time for decisive action by all nations to break the self-perpetuating war syndrome into which we have locked ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The foreign policy credentials of my colleague the honourable member for Fraser are sound. He has devoted much time and energy to contribute in local and international forums on the related issues of disarmament and global poverty. His proposal for the establishment of a conference on security and cooperation in East Asia and the Pacific is well thought out. Similar agreements and conventions have been adopted in other regions, which the honourable member has outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) pointed out on Tuesday, Australia now stands at a high point of its constructive regional influence as an active, respected and positive partner in the region. This gives us certain power to initiate and overcome factors such as the lead time which is always part and parcel of treaties and agreements. If we keep waiting until a future time, without engaging in the sort of debate now before the House, we will never move on. </PARA>
<PARA> From the stance of respect of this Government, a conference on security and cooperation in the East Asian Pacific region, by increasing mutual trust between the countries in the region, would be a logical further step in the Australian Government's leadership and cooperation strategy in the areas of peace and disarmament and our involvement in and support of nations in our region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The events and the rapid changes we have witnessed in Europe over recent months tempt such people as the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) to believe that this experience, this unique experience, can be repeated in other regions, in this case in East Asia and the Pacific. What the honourable member fails to realise is that the confidence building measures and the path towards disarmament in Europe are part of a unique and very specific circumstance. In seeking to repeat the European phenomenon in East Asia and the Pacific the honourable member fails to realise that the experiment cannot as a matter of course be repeated elsewhere for a number of reasons. Firstly, when we consider the confidence building measures witnessed in Europe, it must be remembered that they have been in operation for over 20 years and only now are we seeing the real benefits of the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the confidence measures employed in Europe are very much part of evolving European history and the unique politics of that region, an experience which cannot necessarily be repeated in East Asia and the Pacific, as the honourable member seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the process in Europe have been slow and the road has been anything but smooth. In many respects the saving grace was the unique European ability to persevere. Most importantly, the success of the European program has been dependent on a desire to preserve a lifestyle quality unmatched in history. The ex- perience of prosperity throughout Europe has encouraged Europeans to embrace confidence building measures in order to preserve what is in relative terms a luxurious lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, to attempt to repeat the European experience in Asia, which does not have the lifestyle or the incentives to achieve similar results, is very much dealing with the unknown. The honourable member seems to believe that the European experience of confidence building measures and steps towards disarmament established at the first formal Conference on Security and Cooperation in Helsinki between 1973 and 1975 sets a precedent for Asia and the Pacific. He relies on the fact that President Gorbachev floated the idea for such a conference for the Pacific in 1986, but in his own speech to the Society for International Development Regional Conference in Jakarta in July of this year the honourable member himself provided the answer as to whether the success of Europe can be repeated in East Asia and the Pacific. I quote him in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Why then has there been no movement on this proposal so far? There are many differences between Europe and East Asia and the Pacific. For example, it is not even clear which countries should be included.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that one needs to look at a number of other aspects as well. Some of the comments that were made in the honourable gentleman's speech related to the economic savings that can be achieved by arms reductions. I guess a lot of this is dependent upon who the participants will be-we do not know that at this stage-and how those conflicts in South East Asia will be resolved. There have been a number of suggestions that conflicts go on and on and where there is one conflict another one replaces it. </PARA>
<PARA> Having spent some three years of military service in South East Asia I recognise some of the difficulties even within countries, let alone trying to look at the problems between individual countries. There are a tremendous number of problems there. I would question whether the economic benefits will be there. One has to look at it with respect to the two major players-the USSR and the United States of America-and say that reductions over a period of time in forces will not necessarily mean that there will be savings either to countries in the region or certainly to Australia. If we see a reduction in United States forces it may well necessitate this country providing additional requirements in the defence area. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about these benefits and these savings we really do need to go a lot further than we have at this stage. We need to address the comments that were made earlier by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) when he spoke of the speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in the US only a couple of days ago when he said that some of these processes are premature. We need to assess the overall effects. I believe that a number of those still need to be addressed. The ideas of the honourable gentleman certainly represent the direction in which we should be heading. </PARA>
<PARA> It is early times and there are a lot of things that have changed very rapidly around the world. Certainly since his original speech was made in Jakarta changes have occurred in the Middle East. We are not certain of what the situation will be in Europe. I believe that we need to assess those matters and then maybe look a little further down the track at the proposals that he is suggesting. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House calls on the Government to acknowledge the key role played by primary producers and small businesses in generating exports by (a) agreeing to remove the discriminatory assets test on family allowances and (b) lifting the threshold for the assets test on Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA>I welcome the opportunity in this period of private members' business to address the impact of the assets test on rural Australians. There will be some who will say, `This is a boring and repetitious speech. We have heard it all from the honourable member for Wakefield before. We heard it in a matter of public importance barely 10 days ago'. I make no apology for being boring and repetitious on this issue.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Boring, repetitious and persistent, until the injustice of an assets test, particularly on the family allowance, the family allowance supplement and Austudy is dealt with in a more socially just way by this Government. It is almost inconceivable that in 1990, in the year in which rural Australia will face its lowest income for three decades, this Government should choose to deny Australian farmers the family allowance simply because of the assets they are perceived to hold. Can honourable members believe that a Government that claims as its social justice plank some sense of equity would say to Australian farmers that they will not get what was once the child endowment money, what was once welfare made available to recognise the cost of raising families, that they will not get that and they will not get it not because they are too wealthy but because their assets happen to exceed $300,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No-one asks those farmers how large are their families; no-one asks them about their cash flow. Simply because their assets exceed $300,000 they will be denied the family allowance. There is no justice in that, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, must know and as the Minister at the table knows as well. While I stand here speaking to this House the situation in rural Australia progressively gets worse. We thought when we assembled as a Parliament in May and the Opposition was told what the Government proposed to do about the floor price of wool that the lowering of that price from 870c to 700c had solved the problem. Today we find that the situation is even worse than could possibly have been imagined. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's wool farmers face the situation where not only has the floor price gone from 870c to 700c, but in addition the taxation they pay on the wool they sell has increased from 8 per cent to 20 per cent, and it is proposed that it will increase to 30 per cent, with the possibility of a 20 per cent surcharge taking it to 50 per cent. That is the reality for the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As if that were not grim enough, what has happened to my wheat growers and the wheat growers of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher)? Those same wheat growers who once could have taken for granted a payment of $150 or $165 a tonne for their wheat now face as a result, firstly, of the quite unexpected invasion of Kuwait a major loss of an Australian wheat market; and in addition, as if it were not enough, record Northern Hemisphere crops. So most farmers will face at best a payment of $95 a tonne and the real possibility that the payment will be as low as $70 a tonne. They might as well leave their tractors in the sheds. </PARA>
<PARA> With that facing the farmers, what does the Government say to them? It says that the welfare that the rest of Australia can take for granted will be denied to those farmers. Why? Because they are too wealthy? Because their income exceeds the $57,000 normally made available as the means test limit on the family allowance? No. Simply because their assets are in excess of $300,000, they will be denied that basic welfare. There is no justice in that, and the least this Government can do is to reconsider its Budget night announcement about the family allowance, the family allowance supplement and the changes to Austudy, which meant that whereas once a property could be valued at $600,000 before Australian farming families were denied Austudy, now once the property is valued at $400,000 it falls into the same category. </PARA>
<PARA> Can you believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, as one who participates in a parliamentary debate, that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) would consider doing this, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) having said that he believed Australia should be the clever country? How on earth can the Government consider then denying tertiary education to Australia's rural community? Some of the most innovative young people in Australia come out of Australia's rural communities. Some of the most resourceful young people in Australia come from those communities. It is inevitable; it is almost genetic. </PARA>

When their children are too young to receive Austudy, they will be denied the family allowance because their assets exceed $300,000.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no sense of social justice at all. The Government needs at least to amend these provisions prior to their coming before the Parliament. I am pleased to say that I am not a lone voice. Those in the gallery, people listening and members in the chamber are about to hear from the honourable member for Mallee, who is no less indignant than I am about what is happening to his farmers. More than that, I am pleased to say that one person, the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), with the courage of his convictions, is prepared to say that he, too, is unhappy about these proposals and the impact they are having on his farmers. I would not want to be so bold as to put words into the mouth of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), but I suspect that he also shares some of the sentiments I am expressing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For this reason the honourable member for Grey was prepared yesterday to organise a deputation to Senator Richardson and to invite me to join him. I could have organised my own deputation, but as a member of the Opposition I have to recognise that while Senator Richardson's door is always open, it is a little further open if one has a Government member present. The challenge that Senator Richardson, the Cabinet, and the backbench of the ALP now must face is that of recognising just what is happening to rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is seldom any excuse for imposing an assets test on Australian farmers, but if reason can be found-because there have been exceptions where people ought not to have had a particular entitlement that they have been taking for granted-for that assets test, there can be no justification for applying it without there being adequate hardship provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The ALP, I would have thought, would have stood for some sense of social justice. But I have good reason to question that plank. How on earth can they tell those in rural Australia, which is in its poorest state for three decades, that they will be denied Austudy, family allowance and family allowance supplement solely on the grounds that their assets exceed $300,000-no question about income, no question about the size of the family. Any one of Australia's farming families could take their asset, sell it, buy a home by the sea and sit there with their feet in the ocean and qualify for family allowance. There is no justice in that. If Australia's farming families saw their farms as nothing more than asset value, they would have done that. </PARA>
<PARA> Right now this nation needs productive farmers. It needs productive farmers to address its balance of payments deficit. What the Government is doing to them is consigning them to perpetual poverty and to the real loss of not only their farms, but also of any sense of dignity. There is no justice in that when these are the people we as a parliament need to turn the economy around.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this motion I fear that I start to sound like a gramophone record because the problem goes back to a very basic issue and that is the growing dichotomy in Australia between city and rural Australia. This is indeed the biggest problem facing this country because we will not survive as a divided nation. The problem across the political field in Australia, certainly in the major parties, is that there is a very scant regard for rural Australia and that is because it is a minority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth is that 100 years ago Australia was the most urban country in the world, with the possible exception of Holland, I guess; today it is even more so. Today an even greater number of Australians live in the capital cities, yet the great bulk of the wealth of this country is generated outside the capital cities. The jobs and the standard of living enjoyed by people in capital cities are related directly or indirectly to the wealth generated in the hinterland of Australia. The problem is that that hinterland is getting less and less political representation. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of this is, in my view, the decision of the last Budget to reduce the value of the assets test. I do not disapprove of assets testing. In fact, I strongly approve of assets testing, but I believe it must be kept in perspective and certainly must have hardship provisions. One of the problems we have here is that very few people understand that a farm with a value of $300,000, or even double that, represents a very small farm in Australia. What they also do not realise is that it is very hard to sell such an asset now-it is almost impossible; so no-one knows the real value of it. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, very few people in this country want to test that. Neither the Government nor the banks want that tested because if properties were put on the market now, many of them would sell for less than the amount which the banks have lent against them. It would undermine the banks' equity and cause quite a degree of consternation in the banking field in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. That is the problem we have. It seems to me that we have imposed a level which is totally unrealistic and which will impose a lot of hardship on people-true, not a lot of people, but people who are vital to the future of this country. They are also people, I might say, for whom education is vital if we are going to maintain the agricultural sector as a vital part of our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to address a specific matter in the social security area. Of course, this is an anomaly that I have tried to have redressed. I have been to three government departments and three Ministers and while they all say it is clearly unfair, nothing appears to be being done about it. The matter concerns the case of a woman with two children living in a country town. One child has turned 16. Because there is no year 11 or year 12 in that country town, she has no option but to send that child off to a high school in Geraldton. </PARA>
<PARA> To send the child to Geraldton to board at the government hostel-the John Frewer Boys Hostel-would cost this woman $4,462 a year. So she goes along to Austudy and is told, `Yes, my word, we want to help you and because you are on a very low income we will pay you the full boarding allowance, which is $4,170.66'. At this stage she is only a few dollars out of pocket and I guess that could be considered to be quite fair. Then, in steps the Social Security Department saying that because the child is no longer dependent-which is, in itself, a nonsense concept-it will reassess the woman's widow's pension. It, in fact, reduces it from $419.80 per week to $349. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. That is a loss of something like $2,804 over the 12 months. Her situation now is: her son receives $4,170.66 from Austudy. The mother receives $8,974 as a widow's pension; that gives her a total of $12,244.66, out of which she now pays boarding fees of $4,462, leaving her a balance of $7,782. Before Austudy the family was getting $10,914 a year, little enough as it is, plus the family allowance; now it is getting $3,132 less per year. That does not seem to me to be a very good incentive to encourage education and it seems one hell of a way to build the clever country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The injustice there is so monumental I would have thought that every one of those government departments I have approached would have said, `Yes, this is clearly an anomaly and we will redress it'. Instead, they refer to the Social Security Act, they pass the buck from one department to the other and when I go through the Act I do not find it at all clear that assistance should be cut off from this particular woman. In any case it is clearly an anomaly and clearly one which we should address. I say to Senator Richardson that his Department should pay very strict attention to this and if he, himself, were prepared to look at anomalies like this, instead of wasting our time with a lot of this greenhouse nonsense, this country would be a lot better off. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that unless we redress this basic problem and stop this dichotomy growing, this country is going to fragment. We will end up as rich city states around the coast which will become ever-increasing targets for foreign ownership and we will have a poor hinterland. This is surely a formula for a Third World country and one which we should all be very frightened of. If we are to develop in Australia an export ethos, as we should, then there is absolutely no reason why we should not have industries based in the hinterland of Australia; export oriented industries do not have to be located adjacent to capital cities. To do this we need to overcome a lot of the problems that exist, problems such as lack of power for industry and transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that the conservation movement which in this country is almost entirely city based is the movement which above anyone else tends to stop these sorts of developments taking place. I do not know of one instance of downstream processing in this country that has not been opposed bitterly, and often dishonestly, by the conservation movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say that in the past the Labor Government had a good record. It was a Labor government that introduced the isolated children's allowances, that were not means tested, in recognition of the equity argument for the cost of education. I believe that this is an equity argument, for no matter how rich a person is, if he lives in the city his kid can go down the street, travel a short way and get his education to a very high standard at a high school at very little cost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, at institutions such as Urrbrae of which the honourable member and I are alumni. That is not the case in the country. In the country, often, no matter how poor someone is, the cost of giving his child an education becomes astronomical. It is a problem that must be redressed if we are to build some unity and equity in this country. We must recognise this equity argument, the right to education, the need for education. Let us understand this clearly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support tertiary students paying a proportion of the cost of their education because, primarily, they will be the beneficiaries. In primary and secondary education, overwhelmingly, the beneficiary is the State. If these people do not get this education, they impose a cost upon the State in terms of unemployability or employability at a low level which will endure for their entire lives. So there is a clear distinction between education provided at this level and education provided at university level. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the Labor Party has a good record. We introduced this allowance and increased it in the last Budget to $1,500. In my view, it has not been increased enough. It in no way compensates for the real costs that have occurred since it was first introduced in 1974, but it was at least one step, for which I am grateful. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very important issue. I commend the honourable member for Wakefield for moving the motion during private members' business, and I hope that the Government will take steps to redress what is clearly an unfair anomaly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion moved by my colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), which calls on the Government to acknowledge the key role played by primary producers and small businesses in generating exports by agreeing to remove the discriminatory assets test on family allowances and lifting the threshold on the assets test on Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I congratulate the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), as no doubt I will be able to congratulate the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), on supporting this motion because it deals with a matter that was, without doubt, the worst decision in the last Federal Budget. What makes it even worse is the fact that there was an Austudy rural inequities report by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. I have some fears that this was suppressed until after the last election. This report in fact said that Austudy for rural students was inadequate, unfair, complicated, poorly explained and kept country students out of tertiary education. Despite this, these new assets test levels will create problems in the equitable provision of government services, particularly in the support and care of children and providing them with the same educational opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The tightened assets test on family allowance and Austudy will add to, and do nothing to address, the high level of poverty in country Australia and the widening gap, to which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie referred, between urban and rural life. </PARA>
<PARA> For some in the Australian Labor Party, this change no doubt satisfies their philosophical bent, because the truth of these changes is that no farmers and few small business people will qualify. Farmers and business people will lose the benefit if they have $300,000 in assets, and no allowance will be made for additional children. We have already seen the impact of the assets test: disruption to families, aged parents who were previously on a pension and in retirement moving back on the farms to work or, worse still, the young people, who were the future of farming in rural Australia, moving off the farms and into other pursuits in urban Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the House to compare this particular change to that of a wage-earner who, under these allowances, is allowed to earn up to $57,620 and still qualify for family allowance and have this amount increased for each child. Farms of this value-and the honourable member for Wakefield has clearly indicated the drastically changing circumstances in agriculture today-have no capacity to generate income at this level. This means that thousands of rural children will be held in poverty and will be unable to afford education that the rest of Australia, quite rightly, takes as its right. At a time when the economy of Australia's rural industry is facing its worst outcome, this Federal Labor Government continues to discriminate against farmers and people in small businesses living in rural Australia. </PARA>

In fact, I only have to refer to the comments of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) who, in the past few days, has warned that rural Australia is heading for a worse collapse than that in the 1982-83 recession. He has predicted-and I quote from the Melbourne Age of 8 October 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The word `decentralisation' tends not to occur any more in vocabularies around Australia. Particularly in South Australia, where I live, we have a terrible drift from country areas into the cities. Why? Because, as has been outlined quite clearly by members on both sides of this House, people who live in country and regional areas are disadvantaged. For instance, if students living in the city miss out on Austudy or something like that, at least they are living at home and have accommodation and so forth. All they have to do is find their way to the university and back. But students who live in the country are not only disadvantaged in having to set up, in many instances, a second home but they also have to find transport, accommodation and all those extra costs that arise. </PARA>

<PARA> Many people living in country areas are quite happy about income testing. I do not have any argument with that at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Australian Government allow the restoration of normal sporting links with South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA>I call on the Government to take a leap into the 1990s and resume normal sporting contact with South Africa. Sporting boycotts of that country go back almost three decades to when South Africa was banned from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Later I remember, especially as I am a keen cricket follower, the quite proper banning of the South African cricket team from touring England when the then South African Government would not let Basil d'Olivera tour with England in 1968. The world cry was for South Africa to eliminate apartheid from sport, for its teams to be selected on a non-racial basis and for black South African sportspersons to be allowed to represent their country on the international stage. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early 1970s the then President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Bob Hawke, wrote to the then South African Prime Minister, Mr Vorster, expressing `on behalf of the Australian union movement the sincere hope that your Government will quickly see its way clear to decide that teams purporting to represent your country may in fact be chosen on a basis which involves no racial discrimination'. If this were done, he said, South Africa's rugby and cricket teams would be `warmly and widely welcomed' in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Non-racial sport has long been achieved in South Africa, even to the satisfaction of respected overseas inspection teams, yet our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and this country welsh on this promise. Today there is probably less racial discrimination in most South African sports than there is in Australian sports, let alone in many other overseas countries. Blacks not only sit on selection panels but are chosen on merit in all sporting teams and dominate many South African national sporting teams, such as soccer, athletics and boxing. </PARA>
<PARA> However, now that South Africa has delivered on that promise, the goal posts have suddenly been shifted. Australia now says it is not possible to have normal sport in an abnormal society. If that is the case, why do we have normal sporting contact with another 50 African countries, virtually none of which are democratic by our standards and most of which are brutal one-party dictatorships in which people who do not belong to the ruling tribes are mercilessly persecuted. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Government also says that blacks must have the same access to facilities as whites. That is another nonsensical demand. If Mandela were immediately elected President tomorrow, this Government would rush immediately to recognise South Africa and play sport with South African teams. However, it is obvious that the shortfall of gymnasiums and playing fields in Soweto under President de Klerk would be the same or worse under Mandela. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all this is the fact that the vast majority of black people themselves do not want sporting boycotts any more than they want sanctions. Try to explain to black South Africans why the South African soccer team, of which probably 10 of the 11 chosen players are black, is not allowed to play against Manchester United, Liverpool or Tottenham Hotspurs, and see the looks on the faces of 90 per cent or more of them. While the patronising and comfortably living white Left intelligentsia in distant Western countries receive a warm inner glow by imposing boycotts, they conveniently overlook that these same sports boycotts cost many black people their only chance to compete and earn fame and money. They also deny black school children the chance to have black heroes to look up to. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the same with our sanctions, which cost black South Africans their jobs. Every opinion poll among blacks shows that to be the case. Let us be quite clear on this. We once quite correctly condemned South Africa because its government would not allow its black people to compete internationally. But now, when its Government is eager for black South Africans to compete, our Government is today stopping blacks from competing. These black people want to compete but our Government stops them. Where is the logic in that?</PARA>
<PARA> The methods our Government uses to enforce this policy are despicable. They include misrepresenting the Gleneagles Agreement, misleading Parliament, blackmailing local sporting organisations to do their dirty work for them and badgering and denigrating fine young Australian sportsmen like Kim Hughes and Graham Yallop. The Prime Minister has used intellectually dishonest arguments such as the argument that if we play with South Africa black South African countries will not vote for us for the Olympics. So much for that theory! The irony was that, in his recent unsuccessful overseas bid to gain the Olympics for Melbourne, the Prime Minister endorsed the services of Greg Norman. Though Greg Norman has openly played tournament golf in South Africa, the Prime Minister offered him, virtually as a bribe, as a partner for Olympic voting delegates in a round of golf. What would normally have cost an average citizen thousands of dollars was now proffered for free in an attempt to secure delegate votes. </PARA>
<PARA> What naked hypocrisy from our Prime Minister. He does so many backflips on this issue he should enter the gymnastics events himself. He then has the gall to say we give `aid and comfort' to the South African Government by competing against its sports people. Do we give aid and comfort to the Russian, Ugandan, Pakistani or Romanian governments when we compete against them? Do we give aid and comfort to the Fijian Government which has a racist Constitution and no Indians in its teams? Do we give aid and comfort to the racist West Indians because they will not pick whites under Viv Richards? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most outrageous tactic of this Government is its deliberate and blatant misuse of the Gleneagles Agreement. Drawn up in June 1977 by the Commonwealth heads of government, this Agreement was never signed, let alone ratified. Sporting bodies were never consulted. The two relevant paragraphs of the Agreement, which I do not have time to read, say in effect that each government, acting in the manner it best thinks fit, must discourage all sporting contact between its citizens and those in South Africa. It is between all citizens: no distinction is made between one citizen and another. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that only a government may breach the agreement. It is impossible for an individual or sports person to do so, as was acknowledged by Senator Evans himself back in October 1985. Also, it is not mandatory to ban sporting contact, as some seem to think. Contrary to popular belief, and contrary to what this Government tries to make out, the agreement makes no distinction whatever between teams and individuals, professionals and amateurs, representatives of a country and non-representatives, one sport and another, or one age group and another. However, despite the blatant misleading of the House and the Australian people by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and Mr Hayden in May 1988 when they claimed that Australia had `scrupulously adhered' to the Gleneagles Agreement, the fact is that we breach it openly every day. </PARA>
<PARA> We single out Alderman, Rackeman and Trevor Hohns for vituperation but excuse Greg Norman, Darren Gauci and Wayne Gardner. We discourage Campese, Pat Cash and Glen Ella, who is an Aboriginal, for competing in South Africa but ignore Geoff Hunt, Wally Masur and Evonne Goolagong, also an Aboriginal, for doing so. John Fitzgerald gets a mention for playing there but Johan Kriek is free to come to Australia and is welcomed as the winner of our Australian Open not just once, but twice. The National Australian gymkhana team can go to South Africa but the national rugby team cannot. Gary Player can come here to play golf and win the Australian Open numerous times, but a Rotary golfing group cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about as logical as inviting Mandela to visit Australia but denying entry to Buthelezi. Some white golfers and tennis players are allowed in but black marathon runners and boxers are not. The brilliant South Australian batsman Mike Haysman has even been banned for 10 years for coaching black South African children in cricket, yet Christo van Rensburg is welcomed to play the Russian Andrei Chesnokov in the New South Wales Open tennis titles. We can even play in an international tournament against the South African Golden Oldies rugby team but not in one against the `golden youngies'. Apparently even age is a criterion in the Prime Minister's interpretation of the Gleneagles Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the consistency in this whole issue? The Government's policy is a total and absolute farce and is only supported by a small minority of Australian people. Still more ridiculous is the fact that this Government will not even allow its members to visit South Africa to see for themselves. Only the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has had the guts to defy this ban to see the situation for himself, and he is a strong supporter of lifting the sporting boycotts. If only for the immense harm these boycotts are doing to black people, the bans must be scrapped immediately and normal sporting contact should be resumed with South Africa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset let me say that I recognise and applaud recent developments in South Africa. I believe that these developments, despite the opposition of many-including both black and white-will continue. That so much has been achieved while so much remains to be done shows how far away the starting point was. In two weeks when the Parliament honours Nelson Mandela, indeed, when Australia pays tribute to his many years of struggle, we will be honouring a man who does not have a vote in his own country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a well established fact that sporting boycotts imposed on South Africa have had a profound effect within that country. They have been used not simply because racial discrimination in South African sport is still very solidly entrenched but, more importantly, because sport within that country is inextricably woven into the overall apartheid system. This has been acknowledged by Mr Eddie Barlow, Director of the South African Sports Office, on behalf of 90 South African sports organisations. He announced a declaration of intent to combat apartheid in sport. Even more to the point is the fact that the whites of South Africa and their Government clearly attach such enormous significance to maintaining sporting contacts with the outside world.</PARA>
<PARA> The whites of South Africa see themselves as an embattled minority living in increasing isolation from the rest of the world because of their commitment to apartheid. This sense of isolation, coupled with a desire to restore its reputation in world opinion, has led the South African regime strongly to support any moves made by South African sporting authorities and entrepreneurs to re-establish sporting links with the rest of the world. While it will not openly admit this, the South African Government sees the most compelling reasons to ensure that sport and politics continue to mix. </PARA>
<PARA> To understand what is really happening in South Africa, it is essential to appreciate one simple fact: the entire edifice of apartheid exists not so much because the whites consider themselves to be racially superior to the blacks, but because the apartheid system with all its interlocking laws ensures a constant supply of cheap, expendable black labour which makes it possible for the white minority, and them alone, to enjoy a high standard of living-until recently, perhaps the best in the world. The white minority wishes to maintain this situation and fear any drastic changes. Consequently, despite certain changes to petty apartheid in recent years, little has really changed. </PARA>
<PARA> The black majority-some 77 per cent of the total population-are still denied the right to vote and the right to own land outside the impoverished and underdeveloped homelands, which comprise only 3 per cent of the total area of South Africa. Despite recent changes, the reality is that minority rule and all other pillars of apartheid have not yet been removed. Significant steps have only been taken towards the removal of the obstacles to the process of negotiations. Therefore, the struggle against apartheid must continue and, as long as profound and irreversible changes have not been achieved, international sanctions and sporting boycotts must continue. It is the pressure of sanctions that has forced de Klerk to come to the negotiating table. Any movement backwards with regard to existing sanctions will threaten the process of negotiations itself. </PARA>
<PARA> For the solution to South Africa's situation to be just and lasting, it must result in the transformation of South Africa into a united democratic and non-racial country. Anything less than this would condemn the country to worsening and endemic conflict. Every adult South African must have the right to participate in governing the country through a system of `one person one vote'. The human rights of all citizens must be guaranteed under an entrenched and justiciable Bill of Rights which should be enforced by an independent judiciary. The rights of every citizen to his or her language, culture and religion must also be guaranteed. This, of course, would mean a new Constitution. This should, as in Namibia, be negotiated by an elected constituent assembly. This would ensure that the people themselves decide who should represent them. It would also be of vital importance in ensuring that the new Constitution enjoys legitimacy and acceptability among the masses of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is similarly of central importance that these political changes should be accompanied by serious economic transformations as well. The economy must serve the interests of the people as a whole, and must be geared to end the terrible poverty and deprivation that is the legacy of the apartheid system, an economy which grows at a rate and in a manner which will enable all the people to enjoy a decent and rising standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> The apartheid system still remains intact. A white minority government still rules the country. Only initial agreements have been reached on removing obstacles to the process of negotiations, but once they have been implemented it does not mean that the apartheid system itself will be removed. Meanwhile, many whites do not accept that white minority rule should come to an end and are undermining the current process by all means possible. </PARA>
<PARA> What all this means is that the struggle against apartheid must continue. The situation has not been reached where we can say that profound and irreversible changes have taken place leading to the end of the apartheid system. It is for this reason that the struggle must continue. To stop or de-escalate that struggle now would only have the effect of helping to perpetuate the apartheid system. The masses of South African people must therefore continue the struggle within the country. The international community shares the same obligation. That is why the black majority continue to call on the people of the world to maintain sanctions-and I do not know where the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) gets his information that the blacks want sanctions lifted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the opinion polls I have seen and in talks with the South Africans, I know that they all say that, despite the hardships they may be enduring, they should continue. Sanctions were imposed as a peaceful means of ensuring the end of the apartheid system. This result has not yet been achieved. It is therefore only logical that the existing sanctions should be kept in place. It is too early to countenance resumption of sporting links. Too many people have struggled for too long to give in so easily.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final point I would like to make is to correct something the honourable member for Parkes said-and I am sure it was a case of some misinformation on his part. The Australian Labor Party does not ban politicians from going to South Africa. In fact, one has only returned this week. We do not encourage people to go there but, as a democratic party, we do not forbid or prevent any Australian Labor Party politician going to South Africa. If they want to go there, that is their decision. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dramatic changes in the world's political landscape in the last 12 months have brought about gains in political freedoms throughout the world, especially for human rights and progress in the elimination of racial discrimination. Such progress was registered in Africa with the independence of Namibia and with a number of significant developments in South Africa which have given rise to, we expect, negotiations towards the eradication of apartheid. Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, said that Australia warmly welcomed the changes that had occurred in South Africa this year and looked forward to the pillars of apartheid `as they begin to crumble'. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has given only scant regard to the changes that have happened throughout the world and has not recognised the developments in South Africa that should be applauded by this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How far have we come? Across the world we have come an enormous way, and South Africa has been part of that international move towards freedom. It would be so sad if, after looking at the Soviet Union and the changes that have happened so quickly there, we then looked with expectation to South Africa and believed that those positive changes which had occurred in the Soviet Union could not occur in South Africa. What the honourable member for Throsby has done is to take the total negative in this argument, which is a shame because we are not sending the correct messages to the black people in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be specific. Which people are suffering the most in regard to this situation? Certainly not Australians because we stand pompously as one of the free nations of the world while having some skeletons in our cupboard, yet we criticise what is happening in nations such as South Africa. We as a country are ignoring what is happening throughout the world and we should not be ignoring it. In fact, these black people-especially black sportsmen-are the ones who are suffering the most. They are the people who cannot go overseas and compete with the best in the world. They have to stay at home. Black golfers cannot compete in other countries in the world. It is a two-edged sword which we are failing to address. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that the most popular sport in South Africa is soccer. Soccer is played and enjoyed by most South Africans as the number one sport. Of the people who play soccer in South Africa, 99 per cent are black. It is interesting that last year the black-dominated sport of soccer in South Africa elected as its No. 1 player of the year a white goalkeeper. There have been dramatic changes in integration and segregation in sport in South Africa recently. Let us recognise that and say, `Australia should take a lead. We believe this should be encouraged'. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should we encourage changes to Australia's attitude to sport in South Africa and to apartheid? We should encourage them because when Gorbachev was encouraged from without, he was able to make great gains far more quickly than he would have made otherwise. One has to look at the Gorbachev situation and say that, in regard to perestroika, the changes happened because Gorbachev had support from without. If he had not had that support from without, he would have lost both the conservatives and the reformists in the Soviet Union. We have to give a lead to South Africa and offer it this opportunity for support.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been great political and sporting changes in South Africa. If Australia takes the lead and gives that support, perhaps we can encourage the changes we desire and the honourable member for Throsby desires. Perhaps here is an opportunity for Australia to take the lead. It is hopeless for a young boy in South Africa not to be able to reach the pinnacle in any given sport, not to have an international goal-an opportunity that we in Australia freely accept. He will never be able to compete internationally in cricket, soccer or rugby, and perhaps not in tennis, although that depends who he is. He cannot say `One day I am going to be the best in the world', yet in this country we consider that to be an opportunity that is available to every young man and woman. Social justice for the individual does not exist in South Africa for those who do not have those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the worst problem facing South Africa at the moment-I disagree with the honourable member for Throsby because I believe that the ANC is now talking about this- concerns the massive black unemployment problem in South Africa. The ANC is looking to lift sanctions on behalf of the people in its community who want jobs, who want to feed their families and who want the opportunities that sanctions throughout the world, and especially our sanctions, are depriving them of. The freedom of speech we enjoy in this country is not enjoyed in many other countries, yet we seem to take a different attitude to every country depending on political whim and what is happening in Australia at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust behind this argument over apartheid in South Africa is not based on the best reasons-all of the reasons that have been mentioned by both speakers in this debate today. Rather, the thrust by this Government especially has been to divert attention away from the economic problems that are facing Australia on a daily basis. In other words, the Government says, `We will use anything and we will talk about anything-be it international, constitutional or whatever-to move the argument, to move the press away from discovering the real truth of what is happening in this nation'. That is a tragedy for South Africa because it does not focus our attention on those things that are important: the opportunities for young people in other nations, including South Africa. I think that we as a parliament have a responsibility to do exactly that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few moments I have left I would like to concentrate specifically on the issue raised this morning: that the Australian Government should allow the restoration of normal sporting links with South Africa. I would like to concentrate on the sporting links question and not address the other nefarious issues that have been raised in this debate to date. I do not think anybody in this Parliament, on either side, believes in the apartheid regime, but I think people have to understand that those countries such as South Africa who have over a long period used various methods to try to establish in the minds of the people of the world that they are doing the right thing will go to any lengths to achieve this, and sport is but one of those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For example, I take the point made by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) in his contribution concerning the individual versus sporting teams. The difference between individual Australian sports men and women going to South Africa and sporting teams going there I think is very substantial. In the case of individuals, it is the lure of the loot, the chase of the dollar. Those countries that have been isolated from sporting contacts for any reason whatsoever have found that they can easily find sponsorship-largely through government-invested sponsorship, I should imagine-to encourage people to go there for propaganda purposes. With individual sports men and women, there is a limit to the amount of propaganda value that those countries get from that. But imagine the value gained if a country sends its national cricket, rugby union or, indeed, soccer team to a country such as that and says, `Look what we have done'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the history of South Africa. How many blacks have run out onto the field with the South African rugby union team? How many blacks rolled their arms over in a cricket team in the days when sporting contacts were allowed? I cannot recall seeing too many and I can remember those contests very vividly. I take the point that change may have started to come in South Africa. I take heart, particularly, from rugby union, where we now see that the barriers of apartheid have been broken down and games are being played. That is great, but it is only a step in the right direction. On the other hand, if we encouraged national teams such as the All Blacks or the Australian Wallabies to tour South Africa, the national exposure that that would present would give legitimacy to a regime that in the past has said, `Only the whites will play against those teams coming over, no-one else'.</PARA>
<PARA> The point that was made about the opportunity for young black people to play sport in South Africa compared to Australia is quite valid. One has only to run through the names of some of the people that get the opportunity to play. Blacks in Australia have always been integrated into sport because of their natural abilities and because it is seen that that is the right thing to do in our society. Look at the current group of people playing in the Winfield Cup competition in the rugby league first grade premiership in Australia: Shearer, Walford, Meninga, Daley and Ian Russell-the list goes on of talented black sportspeople playing first grade. In Australia they are given the opportunity to compete equally and they are paid equally. In South Africa, on the other hand, how many times have we seen blacks trotted out in national teams or, indeed, first grade sides of this nature?</PARA>
<PARA> This seems to be the same tired old motion that gets trotted out occasionally in this Parliament. Going back through some of my notes on this matter, I see that in 1984-85 a similar motion was put up and debated. In 1984, I think, the National Party of Australia at its conference actually changed the view it had and decided that it should encourage further sporting contacts with South Africa. Yet only 12 months later, Charles Blunt, then a member of the Opposition shadow Ministry, put out a press release saying that he was totally opposed to sporting contacts with South Africa, particularly the rebel cricket team that was proposing to tour at the time. There was confusion in those days, just as I am sure that there is confusion today. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that, in terms of this entire debate on sporting contact, it is the propaganda value that exists for South Africa and regimes like it which must be discouraged. If such regimes can clearly demonstrate in rugby union, cricket, soccer or any other sport where national teams are involved that their teams are truly representative of the make-up of their countries, we will re-examine the situation and consider how we might improve it in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House :</PARA>
<PARA> (1) welcomes the adoption of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and Health; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on governments at all levels to fund the implementation of the strategy to address the critical issues of Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA>The national Aboriginal health strategy was unanimously adopted by the Joint Ministerial Forum of Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and Health in Brisbane at its meeting on 10 June 1990. This decision came after 2 1/2 years of detailed research and work by the National Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Party and the Aboriginal Health Development Group in putting together the evidence, the arguments and the recommendations which the State and Federal Ministers adopted. I urge all honourable members to obtain a copy of the report of the working party, if they have not already done so, and acquaint themselves with the facts contained in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategy was developed after considerable consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people throughout Australia and with the aid of considerable written input from national, regional and community based organisations, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. It was a decision of major significance for Australia and in particular for Aboriginal Australians. But it was the only decision that could have been made by these Ministers when the overwhelming weight of evidence of the stark position of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was placed before them. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important feature of the decision by the Joint Ministerial Forum to endorse this strategy is the recognition that all governments can and must work together to overcome the fundamental problems faced by Aboriginal Australians which are so clearly exposed by their health statistics. The next and current stage-and probably the more difficult one-is to work out who is going to fund the elements of the national Aboriginal health strategy. This is the point we have arrived at today, and it is the purpose of the motion before the House. The adoption of the strategy by Ministers from the Federal Government and all States is a recognition that past efforts have been insufficient and that a new, additional allocation of resources will be required. </PARA>
<PARA> The dramatic and damning statistics on the health of Aboriginal Australians are a symptom of their experiences of the last 200 years in this land. Unless we get serious about the well-being of a quarter of a million Australians whose living standards and health equate with the worst of the Third World, this generation's leaders shall be damned forever in the eyes of history. It is totally unacceptable in our country, with our wealth and resources, that one section of society should be so seriously disadvantaged in health matters.</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the statistics are: in all age groups and in all States and Territories, Aboriginal people suffer significantly higher mortality rates than the rest of the population; for almost every cause of death, the death rates for Aboriginal people are between two and eight times greater than for non-Aboriginal people; Aboriginal males have a life expectancy as much as 22 years shorter than non-Aboriginal males while life expectancy for Aboriginal women is 15 years shorter than for non-Aboriginal women; circulatory system disease is the number one killer of Aboriginal men and women; the rate of tuberculosis amongst Aboriginal people is 14 times greater than for the rest of the population; immunisation rates for Aboriginal children are 40 to 50 per cent lower than for non-Aboriginals; and Aboriginal people suffer much higher rates of rheumatic heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, ear infections, eye disease, asthma and kidney disease than nonAboriginal Australians. The list goes on and on, and builds into a truly frightening and shocking assessment of the benefits of 200 years of paternalistic administration of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The national Aboriginal health strategy recommends a series of coordinated measures to provide better managed and targeted services for Aboriginal people. These require some financial commitment from both the States and the Commonwealth, and I urge both levels of government to negotiate these arrangements as soon as possible to enable the implementation of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA> But integral to improved health is an examination of the fundamental services required to achieve and maintain good health. They are: decent housing, reasonable income levels, good diet and clean water, regular exercise, a clean environment and proper drainage, self-esteem and motivation through employment, and access to good health services. </PARA>
<PARA> Without acceptable standards of community infrastructure and services, all the best health services in the world are not going to solve the health crisis for Aboriginal Australians. The working party defines health as:</PARA>
<PARA>Not just the physical well-being of the individual but the social, emotional, and the cultural well-being of the whole community. This is a whole of life view and also includes the cyclical concept of life-deathlife. </PARA>
<PARA>I am probably unique in this House in that I have lived and worked in an Aboriginal community for two years and therefore have first-hand experience of the quality of life and opportunities for advancement available to Queensland Aborigines. I have since visited other communities and experienced similar situations. I have experienced part of the reality of life for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> We in white, urban Australia take for granted a house for one family, decent sewerage, water supply, electricity, bitumen roads, proper drainage and a clean environment. The vast bulk of community Aborigines have none of these essentials. Insufficient supply of housing leads to situations where 17 to 20 people share one two-bedroom house. Dirt roads are the norm, with no storm drainage and septic or outhouse toilet services. Often water supply is intermittent and power an expensive and irregular service. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment is usually 75 to 80 per cent among adult Aboriginal males, leading to problems of alcohol and other substance abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, theft and other criminal activities, and high levels of imprisonment. These are the real nitty-gritty issues of Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA> A substantial and sustained contribution towards provision of basic community infrastructure and a real and genuine attempt to provide long term employment for Aboriginal Australians is needed now from all levels of government. My plea is to both State and Federal governments: treat this issue seriously and urgently. Negotiate in a meaningful way, mindful of the overwhelming evidence of the need and demand for action. Accept the responsibility that adoption of the national Aboriginal health strategy entails and commence this process without delay. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two discrete areas of funding allocations which are required. The first, which covers the bulk of the recommendation of the Joint Ministerial Forum, involves the immediate restructuring and increased provision of direct health services. These do not involve significant additional funding but do require additional contributions from both States and the Commonwealth. Both levels of government need to respect their own responsibilities and be forthcoming with their funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The second discrete area, requiring substantial commitments over the long term, has been described as an `environmental health program' or what I earlier described as community infrastructure and services. It emphasises the true dimension of the problem we must face. It has been estimated that a commitment of some $2.5 billion would be required to adequately address environmental health problems afflicting Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategy requires all levels of government to provide Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities with basic facilities such as housing, water, sewerage, electricity and roads to the level that the wider Australian community takes for granted. The strategy must be a cooperative effort, and I repeat my earlier point that it will need substantial financial commitments by the States and Territories also. The Federal Government must negotiate meaningfully with those governments to establish their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Until this commitment is forthcoming, there can be no solution for the crisis in Aboriginal health. Aboriginal Australians will continue to suffer and our commitment to the achievement of genuine social justice will be meaningless rhetoric for our original Australians. As was stated two weeks ago in Darwin by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner):</PARA>
<PARA>To be born Aboriginal in Australia in 1990 means that you are statistically doomed from the moment of birth to a shortened lifespan, as well as standards of health and quality of life dramatically worse than the rest of the population. </PARA>
<PARA>I urge honourable members to support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I rise to support this motion and commend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for bringing it before the House. The national Aboriginal health strategy was the result of a working group that released its report last year. In June this year I travelled to Brisbane and attended as an unofficial observer a meeting of Commonwealth and State Aboriginal affairs and health Ministers. Out of that meeting came a media release that agreement had been reached on a national Aboriginal health strategy. At the time I put out a press release complimenting the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) for his effort in getting this up and running.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say in all honesty that we do not agree with everything in that report, but it is a milestone and it would be petty and pedantic of me to say anything but that it is the end result of a lot of hard work by some very sincere and talented people. It really is a high water mark in Aboriginal health. At the time of that meeting in Brisbane, the press release put out by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was quite explicit. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>A meeting of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and Health in Brisbane today agreed to implement the broad-based program to address the serious health problems afflicting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities. </PARA>
<PARA>It further states that this health strategy:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will represent the first time the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments and Aboriginal communities have joined forces to develop and target services for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA>I was therefore concerned that whilst we had all this fanfare back in June, what has happened subsequently has not matched the rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> The following are just some of the letters that have come across my desk in the last couple of days. The first is a copy of a letter from the Australian Medical Association to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Three months have passed, however, since the establishment of the NAHS and the Association is concerned that nothing appears to have been done . . .</PARA>
<PARA>A letter from the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation to the Prime Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA>You are aware of the parlous state of Aboriginal health. The facts are too stark to deny. Why then does the Government seek to hide behind past efforts when confronted with a reality that demands a tripling of efforts. </PARA>
<PARA>Just yesterday on CAAMA radio in the Northern Territory, the chairperson of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), Lois O'Donoghue stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has given ATSIC the same funds as last year but has not provided any extra money to pay for things like a National Aboriginal Health Strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>Then at the National Press Club on 12 September, I was very concerned to read the transcript of the speech of the Minister for Community Services and Health. When asked about what had happened to the health strategy, he said, `We are still trying to talk with the States to work out who is going to pay for it'. That is in spite of his press release back in June, which I have in my hand, that says that they decided to implement it and extolling what great things it would do. </PARA>
<PARA> What then is the health strategy? Quite simply it proposes a coordinated approach between State and Federal governments to issues in Aboriginal health, something that is long overdue. It recognises that nothing is going to occur without cooperation. It recognises that great flexibility will be needed, more flexibility than there has been in the past. It appreciates that goal setting is required, that we lack data, that Aboriginal people must be involved, and that in the end there must be monitoring and evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> I support these principles very strongly. Some of the recommendations are as follows: We deliberately recommend strategies which are not prescriptive or limiting but which can be flexible; the targets which have been set are indicative only and there is a real need for baseline data; there should be sentinel health testing; and there should be an office of Aboriginal health responsible for monitoring evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been my very great frustration since having the job of shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs of finding a complete lack of long term data on Aboriginal health which allows us to be at least honest with ourselves as to what we are doing. If this strategy were implemented, it would go some way to address that. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking to the motion, I do not intend to look to the past, save for one thing. It is my very genuine concern that Aboriginal people have been subjected to raised expectations on many occasions in recent years, and these expectations have not been met. I am deeply concerned that on this occasion we have the possibility of raising expectations on an issue as important as Aboriginal health and of once again not having those expectations met. </PARA>
<PARA> I fully understand and accept that in difficult economic times money is very tight and that in the end it may be that more money will not be forthcoming. If that is the situation, the Government must really look at its priorities in Aboriginal affairs because, surely, there can be no greater priority than that of Aboriginal health. If the Government looks to rearrange its priorities to provide measurable, tangible, real benefits in this area of Aboriginal health, it will have the full support of the Opposition parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal health is too important to play party politics with. It is simply intolerable that in a country as wealthy as Australia any group of people should live in such appalling conditions and suffer such appalling health problems as is the case with Australia's Aboriginal people. I should say that I do not believe that government alone will solve this. I do not believe that money alone will solve this. It will take two things: government prepared to take a lead and Aboriginal communities prepared to take some responsibility. In the end, if we are to expect people to take some responsibility, we will have to be prepared to say to them, `You have a stake in it. You have the right to have a say as to what is appropriate for your community and what outcomes are important'. In this sense the health strategy goes a long way. </PARA>
<PARA> I have stated previously that there are three things that I want to see happen in the Aboriginal affairs area. The first is that I want to see some political and intellectual honesty. The second is that I want to see some goal setting with some real and measurable outcomes. The third is that I want to see a bit of patience. This health strategy really gives us some direction on the first two of these points. If we collect data, look at it realistically and try to assess whether what we are doing is making things better, worse or indifferent, we will be going a long way towards being honest with ourselves as to the effect of what we are doing. If we set real, achievable and measurable goals in this area, that will be a first in Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the third issue of patience, quite frankly, it is now up to the Government as to whether it is prepared either to apply additional resources or rearrange its existing priorities to give Aboriginal people a chance to solve some of their health problems. I firmly believe that there is not one solution to this; there are thousands of solutions; there is a different solution in every community. What we need is patience and understanding to allow Aboriginal people to find those solutions. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the working party on a national Aboriginal health strategy makes the critical point that, no matter how sound the strategy or how broadly it is supported in the community, it will fail if there is a lack of political will and commitment on the part of governments. I want to assure those in the working party and all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that this report will not be left to gather dust on my office shelves. I call upon my colleagues in the Parliament and at all levels of government to recognise the need to fund and implement the strategy immediately to bring a halt to the path of disease and early death that so many Aboriginal children have already started out on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not detail the disturbing statistics that led the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) to describe Aboriginal people born in Australia in 1990 as statistically doomed. I will, however, be parochial and describe the health crisis that exists for Aboriginal people in north-west Queensland. In the five years that I spent as a solicitor retained by the West Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service I have travelled to many Aboriginal communities in some of the most remote parts of north-west Queensland. The sad state of Aboriginal health in those communities is all too obvious. There are fundamental problems with the health system's infrastructure that urgently need to be addressed. For example, while the Royal Flying Doctor Service deserves to be commended for the wonderful job it does in providing medical attention to remote Aboriginal communities, the resources of the service are already stretched to the limit and it is impossible for the flying doctors to provide more than a bandaid response to Aboriginal health needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Four children aged seven, five, four and two from Doomadgee, a community of 1,200 people up near the Gulf of Carpentaria, are now in the Mount Isa Base Hospital suffering from meningitis, a potentially fatal disease. The Oxford Textbook of Medicine lists some of the risk factors predisposing people to the development of meningitis. That list is headed by socioeconomic factors. Under this heading the textbook includes poor living conditions and notes that attack rates are highest in the deprived sections of the community. This medical assessment of the risk factors for the spread of meningitis emphasises the urgency of the need to address environmental health issues that have a direct bearing on living conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> An essential component of the national Aboriginal health strategy is the need to transform living conditions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by a massive financial commitment by governments at all levels. This financial commitment must be met. </PARA>
<PARA> Factors that contribute to environmental health, such as access to housing, a regular and clean water supply, functional sewerage, access to electricity and reliable roads, are not taken for granted at Doomadgee. In the past, there seems to have been an attitude at some levels of government that such services in remote communities are a privilege rather than the bare minimum standards of community services to which all Australians elsewhere are entitled. Children in Doomadgee suffer a high rate of gastroenteritis and gastrointestinal parasites. This can be directly related back to the state of sanitation in the Doomadgee community. Because of the nature of the soil, septic systems in the area do not function effectively and need to be regularly pumped out, and there is a wait of some weeks for this to happen. One backyard had a system which was overflowing and had been exposing raw sewage for over eight months. </PARA>
<PARA> A new hospital is currently being built at Doomadgee but the new hospital, like the present one, will not have in-patient beds. This means that the high rate of transfer of patients to Mount Isa and the reliance on the Flying Doctor Service will continue. This means also that all pregnant women in Doomadgee will continue to be separated from their families and subjected to a lonely and frightening childbirth in Mount Isa. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar problems exist on Mornington Island. There is a shortage of water there which means that toilets can be flushed for only six hours a day. It is no wonder that there are sanitation and resulting health problems on the island. The national Aboriginal health strategy identifies sewerage as a priority environmental health issue that must be urgently addressed. Like Doomadgee, Mornington Island also has a population of around 1,200 people. On Mornington Island the shire council runs a beer canteen which is open for a limited period each day. One of the council's major sources of funding for infrastructure such as sewerage and water supply and housing is the profits it makes from the sales at the canteen. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the working party makes the point that Aboriginal people themselves report that they experience interpersonal violence, socially disruptive behaviour, the neglect of family responsibilities and adverse health consequences resulting from their drinking. It is well recognised that a poor diet and the prevalence of other health problems that Aboriginal people suffer from at higher rates than non-Aboriginal people, such as hepatitis B, respiratory disease, diabetes and high blood pressure, exacerbate the detrimental effects of alcohol on health. It is also well recognised that Aboriginals are grossly overrepresented in alcohol related court convictions. It is certainly the case from my experience with the legal service on Mornington Island. </PARA>
<PARA> Knowing then the health problems to which alcohol abuse contributes on Mornington Island, and the urgent need to increase spending on environmental health factors, it is a cruel twist that, as the council cannot collect rates as there is no private ownership of land, one of its major sources of income to fund sewerage, water and other services is the profits from beer sales in the canteen. I hope that, with the support of governments at all levels, the implementation of the national Aboriginal health strategy will bring an end to this most tragic of catch 22 situations. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to alcohol consumption, the report of the working party on a national Aboriginal health strategy makes the very salient point that, having introduced alcohol to Aboriginal people and then having used it as a weapon against them, non-Aboriginal people now blame Aborigines for their poverty, unemployment and other problems, wrongly attributing the cause of all Aboriginal problems to their abuse of alcohol. In view of this, I want to stress that on Mornington Island, poverty, unemployment and health problems would still exist without alcohol consumption. Alcohol exacerbates existing problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The national Aboriginal health strategy addresses all these issues and more and has formulated recommendations to halt the crisis in Aboriginal health. The implementation of these recommendations will cost, and governments at all levels must meet this cost. The adoption of the national Aboriginal health strategy by Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers for Aboriginal affairs and health shows that governments recognise the crisis in Aboriginal health. But, as I said at the beginning of this speech, without the funds to implement the program, that recognition is meaningless. We must act now. We must pay now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; All right-thinking Australians are deeply concerned by the problems of Aboriginal health in Australia today. I am sure that all of them would welcome any constructive attempts to fund solutions; to that extent acknowledgment of the problem and the need to do something finds bipartisanship support here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the great benefits of twentieth century life is that of advanced medical capabilities. It seems to me that, whatever else can be said about past relationships between white and Aboriginal communities in this country, the reality, surely, is that Aboriginal people should have proper access to all the benefits of those modern medical capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of our two cultures that we do have in common is that our forebears enjoyed, if that is the word, vastly lower life and health expectations than we do today. It is truly appalling that, whilst for most of us health standards and the quality and range of medical care available to us have improved almost beyond belief over the time that Australia has been settled by Europeans, many Aboriginal communities simply do not enjoy the same good fortune. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, many have the worst possible of all worlds: the diseases and afflictions common to their traditional lifestyles, with or without the added problems of Western lifestyle induced medical problems, coupled with a lack of Western style levels of health care. </PARA>
<PARA> I am only too conscious of the health problems of many of the Aboriginal people, for example, in my own electorate of Gwydir where there are 6,500 Aboriginal people, or around 6 per cent of the total population of the electorate compared to a national average of 1 1/2 per cent. As with other members in this place-and I am only too willing to acknowledge the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner)-I am keen to see the problems of those people addressed in a meaningful way. It has to be said that our record in this country is truly appal- ling in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it does seem to me that we make two essential mistakes in addressing these needs. The first is that we often make the mistake of believing that simply throwing money at the problem will solve it. The second is that we misdirect much of the money that we spend. </PARA>
<PARA> To look at the first mistake, I would like very briefly, in the time available to me, to make the observation that, despite having expended very large amounts of money on Aboriginal health, we have not made anything like the progress that we ought to have. As has been acknowledged here this morning, every survey of the statistics in that regard makes that quite evident. As one example of this problem, in New South Wales Aboriginal people are 13 times more likely to suffer from heart disease than the rest of the New South Wales population. That alone indicates the nature of the problem and I have chosen that example quite deliberately because heart disease has a great deal to do with lifestyle. The dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet, smoking and a lack of exercise all contribute, and in all likelihood so does the stress resulting from social alienation and a lack of purpose and of an identifiable role in life. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that to address these problems requires much more than simply throwing money into medical services, important though medical services are; this, of course, has been acknowledged here today. Aboriginals need to be encouraged to develop self-esteem and dignity based on a healthy view of themselves as being fully human and fully Australian. They need to identify the linkages involved between self-esteem and a healthy lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA> The white community has changed its attitude dramatically in the last 10 years or so. Fitness and so forth are much more important than they once were; so it must become for the Aboriginal people. Interestingly enough, Charles Perkins said in Armidale the other day that the hand-out mentality amongst Aboriginal people must be broken. To do that it seems to me that we must work harder to create meaningful employment and job opportunities for Aboriginal people. For their part, as Perkins also pointed out, they must seek to remove their welfare dependency and create their own economic goals. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem I mentioned refers to the targeting of the money that is spent. It is vital that the money reaches those in need and that it does so by means and programs which not only achieve the objectives of improving health but also do so in a way which does not encourage the further growth of a handout mentality. Indeed, it should seek to wind back that mentality for that mentality only hinders the development--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak about foreign investment. In the 1960s the debate about foreign investment was clearly defined. Supporters pointed to the addition of capital stock, new technology and skills that permitted Australia to grow at a faster rate than it would have been able to without foreign investment. There have been significant changes since the 1960s. In the 1970s the use of debt financing of investment became popular. Even before international debt became an issue of public awareness, rising debt-equity ratios were exerting significant impact. Foreign investors started borrowing heavily from Australian banks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The demand for international sources of credit then gave rise, in the mid-1970s, to merchant banking as the fastest growing area of the financial sector. The demand for a more integrated capital market arose in this context and, following the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, we saw significant financial deregulation. At the same time in the mid-1980s the Hawke Government liberalised the approval criteria for foreign investment. Then foreign owned companies no longer had to demonstrate that a proposal was of economic benefit to Australia or met certain requirements of Australian equity participation. Since that time it has become increasingly difficult to determine both the extent to which capital is foreign owned and the value of capital entering and leaving Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor is that international investment now takes on diverse forms-from long term investment in ownership of Australian industry to overnight money movements in and out of Australia involving speculative movements on equity, commodity and currency markets. Nor do we currently have an accurate measure of either the extent or nature of foreign investment in Australia. The main sources of data on international capital entering and leaving Australia are the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Foreign Investment Review Board. The ABS concedes that, particularly on the issue of foreign investment in Australian real estate, its data is deficient and there is no clear way of resolving the problem. The Foreign Investment Review Board deals only with investment proposals, not actual investment, and it deals only with investment proposals above a certain value; so its data is thereby of limited use also. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a most substantial gap in the information on which policy is being formulated. Yet in this context the Government has apparently adopted an almost open door policy in respect of foreign investment-a laissez faire approach; or, to quote Dick Bryner, a lecturer in economics at Sydney University, our foreign investment policy resembles `a gate which has no fences beside it'. The questions that I believe must be asked are: what type of foreign investment do we want? What types are in the long term best interests for Australia? How do we develop a policy which will ensure we receive the optimum benefits of foreign investment without an unacceptable loss of national autonomy?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me look briefly at the current rationale for foreign investment. In the early to mid-1980s the Australian economy was lacking growth in local investment, and foreign investment became more desirable to compensate as an engine of economic growth. There was then-and still is, I guess-a general unwillingness or inability of banks and financial institutions to fund economic growth in Australia, the crux of this problem being that Australian saving levels have been, and continue to be, abominable. We have proved incapable of saving as a nation and, of course without savings there cannot be investment. Consequently, we have had to rely more heavily on foreign investment, or the savings of others, to compensate for our own inability to save, and indeed to maintain the lifestyles to which we have become accustomed. But also from the mid-1980s there has been a need to finance Australia's deficit in the current account by means of capital inflow. </PARA>
<PARA> Until 1982 there were strict controls on Australian investment overseas. With the lifting of these controls, of course, there has also been a rapid expansion of Australian international investment, which has seen many Australian companies to some extent breaking their ties with the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have not as a nation been the hapless victim of foreign investment; rather, as a result of Government policy, Australian companies have been almost encouraged to invest money overseas-over $16 billion was invested overseas in 1988-89-while, at the same time, the Government has broadened guidelines for foreigners investing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the financial sector deregulation, borrowing has exceeded foreign equity investment by a ratio of about 3 : 1 and this reflects the general shift towards debt financing and away from equity financing of investment. This heavy reliance on debt financing, aided and abetted to some extent by overenthusiastic foreign and local banks, has been responsible for some of the spectacular corporate crashes that we have witnessed recently. </PARA>
<PARA> In examining the break-up of foreign equity investment in Australia we find that about 60 per cent of it enters the finance, property and business services sector, with less than 20 per cent going to manufacturing and 5 per cent to mining. This appears to reflect a serious imbalance in the great deal of foreign investment in this country which appears to have been speculative by nature. The United Kingdom and the United States of America have been the leading investors in the 1980s, but since 1987-88 United States investment has declined rapidly, while Japanese investment has increased rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in a statement in this House earlier this week, pointed out that Japanese investment in Australia is worth over $36 billion, or about 15 per cent of foreign investment in Australia, and that investment has increased by over 70 per cent since 1986-87. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing to note the Prime Minister's recent misguided accusations of racism whenever one dares to question the role of Japan. If debate on the question of Japanese investment, or indeed the Japanese role in the world, is to be meaningful, the notion of racism must be separated from other evaluative data. Considering the enormous part that Japan now plays in our economy, we should be able to discuss all aspects of the issue without being howled down as racist. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Prime Minister was in Japan he told us that he sought to encourage a more diversified economic relationship with Japan through his talks with Prime Minister Kaifu and to steer investment where it is most needed-in the manufacturing sector. Currently, as the Prime Minister pointed out, some 92 per cent of Japanese investment is in tourism and real estate. Of the total foreign investment in the tourism industry, Japanese investment makes up 66 per cent. This issue must be looked at, and it must be looked at on a regional level, not merely a national level. While 1.4 per cent of Queensland land may not seem like a large amount, the 60 per cent of the Surfers Paradise central business district that is currently owned by Japanese companies has important implications for the people of my electorate and, I believe, the tourism industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister stated, `We do not see ourselves solely as a purveyor of leisure services, nor do we see particular economic advantage in selling real estate'. So we return to the question that I asked earlier of exactly what type of foreign investment we do want in Australia. Certainly there is a need to ensure that the limited resources Australia has are not being misallocated-and perhaps they are if they are diverted from manufacturing to tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> I hasten to add that I strongly support Australia's maintaining a healthy tourism industry. It is an industry in which we have a natural comparative advantage. However, we cannot escape from the reality that the development of a hightech manufacturing base is going to be vital if Australia is to become the so-called clever country. </PARA>
<PARA> Many countries around the world actively encourage foreign investment and even provide fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to ensure it. Thailand, for example, exerts an incredible amount of control over foreign investment, but is still recognised as having an open door policy on foreign investment. The board of investment in Thailand gives special consideration to foreign investment proposals which support resource development, which strengthen the balance of payments through export production, which substantially increase employment, or which conserve energy or replace energy supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking briefly at the effect of foreign investment on the tourism industry, again it becomes glaringly obvious that the data gathered to date has been insufficient at best. It is generally acknowledged that foreign investment generates employment, though there are no exact figures. Whilst I concede that there do appear to be definite short term advantages-assuming, of course, that those who are employed in that way might not otherwise be employed-the question still remains as to whether it has a significant impact in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> Another real concern is the threat posed by vertical integration. Here again, there is conflicting data on the effects, I agree. But the report of the tourism shopping implementation committee warns of the dangers of vertical integration in the retail industry. This is not to say that we should not do all we can to encourage Japanese tourism in Australia; at present we have less than 4 per cent of the total Japanese tourism market. We must, however, be certain that Australia retains the maximum benefits from any foreign investment in any Australian industry. It is not in our interest to have a full-scale sell-off of Australian assets, or to allow another nation to own an industry as important as tourism is to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I believe that we should, as a nation, be regarding foreign investment as a policy tool that can be used to our benefit. </PARA>

<TITLE>Academic Salaries</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Under the Federal Government's rapidly evolving unified national system, Australia's higher education institutions are now laying the foundations for nationwide reconstruction. As part of this reconstruction process, a complete review of academic salaries and employment conditions is about to be considered by the Industrial Relations Commission. Negotiations on this review have been going on for some time, but these negotiations have run into deadlock on some very important issues. As a consequence, serious industrial disruption is now likely by academic staff members of university and college staff associations across the nation. It is, therefore, timely to ask why career and salary prospects in Australia's higher education sector are generating such levels of industrial unrest and why major academic organisations around the country are contemplating industrial action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a steady deterioration in academic salaries from the time of the Campbell Inquiry into Academic Salaries in January 1973. In common with all Australians over the 17-year period since then, academics have accepted the need to contain national expenditure in the face of Australia's economic difficulties. An important question must arise: have academic salaries suffered more than others when set beside those public and private sector categories which have traditionally served by way of comparison and which have traditionally served as competitors for academically trained staff?</PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable members to consider the figures published by the Association of Professional Engineers of Australia for the year to December 1989. Average salary increases in the private sector rose by 10.3 per cent, while public sector engineers' salaries rose by 5.5 per cent. The mean age of private sector engineers was three years lower than for the public sector, and the total remuneration included a motor vehicle in over 40 per cent of private sector contracts compared with 13.3 per cent in public sector contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> These trends are apparent in the recent annual salary surveys conducted by the Royal Australian Chemical Institute. Between 1986 and 1989 the cash salaries paid to chemists employed in the private sector rose by 23.5 per cent, whereas chemists working in universities received only 8.6 per cent over the same period. So, clearly, in these two areas academic salaries are no longer competitive. But it is the comparison between academic salaries and the average weekly ordinary time earnings which most clearly reveals the order of events. Average weekly ordinary time earnings data are compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and are available from 1974 onwards. Over the 15-year period to October 1989, compared with the average weekly ordinary time earnings figure, the maximum senior lecturer's salary, representing the uppermost point of the academic career grade, fell from 2.51 per cent to 1.74 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a corresponding rate of salary decline throughout academic career categories. When one allows for changes in average weekly ordinary time earnings collection methods, and the field of coverage over the period under review, the downgrading of academic salaries represents a loss of about one-third relative to average weekly ordinary time earnings in the 15 years to October 1989. Even selecting only those points of comparison which represent academic salaries in the most favourable light, that is focusing on tutor level salaries and using the most depressed employment categories as comparators, the salary losses are never less than 3 per cent. Under circumstances reflecting the least favourable comparison, that is careers grade salaries against Campbell's 1973 relativities, losses of 40 per cent have been sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> The salary position of academics has declined by comparison with community wages in many parts of the developed world since the rate of growth of public spending on education levelled off in the mid-1970s. Relative shifts between countries are nonetheless important because of the international competitiveness which characterises the academic labour force. </PARA>
<PARA> I contrast current salaries in four countries-Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United States. The United States clearly emerges ahead of all other countries, particularly at the professorial level where Australian salaries have become seriously uncompetitive. But the more relative long term comparison deals with price-salary relativities. For the United Kingdom the career grade salary by 1988 was just 6.3 per cent short of its 1972 peak. This is in marked contrast to Australia where salary levels in 1989 were the lowest for 20 years and by June of that year they had fallen 26.9 per cent below the peak which they had reached in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand salaries also peaked at the start of 1973 and by 1989 the maximum career grade salary was 12 per cent below its 1973 level, less than half the decline at the same growth for Australia. Between 1970 and 1989 Australian salaries declined by 26.9 per cent while corresponding figures for the United Kingdom and New Zealand are 9.6 per cent and 12 per cent respectively. Expressed in terms of purchasing power between 1973 and 1989 Australian academic salaries lost 19.1 per cent relative to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> The comparison between Australia and the United States is of special interest because the United States does not have a centrally regulated system. Academic salaries in the United States were thus more vulnerable during the economic stagnation of the late 1970s, but losses over the decade to 1981 largely recovered by 1988-89, to the point where Australia's position relative to the United States deteriorated by more than 22 per cent in the eight-year period from 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be all too evident from these comparisons that academic salaries in Australia reached a critically low level compared with our competitors in the rest of the English speaking world by the time award restructuring principles were introduced in 1989. The current negotiations on academic award restructuring may thus be seen as crucial to restoring genuine international competitiveness to the higher education domain. It is naive to imagine that academics who work at an international level will remain in Australia when jobs in other countries offer the same opportunities for research and scholarship but much better living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> By far the most damaging feature of these statistics is their staffing impact projected into the 1990s. Estimates of the demand of our university system throughout the remaining years of the present century yield the alarming prospect that by 1994 the cumulative shortfall of academic staff will have reached 10,300. Current indications are that the most severe shortages will be felt in the humanities whereas the Times higher education supplement of 19 January 1990 pointed out that the market will demand nearly double the number of PhDs now in the 12-year pipeline. Bearing in mind that parallel staff shortages are predicted in the United States, Australia's capacity simply to retain its existing staff is already under intense pressure as a consequence of salary disparities. </PARA>
<PARA> On the evidence provided by the Department of Employment, Education and Training it will be reasonable to expect that more than half the 5,000 currently tenured career grade staff will have retired or resigned by the year 2000. Honourable members on both sides of this House will undoubtedly agree that the opportunity now presents itself to restore public recognition to the research scholars and academic teachers in our new university system. The steady erosion of their career prospects and their loss of wage parity in terms of their traditional counterparts in the senior Public Service and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation must be rectified. Australia cannot be allowed to slide into the contradictory and self-defeating position whereby it espouses cleverness as a component of high level public policy, but at the same time supports employment conditions for academics which do violence to their career hopes and which impose a salary system that debases the academic labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> I have full confidence in the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) ensuring that justice is done to academic salary levels in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, my grievance today is with this Federal Government for its unholy, illogical and unconscionable alliance with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). It is clear that because of ACTU control over government policy we have in this country not a freely elected democratic government but rather a monopolistic alliance which in essence amounts to a dictatorship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recent events in eastern Europe have made it clear to the world that Marxist and Leninist theory-while pure as a philosophical doctrine-has always been fatally flawed in practice. East Germany should be as good an example as exists of the practical real world effects of a philosophy so eloquently put by the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) in this House several weeks ago when she said, `From each according to their ability; to each according to their need'. </PARA>
<PARA> East Germany with its political will and its excellence in international sport presented to an uninquiring world a public face demonstrating the success of communism. Now that the Wall has gone the world has the opportunity to examine the real results of a political and social leadership divorced and isolated from the scrutiny of its people. We find East Germany in reality substantially different from the public face presented over the last several decades. East Germany is an ecological, social and economic nightmare. West Germany and Western society in general will suffer for many years, if not decades, to make up for over 40 years of incompetence because of a system of leadership which was not under the control of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The point, Mr Deputy Speaker, which needs to be made and which I put most strongly is that while an unelected, unrepresented body-the ACTU-holds control of government agenda in Australia this Government cannot of its own free will develop, market and implement policy for which it has a mandate or which it believes is necessary for the well-being of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent debate within the Australian Labor Party regarding reform in the telecommunications industry is a graphic case in point. Clearly the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) believes that competition for Telecom Australia should produce positive results for the community. From the position supported by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), it is clear that he too supports the view of the positive benefits of competition. But the Minister for Transport and Communications chose to run with the policy option which he clearly knows was third best but was all that he could achieve, given union control of Labor Party policy setting mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Parliament those on the Government benches frequently refer to a wages policy and our print and electronic media carry that terminology and that issue in their dissemination of public debate. For crying out loud, this must be the only major industrialised nation in the free democratic world that talks about a wages policy in the context of a national agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> My question to this House, to the media and to the people of this country is: what in the hell is a wages policy and why on earth do we need one? In a free economy a wage is but one of many input costs to industry, commerce or business. I have never heard or seen anyone advocate mechanisms of control of the input costs of materials or supplies to industry, but the press gallery regularly refers to a wages policy or a lack thereof as if it were the beginning and the end of the economic debate in so far as industry and commerce in our nation are concerned. I believe that our journalists and television commentators have a great deal to answer for in their continuing discussion of the need for a policy with respect to wages. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, wages and conditions of employment are very simply input costs of business which are to be negotiated in the same manner that business negotiates all the rest of its input costs such as materials, services and specific overheads. But the media continues to promote an agenda which is set by the Australian Council of Trade Unions through this Labor Government to the detriment of our national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> A free economy, in a democratic society, can no more operate with a fixed wages policy than it can with a fixed prices policy. Time and again we hear those on the left of the political debate call for price fixing. The average citizen in mainstream metropolitan Australia knows that it is impossible to control prices without the risk of sending employers broke. Why, I ask, do we have this obsession about national control of wages and conditions of employment which acts only to upset the free market mechanism, stifle innovation and growth, lower the wages and conditions of the most productive and force many employees to lose their jobs in times of economic downturn?</PARA>
<PARA> Within the trade union organisations in our country there are a few thinking individuals who know that the best deal for workers lies with their ability to work with management, to achieve excellence in outcomes which means profit that can be shared between the workers and the enterprise. Ask any union shop steward who has seen his company go to the wall because he is not allowed by the union hierarchy to discuss with management reducing employee conditions or wages in times of economic hardship what he thinks about all of his members losing their jobs. He will join with me in telling honourable members that it is long past time for an end to national wage fixing and ACTU meddling in government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> All of our political commentators and economic commentators, even Alan Wood, talk about minimum pay rises. No one ever talks about reductions. No union is today offering release of conditions for pay increases. No union is talking to management about pay rate reductions for those companies that are in trouble. Ask any sample of workers whether they would rather lose their jobs and go on unemployment benefit or retain their jobs having lost their rostered day off, and I will bet that over 90 per cent will vote in favour of their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The point should be made that many factors go together to contribute to business outcomes. If we take the situation in the agricultural industry as an example, I note that farmers are unable to demand of the world the price they need for wheat or the price they need for wool in order to make their operations viable because the world refuses to pay. Wages are no different from wheat or wool and what the market can afford to pay is what it can afford to pay. If the cost of producing wool is greater than the price the market will pay, producers will cease producing. If the cost of labour is higher than the market can afford, the market will cease requiring labour. If we accept that argument, it becomes obvious that any national wages policy as either a social, economic or political objective is arrant nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government needs to get its act together. It should get out of the business of controlling business inputs and sever its partnership with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and allow this country to get on with the job that it must do in developing business, commerce and production in a positive and profitable manner for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>

<TITLE>Creative Writers</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NT4">Dr CATLEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Adelaide)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.59)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to some of the problems faced by creative writers in our society, particularly outside Sydney and Melbourne, and to offer some suggestions as to how a government can make some improvements in the literature industry. We heard in Parliament on Tuesday several speeches extolling the undoubted virtues of a great Australian writer, Patrick White. Last night in the adjournment debate I spoke about some of Adelaide's most successful novelists, poets and short story writers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There will be some other consequential writers of this time, other than Patrick White. They will be remembered long after most of us in this House are forgotten, with the exception of your good self and possibly the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his successor. We need to look at how we can ensure that such notable writers are maintained and how the development of our national literature, which has progressed so successfully, can be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very proud that we have allocated $72m to the arts in the portfolio allocation in the Budget. But we must remember that writers, particularly if we take it in hourly terms, are probably among the most poorly paid people in our society. Writers these days, as I have good cause to know, spend hour after hour sitting at a personal computer screen trying to work out what they are going to write. They might slave for three or four years full time on a novel that will earn them possibly a great deal of respect if they are successful, but is unlikely to earn more than $3,000 or $4,000 in terms of royalties unless they are lucky enough to land a film contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The physical book, the production of the book itself, is a very cheap process, but it sells for a high price from which the writer receives usually about 12 per cent in terms of royalties out of which his or her agent would usually take about 10 per cent. The bookseller in fact will receive between three and five times as much as the writer of the book, essentially for putting the book on display. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole industry of publishers, promoters, agents, booksellers and others who are living off the creative activity of writers who appear to be, despite the brain input of the clever people of the creative literature industry, the least well paid. Apart from the pittance of royalties, how do talented writers, particularly those in the seat of Adelaide who I know better than elsewhere in the country, buy the time to write, which is essentially the question we have to ask about the industry?</PARA>
<PARA> A few of them are able to get grants from the Literature Board and from the State Department of Arts, and in other States I believe the same situation obtains. These are usually low level, one-off, non-renewable awards. The difficulty for non-Melbourne and non-Sydney writers is intensified by the fact that they find it hard to get even these awards and certainly national awards because they find it difficult to get reviewed in national papers and thereby brought to the attention of the national literature industry. It is widely felt outside the two major metropolitan areas that writers are severely under-represented in terms of literature board grants. If they do not get a grant they are in great difficulty buying the time in order to produce their literary output. The category A grants which I have checked out are seemingly substantial-it is about half a backbencher's pay, $29,000 a year-but by the time we take tax out of it, allow for the fact that they have got to leave another job in order to take up the grant for a year and then try to find another job if they are unsuccessful at the end of it, they are in serious financial difficulties in maintaining their output. </PARA>
<PARA> Now a third source of income, apart from royalties which are low and the grants which are also low and fairly rare, is the public lending rights. We have allocated $3.5m in the Budget as part of the maintenance of writers through this mechanism, and I will say something about it in a minute. So if the situation is less than financially rosy for creative writers, what can we do about it? I have jotted down a few suggestions, and if you will bear with me, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will lay them out for you. </PARA>
<PARA> I think in terms of royalties we might look at greater tax concessions for the royalties, which are so low for most writers, particularly quality writers who produce literature in small runs. It is okay to tax at the normal rate of income the blockbuster sellers, and they can well afford it. But I think we might have another look at the way in which we tax royalties for quality literature output and see whether we can give these writers some better write-off since most of them seem to be spending most of their royalty money buying and upgrading their word processors. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a number of suggestions to make about the Literature Board. The category B fellowships provide for a reasonable standard of living and we might look to see whether the Literature Board can ensure that more of the money is delivered directly to the writers, since in the case of category B awards we are talking about writers who have published several books that have been reviewed favourably; we are not talking about pillow poets and cafe poseurs. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of the grants might also be made more flexible so that people do not have to quit their jobs totally in order to take them up; they might be on a half time grant, half time job since some jobs would allow for them to sit at a word processor for, say, four or five hours a day and maintain some sort of output. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue for the Literature Board which is particularly acute outside the Sydney-Melbourne axis is the feeling that writers, because they cannot get in on the social circuit and the friendship basis, do not get their fair share of awards. It might also consider giving special promotion grants for writers geographically remote from the two major metropolitan areas and inaccessible to the major barons of the newspaper literature review boards. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned public lending rights as a maintenance scheme for authors. I have been a recipient of public lending rights income for some time myself and I can assure you it is at a very low level-not even sufficient to pay for a decent restaurant dinner for myself and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who spoke earlier on so warmly about the need to improve the salaries of academics-my previous profession. </PARA>
<PARA> The public lending rights scheme appears to apply only to best sellers, and for small output literature of a quality kind it does not provide much of an income. In addition, it is not universally applicable. For instance, it is not applicable for schools, and not all institutions that lend books, in fact, have to pay royalties for the authors. </PARA>
<PARA> A further point I might raise and one that is of particular concern to creative writers is the libel laws in this country, which they regard as being excessively draconian and which have led to the pulping of books and the destruction of the livelihood thereby of the people who produced them. They claim, and it seems by observation to be true so far as I can see, that the cartoonist can actually draw things in the national daily media about local events concerning politicians and other people of significance which, if a writer were to write about, would be subject to libel. </PARA>
<PARA> A further matter I suggest is the establishment of a national writers' centre. We have one in South Australia and it is proposed that such centres be established in other States. New South Wales and Queensland are apparently looking at this issue. I believe that the establishment of a national writers' centre which would not be very expensive could provide the same kind of interchange that is provided for coaching in the sports and would concentrate creative writers together in one place where they can have access to suitable library facilities and discussion groups on the basis of the exchange of ideas about the way in which our national literature might develop. In North America, the Yaddo retreat at Saratoga Springs in New York State might provide a model for such a facility. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is some feeling among local creative writers that they are being upmarketed by the alien spongers who come in and suck up the small amount of loose change that is available for buying creative books in Australia. As a result of the international blockbusters that are written to a formula and successfully marketed at major outlets, among them airport terminals, the small amount of money which is available for the purchase of books is diverted into international royalties and the pockets of already fairly wealthy international writers. The local writers would like to see some kind of protection facilities available for our national literature in the same way as was made available during the 1970s and 1980s for our national film industry, which has flourished as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have tried to present some ideas as to how we can maintain the flourishing national literature that we have had and which culminated so recently in Patrick White. We have a national literature which we should be proud of; let us keep it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, in this debate I would grieve for the further onset of the Keating recession-this Australian home grown recession-as evidenced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force figures released this morning. The total of employed persons seasonally adjusted actually fell for the second month in succession but, more importantly, the number of people unemployed-the recorded number, that is-rose to upwards of 630,000 persons, which is an increase of more than 142,000 since October last, seasonally adjusted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the recorded unemployment. As we heard in expert comment in the media yesterday, in two-job families very often when one spouse loses a job it is frequently not recorded with the unemployment agency. Further, among young people, 15- to 19-year-olds, the percentage unemployed-those looking for full time work-was nearly 21 per cent, a daunting and damaging prospect for the youth of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The position now is that high and rising unemployment is adding yet another dimension to this Hawke Government's failure in economic management, along with the vast current account deficit and burgeoning overseas debt, which is the overriding challenge facing this nation, the persistent high inflation and continuing high interest rates, the abysmal productivity growth, reduced living standards and the increasing rate of bankruptcies and business liquidations. My grievance is that this Government acts or affects to act as if there is no recession and further as if the current account deficit and vast debt overhang were not a problem-or not too bad at any rate. </PARA>
<PARA> We are presently in the House winding up the Budget debate and I would remind the House that there is only one, just one, reference to the overseas debt in the entire Budget Speech. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), true, had stronger things to say to the Collingwood Football Club on the Friday following the Budget of the preceding Tuesday. Perhaps the Collingwood Football Club win might encourage him to show a bit more leadership, to tell it how it is, to let the Australian public know of the magnitude of our economic problem, of the awful arithmetic of the overseas debt, as it has been put, and to give Australians a clearer focus on the nature of the problem and what has to be done, the changes that have to be effected, if this country is to avoid the downward slide to banana republic status that the Treasurer has referred to in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Does the Treasurer, does the Government, appreciate that the farm sector is on course for upwards of a 60 per cent reduction in the net value of farm production over the current two years and all the social and economic tragedy in rural and regional Australia that that will entail? The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in replying to the Budget, said that the Government should get out and talk to the Australian people. He said that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer should:</PARA>
<PARA> Get away from their Treasury Boffins, who have got their economic forecasts so wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Get out and talk to some of the 100,000 people-</PARA>
<PARA>that was at Budget time; as I have just said, it is over 140,000 now-</PARA>
<PARA>who have lost their jobs since last October, or the thousands and thousands more who are about to lose them. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Walk up and down any street in any city, suburb or town-</PARA>
<PARA>certainly in my area of Hornsby-</PARA>
<PARA>and count the empty shops, the ``for sale'' signs, the auction columns or the growing dole queues. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of this, the home grown Keating recession, there is yet still a very real risk of world recession, Gulf crisis and all. The consequences of world recession on top of the domestic recession could be devastating. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Opposition matter of public importance yesterday argued, it is urgent that the Government change the stance of policy and in particular put in place a package that will allow a significant further cut in interest rates. The Treasurer comes back and says, `You are soft on inflation'. The coalition is not soft on inflation; it is the Government that has been and still is soft on inflation. But the argument is a strong one that the sort of inflationary pressures that monetary policy-these still high and destructive interest rates-can address have well and truly abated for the time being. I quote the very straightforward jargon-free language of Nick Greiner, the New South Wales Premier:</PARA>
<PARA> A year or so ago the banks were lending money to anybody, anytime for anything and now-</PARA>
<PARA>this was about June or July last-</PARA>
<PARA>they are not lending to anyone, anytime for anything. </PARA>
<PARA>In the jargon, in the wake of the open slather of 1987-88 into 1989 the banks' propensity to lend is not strong. So let us have a significant cut in interest rates but at the same time, and I underscore this as strongly as I can, let us have, firstly, a tighter fiscal policy; the Government cannot deny that it fudged on the surplus and it should not suggest that further cuts in government spending are not possible. There is virtually unanimous opinion among informed observers that there has been a loosening, not a tightening, of fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government needs to renegotiate, to put it in this Government's own corporatist terms, the accord mark VI, the election driven arrangement with the unions, the deal with Bill Kelty and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, endorsed without question in the current Budget. It needs to scrap the move to 20 mega-unions and, under whatever guise, `award restructuring' or whatever you might call it, encourage some genuine enterprise bargaining so that wage increases are linked to improved productivity and performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The recession is upon us inexorably, but for goodness sake let us benefit from it and get some genuine change. I refer to the abandonment of absurd work practices on the waterfront and in workplaces all over the country, and to making the best use of what genuine new productive investment there has been-not nearly as much as the bald figures the Treasurer often quotes would indicate-and thereby achieve a sorely needed lift in productivity on both accounts. It is the wage cost outcome, a function of money wage increases and the increase in productivity, that is going to put to put the floor-too high a floor, unless there is radical change-under inflation in the foreseeable future, and that is where the action is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> So, let us keep the money supply taut, which is compatible at this time with lower interest rates, but in the context of a tighter fiscal policy and a jettisoned accord mark VI, and start on some real action in the micro reform area. In that context let us have a significant cut in interest rates as a matter of urgency. Hopefully, in addition to its direct mitigating effects, this will set the scene for a more competitive exchange rate, a lower value of the Australian dollar, when the current petro or energy related pressures subside. </PARA>
<PARA> The informed economic judgment that I respect is looking for a fall in the Australian dollar of at least the order of 10 to 20 per cent. If that sounds like trying to unduly massage the `free' market, well, take note that even Mrs Thatcher last weekend ended the floating of the pound sterling. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the program I have outlined will not only address the Keating recession but also the longer term overriding economic challenge of this country, the vast current account deficit and the burgeoning foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> As the recession takes hold, the people out there undoubtedly want something as a basis of hope for the future. I would say to the Treasurer and the Government to tell it as it is. That is, that it requires a four to five to six year stint for this country to work its way out of the present deficit and debt situation, and that is even just to the point of stabilising the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> What the country has to do is effect a transfer of some 3 to 4 percentage points of total production into net exports. That is the only way we can pay the interest on the debt without borrowing to pay it, which we are doing now-the only way to pick up the tab for the profligate borrowing and living beyond our means of the past few years. What should be made clear is that if everyone pulls their weight, management lifts its game and employees give up stupid and archaic work practices, black bans, go-slows and stop-works, everybody and the whole nation will be better off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the debate today I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this week has been chosen to mark a most important but greatly underestimated disease which afflicts more than one million Australians, and that disease is asthma. In the context of this disease I would also like to make a special mention of two separate items each of which could in its own way be contributing to the apparently inexplicable increase of asthma in the population of both Australia and New Zealand. The two items are: food colourings and additives and smoking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One matter which continues to amaze asthma experts is that the disease is taken so much for granted by sufferers, their relatives and their medical practitioners. This unwillingness to accept the serious potential of the disease actually costs lives and it frequently arises from a lack of understanding at all levels of society of the cause, the effect and the possibilities for prevention. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, with proper treatment of preventative and spasm relieving medication, asthma can be greatly controlled. As an asthmatic myself, I am most grateful for the somewhat belated expert treatment I received after being elected to Parliament. However, I must confess that the only reason I sought specific help was that I did not want the disease to affect my work as a parliamentarian representing my electorate and in fulfilling my most other essential and complementary role of wife and mother. </PARA>
<PARA> With hindsight, I am amazed at the number of times that appropriate treatment was denied me, starting from very early childhood when my asthma was treated as bronchitis, right through to my thirties when I was forced to go to hospital in the middle of the night, as are so many other asthmatic Australians, to receive medical attention. At no time, however, did anybody offer me a comprehensive course of preventative treatment, despite the fact that I was being treated in emergency care. In fact, had I not actively sought assistance and advice at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Western Australia in 1985 I would by now quite likely be unable to continue in my job. Worse still, like so many other asthmatics who underestimate this disease, I would be risking death by working on the basis of crisis management only. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important message that the National Asthma Awareness Week is putting forward is that one cannot be too careful with this disease and that good diet and regular exercise are beneficial additions to a properly planned course of treatment. However, very little is known about the cause of asthma and I would also like to proffer an opinion in this area which may or may not be subsequently borne out by research. Not surprisingly, my opinion involves the points I mentioned earlier, that is, smoking, artificial food colourings and additives and another factor which I shall bring in at a later time. Along with other irritants such as grains, of which we have plenty in the Australian atmosphere, and dust mite, which also thrives here, I believe that a number of food colourings and additives or preservatives can act as potent triggers for asthma spasms of existing sufferers. But I do not believe that they are in themselves the cause of the disease. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable members to an article in the Australian this week which talks about this aspect of asthma and says, `Asthmatics may have too much on plate'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>A consultant respiratory physician and allergist at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Dr Kwok Yan, said probably fewer than 5 per cent of Australian asthmatics needed to concern themselves with what they ate. </PARA>
<PARA> But when that 5 per cent means between 150,000 and 250,000 people, it is a concern worth examining, particularly at the start of National Asthma Awareness Week. </PARA>
<PARA> Associate Professor Paul Seale of the school of clinical pharmacology at the University of Sydney said despite the term, food allergy was unlikely to contain any elements of a true allergy. </PARA>
<PARA> He also said the response of the lungs to food might be a direct response of the airways to chemicals in the food, rather than an allergic response. </PARA>
<PARA>Believe me, this is all academic when people are having breathing problems. But it is still important, because once they are over the breathing problem they have to think about what might have caused it. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Doctor Yan said food did not cause asthma but it could aggravate a pre-existing condition. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Peter Gibson, a chest physician at the Royal Newcastle Hospital, said there had been a recent change of thinking regarding asthma. Previously, it was assumed to be a disease where the smooth muscles surrounding the airways of the lung contracted: now it was thought that inflammation of the airways was at least as important. </PARA>
<PARA>The article listed a number of foods that can provoke asthma. Some of these are nuts, seafood, eggs and dairy products. Most problems come from the chemical additives. These include the flavour enhancer MSG, and the preservatives metabisulphite, benzoate and tartrazine. As the article says:</PARA>
<PARA>Ironically these are also used as preservatives in aminophylline, Berotec nebuliser solution and Alupent syrup and nebuliser solution-all drugs used to treat asthma. </PARA>
<PARA>So people could actually be making themselves ill on some occasions when they think they are making themselves better. I find that a particularly interesting article because obviously many asthmatics are very much affected by food additives and food colourings. I think, particularly as metabisulphite is so common in the Australian diet, that many asthmatics have spasms without realising that that in fact is the cause. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested that the article from which I just quoted did not refer to smoking as a possible asthma trigger. I cannot overlook the common cigarette as it did. So often when one is eating it is associated with the plate in some way; it may not be your plate, it might be somebody else's. As people are pointing out more and more frequently, the passive smoking syndrome is almost worse than the actual smoking itself because the chemicals are burning at a higher degree when the person is consuming the smoke directly; the person to the side of the smoke is getting it at a much lower level, with the chemicals possibly more prevalent. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that anecdotal, if not empirical, evidence points to the fact that a pregnant woman who smokes during pregnancy may well be predisposing her unborn baby to asthma in childhood or later life. It is a terrible thing to be in this position and trying to blame the woman-it always seems to be the woman who gets the blame. Unfortunately, it seems that the experts are now thinking more and more that not only are babies subject to a lower weight at birth if their mother has been smoking but also they may well be potential asthma sufferers in later life. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no positive proof, of course, that this is the case but the evidence suggests that women would be well advised to give up smoking during pregnancy and, given the dangers of passive smoking to the infant, they should endeavour not to smoke in the vicinity of the baby during its early growth stages if they want to smoke after the baby is born. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this is very important because so many women want to have a reason to give up smoking anyway. Often they have taken it up in their earlier life and want to give it up but they have no really substantive reason to do so. I think that if they had any suggestion that their baby may be suffering as a consequence of their smoking they would give it up even if it was only for the period of their pregnancy. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of my theory that I wanted to bring forward is that the propensity not to breast feed the infant actually exacerbates any predilection towards asthma which the baby may have as a consequence of either parent smoking or because of other genetically related factors. It seems to me that a mother who may have asthma herself would be well advised in the absence of evidence to the contrary not to smoke during pregnancy, even if she is silly enough to do so at other times, not to smoke near the growing infant, and to take the time to breast feed her baby. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be very interested to know how many asthmatic mums have tried this plan and what the outcome was for their children. I would suggest that in the event that research is being undertaken, which, of course, some is at the moment and more is being pushed for, there ought to be some look at the correlation between, firstly, smoking and asthma in children and, secondly, the capacity for breast feeding to assist the infant overcome any difficulties it might have been having as a consequence of either asthma in the genes or asthma through smoking and the mother. </PARA>
<PARA> For my own case, I am very grateful to say that neither of my children has asthma and I hope that others may have a similarly fortunate story to tell. It is an avenue for future research and one which I think has long been neglected. There was a person on the Four Corners program who was unkind enough to say that if asthma had been a disease which afflicted 40-to 50-year-old males, particularly politicians, more research may have gone into it. I do not believe that is the case. In fact, there are quite a number of male politicians in this place who suffer from asthma. Nevertheless, it is a neglected disease and we ought to be doing more about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In a so-called liberated position of women smoking and not breast feeding their babies I would suggest these are pseudo-symbols of liberation only and that women should be encouraged to look after their own health and their baby's health by not smoking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Seemingly in every Budget there are some harsh measures and in these tough times it is perhaps not surprising that there was a need for some difficult measure in this year's Budget. However, the announcements in relation to assets tests for family allowance, family allowance supplements, Austudy and the isolated children's allowance are draconian. They are grossly unjust and they are discriminatory against asset owners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to appeal in this grievance debate to the Government, if it has any sense of justice at all, to reconsider those decisions and to put in place a system that is fair for all. In these tough times it may be that Australia can no longer afford to pay family allowance to wealthy families. However, in this Budget the Government was able to devote considerable additional resources to child-care and provide a large number of additional child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess I would prefer to emphasise policies which encouraged children to stay in the family. In my view a dollar spent on family allowance is a better investment than a dollar spent on child-care. Child-care centres seem to have to pick up the debris from families broken often by economic circumstances and difficult economic times. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the assets test on family allowance and the family allowance supplement is the inequity between the assets test and the income test. Earning capacity of assets seems to have been completely ignored. The assets test for family allowance has been set at $300,000, yet a wage earner can continue to receive the full family allowance if he earns $57,620, and even more if he has more than one child. The relationship between the earning limit and the assets test has become grossly distorted. A business with $300,000 worth of assets would need to earn something like 19 per cent on the investment before the income test would be triggered. Now in Paul Keating's Australia, there are very few, if any, businesses that have the capacity to return anything like 19 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation on Australian farms is considerably worse. The Government's own Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics (ABARE) estimated last year that the return on farm investment averaged only 1.1 per cent, and that included capital gain. This year farmers terms of trade, according to ABARE, are to be down by over 50 per cent. The average return, therefore, on a farm asset of $300,000 in 1991 is likely to be less than $2,000-less than $40 a week. Farmers, on average earning $2,000 or less a year, are considered to be too rich to receive the family allowance, and yet a salary earner on $57,620 or more can still receive the full allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> A farmer on his knees at the bank manager's table, after years of negative income, pleading for cash to carry on, will be denied the family allowance, while the bank manager on the other side of the table will continue to receive it. Many doctors, lawyers, senior public servants and university academics will continue to receive the family allowance, but farmers and businessmen will be denied it. Even members of this House will probably remain eligible to receive the family allowance but destitute farmers will be denied it. </PARA>
<PARA> On the ABARE estimates, a farm would need to be worth $5.5m before it is likely to return sufficient to trigger the income test, and on this year's projected farm incomes the figure is likely to be nearer $10m. Clearly, there is a gross injustice in the figures that have been set. What is more, the income test increases with every child while the assets test is absolute on the figure of $300,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Many debt stricken farmers whose assets have not yet eroded below $200,000 will not even get the family allowance supplement. The $200,000 assets test which has been put in place means that farm families, which on average are earning only $1,500 a year, will be denied the family allowance supplement. And that penalty has become more significant with the Government's decision to attach health card entitlements to the family allowance supplements. </PARA>
<PARA> It is bad enough that this Government chooses to beat farmers and small business with its economic policies, ruinous as they are to those sectors of our community trying to provide productivity for our nation. Now the Government is turning its anger on families and farm children, and they are to be denied the basic necessities. Already rural children are significantly disadvantaged in education, health services, cultural experience and future employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said that by 1990 no child should live in poverty. That was clearly an empty, cruel farce. He was no doubt involved in the drafting of this infamous Budget provision which condemned many more children to a life of poverty. The Budget offers city children considerably more opportunities to find a place in child-care centres. Generous fee relief provisions are available. In fact, families earning over $60,000 are entitled to some fee relief in child-care centres. There is no assets test applied, and wealthy families can still obtain child-care fee relief. Most country children, of course, will not get that opportunity because none of the new child-care centres are likely to be provided in country towns or on the Australian farms. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, these days 42 per cent of tertiary students, according to the Budget figures, receive Austudy. The asset drop from $322,000 to $200,000 will affect many country students. Many members of parliament have already been approached by farm families telling sad stories of their children having to leave university next year because the assets test will prevent them from receiving Austudy. Even with the 50 per cent concession, many farm families are earning significantly less than the total Austudy allowance let alone being able to provide for their children living in a far away city. </PARA>
<PARA> Is tertiary education to be available only to those who live in the city, or only to the children of non-business owning families? Clearly there is a need for us to look closely at the Austudy arrangements and to recognise that there is an inequality that needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note as well that Abstudy has no assets test. Yet Austudy now has a stringent assets test which will deny accessibility to many gifted children and ensure that farm families in particular are disadvantaged by comparison with other Australians. The assets test is iniquitous and it should go. If the Government must have an assets test to satisfy its left wing, the least it can do is balance it against the capacity for assets to earn. There needs to be a restoration of the Austudy limits, and let us index them as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar figures should apply to the family allowance supplements. The family allowance, if it needs to be assets tested, should be equivalent to income test and the real earning potential of such assets. Of course, the 50 per cent concession that applies to business and farms at the present time should be retained. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that many members of the Government are also concerned about this level of inequity. Australian Associated Press reported on 9 October that the caucus primary industry and resources committee had admitted that there was an anomaly at a meeting with Mr Farley of the National Farmers Federation and promised, in fact, to take the matter up with Federal Cabinet. I commend that decision if that report is accurate. Unfortunately, the Caucus primary industry committee has not been very successful in the past in taking up issues on behalf of the rural sector. It has been more of a public relations gimmick designed to pretend that there was some kind of interest in the rural sector. In this instance, if it is prepared to take up this issue, its cause is just and it is one that the Cabinet and the Government ought to recognise. There is clearly an urgent need for this inequitable situation to be addressed and to be reconsidered by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation, Mr Deputy Speaker, where a system of assets testing has been put in place which grossly discriminates against a significant sector of the community. The income tests are reasonably generous in relation to many of these matters. I appeal to the Government to look again at its assets test provisions and if it must have an assets test, let us be sure that it is fair, just and equitable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I refer to two well documented facts. One: every day in this socalled progressive world of ours 40,000 children die of preventable causes. Two: two million Australians make at least one donation each to an aid agency every year. In this chamber there would not be one person not concerned about the pain and grief, the despair surrounding deaths which could have been prevented if food or medication or care had been available. I believe this concern reflects the response of the millions of Australians whom we represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australians do care, yet when faced with the immense implications of a world which has lost its way to the extent that the enormous personal tragedy which the loss of a child is has become another statistic in another report on the state of humankind, many who would grieve over such a tragedy may be paralysed over the enormity of the problem. What can we do?</PARA>
<PARA> It is against this background that I wish to commend the Community Aid Abroad (CAA) project of Work Against Want to those honourable members and listeners who have not yet heard of this project to alleviate the trauma suffered by too large a percentage of our global neighbours. There may be some people who are concerned about some aid on the basis of fears that the money may not get past corrupt governments; that direct food aid may hinder the recipient's self-sufficiency. But in recent years the holes in the fabric of aid giving have been virtually closed so that a variety of avenues-government and non-government-are used to channel funds directly to the area of need. </PARA>
<PARA> While direct cash or food grants are necessary to prevent imminent death by starvation, a range of programs based on transfer of Australian technology, skills training and provision of implements all designed to encourage self-sufficiency are the order of the day. For instance, in the dry season in Thailand finding drinking water is a real problem for fisherfolk in the south-west islands. A Community Aid Abroad project will help these people to improve drinking water storage, so preventing needless infections and digestive problems. As well, improved fishing techniques will help to increase incomes and nutrition. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, it is to fund such programs that CAA has conceived an idea which will enable people who, while they may have their own personal struggles, wish to be involved in an efficiently planned effort by a highly respected organisation to relieve the almost 900 million people-approximately one-sixth of humankind-for whom the question of the day is live or die. Will the parents survive to protect the family or will the mother become one of the half-million women who, according to the latest United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund report, die of maternal causes every year because of lack of health care or lack of drugs or lack of food, leaving behind over one million motherless children?</PARA>
<PARA> The Community Aid Abroad program of Work Against Want asks concerned people to donate one day's pay to help the poorest of the poor to help themselves, to attack the causes of poverty and to work toward permanent change. It is up to individuals to decide the extent to which they contribute. I am aware that while a larger wage means a larger contribution, the sacrifice of a day's wage will be more to people on lower incomes and impossible to some, yet last year 3,975 Australians responded to Work Against Want, raising $355,000. From this, CAA was able to supply seeds and tools for about 2,000 farmers in Mozambique. Despite the deteriorating security situation, project partners in that stricken land managed to turn wasteland into market gardens so that these green zones now provide more food for the thousands of refugees who have fled to the cities. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, Work Against Want began as a pilot in 1988 in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Some $50,000 was raised. In 1990 it hopes to raise about $500,000. Project partners in Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Solomons have already committed themselves to making the planned projects work. They will do the hard labour for months and even years. The donations from caring Australians will make it possible. </PARA>

Not only do those decisions have an adverse effect on command, control, and operational effectiveness of Army Reserve units but also they put a big question mark over both the wider Defence Force structure review announced earlier this year and an objective assessment of the rationale underlying the highly publicised Wrigley report of June 1990 into the Defence Force and the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> If honourable members cannot get into Nediz Tu, and I am sure they will want to note this down, the House of Chow just up the street is run by third generation Australian Chinese. If they cannot get in there, they should go around the corner and get a nice French feed bistro style from the Mandarin Duck. </PARA>
<PARA> I could list Adelaide's culinary achievements into the late afternoon, Mr Speaker, but let me just make three points. First of all the credit must go to the public sector Regency Park College established by my old mate Don Dunstan. Another triumph for successful industry planning! Secondly, many of the chefs have come from overseas and we have all benefited. Thirdly, Adelaide is a great place to visit so when honourable members come for the Grand Prix stay for a meal or tea. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to register my objection and those of many pharmacists in the electorate of Corangamite to the Government's clandestine approach to implementing its proposed black box prescription dispensing scheme. Not only does it impugn upon the integrity of local pharmacists by setting them up as a government spy network, but it represents an excessive and unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of the general public. It imposes an extra burden on pharmacies who will presumably have to bear not only the burden of increased costs associated with establishing the computer link but also the wrath of the public when the system breaks down as it inevitably will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been brought to my attention by local pharmacists that everyone will be required to have a Medicare card and that without it a prescription will be automatically refused. Furthermore the Government's intention is now to use all data relating to individual's tax, social security, veterans affairs, Medicare and unemployment files in the data bank. There is no justifiable reason for a person's health status to be determined by a computer and for those details to be the province of Canberra bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Virtually all pharmacies keep detailed records of client drug needs which they check against prescriptions anyway. They do so for the safety of the client and determine the future drug requirements. The building of dossiers on individuals is one of the foremost reasons for the resounding defeat of the Australia Card proposal back in 1987. The whole concept is intrusive and fraught with administrative dangers. Neither is it in the best interest of the public at large or the many thousand of pharmacies throughout Australia who will be forced to rely on it. </PARA>

At the moment most development on a local scale is handled through either local councils or State planning authorities and major developments which cross council or authority boundaries really are not looked at on a regional perspective. Recently within my electorate there was a large proposal which would have seen some 17,000 hectares of pine plantations progressively cleared and replaced with residential housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This development goes over some four local authorities and neither the Commonwealth Government, through its planning procedures in granting an export licence for the woodchips that would result from the clearing of the pine plantations, nor the State Government, in it planning decisions, seem to take into account the long term land use measures which would come about by allowing a quantity of this land on to the residential market.

That event was the opening of Monash Lodge Hostel. The Monash Lodge Hostel is an aged persons, hostel funded in the main by a Commonwealth grant of over half a million dollars and also through the private fund raising efforts of an extremely active and hard working committee. That aged persons hostel is a credit to the people of Clermont, a credit to its President, Arthur Humphries, a credit to people like Betty Spring, Laura Burnett, Michelle Sporne, Robert and Shirely Maisey, a credit to the Belyando Shire Council led by Ted Rolfe and a credit to a host of dedicated workers who turned a dream into a reality.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2683" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The quick and immediate answer is no, of course I do not. I am very interested to see that what is implicit in the statement of the Leader of the Opposition is that he regards the New South Wales Labor Leader of the Opposition as a more authoritative spokesman on economic affairs than he does the Westpac Banking Corporation. The Leader of the Opposition said that Westpac is wrong. As I said yesterday, Westpac said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>However, Westpac believes that despite the ubiquitous gloom which is developing about the prospects for the economy and in the absence of unforseen external events, a re-run of 1982/83 is unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me make the following points to prove the accuracy of the statement by Westpac and the inaccuracy of what has been said by the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> The contention that it is the worst recession since World War II is simply unsustainable. One has only to go back to 1982-83 to find the truth of that. Let me make these points: in 1982-83-the Leader of the Opposition may or may not understand these things-private consumption fell significantly at the beginning of the downturn. Today its growth remains positive. In 1982-83 gross domestic product fell for four successive quarters. Today we have yet to see two consecutive negative quarters recorded. In 1982-83 employment growth was negative for five consecutive quarters. Today employment growth remains positive.</PARA>
<PARA> In the year to March 1983 employment fell by 187,800. Unemployment increased by 254,900. The unemployment rate at March 1983 was virtually 10 per cent. Investment, including housing, has not fallen to the extent it did in 1982-83 and, very importantly, wages growth today is moderate. In 1982-83, because of the absence of an incomes policy on the part of the then government, wages growth was uncontrolled.</PARA>
<PARA> If we look at all the statistics, all the facts of employment, unemployment, consumption, investment and wages, we see that the proposition that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales is simply unsustainable. The record remains clear that it was the Opposition's ineptitude in 1982 which produced the worst recession in this country in 50 years.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's intentions are to protect the position of lower income earners and pensioners by maintaining our election commitment not to introduce a consumption tax. However, I note that the Leader of the Opposition is reported in the Bulletin of this week as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recognise Keating will have a field day with our tax. He'll run around taking every cheap shot in the book. He'll stand up there with pictures of children's food and baby shoes and say, `Look what they are going to do to these people.' And, of course, as is usual with Paul he never tells you the whole story. He doesn't tell you how the lower income earners and pensioners will be compensated. He doesn't tell you of the substantial tax cuts, the much lower tax rates that people will get.</PARA>
<PARA> The whole point is that it is the Leader of the Opposition who has not told the whole story, not by a long way. It will be recalled that when this tax was announced by the Opposition, it was announced in a hurried press conference outside the front door of Parliament House, and we have not heard another thing about it since. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to complain about being misrepresented, why does he not come out now and provide a few facts? He should tell the people of Australia at what rate the new consumption tax is proposed to be set. Is he talking about 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent or even 30 per cent? What effect would this new tax have on price levels? By how much does he propose increasing the price of food, clothing and other essential items? What is he going to do about commodities which are subject to excise?</PARA>
<PARA> Just what bit of magic does the Leader of the Opposition imagine he can weave to prevent price increases feeding into wages and hence into continuing inflation? What accommodation has he reached with the trade union movement that would permit the appropriate discounting of wages? By how much does he think he will cut marginal tax rates? Who will be the big beneficiaries of these tax cuts?</PARA>
<PARA> Will he confirm today publicly that those personal tax cuts are to be directed to higher income earners by, as the Opposition proposed in the election campaign, cutting the top marginal rate to 30 per cent? Will he come clean with the electorate today and tell them by how much his consumption tax proposals will reduce the Budget surplus?</PARA>
<PARA> If the Leader of the Opposition will answer these questions-and the people are entitled to that-then the full story of this Opposition's tax policy could begin to be told. He would have no need to complain. But beyond that, it is completely disingenuous for the Leader of the Opposition to complain that I have misrepresented the issue of compensation for pensioners and low income earners. The source for my statements on the Opposition's proposals is the shadow Treasurer's own statement that an Opposition consumption tax `will compensate only for current consumption'. He has made it quite clear that the Opposition proposes that low and middle income earners should suffer a reduction in real disposable incomes, that is, a reduction in their standard of living. He said this.</PARA>
<PARA> This is in complete contrast to the 1983 White Paper, which I might add not only had absolutely precise proposals, but provided not just for compensation but for overcompensation, that is, over and above the consumption tax paid. The table on page 10 of the draft White Paper provided for excess income tax cuts at all income levels under option C. That excess compensation effectively allowed for savings. It is this point that the shadow Treasurer completely misunderstood in his statements of May this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders revealed that the Opposition intended to give people a tax cut only for the money they spent today. He was not prepared to compensate disposable income; he was prepared to compensate only for the money they spent, not for money they saved and which they could spend another day. So anybody who saves would be worse off. It is that which he plans to try to use to make his consumption tax numbers add up. As the honourable member for Flinders has indicated, the Opposition has absolutely no intention of providing adequate compensation.</PARA>
<PARA> What we are saying on this side of the House is that the Leader of the Opposition is proposing to have a consumption tax; he can answer the questions I put to him.</PARA>

He'll run around taking every cheap shot'-cheap shots by him, cheap shots by him at pensioners. The Leader of the Opposition does not like it. He thinks he is going to go out there with a tax that will cut the top marginal rates of tax for the wealthy and have it paid for by the poorest people in our community. Yet when the Government considered this, we put up a proposal which offered overcompensation for every income category. But because we could not get the wage discounts, we abandoned it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition has never told anybody whether he has had any conversation with the trade union movement or how he would remove five or six percentage points from the price level from ongoing inflation. He has never said it.  He thinks he has the right to go to the front door in a five-minute press conference and announce he will put a major tax into the tax base of the Commonwealth, which has huge income and redistributive and equity effects, and how dare the Government even mention it. We will be mentioning it much more often. The Opposition will be hearing it right up to polling day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer him to the fact that unemployment has increased by over 128,000 since October last year as a result of his deliberate policy of high interest rates. As the 7.4 per cent unemployment rate for September announced today by the Statistician is already above the average he has assumed for the year and close to the rate assumed for June 1991, does he still maintain that his estimates are on track? If so, can the Treasurer please inform the House how much higher his assumed track will carry us before unemployment peaks?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It depends very much on what happens with the participation rate. As we know we have had a participation rate for July at a record high of 64.2 per cent, as far as I know the highest in the 21 years that I have been in this House. The normal expectation would be that when the economy is slowing and employment prospects are getting more difficult the participation rate falls. The level depends on where that fall finally ceases, but today's figures are broadly consistent with the pattern forecast at Budget time. The fact of the matter is that it will be the participation rate which decides much of the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The participation rate was expected to decline during the year. The rate for September was 63.9 per cent, a fall of 0.1 percentage point from August and a decline of 0.3 percentage points from a record high of 64.2 per cent, so it is still very high. These numbers make it clear we are not looking at anything like the kind of recession which we saw in 1982-83. The unemployment rate for the June quarter 1983 was 10.2 per cent-it is 7.4 per cent today-and there was a much lower participation rate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister for Science and Technology in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce to a letter to constituents from the honourable member for Lowe concerning the multifunction polis (MFP) tabled in this House yesterday. Was the Homebush site preferred? Was the Hawke Government trying to impose the MFP on the people of Lowe? Will the MFP be inhabited by between 100,000 and 200,000 people, about 80 per cent of them Japanese citizens?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2687" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement made in the House yesterday by the honourable member for Lowe needs to be addressed. Let me deal with the issues in the question because all three statements are factually incorrect, and this House needs to have that recorded. This Government's favoured site was not Homebush Bay. In fact, the Homebush Bay site was the favoured preference of the Greiner Government in New South Wales. We set up an inquiry, an independent selection process, to advise the Government on the appropriate site. That is how we ended up with the Adelaide site. In contrast, it was the Liberal Party in New South Wales that proposed Homebush Bay. At the time of the letter from the honourable member for Lowe, no site had been chosen, despite what he was asserting in that letter; nor had this Government approved any site in principle. That is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That leads me to the second point in the honourable member's question. It is therefore totally deceitful to suggest that the Hawke Government was trying to impose the MFP on the people of Homebush. The assertion of the honourable member for Lowe was totally deceitful.</PARA>
<PARA> As for the third point relating to the numbers of Japanese and the proportion of them, the report of Arthur Andersen and Co. did suggest, as one of three options, that the outcome could involve the numbers mentioned-that is, 100,000 to 200,000 people-but not 80 per cent of them Japanese, as the member indicated. It was 80 per cent international; not Japanese. The honourable member for Lowe deliberately substituted `Japanese' for `international'.</PARA>
<PARA> The whole concept of the multifunction polis is that it be an international city, but its composition is to be subjected to exhaustive scrutiny and advice to this Government based on strict guidelines, imposed by this Government, for economic significance and social harmony. If the site cannot meet those criteria, the multifunction polis simply will not go ahead. But worse than that, this letter, by its assertion, inflames racism and is an example of the fear-mongering tactics that the Opposition resorted to in 1988 and during the last election.</PARA>
<PARA> I come briefly to the question of the potential benefits to the economy of the MFP, because this is the positive side of the equation and not the negative, fear-mongering side. There is significant potential in the MFP for this economy. It is a recognition that was noted by the joint selection committee in relation to the Adelaide site. The reality is that this country does have to become competitive and innovative; we have to use strategic alliances to achieve it. To shun, as the Opposition would do, constructive cooperative ventures will doom this nation. We need to recognise our strengths, particularly in the high-tech, science based areas and strategically build on them; to really develop quality partnerships, particularly with our neighbours but, more importantly, with the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lowe misled the House yesterday in claiming that he had been misrepresented. He should now retract and admit that he misled the people of Lowe and this Parliament. If he does not, then the Leader of the Opposition ought to use his so-called authority in relation to his front bench members and get the honourable member for Lowe to so retract.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I know that the honourable member for Moreton takes a very keen interest in the subject of Sri Lanka, reflecting the concern of many people in his electorate. We have, as I am sure all honourable members do, a deep concern at the increased intensity of fighting between government forces and Tamil militants and at the reports that are coming in of very heavy civilian casualties. They reinforce our desire to see a peaceful resolution of this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, visited Sri Lanka in August and discussed with the Sri Lankan Government ways of making progress towards a peaceful settlement there. Following those discussions in Sri Lanka, I recently wrote to President Premadasa outlining my concerns and setting out some options in the Commonwealth context which the Sri Lankans might like to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill, to his credit, has taken a keen interest in Sri Lanka and has himself proposed a Commonwealth-sponsored settlement. His plans, we believe, however, are too ambitious at this stage to form the basis of a serious initiative. But let me say without qualification that we welcome his effort as evidence that he at least in the Opposition is trying to think about foreign policy because there is very little evidence of it anywhere else in the Opposition. The contrast with the performance of his leader is not flattering to the Leader of the Opposition. The most striking thing about the Leader of the Opposition's comments on foreign policy since he became leader has been his complete failure to articulate any significant new policies except on Japan, despite all the rhetoric that has flowed from him. He has tried to earn a political dividend by claiming that the Government's policies upon which he cannot improve were his in the first place. That is what he said here on Tuesday. The most charitable thing that one can say about that is that it is just plain silly. It shows that he knows as little about the business of opposition as he does about foreign policy.</PARA>
<PARA> I take up the theme of my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister. The challenge that confronts this Opposition is the same in foreign policy as in the whole range of issues confronting him. It is a very simple challenge. Those opposite have to work out credible alternative policies and explain very simply to the people of Australia how they would do better than us.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad, Mr Speaker, that you permitted that question to be asked. The answer to the honourable member's question is, I think, very much in line with what the Government has already had to say about the question of the third runway at Sydney airport. Of course, subject to a satisfactory outcome of all the environmental processes that it is currently going through-and it is now available for public comment from interested parties-it is the Government's intention to proceed with that runway development. We have not, however, waited simply for that process to take place in addressing movement concerns at Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since we have been operating this year, we have had some very significant developments there which are, at this stage-and they have only had their operations in place for a few months-substantially improving operations at Sydney airport. I refer to the changes in scheduling that the airlines have introduced, changes in priority systems for landings and simultaneous operations off the two runways. There are another couple of initiatives that will come to conclusion shortly, and that includes the introduction of peak period pricing. That will take small aircraft out of the system without impacting particularly heavily upon commuter airline operations. Also, soon to be available for use are rapid exit taxiways. Once those initiatives are put in place, they will make a substantial difference to movement at Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Sydney airport is the hub of operations into and out of Australia and is, indeed, the hub of the Australian domestic aviation system. It is critical for tourism not only, obviously, in the State of New South Wales-even though the honourable member for Leichhardt is almost as distant from it as I am when I am at home-but across the nation as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> The process that we are going through, both in creating the area for a second airport at Sydney, which ultimately will be absolutely required, and the way in which we are going through the process of addressing the issue of the third runway, is in marked contrast to the way in which governments in the past have handled these issues. Given that I have been asked this question, what bears thinking about is the fact that for years and years governments have struggled with finding and locating a site for an alternative airport at Sydney, and that will subsequently, down through the years, be absolutely essential. No government managed to come to a conclusion on that.</PARA>
<PARA> Governments lost seats and by-elections and God knows what. It was the subject of constant political footballing. We are the Government that has got in place the alternative airport at Sydney which must proceed. Again, the runway that we are now considering, if it is to proceed-as I said, subject to that environment study it will proceed-is a runway which, if put into operation, will improve movement at Sydney Airport, as opposed to that which we were confronted with when we first came into office seven years ago. If we had proceeded with the propositions that the Opposition had then put forward for runway development at Sydney Airport, we would have experienced exactly the same sorts of costs as would be imposed by proceeding with that medium-spaced runway, but with very little effect on movement into and out of Sydney. Something like a 28 per cent improvement would have resulted from that.</PARA>
<PARA> I think honourable members could contemplate the disaster that that would have been and the enormous political trouble that would have been associated with that enormous cost in constructing the close-spaced parallel runway that the Opposition had proposed, to achieve virtually nothing in traffic movement. Indeed, the sorts of measures that I talked about earlier in my answer and one or two other things that have been put in place over the years more than adequately achieve the type of improvement in movement that that close-spaced parallel runway would have achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the totality of what has been done with Sydney Airport by this Government one can see that it has been this Government and this Government alone that has addressed sensibly the requirements of aircraft movement in Sydney and created the basis, in the long haul, for Sydney to remain the hub, serving our tourism industry and our aviation industry overall. It is very easy to score cheap political points for conforming to legal processes associated with environmental studies, but when looked at in the broad, one can see that that constitutes a significant achievement for this Government-in contrast with its predecessors-in addressing this most important issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that the accord mark 6, which the Government is committed to and which forms the basis of wages policy for this financial year, encompasses considerable scope for enterprise-based agreements. Of course, the implementation of that accord mark 6 is in the early stages. At the moment there is much discussion in various industries about the development of that approach. Shortly it will come before the Industrial Relations Commission and the Commission will decide whether or not to give its imprimatur to that approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is accepted by everyone at this stage that even before it has been to the Commission that approach will encompass a considerable amount of industry-and enterprise based agreements. As the questioner indicates, some of those undoubtedly will involve section 115 agreements, certified agreements-a provision put into the Industrial Relations Act by this Government in 1988. Section 115 provides for agreements to be put in place which go beyond the norms applying in an industry. I must say to the honourable member for Bennelong that it is not at all clear at this stage that that is the way in which most agreements will take place. Indeed, I suspect that most agreements which occur will not be of a section 115 type.</PARA>
<PARA> This, of course, is really a matter for the parties concerned. There are other ways in which they can get agreements before the Commission that will be accepted by the Commission other than by way of section 115. I imagine and understand that the likelihood is that we will see a variety of approaches. At this stage exactly how that falls out it is not possible to say because there are conflicting views and the Commission has to give its final say about how it would see those agreements being put in place.</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, it has to decide whether it wants to be in the position of giving an imprimatur to those agreements, or whether it wants basically to stand back and let those agreements be reached in an informal way without the Commission being directly involved in giving its acceptance or rejection to each of those agreements as they take place. That is a matter which has to be decided in the context of a national wage case. Ironically, at the moment we have the situation where the unions are essentially saying that they would expect that these agreements would not come individually before the Commission for approval, and a number of employer organisations are saying that that is what should happen. If the honourable member is being consistent, I imagine he would be supportive of the trade unions and the approach they are taking.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Let me first say how much I and I am sure the honourable member are looking forward to the visit of Nelson Mandela to this country. He is without any question a great leader of our times. Emerging from 27 years in prison, this man sat down with his former gaolers and has given new hope to a new South Africa emerging. He has been without any question a major force in the recent progress which is occurring in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But we must be fair and say that he has not been acting alone in this matter. Agreements reached in discussion between Mr Mandela and President de Klerk, and most importantly those which were held on 5 August this year, opened the way for full negotiations for a new constitution for South Africa, and those negotiations and outcomes are a very considerable credit to the foresight and the courage of both those leaders. I have written to both President de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, congratulating them on the progress that has been made.</PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, the continuing spectre of township violence and the increasing militancy of the extreme right have the potential obviously to threaten the considerable progress that has been made and is being made. Until all groups concerned heed the advice of this week's joint statement by Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk that `all sides must do their utmost to bring violence to an end', a final settlement will remain under threat.</PARA>
<PARA> While these agreements that have been reached to this time are without any question a significant step, they go only part way down the path to reform and they are not by any means the end of the journey. The progress is welcomed, but by international consensus it does not yet represent the `clear and irreversible change' which the Commonwealth has set down as the criterion for the easing of sanctions. There is more that needs to be done, and in particular we urge President de Klerk to act on his commitments and to maintain the momentum of reform by acting as soon as possible to remove the legislative pillars of apartheid.</PARA>
<PARA> In that context, the Government will keep under review its sanctions policy which, together with the sanctions policies of others, has played a central role in bringing about change in South Africa to ensure that our policy continues to address the rapid developments in South Africa to which I have already referred. That review of our sanctions policy that we will keep in place will be undertaken in consultation with our colleagues in the Commonwealth and with leaders like Mr Mandela.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The simple fact which eludes the honourable member who asks this question is that the Commonwealth remains the owner of what will become a significantly enlarged and strengthened bank. It will be the largest bank in the country. We make no apology for the decision that we have taken. At the time of that letter, of course, we did not have in contemplation the enlarging of the bank. If I had my druthers, I would rather that it had not arisen, because the circumstances in which we have now acquired, or are now in the process of acquiring, an enlarged and strengthened bank are not quite the circumstances that I would have preferred to be dealing with. However, we have a situation in which this Government was confronted with a challenge in Victoria. It was a judgment that was made by the Treasurer and me, by our Cabinet and our party, and endorsed with perhaps varying degrees of reluctance by certain sections of the party. Nevertheless, it was an effective judgment that good government required us to enable the Commonwealth Bank to take over the State Bank of Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the event, these things have resulted from that very intelligent and far-sighted decision: firstly, a potentially very dangerous situation in Victoria has been averted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Occasionally, as its creators, we reserve the right to give it a bit of friendly advice. But that is not re-regulating the exchange rate, having it fixed at a Monday morning meeting over a cup of tea and a scone in the Treasury, which was what the game was in the Opposition's days. It chose to have the market massively overvalued to keep downward pressure on inflation robbing the farm sector of income for decades. That was the game that was played then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Talk about strange bedfellows: I notice that today the Leader of the National Party was joined by a major columnist in the Sydney Morning Herald, once a free marketeer of the 1970s and now a regulator of the 1990s, saying that in some contorted logic the Government had been stabbed in the back by Margaret Thatcher because Margaret Thatcher and Britain had joined the European monetary system. The fact of the matter is that if Europe goes into a monetary union and over time there ends up being a common currency, one does not have to be a genius to work out that people living in Britain would not be in it. As part of the European community, at the eleventh hour Britain has decided to join the European monetary system, the ERM. It is doing so very simply because Britain is a manufacturer in Europe. Australia is a commodity producer which is not part of any community. What are people proposing-that we tie the Australian dollar to the yen or the US dollar?</PARA>
<PARA> Where is this notion of harking back to some tied or fixed exchange rates or regulation? This is a pathetic debate. I can only say that people who ought to know better are giving succour and encouragement to the Leader of the National Party. The National Party, following the more base instincts of that agrarian rump, is back there to create and re-regulate the market it made a mess of throughout most of Australia's post-war history.</PARA>
<PARA> Members of the National Party love markets, particularly the ones they run themselves. That is why they always have their sticky, regulatory hands in things and now they want to go back to doing it with the currency. Well, bully for them! It shows again that they cannot even agree on such a basic point. Finally having unshackled ourselves from the purgatory of the crawling peg system, the fixed system, the administrative system, to one where the rate is now set in the market, the coalition, on such a basic matter as the most important price in the economy, does not have agreement about that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I addressed this subject at Question Time. I made the point that in developing an equitable tax base one could never persist with the ruse that income taken as capital should be taken free of tax. It is that appalling tax sentiment which we had expressed in our tax laws for so long which allowed so many people with assets to become wealthy without paying tax upon the growth of those assets or their wealth. That is why, amongst other reasons, the Government introduced a capital gains tax-so as to even up the tax treatment between income and income taken as capital so that we could secure in this country a commercial sector where commerce was rewarded for the production of income and employment and people were not simply rewarded for sitting on assets, speculating in them, watching them appreciate and taking profits free of tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said yesterday that when the Leader of the Opposition showed some prospect of yielding on his position on this matter that we on this side of the House would welcome it. Last night on national television the Leader of the National Party of Australia, again at his eloquent best, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . when we are ready in terms of the Coalition policy dimension of that, there will be an announcement, if indeed there is an announcement, to the change of our existing policy on that matter . . . Any alteration to that fundamental circumstance will emerge closer to the election dates . . .</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, he was releasing the National Party draft policy position to be taken up by the Federal Council later this month. The draft policy was circulated in the press boxes yesterday. Amongst other things, it seeks to abolish the capital gains tax other than for speculative gains held for less than five years. So again it is the maintenance of that view that the capital gains tax is wiped out back to 1985, and that means providing a huge retrospective benefit for anybody who has turned assets over after that date. Then on the next page it says, `Reject retrospective tax laws'. I do not suppose the irony of that has struck him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past week there have been two very clear-cut and honest statements by members of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) about the true nature of our present economic circumstances which stand in very sharp contrast to those that have been uttered in the course of this week, or indeed throughout most of the period of our recent difficulties, by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). The first of these was the one this morning by Bob Carr, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, who emphasised the fact that `it is a very serious recession. It is the most serious postwar recession'. The other statement was that by Senator Button earlier in the week that the Government's high interest rate policy in effect was doing permanent and irreparable damage.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button, the third most important and most honest member of the Government made that statement: it is doing permanent and irreparable damage to the manufacturing sector of this economy. Yet the statements we get from the Treasurer and from the Prime Minister still try to put a gloss on the current state of our economic circumstances. They have failed yet to acknowledge, as my matter of public importance suggests today, and to address the fact that it is the Government's high interest rate policy more than anything else that has led this economy into what Bob Carr has described as the worst postwar recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have done either one of two things. They have either made a massive miscalculation and are still weaselling around trying to work out some way of undoing it, or they have deliberately run a high interest rate policy to bring about what the Treasurer himself has described as a scorched earth, as the only way he knows, with the way they run this Government, to bring down inflation and hopefully to turn around the balance of payments by somehow boosting our export performance and bringing imports under control. </PARA>
<PARA> It shows an appalling lack of understanding of the detail of the working of an economic system in general, or this one in particular, that the Treasurer, after seven years in the job, still has absolutely no idea of the damage that he is doing to the average Australian, to the average Australian family, as a result of that high interest rate policy. As I have suggested to members of the Government in the past, if they left Canberra and their VIP aircraft and just had a look anecdotally in any part of any major city in this country or in any regional centre or any farm, they would get a very clear-cut idea of the extent to which those high interest rates have precipitated the most difficult circumstances for Australian families over the postwar period, as Bob Carr has emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at any indicator now-it does not matter whether we look at retail sales, motor vehicle registrations, housing approvals, or today's data on the labour market-we start to see clear-cut, overwhelming evidence that the economy has now moved into a recession. Certainly, the private sector of the Australian economy is in the deepest and most prolonged recession of the postwar period. So it is not surprising that we are starting to see record levels of personal bankruptcies and record levels of small to medium size business failures. </PARA>
<PARA> The only area of the economy that is still growing, with the exception of a few mining companies which are in the process of slowing down, is the Treasurer's area, the government sector, which he has forecast this year will grow by something like 2 3/4 per cent at a time when he projected the rest of the economy will grow at about 2 per cent. We have already seen overwhelming evidence that there is no hope of that forecast being achieved this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we got some unemployment and labour market data which start to emphasise the magnitude of the problem that is coming for the average Australian family in current circumstances. Even though the Government has brought official interest rates down a bit, real interest rates are still near record levels and they are still having an effect on the average Australian family's capacity to buy a home or indeed, in many cases, just to get by; they are still having near record level effects. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are now seeing collapse is the one thing the Government boasted about and claimed credit for over this seven year period. We are now seeing its employment market performance collapse. For a large part of the last seven years the Government boasted that it had created something like 1.6 million jobs. This was the last reed it had left, if you like, the last thing that was going in its favour, the only thing, indeed, it pinned its hopes on in the course of the last election campaign. If we remember, the Prime Minister made some classic statements. For example, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>And I'll tell you what, if you vote for me what you'll get, what you'll get is a continuation of record employment growth, of an average rate of growth of the economy-twice as fast under us as under our predecessors . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to talk about international averages. The one thing that has happened in the last few months is that the employment market has collapsed. We have seen the unemployment rate jump from about 5.9 to 7.4 per cent. We have seen something like 130,000 Australians thrown out on the dole queues, thrown out on the scrapheap of the unemployed, and we are in only the early stages of this recession. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now seeing a lot of forward looking indicators that suggest that the magnitude of the collapse in the labour market is really going to be something by postwar standards. Almost any forward looking indicator we want to look at will tell us exactly the same story-that is, that the labour market decline that we have seen in recent days will probably accelerate in the course of the next 12 to 18 months and the Budget time forecasts, for example, the most immediate barometer we have of the Government's view about unemployment has already been blown out of the water by the data in the last three months, the first three months of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> There has already been an increase of 72,000 in the number of unemployed. The unemployment rate has already risen to 7.4 per cent, which is well above the average forecast for the year of 7.25 per cent, and almost at the level of 7.5 per cent which was projected for the month of June in the middle of next year. So already there has been a much more significant and dramatic deterioration in the labour market in just the first three months of the year than was suggested in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget, the forecasts were pinned very crucially on that 2 per cent growth, which even the Government's own agricultural forecasting group, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics, now talks about as being only one per cent at best. Therefore, the prospect is for a very significant rise in unemployment to somewhere between 8 per cent and 9 per cent by the middle of next year. So the prospect for the average Australian in the current circumstances is the coincidence, the double-whammy effect, of two things: sustained high interest rates and now job insecurity. If one puts those two things together, particularly in the context of the collapse of the farm sector, one gets a very dim set of prospects for the average Australian and the average Australian family in the course of the next couple of years. That is not to mention the fact that we are sitting here in Australia with that problem, that magnitude of effect, as an entirely home-grown phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA> The sole responsibility for this lies with the Treasurer, who is sitting opposite me at the table. The world has just gone through its longest period of sustained growth in the post-war period with significant rates of growth in world trade that have been unequalled in the post-war period. There has been no domestic or international drought, yet here we have a set of circumstances where the recession is already promising to be worse than at any other time in the post-war period. Also, the world itself will be subject to a number of significant shocks in the course of the next few months which could further worsen the prospects for the average Australian during the next couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> First, of course, is the situation in the Middle East with a significant increase in the price of oil, which is running somewhere above $35 per barrel at present, having been as high as nearly $45 per barrel. But the key point is that the price of oil is significantly above the $23 a barrel that was assumed in the Treasurer's Budget forecast. </PARA>
<PARA> The immediate effects of that, which could be quite devastating on a country like Australia, are to push the world economy towards recession. It will certainly tip the United States economy into recession in the latter part of this year. It will also significantly increase inflation during the next 12 to 18 months. Put those two factors together and Australia, as a country that is trying to boost its exports, will be faced with further shrinking export markets, further falls in its export prices, higher world inflation and the fact that world interest rates will stay higher for longer than would otherwise have been the case. That is the first great uncertainty in the international economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The second is that there has been something of a major shake-out around the world in world stock markets. World stock markets have had a very good long term capacity to predict the state of economic activity, and they are telling a very alarming tale about the direction of global activity in the course of the next 12 or 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> In that area there will be a substantial shake-out in world debt markets and world equity markets which could, in a country like Australia, with $160 billion of international debts and a credit rating that has been downgraded twice in the past three years, cause a significant flight to quality as the world wakes up to the magnitude of our economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has all this happened? This has happened because for the past 2 1/2 years the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have together quite deliberately-and in saying that I am giving the Treasurer the benefit of the doubt that he did not make a massive miscalculation-embraced a high interest rate policy as the only way for this country to go. They have created all those circumstances essentially as a result of that one decision. Any other policy options, all of which have been listed consistently by the Opposition and almost any other commentator on the economic scene in Australia, has been eschewed by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It cannot cut government expenditure. Indeed, it now talks about increasing government expenditure. The Government increased welfare spending in the last Budget by 12.3 per cent. The Treasurer should not come in here parading around as if he is the great cutter of government expenditure; far from it. The Treasurer knows why he has not cut government expenditure-because he has been hog-tied by his mate Bill Kelty and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) who have locked him into substantial increases in expenditure in the name of the social wage, which is part of the price that the Australian community has been expected to pay for the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Treasurer cannot reform taxation in this country. Sure he has made a few changes. I am happy to give him credit for some of the changes he has made but he has a long way to go to get a fair and equitable tax system that he can parade around the country claiming credit for. One of the key elements that is doing a lot of the damage is the lack of a broad-based goods and services tax. He prefers to tax by stealth, with backdoor increases in sales tax. He prefers to take such taxes out of the Budget by stealth and rely on bracket creep as a way of funding the Budget. But there are no genuine tax reforms. The Treasurer is quite happy to look after Bill Kelty's mates in the cash economy. He will never, in the circumstances that I see, take the tough decisions in relation to tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is so sensitive about the capital gains tax decision because at the very time that our country desperately needs people to put their money at risk in small to medium sized business we have one of the highest and most injurious capital gains systems in the world, and the Treasurer knows it. He stands up as a monument to someone who is running against the international trend-again because of the constraints he is operating under with his special relationship with Bill Kelty and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, we can go through any other area. The Treasurer has not reformed telecommunications as he should have. He has opted for the third best option for introducing what he calls competition to the telecommunications industry. To give the Treasurer some credit, he did prefer a different option, the second best option. The best option of full-blooded competition across the board was eschewed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are similar problems in relation to waterfront reform, where money is going out the door for redundancies but nobody is actually leaving the jobs, the area of coastal shipping reform, and injecting competition or reform in a host of other domestic industries. In every single case the Treasurer has been unable to deliver the necessary policy change. </PARA>
<PARA> By default and by design the Treasurer has fallen back on the one thing that has created this recession and will prolong it, from which we will not be able to escape until the Treasurer changes policy: he has fallen back consciously and deliberately on high interest rates which have done such tremendous damage to the average Australian, the average Australian family and, as Senator Button correctly said, the capacity of the manufacturing sector in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has made a totally disingenuous speech. He said we are about to see the United States (US) economy tip into recession in the latter part of this year with shrinking export markets for us. Yet apparently he believes we should be growing at a pace whereby we have our head up as the rest of the world puts its head down and that, by growing faster than the United States, we stand to cop its huge exportable surplus like a punch on the nose as the US floods imports into Australia. In one breath the Leader of the Opposition says the US will slow down; in the next breath he says we should be growing faster. We should be taking the poultice off imports from the US economy, instead of those going somewhere else, with Australia keeping its head down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition knows that in 1988-89 domestic spending was growing at twice the productive capacity of the economy. There was 9.1 per cent growth in gross national expenditure compared with 4.2 per cent for gross domestic product (GDP) up to the end of last year. That was a totally unsustainable position and one where we simply had to rein in domestic spending to rein in the growth in imports. Yet, with all the insincerity he can muster, the Leader of the Opposition says that, despite the fact that the rest of the world is slowing down, we should be doing better by doing something other than embracing a high interest rates policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the Leader of the Opposition who was telling me throughout 1989 that we were perverting the processes of monetary management in this country by political manipulation of the central bank-in other words, that interest rates were not high enough to deal with the spurt in demand, and what we were doing was holding them down for political reasons. Now the tune is different: we have held them too high. In other words, he says just what suits him politically. There is not a skerrick of consistency. There is nothing genuine about his comments and certainly nothing constructive about them. What was a year ago crass manipulation of interest rates this year is interest rates too high. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable members remember all that rhetoric last year about a steadier, medium term monetary policy to bear down inflation? What we needed then, he said, was this year a one-sided policy thrust exacting hardship upon the community. The indecency of these arguments and the lack of consistency in them is profound, but it takes only a Liberal to get up and do a somersault like that-and do it barefaced, without a smile on his face. </PARA>
<PARA> He then says that whatever the problems are, they are all my fault. I am prepared to accept whatever responsibilities come my way, but one thing I do know is that it would be a lot easier to manage a Northern Hemisphere economy where a small proportion of gross national product is in trade and where one does not see these huge terms of trade swings. We have come through a period with, first of all, a recession which he bequeathed to us in 1982-83 and then two back-to-back terms of trade swings, a huge decline in national income in 1985-86-the year I made the banana republic remarks in response to it-and then a pick-up in the middle of 1987 equal to 4 per cent of GDP, a $15 billion change in our national income from the rest of the world paying us a higher price for commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what has made economic management in this country difficult: a loss of national income; cuts in fiscal policy; cuts in real wages; putting our head down because we could not afford to go on the way we were with a loss of income; and then a sharp reversal of the position with a surge of income pulling up domestic demand and spending at a time of high profitability, inducing an investment boom. That is what made monetary management difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have liked, of course, to have had even terms of trade through this period and, if we had, we would now be looking at a current account at around the debt stabilisation point, 2 1/2 to 3 per cent of GDP, and an inflation rate well under 4 per cent. That was lost by the increase in demand coming from that huge shift in wealth to us. But no country can say, as $15 billion is planted on one, `Thank you, but we don't need the money; it'll make economic management difficult'. How can one say as a country, `The world wants to pay us another $15 billion but, thank you, we won't have it because it will make economic management difficult; it will blow out our current account and inflation targets'. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we have taken the money and it has made Australia much wealthier. We have reinvigorated all of our capital sectors both in the trade and in the non-trade areas of the economy. The economy out there in terms of capital stock is almost brand new instead of the ramshackle, debilitated capital stock inherited from these empty people opposite who could not run a sophisticated economy with a primary and secondary sector for most of the postwar years. We have had the job of rebuilding the capital stock and we have used some of that wealth to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that we still have a large current account and we have inflation in the 6 to 7 per cent area. But instead of being off a low wealth level, it is off a high wealth level. The place is eminently wealthier-</PARA>

But the gap in our trade is still up there, and I am not going to sit as Treasurer of this country and not face up to my responsibilities to pull our spending down. We have done it with a mix of policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I use the word `disingenuous' in relation to the Leader of the Opposition because he was an adviser to the former Treasurer. He knows precisely what Commonwealth outlays to GDP were in 1983. They were 30.4 per cent. Today they are 23.4 per cent. They are down 7 percentage points of gross domestic product. They are down $30,000m a year. Yet he has the audacity to say that the Government is not cutting outlays or fiscal policy; that, for some reason, I have turned this over because I do not want to offend Bill Kelty and his mates, as he put it. He will not even accept the strength of what the Government has done on fiscal policy and at least applaud us for that by giving us one of the smallest public sectors in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. </PARA>
<PARA> That balance between fiscal policy, monetary policy and wages policy is the triumvirate on which this policy change sits. The sleazy claim that this is all about interest rates, that this is a policy built solely on interest rates, is totally dishonest. The Leader of the Opposition did not mention the terms of trade swings. He tried to deny that. He wants to be taken seriously. He is the Leader of the Opposition. He is wandering around telling everybody that he is a professor of economics. Yet he has the audacity to say to the Government `We won't cut policy' when he left us outlays at the largest level in our Federal history. We have now cut them back so that in two years time Commonwealth spending will be at the same level of GDP as it was in the first year that Robert Menzies came into office in 1950-40 years ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member has read them he should be decent enough to own up to it. At least he has acknowledged it. The fact of the matter is that we will get nothing from those opposite. They are empty and they have no ideas. If the Leader of the Opposition were Treasurer or Prime Minister now, he would have this country into a recession the likes of which we last saw in 1982-83. As Westpac Banking Corporation said yesterday, we are not seeing a collapse of commodity prices, we are not seeing a drought and we are not seeing a wages break-out. Westpac stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>None of these is apparent in the current policy-induced slow down. Also, growth in the services sector provides underlying strength to the economy . . . in the absence of unforeseen external events, a rerun of 1982/83 is unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the position. The profit share is basically still intact because wages are holding at 6 1/2 per cent. Fiscal policy is intact. We are not seeing a big shift in the terms of trade. But if the Opposition were in office, because it would not be able to do anything about wages, it would simply grab the monetary lever and jam the place into recession. That is the scorched earth policy that I am speaking of-the one that the Opposition would induce. How dare Opposition members get up here for a year and half and talk about a steadier monetary policy and bearing down on inflation, and then upbraid the Government for exercising a sensible and prudent monetary policy. At a time when the rest of the world is slowing down, it wants us growing apace. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition talked about housing approvals. Let me remind him about housing approvals. When he was last advising the former Treasurer, housing approvals went to 105,000 starts-the lowest level in the post war years. At the depths of this trough it has been at a level of 130,000 and it is now picking up. Yet he has the temerity to talk about housing approvals. He flattened the whole housing industry. At the 1983 Economic Summit, which was held in the House of Representatives chamber in the old Parliament House, one of the points of focus was the disastrous state of the housing industry. We introduced the first home owners scheme to try to pull it out. The Leader of the Opposition has the temerity today to talk about housing approvals when they are still running at 130,000-about the mean successful average of the last 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> He then talked about retail sales being flat. That is all he could say about them-that they are flat. He said that this will be the deepest and longest recession in the postwar period. The rest of the world is not collapsing; there is a slowdown. He and the former Treasurer gave us the deepest recession in the postwar period. I do not know whether he noticed the other day that the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) declared an almost record profit for the six months. Many of the top Australian companies are in very fine financial form in terms of their earnings. It is true that it is patchy in terms of commerce, very patchy. Some categories of business are not doing well, but others are doing very well. In 1983 everyone was broke. In 1983 the steel division nearly collapsed. BHP was going to close down its operations in Port Kembla and Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> The gall of these people, who get up here with this sort of cheapjack political stuff and then want to be taken seriously! Then the Leader of the Opposition got into the Government about our telecommunications reforms. We are going to have a competitive telecommunications system. Those opposite were the Government from 1949 to 1983, bar three years. How come they never got a competitor for Telecom? What were they doing asleep at the wheel for 30-odd years?</PARA>
<PARA> It is the same with coastal shipping. How come we inherited a position where the crew manning levels were about 1 3/4 times Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development levels? How come, now, crew sizes are supposed to drop below OECD levels? How come the waterfront was full of people who were too old to actually carry out their occupation? Why did they wait for us to take thousands of people off the waterfront and change the age profile of that area?</PARA>
<PARA> Yet, those opposite have the gall to talk about the progress we are making on micro-economic areas they had not even heard about. Very few of them would have understood until recently how important these sectors have been to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate offence is that we are told that we have presided over no tax reform. When I became Treasurer the top marginal rate was 60 per cent. It is now 47 per cent. The bottom rate was 30 per cent; it is now 21. The corporate rate was 46 per cent; it is now 39. The rate of tax on distributed income was 78c in the dollar; it is now 47c. The rate of tax on undistributed income was 78c in the dollar; it is now 39c, with a full dividend imputation system. How can those opposite say those things?</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition said there are no equitable changes in the system. What about the fringe benefits tax, which taxed all the people who were taking income outside the income system as benefits in kind? What about the abolition of entertainment as a deduction, which affected all the people who were given a credit card and had their meals free? We introduced the capital gains tax, which taxed all the mates of those opposite who took their income as capital and paid no tax, bludging on the rest of us. </PARA>
<PARA> Where do those opposite get off with these kinds of performances? I notice that the Leader of the Opposition slunk out after he made his cravenly coward speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a typical speech-full of bluster and absolute nonsense. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) started with personal abuse and he finished with personal abuse. I say to him: If he is going to come into these debates to give us his views on the economy, he ought to bring up some substance instead of some of the nonsense we have heard both yesterday and today. There he is, talking about tax reform. I say to the Australian electorate: Who do you want to believe-Paul Keating today or Paul Keating back in 1985? What did he say then about a goods and services tax? He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>If we don't as a nation adopt this proposal then you won't see significant reforms in this country in taxation for the balance of this century. </PARA>
<PARA>I say that he was right back in 1985. We have had no significant tax reform in this country. It is one of the major reforms that awaits a coalition Government after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, we had all this nonsense about outlays. For heaven's sake, why does the Treasurer not do his homework? He does not bother to compare apples with apples; he compares apples with oranges. Fancy comparing himself and the present situation with the 1950s and Menzies. He is all bluff and bluster. I have taken him up on this. I gave him a detailed critique of his assertions. We have heard not one word of substantial response to counter that position. </PARA>
<PARA> It is nonsense for the Treasurer to say that he is going to have outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product back to what they were in the 1950s. We would have had to have expenditure cuts of around $20 billion. What a laugh that is. He claims this year, as he does every year, that he has cut expenditure to the bone, and every year he is back with some more. Within 48 hours of the Budget having been brought down this year, the Minister for Finance in the last Government, Senator Walsh, dropped a bucket on the Treasurer, and he did so with a very simple statement, to the effect that there was much more that could have been done on the expenditure side in the last Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Why was the Budget such an immediate failure? The truth is very simple and that is that it failed to tell the truth. If the Treasurer had said on the Tuesday night, as he said on the following Friday at the Collingwood Football Club, that this country was back on the road to Argentina, then it might have given his Budget an ounce of credibility, but he failed to do so and we find it here again today. </PARA>
<PARA> This Treasurer is simply not prepared to face up to the damage caused by his high interest rate policy. He really ought to take a leaf out of the book of his parliamentary colleague, the New South Wales Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Carr, who said today on radio in Sydney:</PARA>
<PARA>Well it's a very serious recession. It's the most serious post-war recession that we have had. </PARA>
<PARA>When the interviewer pointed out that the Prime Minister had said in the Parliament that things were not too bad, that activity was down a bit, but nothing like 1982 and 1983, the reply from Mr Carr was a very telling remark for someone who is the leader of the New South Wales Labor right wing. The interviewer asked:</PARA>
<PARA>But the Prime Minister and the Treasurer wouldn't say there is a recession . . . You believe there is one?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Carr answered:</PARA>
<PARA>Oh yes, based on the feedback I get from small business and based on the economic indicators I see about trends in employment and growth and investment, I think you've got to say that's the case. Now that's not a happy state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>What a fair comment from somebody who really is obviously getting out and talking to people about the implications, the impact, of the Treasurer's high interest rate policy. In fact there was nothing remarkable in what Mr Carr said. Senator Button said it-and he is the No. 3 economic Minister in this Government. He said it earlier this week. It was a simple statement of the facts-that high interest rates are sending many businesses broke, some very good businesses amongst them, and that that will lead to permanent, lasting damage to this economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the Treasurer has had a pretty hard time. He has had a rough time over telecommunications. His Budget was very badly received and he has, in his defence today, resorted to personal abuse. It is not good enough for the Treasurer of this country to respond in the way that he has. As far as his acknowledgment of these facts is concerned, I simply say to the Treasurer that he would be doing no less than his duty but to come back into the Parliament and just give us an honest and frank assessment of where the economy is. In this matter of public importance today, we are saying that if the Treasurer were prepared to do that, then that would at least be a starting point for a complete rejigging of economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are very clear: today we have had yet another set of data, which put the matter beyond doubt. Let me turn to the unemployment figures today. They fall very much within our expectations and those of many in the community who are close to these matters. Unemployment rose again. The figure for September 1990 is 7.4 per cent-a rise of 0.2 per cent since August 1990. It would have been higher if the labour force participation rate had not fallen slightly in September by 1 percentage point to 63.9 per cent. So that is on the unemployment side. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment is the achilles heel of the Labor Government. It boasts about employment growth during the time it has been in office. But the fact is, and the Government ought to realise it, that not only are people being thrown out of work but they are also unable to obtain work, and the number of people employed is falling. I say to the Government seriously: why does it not look beyond the figures? Forget about the figures, but start to think about the people whom those figures actually represent. Start to think about the Australian families who are wearing the burden of the Government's economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> For the latest month we have an interesting figure. We have a situation where the great fall-back in employment in this month was not for males but females. These females are the married mums of this country. Many of them do not go out to work because they want to; they go out to work because they have to. They have to go to work because someone has to bring in that extra dollar to pay for the kids' school shoes and an extra dollar to pay for the high interest policy which is at the centre of this Government's economic policy prescriptions. Those are real people. They are not working because they want to; they are working because they have to make ends meet. The Government's policies are seeing those people being thrown onto the unemployment scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA> I say this again and the Opposition will continue to repeat it until some honourable members opposite wake up to the effects of the Government's policies: these people are Australians. They are entitled to a future where employment is secure and they have an opportunity to work to maintain their living standards. The Treasurer ought to recognise that and be man enough to admit the failures of his economic policy and give these people a fair and even break. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see the employment figures. In a sense the Treasurer has just basically shrugged them off as he does day in and day out. He is not prepared to acknowledge that reality. It is not just these figures we rely on. One can talk to people and obtain anecdotal evidence; there is plenty of that. One can look at the ANZ Banking Group Ltd job series which would show the sort of expectations which substantiate the expectations that we have of the employment market in the months ahead. Those figures relate to the number of advertisements for jobs appearing in today's papers. They give some idea of the sort of jobs that are going to be around in the months ahead. They are falling through the floor. In the last ANZ job series we had an 8 per cent drop against the previous month. Government members keep referring to 1982 and 1983 and how this situation is nothing like it was then. They ought to look at the graph; employment is dropping like a stone. The Australian Bureau of Statistics provides another set of figures and it is again the same story with job vacancies. It is the same wherever one looks. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the Treasurer is so popular that he has to drive in unmarked Commonwealth cars with tinted windows to prevent himself from being mobbed by an adoring crowd, and that he has to go to the footy in a VIP jet to avoid the same adulation. The fact is that he ought to stop, wind the window down and talk to a few Australians about what is happening in this economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We say today, as we have said earlier in the week, that high interest rates are doing great damage to this economy. Farmers, people in the rural community and in the provincial bush, and any group in the community that one cares to mention are wearing the burden of the Government's policies. What we say to the Treasurer today we will continue to say: Wake up to yourself and see the damage that your policies are doing. Be man enough to admit your economic policy failures and do something about them. Make the changes that really would make a difference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to this matter of public importance which, as I read it, was to address the issues of high interest rates and rapidly rising unemployment, I think it is important to make one or two comments about both the contribution from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and that from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). We need to put them in some degree of perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First and foremost, anyone who was in this Parliament yesterday during Question Time would have heard that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) did admit that this Government was aware of some of the concerns that have been expressed today by speakers on the other side of the chamber. It is not a new phenomenon. I just refer honourable members to yesterday's Hansard. In response to a question about interest rates, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, it is hurting, and it is causing damage in certain areas. But the point, which seems to escape completely these unerudite economists on the other side, is that if we had not followed these policies, the damage that would have been done to these businesses and the economy as a whole would have been infinitely worse. </PARA>
<PARA>How true that statement is. The Prime Minister has clearly demonstrated that he, the Treasurer (Mr Keating), other economic Ministers, and those on this side of the House who roll the windows down and get out there and talk to our constituents understand those concerns. We also understand-those on the other side of the House have conveniently chosen not to-that people in the banking industry and economists that work within various parts of our economy are making suggestions that the level of concern and the doom and gloom being peddled by honourable members opposite is nowhere near as great as it was in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat what was said by the Westpac Banking Corporation in a very pointed press release that was put out yesterday. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>However, Westpac believes that despite the ubiquitous gloom which is developing about the prospects for the economy, and in the absence of unforeseen external events, a rerun of 1982/83 is unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA>Those on the other side have been trying to peddle the line that this Government has perpetrated on the people of Australia the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. That is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of interest rates. Did honourable members who were here during the speech of the Leader of the Opposition hear him concede that official interest rates were `down a bit'? They are down 4 per cent. What do they have to be to be down a lot? What was that translated into in ordinary interest rates for the small businesses and the home owners? What did the banks do? The interest rates were reduced by one per cent. Those on the other side say, `Well, the Treasurer, the Reserve Bank and the Government have put the rates down a bit but it is really not enough'. It is just absolute nonsense to peddle that gloom and doom nonsense which they peddle on every occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders and the Leader of the Opposition talked about some comments that were made by the State Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales on radio this morning. Bob Carr is a mate of mine. Quite frankly, he is well wide of the mark on this one. He should have a look at the opinion polls in this week's Bulletin before he starts shooting a few bullets towards this Government as to the level of policy direction and so on that has been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of the argument that has been put up by the Opposition was that the Government was directionless in terms of policy. Where have members of the Opposition been in seven years? Where have they been during the development of the wages policy through the accord? Where have they been in the last seven years, as the Treasurer rightly pointed out, in terms of the reform of the tax system which the Leader of the Opposition said we did nothing about? Where were they in the last seven years when we talked about the need to ensure the terms of trade which, as the Treasurer again pointed out, had two major adverse swings for Australia? Where are they now when they cry poormouth about the farming sector, yet they make no comment about the over-production in wool and the over-production in wheat? Was any comment made about the fact that as far as wheat supply is concerned throughout the whole world there is a glut, a surplus, the likes of which the world has not seen because of good seasons all over the place in all wheat growing countries? Was any comment made about the difficulties that farmers in Australia have in selling their products because there is a supply problem? Not one mention was made. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the terms of trade and the question of foreign debt. The foreign debt issue is one which needs careful examination. I do not know whether any people on the other side happened to see the Four Corners program last Monday week which looked at the activities of some corporate cowboys in this country over the last few years. It was most interesting to get the view of an economist working for the Australian Taxation Office who put the view that perhaps the level of foreign debt may not be as high as most people suggest in this country for the simple reason that some of those corporate cowboys, the 60-odd per cent who make up the bulk of our foreign debt, have simply been loaning to themselves-borrowing from themselves and loaning back. Maybe the level of foreign debt is not as high. Notwithstanding that, has there been any recognition from those on the other side that those sorts of issues are around? Not one bit. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there was the nonsense being peddled that the United Kingdom, the United States and other economies were not going through some problems at present. The Treasurer touched on that matter. What has happened in the last few days in the United States? It has had a budgetary problem because of an attempt made to cut the deficit-a deficit that makes ours look like a Sunday school picnic by comparison. It got into all sorts of problems. Was there any recognition of that fact? Not one. With regard to the United Kingdom-that model, that tremendous economy run by the erudite Mrs Thatcher-was there any recognition that the unemployment rate in that economy is going up and up because of policies induced by that Government? She is the one that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and others would seek to follow at every opportunity. The question of unemployment is one which I think really is of concern to us all, as it has been. Is the unemployment rate announced today getting anywhere near the 10.4 per cent figure in 1982-83 which was induced by those opposite? No, it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the response out there in the community? Let me give an example of one response. The other day I happened to talk to a small business operator at Narellan in my electorate. He is in the printing trade. This operator is working in colour printing and so on, on behalf of a range of large companies around Australia. His business is very specialised; he has about 10 presses. The business has just hired two extra sales staff to go out and chase more business. The business operator said to me, `I'm not going to let some of the lending policies that have been introduced by banks and others in the last 18 months get to my business. I am not going to sit here and let the doom and gloom merchants that we hear so often peddling their stories of devastation get to me and my business. We are a big family here'-the family concept that the Opposition makes so much of-`and I am going to ensure that our business survives and that the people who work here survive'. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to that absolutely appalling point in the contribution made by the honourable member for Flinders when he said that mums who do not want to work have been forced to go out and work because of the policies of this Government and they are the ones who are losing their jobs because of the unemployment rates that have just been announced today. What a put-down to those many women in the community who want to work, not because they may have to, as he would assert, but because they want to, because they have training and because they have particular expertise that they bring to our economy. What an ultimate put-down! What a sexist remark! I would expect nothing less from the honourable member for Flinders. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter of public importance is nothing less than a farce. How well we all remember the comments made by the honourable member for Bennelong-or was it the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)-two years ago that `these times will suit me'. I see that the puppeteer, the honourable member for Bennelong, is still pulling the strings, with his former adviser now the Leader of the Opposition. He is telling him to use the same phraseology-doom, gloom, talk the Australian economy down, and the times will suit him. I am here to tell the Opposition that that is not the case and we utterly reject those assertions. The economy is on track and the policy prescription is right. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) amends several Acts within the Industrial Relations portfolio and also makes an amendment to that part of the Defence Act 1903, which is administered by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook). The proposed amendments are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum and many are of a merely technical nature. I will confine my comments to a number of the more noteworthy amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Defence Act 1903</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Defence Act to reduce from five years to one year the period during which a former member of the Defence Force is excluded from being a member of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. The Bill also replaces the existing provision for a fixed term of appointment of five years for members with a provision which establishes that period as a maximum term. As a result, shorter periods of appointment will be possible in appropriate circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments will extend the range of people who are eligible for appointment to ensure that a wider range of candidates with relevant skills and expertise are available to serve on the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Industrial Relations Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A number of amendments are proposed to be made to the Industrial Relations Act to improve its operation, particularly in the area of award observance. Although most employers, especially those who are properly informed about their award obligations through membership of an effective employer association, observe awards, breaches are too common. In the past financial year inspectors appointed under the Act detected over 20,000 breaches. About 17,500 of these were monetary breaches. Over $4m was recovered. Most breaches are voluntarily rectified but, regrettably, legal action is frequently required. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are being proposed which will assist in securing the observance of awards in the interests of employers, workers and the community generally. This is to be achieved by:</PARA>
<PARA> - establishing means to supplement for short periods the number of inspectors who secure award observance;</PARA>
<PARA> - providing for action to be taken under the Act to bring about the observance of award provisions requiring the payment of superannuation contributions on behalf of employees;</PARA>
<PARA> - widening the range of persons who may bring proceedings relating to the non-observance of award obligations; and</PARA>
<PARA> - ensuring better employment records are kept. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Act, inspectors have a primary role in securing the observance of awards made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. At present, only persons employed or appointed under the Public Service Act 1922 may be inspectors. It is proposed to permit the appointment of other persons for a fixed term and with such of an inspector's powers as may be specified. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will permit short term peak workloads to be met more satisfactorily. In addition, it will enable persons with specialised qualifications to be appointed for particular tasks, for example, where highly technical areas of work are involved. Those persons will, of course, be obliged to exercise their powers in good faith and with the same integrity as permanent inspectors under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> An area of particular concern relates to the observance of awards which require the payment by employers of contributions to superannuation funds for the benefit of their employees. Since it was held by the High Court in 1986 that such provisions could be included in Federal awards, there has been a spectacular increase in the extent to which workers enjoy such benefits. Indeed, it is estimated that over 50 per cent of workers have some form of superannuation cover and 80 per cent of workers covered by Federal or State awards are in that position. </PARA>
<PARA> Occupational superannuation is a key element in the Government's retirement and incomes policy. Greater use of superannuation is being actively encouraged to achieve higher living standards for people who have retired. It is clear that the most important means for accelerating the spread of superannuation in recent years has been through awards. All the available evidence, including data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, suggests that a substantial minority of employers are not meeting their obligations in this area. In some cases, this may be a result of ignorance. The Government has developed, in consultation with the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI) and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), a national strategy to deal with the problem, including educative and information components and appropriate award inspections. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases legal proceedings under the Act may be necessary. A difficulty has arisen, however, in relation to the enforcement of award provisions requiring the payment by an employer of an amount on behalf of employees to a superannuation fund. Under the Act, where an award requires an employer to make a payment to an employee, the court may order the payment to be made. This does not, however, apply to a contribution required to be paid by an employer on behalf of an employee to a superannuation fund rather than to the employee concerned. An amendment is proposed so that, where such superannuation contributions have not been paid, payments may be ordered by the court to rectify the failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also to be made for the court to be able to order the payment of an amount equivalent to any return forgone as a result of the non-payment of the contributions. In consultations over the Bill the Confederation of Australian Industry has not agreed that a court should be able to order the payment of any amount in addition to unpaid superannuation contributions in a proceeding to rectify their non-payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that it would be unfair to exclude the possibility of complete restitution. Indeed, the minority of employers who deliberately refuse to meet their obligations could merely be encouraged to avoid making contributions when they are due. It should also be noted that it will be for a court to decide what amounts should be paid where a failure to make the required payments has been established. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reform is proposed to the provisions of the Act under which penalties may be imposed for award breaches and under which employees may recover amounts due to them. At present, because of the wording of the Act, an employee who is not a member of a federally registered union does not have access to the provisions of sections 178 and 179, which permit a court to order the payment of amounts due under an award. Yet in many ways the non-unionised work force is more vulnerable to award breaches. It is unacceptable for an employer to be able to evade proceedings under the Act which would compel compliance with award obligations simply because a worker does not belong to a union. Accordingly, it is proposed to revise the wording of the relevant provisions to allow workers who do not belong to a union to use the more practical and convenient remedies under the Act to recover amounts owing to them under awards. </PARA>
<PARA> An important amendment proposed in the Bill will permit regulations to be made under the Industrial Relations Act requiring employers to keep time and wages records relating to employees. The regulations will provide also penalties for failing to keep such records. There is currently no provision in the Act which requires an employer to have such records. At present, a minority of Federal awards require time and wages records to be kept. The award clauses vary considerably in style and content and no standard prescription has been established. This leaves an inadequate situation which has caused difficulties in the identification and correction of award breaches. The Act permits proceedings to be brought within six years of the occurrence of a breach.  The absence of proper records can cause substantial difficulties for both employers and employees in establishing the true position. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision will be made also to clarify the capacity of courts to award interest on amounts due under awards to employees which are recovered under the Act. At present, the availability and amount of interest depends on whether an action is brought in the Federal Court or a lower State or Territory court. A uniform rate of interest will apply to amounts for which judgment is entered but which have not been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Confederation of Australian Industry has also expressed concerns about interest being ordered to be paid in these matters. While the CAI accepts the clarification of powers of courts in this area, it does not support any extension of those powers. At present there is some doubt about the capacity of some courts to order interest on amounts due before judgment is entered for those amounts under section 178. </PARA>
<PARA> The same problems do not apply to proceedings under section 179 for amounts owing to employees. It would be anomalous for the availability of interest to depend merely on the nature of the proceedings even though exactly the same failure to pay can give rise to proceedings under sections 178 and 179 and, in either case, an order can be made for payment. It should also be remembered that the awarding of interest on amounts owing before judgment is entered will be discretionary and that, in proceedings under the Act, costs are not normally available. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments of the Industrial Relations (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A new provision is proposed for inclusion in the Industrial Relations (Consequential Provisions) Act. It concerns the application of the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 to a presidential member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. A presidential member has the status of a judge of the Federal Court of Australia and thereby comes within the Judges' Pensions Act unless, before appointment, that person was eligible for benefits under the Superannuation Act 1976. Such a person may, however, elect to forgo those benefits and to come within the operation of the Judges' Pensions Act instead.</PARA>
<PARA> No provision has been made, however, for such a presidential member's prior service as a presidential member of the former Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to be taken into account in determining whether such a person qualifies for a judicial pension under the Judges' Pensions Act. The proposed amendment so provides. The time in which such an election may be made is stipulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is made also to prevent a person who has made such an election from continuing to have entitlements under the Superannuation Act as well as under the Judges' Pensions Act. The amendment does not affect other persons who have been or may be appointed as presidential members. Their right to make an election of this type, where necessary, is provided for under the Industrial Relations Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments affecting Australian Federal Police Staff</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, consequential on the commencement of certain provisions of the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989. That Act created new employment arrangements for staff members of the AFP, bringing them into line with uniformed AFP members and replacing the previous Public Service Act arrangements. These amendments are of a consequential nature to reflect the new staffing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part 8 of the Bill removes Australian Capital Territory (ACT) magistrates from the scope of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990. That Act currently sets salaries for ACT magistrates and provides that they be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The ACT Administration will now be responsible for funding salaries of ACT magistrates and can refer the determination of their salaries direct to the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to this Act are mainly of a drafting or machinery nature. The principal amendments will allow the Commonwealth to make certain advances to the States and to recover its administration costs in relation to the coal mining industry long service leave scheme. A preliminary estimate of the Commonwealth's administration costs is about $250,000 per annum. All States which are parties to the scheme are able to recover their own administration costs and have agreed to the provision. </PARA>
<PARA>Consultation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU and the CAI have been consulted over the Bill, with detailed discussions over the award observance amendments proposed to the Industrial Relations Act taking place through the National Labour Consultative Council. Apart from the CAI's concerns, which I have already mentioned, the proposed amendments are generally accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this Bill are not expected to have a significant financial impact on the Commonwealth. The amendment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 will allow formal transfer of responsibility for ACT magistrates' salaries to the Territory. The amendment of the States Grants (Coal Mining Industry Long Service Leave) Act 1949 will facilitate cost recovery by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 which provides funding for the 1990-92 triennium. This Bill provides funding for higher education institutions for 1993 amounting to $3,204m in accordance with the Government's commitment to rolling triennial funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill reflects the Government's decision to provide $29.6m for additional intakes in 1993 and additional funding for capital projects to maintain the capital program at its 1992 level. The total funding for major works in 1993 will be $212.5m. These measures reflect the Government's continuing commitment to the expansion of the higher education system to provide for a more highly skilled and educated Australian community, as announced in the White Paper. Indeed by the end of 1993, the Government will have created some 70,000 new higher education places since 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The capital funds will allow the Government to make early decisions on new capital projects to commence in 1993 in order to facilitate the proper planning of these developments by institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased funding is being provided for 1990, 1991 and 1992 amounting to some $533m in accordance with the Government's cost supplementation arrangements. The Bill also provides for the incorporation into the Act of the Australian Postgraduate Course Awards and the Research Fellowship Scheme of the Australian Research Council (ARC). The incorporation of these programs into the Act completes the implementation of the Government's decision to fund ARC programs on a rolling triennium basis, and facilitates further rationalisation of the administration and conditions of postgraduate awards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the integration of the higher education component of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program (AESIP) from the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 with the Aboriginal participation initiative within the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. From 1993, new places for Aboriginal students will be funded with a premium to reflect the need for additional support services for Aboriginal students but no additional funding will be available under AESIP. Institutions will be required to support participation by Aboriginal students within their total educational program and account for such activities within the profile planning and negotiation process. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly the conditions of grant for the equity program have been varied to reflect a change in emphasis from funding of specific projects to the achievement of participation targets for disadvantaged groups as set out in institutional equity plans. This approach will require institutions to incorporate equity initiatives as an integral component of their management and decision-making processes and is consistent with Government objectives for equity in higher education as set out in the statement A Fair Chance for All. Institutions will be required to report on progress towards achieving their equity objectives within the profile planning and negotiation process. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill provides increased flexibility in the remitting of higher education contribution scheme semester debt to assist students who, but for the current statutory period, would have had the debt remitted. This change will provide relief to a small group of students who could not become aware of the circumstances which prevent them from continuing their studies until after the statutory period or are incapable of making an application within the period. The change will further enhance the equity of the scheme. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 and the Family Law Act 1975 to give effect to some desirable improvements in the child support scheme and to update references in the child support legislation to the Family Law Act which was amended in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The child support scheme has now been operating for just over two years and in that time we have seen a substantial turnaround in the payment of maintenance for children who are living in single parent families. The collection of amounts payable under court orders has increased from around 30 per cent pre the scheme to around 70 per cent now and many more children can expect to benefit from the scheme as its coverage extends throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in this Bill are minor but nevertheless important as they will free up certain restrictions that were included in the original Bills which, with the benefit of experience in the operation of the scheme, can now be relaxed. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important of the amendments is the one which will allow the Registrar to inform custodial parents of the progress of the recovery of amounts due to them and not fear any breach of the secrecy provisions. These people have a right to know what that position is and this amendment will ensure that can happen in future. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment is aimed at clarifying the position of counsellors employed by the Family Court in relation to the secrecy provisions of the child support legislation. In providing counselling in disputes over custody, access or child support, Family Court counsellors sometimes become aware of allegations of child abuse. If that counselling is provided pursuant to child support legislation, the secrecy provisions of that legislation may prevent the reporting of suspected abuse to child welfare authorities. This Bill will free counsellors from the secrecy obligations of the child support legislation and leave the issue of counsellors' obligations of confidentiality to be determined by the provisions of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also amend the Family Law Act in two important ways to further complement the operation of the child support scheme. Section 66 was inserted in the Family Law Act to coincide with the introduction of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 to limit the actions that can be taken in the courts for the ongoing support of children when support could and should be sought from the Child Support Agency by way of application of the administrative formula. In practice this provision has not stopped non-custodians from seeking an order from the court to pay before the custodian has lodged an application for assessment. This amendment will stop all persons from being able to circumvent the intended provisions of the Child Support (Assessment) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The other change to the Family Law Act will introduce a new condition under which a maintenance liability ordered by a court under the Family Law Act should cease. In the event that a custodian dies there is no provision for the Agency either in its own legislation or the Family Law Act to act in the best interests of the surviving children. The liability continues under the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act but the person to whom the money is to be paid is deceased. This Bill will amend the Family Law Act to end the specific liability under a court order where the person entitled to the maintenance is deceased and the order makes no provision for the continuation of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change to be brought about by this Bill will remove the need for parties to private consent agreements and courts that make orders to depart from administrative assessments to state the amount of child support payable as an annual amount. This requirement was initially included to coincide with the annual outcomes of assessments made by the Agency but is out of touch with how child support is generally viewed by the community. As a result persons and courts will now be able to specify any periodicity in their agreements and orders and they will be acceptable to the Agency. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining changes introduced in this Bill are all of a machinery nature and update references only in the child support legislation to the new enforcement provisions of the Family Law Act which were included in the Family Law Amendment Act 1989. They were not able to be introduced with that Bill at that time. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1990-91, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting on 28 and 29 June 1990. The Bill will replace the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1989 and its provisions closely follow those of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The current estimate of general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory under the Bill totals $13,508m, or about 15 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1990-91. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's Budget.  In combination with the global borrowing limits agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> General purpose payments to the States and the Northern Territory-before adjustments such as that associated with the transfer of the debits tax base-are estimated to decline by around 2 1/2 per cent in real terms in 1990-91. This is close to the reduction in 1989-90, although somewhat less marked than that in 1988-89. It will, of course, add to the effect of the significant reductions in payments to the States and global borrowing limits of recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> These reductions in payments and borrowings have been a key part of our strategy to ensure the continuation of a process of fiscal consolidation by encouraging restraint in expenditure at all levels of government but, at the same time, targeting that restraint so that the burden is shared equitably and sensibly. The decisions which this Bill implements strike a balance between the need for restraint and the requirement that the States have access to sufficient funding to provide essential public services and infrastructure. In this regard, the recently announced State Budgets for 1990-91 confirm that this strategy is beginning to produce clear dividends in terms of fiscal adjustment at the State level. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the assistance to be provided under this Bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $13,211m in 1990-91. The vast bulk of this amount comprises financial assistance grants, but it also includes special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> At the June 1990 Premiers Conference, it was agreed that the pool of financial assistance grants in 1990-91 would be determined on the basis of a reduction from the Forward Estimates at the time of $400m in savings and a further $50m to fund the special revenue assistance for the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> This involves a reduction of $450m in financial assistance grants, offset by the $50m special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory and implies therefore net savings from the Forward Estimates of general revenue grants of $400m. Consistent with the arrangements in previous years, both financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance are to be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the consumer price index in the year to the March quarter 1991 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers Conference, so that the real level of assistance agreed at the Conference is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Financial assistance grants are to be distributed on the basis of Grants Commission's updated per capita relativities based on the five-year review period included in the Commission's 1990 report. As in recent years, the relativities are applied to a combined pool of financial assistance grants and the base level of hospital funding grants. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also included in the Bill to make any necessary minor adjustments to financial assistance grants in 1990-91 and the base level of assistance in respect of the recoupment of States taxes paid for the first time in 1989-90 by Commonwealth government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1989-90 at a base level of $50m. Similar assistance was provided to the Northern Territory in 1989-90. The Government intends, as a matter of policy, to progressively move the Northern Territory to a financial basis comparable with the States. Nevertheless, had special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory been terminated in 1990-91, the disproportionately large fall in the Territory's general revenue grants which would have resulted and the fiscal adjustment this would have necessitated could not have been readily accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the payment of $296.8m in interest free capital grants to the States and the Northern Territory. This is the same nominal amount as provided in 1989-90 after adjusting for the recoupment of 90 per cent of State motor taxes levied on Telecom Australia and Australia Post from 1989. It was necessary to effect this recoupment from the capital grant as, unlike the other State taxes now paid by Commonwealth government business enterprises, the relative impact of collections by the States is not reflected in the Grants Commission's calculations. </PARA>
<PARA> No provision is made in this Bill for payments of general purpose assistance to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). However, provisions in Appropriation Bill No. 2 allow for analogous payments to be made to the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few changes from the arrangements put into place last year. This Bill allows for a reduction in the payment of financial assistance grants from that agreed at Premiers Conference so as to facilitate the transfer to the States and Territories of the debits tax base announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 19 July. Arrangements for the transfer, which is expected to take effect on 1 December, are proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA> A further change is the inclusion of a clause to complement amendments-presently before Parliament-to the Higher Education Funding Act to protect the rights and responsibilities of higher education institutions to make their own decisions, independent of Government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for their students and the imposition and collection of fees for that purpose. These provisions strengthen, and where necessary protect, the legitimate autonomy of higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated at the time of introducing the amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, the Government considers it unfortunate that there need to be provisions of this kind at all. However, the Government is conscious that the primary source of funds for student organisations is the fees collected on their behalf by institutions. Some States have in the past interfered with the arrangements for the funding of services and amenities to students and there is some possibility that this might occur again. We are not prepared to see that happen but we hope that these provisions will never need to be invoked. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with the State governments and the Budget. I commend the Bill to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Australian Maritime Museum Bill is to establish the Australian National Maritime Museum as an independent statutory authority. The Government considers that the Museum should have an independent role, similar to other national collecting institutions, which will provide it with a permanent and distinctive presence in the community. The Museum's statutory status will also strengthen its ability to seek sponsorship from the corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Museum's building, with its billowing sail roof line, occupies a prominent site at the entrance to Darling Harbour. This site, which provides a superb maritime environment for the Museum, has been leased to the Commonwealth by the New South Wales Government. In November 1985 the Commonwealth Government agreed to provide $30m to enable the construction of the building for the Australian National Maritime Museum. I accepted the building on behalf of the Commonwealth on 2 October 1990. The work of establishing and installing the exhibitions, including the fit-out of the building, is now under way. This work is expected to take 12 months to complete. It was hoped at the beginning of the project that the Museum would open during the bicentennial celebrations. It is now anticipated that the Museum will open its doors to the public during the second half of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for an Australian national maritime museum, reflecting the significance of maritime activity in the history and cultural life of Australians, was recognised over a decade ago in the 1975 Report of the Committee of Inquiry on Museums and National Collections, better known as the Pigott report. This Government reaffirmed the need for an institution to provide Australians with a comprehensive record of their past and present dependence on the sea. The Australian National Maritime Museum will provide a national focus for our maritime history and an insight for domestic and international visitors into a major facet of our cultural heritage tradition. </PARA>
<PARA> An earlier Bill to establish the Museum was introduced in Parliament in 1986, but lapsed due to the 1987 Federal elections. Subsequently the Government reviewed its involvement in the development of Commonwealth museums and similar collecting and exhibiting institutions, and this further delayed consideration of this matter. The Government announced in the 1988-89 Budget context that the Australian National Maritime Museum should be primarily an exhibition-oriented institution, and it provided capital and recurrent financial resources to reflect this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Museum will exhibit, in cooperation with other public and private institutions, maritime historical material included in the national maritime collection, or objects on loan to the Museum. The Museum will also undertake research and disseminate information relating to both Australian maritime history and the functions of the Museum. Most importantly, the Museum will have a national role and will complement rather than compete with State or Territory institutions. Strong cooperative links are being forged between the national, State and regional maritime museums. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill empowers the Museum to develop a collection of maritime historical material known as the national maritime collection. The Council will determine the material to be included in this collection, based upon criteria and guidelines approved by the Minister. The Museum will also be able to purchase historical and other relevant material, accept gifts and bequests, and acquire and operate vessels of historical interest and significance. </PARA>
<PARA> Maritime historical material is defined in the Bill to mean material relating to Australian maritime history and maritime archaeology, which includes the history of the interaction of people with the Australian marine environment, and the history of sea travel for every purpose. The reference to Australian marine environment includes the sea above the continental shelf and the subsoil of the continental shelf adjacent to the Australian coast. It also includes the environment of the lakes, rivers and internal waters of Australia. This allows the Museum effectively to acquire any material of a maritime nature, provided it has a connection with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will apply not only to the Australian mainland but also to its external territories, past and present. However, material of significance from Australian external territories in the Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans and Antarctica will only be transferred to the National Maritime Collection after consultation by my Department and the Museum with the local governing body of the relevant Territory. Much of Australia's historical material reflecting the involvement of its people with the sea has never been exhibited on a large scale. The Government intends that the displays will be exciting and stimulating; the Museum will not be a mere collection of inanimate objects. On opening, there will be six major exhibition themes, namely, discovery-the finding of Australia; passengers-the long sea voyage; commerce-the working sea; Navy-protecting Australia; leisure-sun, surf and sails; and Australia-USA-linked by the sea. The Australia-USA gallery will be a permanent gallery, funded as a bicentennial gift from the United States, to commemorate more than two centuries of maritime contact between the two countries. Another gallery will be used for temporary and travelling exhibitions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Museum's fleet will be a major attraction, moored at the two finger-wharves alongside the Museum, complementing the indoor exhibitions. Some of the most notable vessels in the fleet include the Akarana, an 1888 gaff rigged racing cutter which was a bicentennial gift from New Zealand; the Kathleen Gillett, a veteran of the first Sydney-Hobart yacht race; Norway's bicentennial gift, the John Louis, a sturdy pearling lugger from Western Australia; and vessels representing the Royal Australian Navy. Some of these ships are on loan from our other national collecting institutions. One very important vessel that will not be at the wharves is Australia's best known yacht, Australia II. Instead, it will dominate the Museum's Tall Gallery. </PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with its primary role as an exhibition-oriented institution, the Museum will be a place of education, participation and enjoyment-in short, a dynamic institution. Indeed, one of the refreshing features of the Museum will be its acknowledgment of children as an important part of the visiting public. There will be an education centre located within the Museum complex for use by groups who visit the Museum as part of the formal education programs offered by the Museum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Museum will have an exciting calendar of indoor and outdoor entertainments throughout the year. One of the Museum's biggest attractions will be the floating exhibits about which I spoke earlier. Visitors may expect to board some of the vessels to find costumed role players, cooking demonstrations in the galleys or demonstrations of mast climbing or sail furling. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Museum's management. A Museum council is to be established by this Bill which will ensure the proper and efficient management of the Museum and determine its policy, subject to ministerial direction. The Council will give directions to the Director of the Museum with regard to the management of the affairs of the Museum. The Council will consist of a chairperson, a director and no fewer than seven nor more than 10 members appointed by the Governor-General. An appointed member will possess knowledge and experience relating to Australian maritime history or other areas of knowledge relevant to the affairs of the Museum. The chairperson and other members are to be appointed on a part time basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The day-to-day management of the Museum will be conducted by a Director who shall be appointed for a period of up to seven years. The Director shall have all the powers of a secretary of a department in relation to the staff of the Museum, who will be employed under the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Museum will be funded through the annual budgetary process, the Bill also provides for the establishment of a National Maritime Museum fund. Money paid into the fund will include gifts and bequests or money received from the disposal of property given to the Museum, other than on trust. Money from the fund will be spent in accordance with the functions of the Museum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is encouraging the Museum to adopt an entrepreneurial outlook in organising its activities. The Bill empowers the Museum to develop sponsorship proposals and to carry out a broad range of commercial activities. The Museum has embarked already on an active program of seeking corporate support and raising the Museum's public profile. Situated as it is on a prominent site in Darling Harbour, the Museum will benefit from visitors to the Darling Harbour complex. The Museum will also attract substantial numbers of tourists in its own right, which will in turn benefit Darling Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> The running costs of the Museum in 1990-91 are estimated to be in the order of $7m, including the cost of preserving, documenting and building the collection. The increased costs associated with the Museum becoming a statutory authority are expected to be offset by its ability to generate revenue through sponsorship and commercial activities such as charging an admission fee. In addition, part of its building will be leased for use as a restaurant to serve its patrons and as a shop for those visitors who wish to purchase posters, books and a range of quality goods and souvenirs to remind them of their visit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Museum is required by this Bill to prepare annual estimates of expenditure. The Council shall be responsible for the preparation of strategic plans on a three-year cycle, as well as annual operational plans. The Museum shall be subject to audit by the Auditor-General, and will be obliged to prepare an annual report by virtue of being subject to certain provisions of the Audit Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the Australian National Maritime Museum by this Bill is an example of the Government's commitment to the preservation and display of Australia's cultural heritage. The Museum will become one of our most important national cultural institutions as well as a centre of excellence in communicating our national maritime heritage. The Museum will be recognised as a place where the richness and diversity of our past and present achievements as a maritime nation are documented and can be experienced. It will not restrict its displays to the history of Australia as a maritime nation; it will also focus on our contemporary achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> The spacious forecourt, which opens onto a dramatic view of the city skyline, has been named the Ben Lexcen Walk in honour of the man who made maritime history by designing the Australian winner of the America's Cup. Significant maritime achievements of all Australians will be well-documented in the collection. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been amended in the Senate to assist the scrutiny by the Parliament of the Museum and the actions of the Minister in relation to the Museum, and to give the Council a greater range of options when considering disposing of items in the Museum's collection. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this new national Museum will become a proud achievement with a strong commitment to educating and entertaining all its visitors. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill comes before us after the Senate added it to the original legislation that was presented to the House of Representatives a couple of weeks ago. The Opposition does not oppose it and, indeed, in the Senate our colleagues, along with the Australian Democrats and, indeed, independent members of the Senate, supported it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subject is timely for it comes when there is quite a deal of controversy surrounding the establishment of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). Under the original legislation the Authority was to be located in Newcastle, amazingly enough in the electorate of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who first introduced this legislation-although we would not dare accuse him of pork-barrelling. That decision has subsequently been axed and that caused a great deal of heartache and anguish for the Australian Labor Party in the Newcastle area. Only yesterday members of the Newcastle civic leadership were here, along with Labor members from the Newcastle region, to meet with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins). </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of that meeting they have gone home with some sort of relief. I would like to place on record the fact that the Opposition has always seen the AMSA legislation as being an opportunity for the Government to create some efficiencies within the Department of Transport and Communications, as far as the provision of maritime services on behalf of the Commonwealth is concerned. However, we were opposed to the move of the new Authority out of Canberra to any city-whether it be Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Newcastle, Darwin or wherever-unless the Government could provide us with sensible reasons that would indicate that there was an economic or operational advantage in shifting the Authority from Canberra to another place. We are certainly not opposed to shifting it to Newcastle; we are simply opposed to shifting it out of Canberra unless there is a justifiable argument for that, and the Government has failed to put one forward. It has caused it some anguish, and it deserves to dwell on that anguish for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment which is being put to the House this afternoon, as I understand it, will limit the powers of members of the staff of the new Authority and will mean that any borrowings, for example, will have to be approved by the Authority itself rather than by individual employees of the Authority. Some would argue that this makes the new Authority somewhat less flexible, but it is a recommendation of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee-a body of the Senate which in most cases puts forward very sensible recommendations to the Parliament. On the basis of its recommendation and on the basis that this legislation has gone through the Senate with strong support, the Opposition does not oppose this amendment to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill 1990 and the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 which we are debating cognately are terribly significant to the economic plight of Australia, to our exporters and to every Australian, as the success or otherwise of the waterfront reforms that are currently under way will very much influence Australia's standards of living and the strength of our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After the last election in March this year the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in a very conveniently leaked letter to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley)-it was on the front page of every daily newspaper in Australia-said that he wanted to see micro-economic reform become one of the tenets of this fourth term of the Hawke Government. He wanted the Minister to go out and get tough with the trade unions and the employers and to get on with the job of delivering the very substantial gains that were there for the asking through micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as many people who have an interest in this area would point out, one of the glaring examples of inefficiency in Australia's economic structure is our waterfront. Indeed, one could extend it beyond the waterfront to the entire transport infrastructure of Australia, which is in desperate need of reform. If we can implement reform in this area, there are several billions of dollars of extra income for Australia to be earned each and every year. Indeed, the Industry Commission has highlighted the fact that, with reform of our transport infrastructure and reform of power generation, Australia can add an extra $16,000m a year to its gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> So we are talking about something that is not inconsequential. We are talking about something that has the major potential to earn extra income for this country. It is an opportunity for every Australian to enjoy a higher standard of living and a better quality of life and it is an opportunity for young Australians to cash in on the extra jobs that are waiting to unfold if a government has the courage, the determination and the ability to capitalise on those micro-economic reforms that the Industry Commission has so skilfully highlighted. </PARA>
<PARA> The waterfront has become a major aspect of the Government's micro-economic reform agenda in this the fourth term of the Hawke Government. The history of waterfront reform dates back a long time but, to be more pertinent, in the term of the Hawke Government-which dates back to March 1983-the Government has highlighted its interest in reforming the waterfront. In 1984 it established an inquiry headed by a gentleman named Webber. He undertook an inquiry which lasted two years. At the conclusion of that inquiry the Government said, `My goodness, that has gone past quickly; we might have to do something here. Let's have another inquiry'. So it had another inquiry under the auspices of the Inter-State Commission-a body which has now been axed simply because it made recommendations that the Government did not agree with. </PARA>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission's inquiry into reforms on the waterfront took 2 1/2 years and it reported back to the Parliament in April last year. The report contained a range of very sensible recommendations. The Liberal and National parties were not entirely happy with every single one of the recommendations, but we believed that the package of reforms that were being put forward by the Inter-State Commission, after its 2 1/2 years of investigation and the previous two years of investigation by the Webber inquiry, were worth implementing and would deliver real and achievable gains for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Then on 1 June last year in this House the then Minister for Transport and Communications, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), introduced a major response to the Inter-State Commission's recommendations which outlined the Government's proposals for waterfront reform. Yet again the Government was not prepared to take the really hard decisions. Despite the fact that we had had 4 1/2 years of inquiries involving two separate groups, the Government set up another committee called the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA). That Authority was established in the last week of September last year-it is just over 12 months old. It was given the task of implementing the Government's reform agenda-an agenda which it was permitted to have extended over a three-year period-the goal being a 30 per cent gain in productivity to be achieved through WIRA over a three-year period. Many people would say that 30 per cent is a tremendous gain, but later in my address this afternoon I will show how this 30 per cent gain in productivity stands up to the sorts of reforms that we have seen on other waterfronts around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I talk in these terms this afternoon is to highlight the classic fashion in which a Labor Government tries to engage in reform that affects its mates in the trade unions of Australia, through the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Waterside Workers Federation and so on. It gets good with the rhetoric; it says that we have to have reform and that it is going to bring Australia's economy up to scratch, that we are going to be more competitive and that the Government will do all the things that sound right. It gets the rhetoric right, and then it goes about having committees and inquiries, and it drags on and on. By the time Australia actually sees this agenda achieved, if the Government can achieve its proposed reform agenda, it will have taken nine years of this Government's hard efforts to get a 30 per cent increase in productivity on our waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course this is the case because this Government is hamstrung by its very close relationship with the trade union movement. In these industrial relations matters, the trade union movement takes a very keen interest-an interest which, of course, relates to its own self-interest because in these reforms there is a threat to the very interests of the trade union movement in Australia and to one of the most historic aspects of that movement, the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> So they take a long time to carry out this reform, and they involve their friends as much as possible in the reform program. Of course if we look at the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority we note that it is made up of representatives of the Government, representatives of the stevedores and representatives of the trade unions-the ACTU and the Waterside Workers Federation. Many people who have had experience in the industry would say that if we look at this group of three, we could almost say that they are the very people who are responsible for the inefficiencies on the waterfront that have caused the need for reform. So we are asking the people who have caused the inefficiencies to undertake the reform of those inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Many would say that that is the wrong way to go about it. Certainly those people have a right to take an interest in it; certainly they should be consulted in any reforms put forward. But how about the people who actually use the waterfront? How about the people who actually pay for everything that goes on at the waterfront? Surely they ought to have some sort of say in what is going to happen with waterfront reform. But, no, we do not have them involved in the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority-they might have a different view from that of the club. We keep them happy with a small advisory committee that meets every so often; we take note of what they say and that is as far as it goes. So we have not seen the very people who use the waterfront and pay for all the activities that go on there actually involved in the whole program of reform. </PARA>
<PARA> When we go across the Tasman to New Zealand, we see that the Labour Government there has enacted quite commendable reforms on its waterfront, and we see too that the New Zealand Government has involved the users of the waterfront in the reform process. It knew that they were the people who had the driving influence and the driving interest in ensuring that the maximum efficiencies would be gained through reform on the waterfront, so it involved them intricately in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, we have not seen that approach here. I suppose it reflects the entire attitude of the Australian waterfront, and that attitude has been one of cost-plus. If it means we can get on with the job and can satisfy the claims of the trade unions or the claims of the shippers, whomever it be, let us just accept the arguments and if that costs us some more, we can just pass that on. Indeed, Ivan Deveson, the Chairman of the Australian Shipping Users Group and the Chief Executive Officer of Nissan Australia, a person well known throughout the country, said in a speech made in Melbourne just the other day:</PARA>
<PARA>In my life, I have never ever seen an industry where the customer is so irrelevant as I do in Australia's waterfront. I would describe Australia's waterfront now as the most rampant cost plus culture I have ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA>This typifies the entire attitudinal problem that exists on the Australian waterfront. It is the cost-plus syndrome. Those users of the Australian waterfront should have been involved in the authority that was to set about the reforms of the waterfront-people like the miners, retailers, farmers, exporters and importers. They are the sorts of people who have a driving interest in what goes on on Australia's waterfront, because they pay for it. They should have been involved in that program. </PARA>
<PARA> So after six years of a Labor Government we have not progressed very far with waterfront reform. It is six years since the days when the Australian Labor Party indicated that it wanted to enact some reform on the waterfront. Indeed, it has been said to me that this Government is engaging in a Claytons waterfront reform program. It is the waterfront reform you are having when you are not having any waterfront reform. That is because nothing has actually happened on the Australian waterfront since the Government started. There has been not one redundancy made to this date as a result of the establishment of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. I know that it claims the removal of some 300 nightwatchmen is a great part of the gains that it has achieved so far, but I am reliably informed that the removal of those night- watchmen actually took place before the WIRA program was even set up in the first place, so it is not quite right for the Authority to claim that as one of its credits. </PARA>
<PARA> So Australia still has one of, if not the most, inefficient waterfronts in the world. The Industry Commission I think said that Australia's waterfront was only 50 per cent as productive as the average European waterfront-the average, not the most efficient European waterfront-and only 40 per cent as productive as the average Asian waterfront. So Australia is very inefficient when compared with waterfronts around the world. Yet here we are, a country that depends upon its exports, a country so far away from its international marketplace, that surely we should have the most efficient waterfront in the world rather than one of the most inefficient. It is worth noting that the Australian waterfront is now 60 per cent more expensive than the New Zealand waterfront since the New Zealand Government enacted its reforms last year. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these added costs make a tremendous problem for Australia's exporters and for our importers. They add to the cost of living in this country and reduce our ability to compete. And, of course, compete this country must if it is to have any hope of getting itself out of the economic malaise that this Government has driven us into. We can compare the performance of waterfronts around the world. They talk about those big cranes handling only 11 boxes an hour on the Australian waterfront, while the exact same crane on the Singapore waterfront handles 25 boxes an hour. Such comparisons confirm that the Australian waterfront, despite the talk of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and various other members of the Government, is well and truly behind the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission has highlighted the fact that if we had a government prepared to enact reforms on the waterfront, there are some $860m worth of savings to be had by the Australian economy each and every year, and there could be a boost of some $2.5 billion to the gross domestic product. It is worth reading a report which is to be released very shortly by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics. In fact, I put out a press release on this yesterday which got a run in the Australian Financial Review, although I note that it did not attribute any of the comments to me. But that is nothing new from the Financial Review. The Bureau says in its report soon to be released that unreliability on the waterfront is costing Australia $1 billion annually. That is simply because of unreliability. When ships come to Australia, they are not sure whether they will be held up for a day, a week or a month. They can arrive here and all of a sudden a go-slow or a strike will occur with no advance warning, and the ships waiting at sea or at dock, which cost $30,000 or $40,000 a day for every day they are delayed, have no idea how long it will be before they can move. They may be delayed for four days or 10 days, which would cost $400,000. It adds up very quickly indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been pointed out to us by various economic analysts that a 20 per cent improvement in productivity on the Australian waterfront will boost our gross domestic product by $1,100m a year. New Zealand has recognised just how valuable proper and effective reforms are on the waterfront. The New Zealand Government has made great strides in waterfront reform, and this reform is paying off in terms of shipping costs across the New Zealand waterfront. Port company employees, which include administrative people such as clerks, have dropped from 2,700 to around 1,700-a 37 per cent reduction-and port charges have dropped in real terms as a consequence. The port of Auckland has delivered a 10 per cent reduction in port charges in real terms. Some container terminals have dropped their charges by as much as 15 per cent since the introduction of competition in and between ports. The number of waterside workers has dropped by about 50 per cent, and improvements in work practices have combined with this to produce a roll-on, roll-off saving of up to $10,000 per ship per call. In the case of one operator, this has translated to an annual savings of $600,00 per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall stevedoring costs have been reduced by between 20 and 40 per cent and in some cases cost savings have been as much as 66 per cent. The New Zealand Government was able to achieve all those significant gains simply by introducing reforms last year. It has taken the New Zealand Government a few months to implement those reforms but they have lifted the productivity of the New Zealand waterfront by 100 per cent. Yet this Government thinks that having a 30 per cent increase in productivity over the course of three years is a real breast-beating exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that other countries, such as New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Italy, are all engaging in major waterfront reforms, whilst our economy languishes because we cannot be efficient in our transport infrastructure, particularly our waterfront. We need a lift. Our exporters and farmers need a lift. Our farmers are in such a deep crisis at present that they do need some assistance. One of the greatest ways of providing assistance to them would be to make our waterfront more efficient by following the sorts of reforms which the New Zealand Government has had the courage to implement. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I recall that when the wheat deregulation debate took place in this House not that long ago, one of the things that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) said to the wheat farmers of Australia at the time was, `Look, accept this change. I know it does not necessarily gel too well with you fellows, but accept it because we will go out there and reform the Australian waterfront. We will make it so much more efficient and that will help you tremendously financially'. The Australian wheat farmers said, `Maybe that is a good idea. Maybe we will accept your reforms on the basis that you can do things like that.'</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of what has happened today, Australia's wheat farmers are being cheated very savagely indeed. New Zealand farmers are experiencing significant gains. I happened to pick up a farming magazine in New Zealand a little while ago and I read a section about how the waterfront reforms enacted by the New Zealand Government had provided New Zealand dairy farmers with, on average, an extra $5,600 income each year. Such reforms translate to extra money in the pockets of farmers, manufacturers, exporters and even importers. All end up benefiting at the end of the day. Similarly, the Australian people would benefit through extra jobs and an increased standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> So what does the Government do? The Government introduces this legislation into the House, probably 12 months later than it should have done. The Government has promised gains of up to 30 per cent over three years. But one must ask the question: as a result of this legislation, as a result of the Government's reform program, will there be real competition on Australia's waterfront? The simple answer to that question is `no, there will not'. Will the Waterside Workers Federation still be in control of Australia's waterfront? The answer is `yes, it will be'. Will there still be compulsory trade unionism on Australia's waterfront? The answer is `yes, there will be'. Will employers in real, practical terms have the right to hire and fire the people whom they want for the particular jobs they have? The answer is `no, they will not'. Will security of tenure be removed? Security of tenure, which is a feature of the Australian waterfront, has been promised in these reforms to continue to the year 2018. So all the people on the Australian waterfront at present have their jobs guaranteed until the year 2018. Will that quite unique exercise be removed in these reforms? The answer is `no, it will not'. </PARA>
<PARA> So this is what the Government is proposing to do: very little indeed. This legislation does not go very far towards achieving some of the reforms that the Inter-State Commission highlighted could be achieved and what New Zealand and the United Kingdom have shown us can be achieved. The Government did not pick up all the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission. It was said that it did not do so because some of the recommendations were a bit too tough and would offend the Government's trade union mates. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, our pace of reform is moving very slowly indeed. If one wants to gauge the speed of reform on the Australian waterfront-take a speedo reading of our pace of reform-one needs only to go to the Budget Papers introduced into the House in August by the Treasurer and compare what the Government indicated it was going to spend in redundancy payments on the waterfront through the enactment of its reforms with what it has spent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government indicated it was going to spend around about $40m and, off the top of my head, I think it spent about $9m in the last financial year. In other words, the pace of reform is moving at about 25 per cent of the pace the Government originally intended at this particular stage in the game. The Government said that it had hoped to process some 500 redundancies of waterside workers over the past 12 months. Indeed, there have been no redundancies of waterside workers over the past 12 months. So we really are moving very slowly. </PARA>
<PARA> To date no enterprise based agreements (EBA) have been agreed to. I know some are being negotiated and some may well indeed be before the Waterside Industry Reform Authority. But at this stage no EBAs have been agreed to by the Government, and that is causing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) to start sweating a little because he promised that he would resign as a Minister if he could not get significant reform on the Australian waterfront up and running within 12 months. The Minister has now redefined `significant' and I suspect he probably will achieve what he calls `significant'. But to this date nothing has been put down on the table that has been agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> The only thing that has really been agreed to is the size of the redundancy package. The size of that package is real beaut for the people down there on the waterfront. Redundancy packages will be paid to retiring waterside workers 55 years of age or older. That in itself poses an interesting question: why are we offering massive redundancy packages, which average out at $100,000 per person, to people who are over 55 years of age and not that many years away from retirement anyway?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the interesting facets of reform in other countries around the world is that they have not had a 55-year age barrier for redundancy packages. So what we really need to ask ourselves is why we are paying huge redundancy packages to people who probably are not that many years away from retirement anyway. The $100,000 average redundancy package offered to Australian waterside workers compares most favourably with the maximum redundancy payment offered by the New South Wales Government through its State Rail Authority reforms. It offered a maximum redundancy package of $80,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United Kingdom, the average redundancy payment offered to those dockers who left the waterfront was #35,000, which translates to about $A70,000 to $A80,000. But for the $A70,000 to $A80,000 packages, the United Kingdom got a 65 per cent increase in productivity. For our $100,000 packages, we will get a 30 per cent increase in productivity over three years. For considerably less money, the Brits got a 65 per cent increase in productivity over 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> In New Zealand, where there has been a 100 per cent increase in productivity over 12 months, an average redundancy package of about $A24,000 was paid. So for what Australia is getting in terms of productivity gains, it is paying through the nose to its waterside workers in redundancy payments. Indeed, for every one per cent increase in productivity on the Australian waterfront, Australians will have to pay out $10m, with half of that money coming directly from taxpayers and the other half from the shippers-all of which ultimately comes from the pockets of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> So these redundancy packages are a burden on the Australian taxpayer. They are a burden on Australia's exporters. And indeed, it is questionable whether we really will achieve the sorts of reforms that the Government has said it hopes to achieve simply because at the commencement of negotiations, the wharfies said that there would be no diminution of employment conditions and work practices. </PARA>
<PARA> That has proven to be very prophetic because the rorts still exist on Australia's waterfront. Only last week, I was down on the waterfront and I asked a representative of the Waterside Workers Federation whether the rort still existed today whereby the WWF insisted that a derrick crane with one seat and three levers had two drivers. One seat, three levers and two drivers-that is the requirement of the Federation. The secretary of that particular Waterside Workers Federation branch said, `Oh yes, that still exists.' So do so many other rorts which are the result of inefficiencies and silly work practices and which have been going on for decades. We have to get rid of those rorts. </PARA>
<PARA> One rort, of course, is the artificial ban by the trade unions on foreign flagged vessels using the trans-Tasman shipping route. That is causing a great deal of complaint around the traps at the moment. Indeed, the New Zealand Minister for Transport, Mr Jeffries, has complained that whilst New Zealand has introduced major waterfront reforms, New Zealand exporters hit a brick wall when they reach Australia's ports. That is because this Government has not engaged in proper waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw a only few weeks ago in Canberra the former New Zealand Prime Minister, Geoffrey Palmer, come to Australia to sign the closer economic relations (CER) agreements. We will never have proper CER working until that barrier of union to union bans on foreign flag vessels operating between Australia and New Zealand in the trans-Tasman route are knocked down. </PARA>
<PARA> What this Bill really does is cheat the average Australian of the opportunity to cash in on the full potential of reform of our Australian waterfront. It leaves waterside workers still in a privileged position. They still have security of tenure until the year 2018. This Bill denies Australia's exporters the opportunity to be competitive, to go out there and sell more and to earn more money for Australia. Indeed, it denies the average Australian the opportunity to gain from the macro-economic benefits that would flow from capitalising on waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note using the Orani economic model for the Business Council of Australia on a recent Economic Planning Advisory Council discussion paper that if we can cash in on reform in our waterfront, the mining industry will expand by 7 per cent; the services industry will expand by 2 per cent; our manufacturing industry will expand by one per cent; and wages and jobs following longer term output will show an improvement of $6.1 billion. The waterfront accounts for $2.562 billion of that. Real wages will rise by 3 per cent and 17,000 additional jobs will be created. That is if there is a government that is prepared to engage in real waterfront reform and other reforms throughout the Australian transport infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we really go about reform? The first and foremost requirement is that we must have true and genuine competition on the Australian waterfront. We must give the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority a new set of goals to work to, matching those goals that other countries have been able to achieve. If we are going to offer packages to waterside workers to encourage them to leave early, then let us get some real gains in efficiency for the money that we are paying out. In order to do that, there must be discipline within the work force. If there is discipline within the work force on the waterfront, security of tenure must be removed. That makes waterside workers like every other Australian employee; their employer has a right to hire and fire them if they do not perform. We must have that rule. We must be prepared to scrap compulsory unionism on the Australian waterfront because I am afraid to say that whilst trade unionism had a very significant, important and useful role on the waterside years ago, I think its time has passed. We must be able to establish legally binding contracts. We must then also encourage the States to advertise their ports privately. If we can do those sorts of things, then we will really start to see some major efficiency gains occurring on the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, when we look at this legislation before the House today, the Opposition does not oppose it simply because we believe that some reform, miserable and meagre though it may be, is better than no reform. On the basis of that philosophy, the Opposition will not be opposing this legislation but will be moving an amendment in the committee stage later today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had to wait for 28 minutes to hear the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) tell us everything that is wrong with the Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill and the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill, and then in the last 50 seconds make a momentous decision that the Opposition will not oppose the legislation. If I had legislation before the House and it had all the ills that the honourable member for Gilmore seemed to find in this legislation, I would most certainly oppose it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We heard a terrible tale of woe from the honourable member for Gilmore. I was sitting here wondering how, if so many people have worked on this legislation and had an input into it, so many people could get it so wrong. Having said that, I am very pleased to speak on these two important Bills before the House. Indeed, few areas in the Australian work force have been subjected to more comment than the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard many stories. We have heard the story that the waterfront is inefficient, unreliable, and things such as that. This is not something that developed overnight. The honourable member for Gilmore would know that the coalition was in government for something like 30 years. What did it do? It is all very well to stand up in this House and tell a tale of woe about what is wrong with the waterfront. But the time the Opposition had control of the Treasury benches was when all the inefficiencies were most evident in the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> There are difficulties on the waterfront-we all know that-but it is a bit naive to just put the causes down to one theme which, as usual, is the waterside workers. The poor old Waterside Workers Federation comes in for a lot of flak in this place. What people do not realise is that in every dispute on the waterfront-and we might be dealing with something like 30 unions on the waterfront-it is the Waterside Workers Federation that cops the flak. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, much of the discussion concerning the waterfront industry has been very biased and ill informed. It has been interesting in the time I have been in this House to hear people attacking the Waterside Workers Federation and other unions. When they are here giving vent to their spleen about the waterside workers, I always issue a challenge to them to come with me to the waterside at Port Kembla, just as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, has visited it and other places. I challenge those people to come and put what they are saying in this House to the workers there and see some of the difficulties that the workers are faced with. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember when some people here started talking about bans being put on ships. I make it a point when there is a ban on a ship in Port Kembla harbour to go down there and look at those ships. Most of them are just rust buckets. I would not go out to sea on those ships; they are dreadful. I always say, `Come down with me to Port Kembla, talk to the workers there and we will see what is going on'. It is interesting that, although those officers have always been very quick to criticise, they have been very slow to accept my invitation. In fact, they have never accepted my invitation. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will go a long way to reform the waterfront. For reasons different from those of the honourable member for Gilmore, I wonder whether the legislation will go far enough. I cannot for the life of me see the point in having major ports in the inner city areas of some of our coastal cities. For example, containers go down to Balmain in Sydney and even Botany Bay. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore talked about some overseas practices. I have had a look at some of the major container ports, for example, in Sweden and Holland. The port at Rotterdam is the largest in the world. What we have to do in Australia is establish one or two major container ports along the eastern coast. If we are going to clean up the waterfront, it has to be more than just the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The inefficiencies that we hear about, such as the ships waiting offshore, concern not only what is happening in the waterfront, but the interface with the waterfront-that is, the road and rail systems into the waterfront. We started a rail link from the inland to the coast, the Maldon-Dombarton rail link. It was to be a major contribution to the revitalisation of Port Kembla. What happened? When the Liberal Government came into New South Wales, the first thing it did was to cancel work on that line, claiming that it was not needed. We now have a half-completed line. That line could be bringing produce and coal down. When we are talking about reform in the waterfront, we should be talking about not just what is happening in the waterfront; we should include the interface. </PARA>
<PARA> In the southern area of Port Kembla there is a goat track for a road. The Federal Government will provide money to have an export development road linking the highlands to the port, but again the New South Wales Government will not take that up. If we are going to talk about waterfront reform, it includes more than what happens on the waterfront; it includes all the interface behind the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has embarked on this important reform of the waterfront industry and it is, as has been said, a major element of the Government's program of macro-economic reform. These requirements are designed to improve waterfront efficiency, reliability and productivity which will in turn assist our exporting sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> The agenda for reform is without doubt the most ambitious ever taken on the waterfront. I could not understand what the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) was saying. We had 30 minutes of him saying that this is nothing. We are talking about the most ambitious reforms ever undertaken on the waterfront. The stevedoring unions have recognised the need for change. They have actually pursued the achievement of the objectives about the in-principle agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, and in conjunction with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the unions are determined to pursue the rationalisation of the unions covering the industry in accordance with the ACTU policy. The unions have not been slow to respond to the challenge. They know that change is inevitable on the waterfront. I do not know why there is such objection to talking to the unions about it. </PARA>
<PARA> After hearing what the honourable member for Gilmore was talking about we may ask: Does he not want negotiation? What does he want to do? Does he want to go in there with a confrontationist approach? Does he want to tie up the entire waterfront in Australia? That is what he is talking about. Surely it is better to negotiate. We are talking about major and fundamental change in work practices over many years. Fundamental to the reforms outlined in the agreement is a shift from the present industry-wide employment practice to enterprise-based employment-there are negotiations going on about that at the moment-and other new employment arrangements where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new arrangement employment responsibilities which have rested with the industry will be assumed by individual employers. This is an arrangement more in line with the practice in other industries. These changed arrangements will contribute to achieving a competitive and productive waterfront industry with improved service to the clients. This initiative is to be assisted by a work force rejuvenation program involving a one-off early retirement and redundancy scheme. The honourable member for Gilmore went on about people getting a redundancy payment over the age of 55. What happened in the work force on the waterfront is that there was a whole group of people in that age bracket and there were no younger people coming in. We have brought some younger people in so although some people are being made redundant we are also bringing younger people into the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there will be a progressive phasing out of statute based arrangements and cross-subsidies between ports. The major cost savings and efficiency gains from reform are to be made through the negotiation of enterprise-based arrangements between employers and unions. Substantial progress has been made in the major enterprise arrangements in Sydney and Melbourne. It is essential that we get those two ports right. Negotiations are now well advanced and in some instances there are only a few matters to be resolved. Nevertheless, the remaining areas are likely to deliver the significant productivity gains that the Government requires. Following the successful negotiation of an interim stevedoring industry award the way is open to achieve progress in this critical area. As part of the interim award employees and unions agreed to the objective of finalising enterprise agreements in major ports by the end of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The major aims of award restructuring in the industry include the consolidation and modernisation of the 19 stevedoring awards and agreements into one award-and I think it is very important that we are going to have one award; the rationalisation and codification of job classifications involving the development of skill related career paths with improved training and career prospects for employees; the restructuring and redrafting of awards to provide for broad banding, multi-skilling and more flexible use of labour; the elimination of inefficient work practices; an increased emphasis on participative practices at the workplace; improved occupational health and safety efforts; and the simplification of bargaining processes, including union amalgamation and fewer demarcations. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I was making the point that there have been demarcation disputes on the waterfront. That is because we have had a number of awards and a number of unions. We are trying to eliminate these so that they work under the one award. We are also giving the workers an opportunity to have a career path by having multiskilling. It is very important for the work force to have that. No longer do people have the one job all the time; they can do a whole variety of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be improved training arrangements. These are a key element of the reform process and the in-principle agreement. A national training advisory council has been established to monitor the stevedoring industry and enterprise training plans, as well as developing national training arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> There are currently 26 federally registered organisations and a range of State registered unions covering employees working on the Australian waterfront in container depots, ports and bulk loading facilities. Over the three-year reform period there will be a major rejuvenation of the work force. Some 3,000 older workers-including the 277 gangway watchmen already retired-will be given the opportunity of early retirement. Half the work force at the moment is over 50 years of age. There will be 1,000 new recruits under 30 years of age and these will be progressively introduced into the industry over the next three years concurrently with the introduction of the new enterprise-based employment system. This process has commenced and the initial intake of 200 new employees has completed training and commenced work. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the actual reform of the waterfront itself is only part of the package. I do not believe it will ever be really successful until we get the whole interface between the ports correct. What is the point of having the best port in the world if we have a goat track into it, as happens in Port Kembla? I am not saying that Port Kembla is the best port in the world but it most certainly will not be the best port in the world until we get a decent road into it. We have a goat track into it. We are talking about being competitive in the export market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Maldon-Dombarton rail line has to be recommenced. There is absolutely no doubt about it. The Caloola Pass road has to be built-there are no two ways about it-if Port Kembla is to take its rightful place as one of the major export ports of Australia. I hope that it will become one of the two or three container ports on the eastern coast of Australia. The containers, instead of coming into Botany and places like that, will come into Port Kembla. They will then be put onto rail and taken out to Parkes where, hopefully, by that time we will have a new marshalling yard. They will be sent north, south or west. We could bring containers into the port of Fremantle. When we redo the line between Parkes and Broken Hill the containers can be transported on major trains which may be a mile long. That is the sort of reform that we have to be thinking of. If we are going to achieve everything we want to achieve in the ports these are the sorts of broad areas that we have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual the unions always come in for a bit of a bashing. They have accepted the need for reform. They work very closely together. It is all very well for people to come in here and say, `They are not entitled to redundancy; put all these restrictive work practices on them or fire them'. We are talking about people's careers-people who have spent all their working lives in that industry. Surely it is better to negotiate, to talk to these people and to discuss it, and if need be come to a system of compromise on it. In that way we will achieve this major reform. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go at this reform like a bull at a gate, we will tie up all the ports in Australia. The days of the boss having all the say and cracking the whip all the time are well and truly gone. If we have learned anything in the field of industrial relations it is that negotiation-talking matters through and compromising where necessary-is the way to achieve the ends that everyone is seeking. This Hawke Labor Government is determined that the true potential of the waterfront industry should be unlocked by a coherent strategy for reform. It is the major element of the Government's program of micro-economic reform. I personally welcome it, as I know everyone on this side of the House does. I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) started by trotting out the old chestnut about the coalition having been in government for a large proportion of the past 30 years. He conveniently overlooks-and he is not alone in this on his side of the House-that governments of his particular persuasion have been in office for 10 or 11 of the past 18 years. So when one is talking about what happened at the Battle of Hastings, it is all very interesting and historically enlightening, but the truth is that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) has been in government for 10 or 11 of the past 18 years and it has had ample opportunity in this present term of 7 1/2 years to eight years to have done much of what it now seeks, or pretends to seek, to be doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member talked about there being no need to go like a bull at a gate at this problem of waterfront reform. His mob have been more like a slug at a lettuce. It is taking them a zillion years. The Stevedoring Industry Levy Amendment Bill and the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill do make some further progress, albeit very limited, towards redressing the disastrous situation on the Australian waterfront. They seek to amend the existing stevedoring industry legislation to cater for the Government's in principle agreement (IPA) on waterfront restructuring. In particular the proposals allow for a move towards enterprise-based as opposed to industry-based employment arrangements and support redundancy arrangements where employers leave the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills also will bring to an end the cross-subsidisation of smaller, non-permanent ports by the larger or permanent ports. At the same time, however, the Bills highlight the painfully slow pace of micro-economic reform under this Government. Despite an unprecedented degree of national consensus on the urgent need for extensive micro-economic reform, the Government continues to be inadequate for the task. This is particularly true of waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Reform of the waterfront supposedly has been on the agenda of Labor since 1984. Over the past six years we have seen the Webber task force, the Inter-State Commission report and the establishment of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA), all of which have served to highlight gross inefficiencies on the waterfront. The Government has spent six years investigating the waterfront. In other words, the Government has had at least six years to do something about the state of the wharves, and yet it has little to show for it. As well, the Government's proposals for reform have continually fallen behind the recommendations of the relevant authorities in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's actions in the area have even fallen behind its own timetable for reform, as provided for in the IPA and as administered by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. That is perhaps best indicated by the fact that most of the funds that have been allocated to this so-called reform process have not yet been spent. Only 25 per cent of funds allocated by this Government to waterfront reform in 1989-90 were actually spent. Year after year, authorities such as the Industry Commission and the Wheat Board have continued to produce damning statistics on the state of the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Delays during stevedoring operations are recognised as the principal cause of inefficiency at Australian ports. It is the stevedoring industry that is largely responsible for our ports being only about half as productive as those in Europe and only about 40 per cent as productive as those in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> Most notable amongst these inefficiencies are outrageous work practices, which continue to affect considerably the amount of time spent working on cargo while ships are in port. High penalty rates and shift allowances have made 24-hour wharf operations impossible. Cranes stand idle during meal breaks, which means that millions of dollars worth of cargo just sits on wharves for large parts of the day. These work practices are deeply entrenched, and fiercely protected by the waterfront unions. As a result, they have been largely put into the too-hard basket by the WIRA, as the Government resorts to buying wharfies out of their jobs as a substitute for comprehensive reform. </PARA>
<PARA> What must be the most generous redundancy packages ever conceived are being used in the attempt to reduce overmanning on the wharves. It is estimated that a 55-year-old wharfie with 25 years on the job can look forward to 247 weeks of pay under the Government's waterfront redundancy program. With the average salary for a wharfie standing at $750 a week before tax, we begin to get an idea of the sort of privileges that wharfies must be enjoying while on the job and the magnitude of the change in work practices that is required. </PARA>
<PARA> Such generous packages should be offered only in exchange for real and comprehensive reform in work practices. Regrettably, no such reform is in prospect. In fact, there is considerable concern on the part of consumers of stevedoring industry services that the reductions in labour necessary to eliminate overmanning on the wharves are much greater than the number of waterside workers likely to be eligible for these redundancy packages. Thus we are looking at enormously generous redundancy packages that will achieve little by way of substantial reform. To date not one has been made redundant under the in-principle agreement, despite the agreement's goal of 500 wharfies who were meant to have been processed in the first 12 months. That hardly augurs well for progress towards the 3,000 redundancies that the Government recognises need to occur before we can even begin to think about an efficient waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> We are still waiting on the conclusion of the first of the enterprise-based agreements (EBAs) which will determine redundancies and changes in work practices in the industry. Until those agreements emerge we can have no confidence that the Government's reform program is anywhere near on track. In any case, the Government's redundancy packages are more like a one-off voluntary retirement scheme than a real redundancy program. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a good case for introducing compulsory redundancy as a solution to overmanning where voluntary schemes are found to be inadequate to the task at hand. But the Government will accept compulsory redundancies outside the pre-existing industry arrangements only as a last resort, and then only at the end of a three-year period for the IPA-another three years before progress is made to that miserable extent. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a notable feature of the in-principle agreement on waterfront reform that it contains very few timetable commitments. What firm dates the WIRA has set itself have often not been met by the very same Authority. The first report of the WIRA handed down in May this year noted that the Government had failed to meet an important deadline on the conclusion of a new draft stevedoring award. It also noted that the restructuring of the 1919 waterfront industry awards was behind schedule. The Authority suffers from the lack of impetus that would have been given by having consumer representation on the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation where the key consumer groups such as the Australian Wheat Board have been relegated to the status of members of an advisory group to the Authority. This is typical of the Government's approach to micro-economic reform in this and in so many other areas as well. It works on the basis of compromises with the beneficiaries of the existing regulatory arrangements rather than looking to those who suffer from these arrangements for leadership and support. As the Industry Commission has noted, such an approach is bound to result in the derailing of the reform process because it allows it to be captured by the industry affected by the reform proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is not just employment arrangements and work practices that are a major source of inefficiency on the wharves. There is an enormous scope for improvement in the efficiency of port authorities that are currently insulated from competitive pressures. The Wheat Board estimates that faster inspection arrangements and turnaround times for vessels in port could reduce the wharfage on our wheat exports by as much as $1 per tonne while improvements in the efficiency of port authorities could further reduce wharfage by 50c a tonne. Without such improvements we will be looking at a ridiculous situation where Turkey and the United States will be landing wheat in New Zealand cheaper than Australia can. What an indictment!</PARA>
<PARA> The slow pace of waterfront reform in Australia contrasts sharply with that overseas where countries with inefficient waterfronts have made outstanding improvements in a short period. New Zealand and the United Kingdom have made 100 per cent and 65 per cent improvements respectively in waterfront efficiency in the space of just one year. This proves that substantial reform can be achieved in a short period of time. All that is required is the will to make the necessary changes and to take on the vested interests involved. But the Australian Government has set a goal of achieving only a 30 per cent increase in productivity over a three-year period. It does not make things too hard for itself does it? The goal in Australia is 30 per cent over three years compared with a goal in Britain and New Zealand of 60 per cent and 40 per cent respectively in one year. Furthermore, the Government already considers that some aspects of its reform program have been overly ambitious. Our Government reckons its reform program has been overly ambitious. It has, but only because it cannot make it work. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only does overseas experience point to the inadequacies of our Government's efforts, it also constitutes a vivid reminder of the competitive situation we face. Improvements in waterfront efficiency overseas are not just gains for those countries. They actually worsen Australia's competitive position. Waterfront reform is thus essential to maintaining, let alone improving, our trade performance, particularly in view of the recent strength of the Australian dollar. The gains to be had through micro-economic reform in the transport sector in Australia are considerable. The Industry Commission estimates that they could amount to as much as a $9 billion per annum increase in gross domestic product. In the case of the waterfront, the Inter-State Commission estimates reform to be worth about $620m per year, but these gains will not be realised by this Government's approach to micro-economic reform on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with the Government's waterfront approach, as Dr Peter Barnard of the National Farmers Federation has pointed out, is that it is `centrally administered and interventionist, concentrating on evidentiary unsatisfactory features of the existing waterfront industry, while leaving the basic structures intact'. The Government is resorting to ad hoc interventions into employment and subsidy arrangements that prevail in this industry, instead of establishing a competitive industry structure that will deliver efficient and permanent outcomes. Without such a competitive structure, as Dr Barnard also points out, there is nothing to ensure that the industry does not return to hiding behind government-sponsored protection arrangements and barriers to entry into the stevedoring industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently there are only four stevedoring firms in the whole country. This reflects the high capital outlays necessary to enter this industry and the cosy links between existing stevedoring and shipping companies which make it difficult for new entrants to secure contracts. Australia's four stevedoring companies can be expected to operate efficiently only when they are faced with a competitive environment. Then we will see reductions in overmanning and improvements in work practices without the need for centralised government intervention with its inherently inferior knowledge of the requirements of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Government's redundancy program is serving to raise barriers to entry into stevedoring by requiring new entrants to share the burden of redundancies that should be the responsibility of existing firms which allowed the gross overmanning to occur in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Essential to the establishment of a competitive structure for industry is the privatisation, in conjunction with State governments, of Australia's ports and the elimination of cross-subsidies between them. The Government's corporatisation effort with port authorities, like the remainder of its corporatisation program, will reveal itself to be an inferior alternative to full privatisation. Under full privatisation port authorities should be expected to adopt commercial operating charters and be run or at least influenced by consumers of port facilities rather than the current providers of those services. We could in turn then expect to see the emergence of port pricing policies, leases and licensing arrangements which reflect market imperatives. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to bring to an end the situation where ports are run for the exclusive benefit of those employed at them rather than serving the needs of the consumers of the service and the consumers of the products that those consumers sell in the marketplace. Only privatised and competing ports and port authorities will bring an end to what has been described as the `fossilised, clubby atmosphere of the Australian waterfront'. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA> Government members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the interjections confirm my greatest hope. The Stevedoring Industry Amendment Bill and the Stevedoring Industry Legislation Amendment Bill underline for all members of the Parliament the importance of our achieving very substantial reform on the Australian waterfront. Certainly, from my own position as the shadow Minister for trade, there are very few areas of so-called micro-economic reform which are as important, and probably there are none which are more important in order to achieve a much better trading performance for our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These Bills give some effect to the Government's waterfront reform program as it has outlined it and, in particular, the program for restructuring the stevedoring industry. These new employment arrangements, which are really a fundamental part of the restructuring of the stevedoring industry, include the provision of very substantial redundancy payments about which, I am sure, members of the broader community will have some reservations. However, the Government certainly argues that this is the only way by which some change in employment arrangements can be achieved on the waterfront itself. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two basic points that I want to make today. First, whilst not opposing this legislation, my view is that it is legislation which underlines the very slow progress that is being made in Australia in order to achieve waterfront reform. This seems to me to be a very fundamental point for all Australians properly to understand. The Government's waterfront reform program aims to achieve a 30 per cent improvement in productivity over the next three years. Of course, if one looks at that baldly and says that over the next three years productivity will be 30 per cent better than it is today, one has a sense of excitement that that represents achievement. But, of course, the waterfront is all about trade, all about the competitiveness of our economy. That is what is at the heart of this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> So the question is not whether we are going to achieve a 30 per cent improvement over the next three years but to what extent that 30 per cent improvement is a real improvement in our competitiveness with other countries. In other words, what are other countries doing while we in Australia are achieving that 30 per cent improvement in productivity?</PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at what has happened in two Anglo Saxon countries, as they are sometimes described, in the last two or three years and at their improvements in productivity, then one realises that that really underlines the fact that this 30 per cent improvement is hopelessly inadequate. Indeed, by achieving only a 30 per cent improvement in productivity, we as a country are going backwards on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand achieved a 100 per cent improvement in productivity on its waterfront in one year. That is the relative position of Australia. As Mike Moore, the now New Zealand Prime Minister, and formerly the New Zealand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, said to me about six weeks ago in New Zealand, its waterfront costs are some 60 per cent below waterfront costs in Australia. If we achieve a 30 per cent improvement in productivity over three years, we are still a long way behind New Zealand's position today. According to the present New Zealand Government-the Government may change there-it is aiming to achieve greater improvements in productivity than those achieved recently. How this represents progress when it is looked at in those terms, no-one will ever understand. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Kingdom, which has the same sort of chronic history of waterfront problems that Australia has and probably for many of the same reasons, also has undertaken substantial waterfront reform but has not achieved quite such an improvement in productivity as the New Zealanders. Nevertheless, in one year, the United Kingdom achieved a 65 per cent improvement in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> So my point is that to improve on our past performance is not enough. We have to improve at a faster rate than the rest of the world in order to achieve a greater level of competitiveness. There is no point in politicians on the other side of the House coming in here and saying, `Aren't we clever? We have done something', because the problem is that everyone else around the world is also doing something and doing it a lot faster than we are. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that the Government is doing is making these substantial redundancy payments in order to reduce the level of manning, as many speakers before me in this debate have made clear. The people who end up paying for these redundancy payments are ultimately the importers and exporters who use the ports. They are the people-let us face it-who have over many generations been ripped off by the waterfront and the waterside workers to an extent which can only be described as extortion. But in any case, these very small changes, which represent a reduction in manning levels in the activity of stevedoring and in the average age of waterfront workers, are a very small step towards improving our waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I give honourable members some examples. I have said that this Bill is about ultimately reducing manning, but when one looks at the task ahead one can see that it is pretty substantial. If we look at the manning levels at some of the ports in my own State of South Australia, we are reminded of the horrendous problem that we face on our waterfront. In 1989, Port Adelaide had 173 waterside workers who worked for 21.4 hours per employee. Incidentally, these figures have been produced by the Department of Transport and Communications. Port Pirie had 35 waterside workers who worked for an average of 19.34 hours per employee. Wallaroo had 20 workers working for an average of 12.69 hours. Port Lincoln had 19 workers working for an average of 6.8 hours. Thevenard, over on the west coast, had six workers working for an average of 5.12 hours. Port Giles had six workers working for 8.97 hours. Incidentally, these people are all working a 35-hour week and are paid triple time on Sunday if a ship happens to arrive in any of those ports on a Sunday and needs to be loaded or unloaded at that time, which is, of course, often the case. There is approximately one chance in seven of that ship arriving or leaving on a Sunday. There is probably a much higher chance, given the time that it takes in Australia to load and unload a ship, of some work being done on that ship on a Sunday. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will argue that this legislation is designed to address that problem. I concede that that is right: it is designed to address that particular problem, but not in a particularly dramatic way. In two or three years' time it will be interesting to see the figures for the number of waterside workers employed in those particular ports. But the point is that an enormous amount of ground-not a little bit-has to be made up in order to achieve much greater efficiency on our waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I would make another and, I think, very substantial point about the waterfront, that is, that the stevedoring industry is far from being the only problem and the only, if you like, extortionate cost on our waterfront. Once more, if I could be excused for being parochial, I would refer to problems in my own State of South Australia where the South Australian Government and the Federal Government are effectively using our State's ports as a milch cow in order to raise extra revenue. They simply know that people have to use ports, so they impose very substantial charges on those ports in order to fatten the coffers of government. </PARA>
<PARA> I use the example of Port Adelaide, the most important port in South Australia. In Port Adelaide it costs about $255 to load a container on to a ship. An amount of $255 a container does not mean very much to people unless they understand what that cost would be in a competitor country. I keep making the point that that is the key: how much do these things cost somewhere else? At the major port of Kalang in Malaysia-a very significant competitor country to Australia and one in our own region-the cost of loading a container is $95. That is $95 as against $255. There is an enormous difference. But when one actually compares the State and Federal government charges at Port Adelaide with those charges at Kalang, it illustrates why our cost structure in Australia is so different-and it is not only because of the inefficiencies in the stevedoring industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this matter. In South Australia at Port Adelaide it costs on average $2,000 per vessel for the use of a pilot-'pilotage' as it is described. In Kalang it costs $700. So it is nearly a third of the cost at Port Adelaide. At Port Adelaide a 15,000 tonne ship-which is used as a reasonable illustration-pays tonnage rates of $1,200. In Kalang they do not have tonnage rates; they do not pay anything. At Port Adelaide $2,800 per vessel is paid on average in overtime for mooring and unmooring that ship. In Kalang the average is $165. Wages in Malaysia are not a minuscule proportion. They are not 5 per cent of wages in Australia, believe me, and anybody who knows anything about the dynamic country of Malaysia knows that that is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA> At Port Adelaide, conservancy dues, as they are described, are $9,650 a vessel. In Kalang the equivalent, an ancillary charge as they call it there, is $1,635. That is, I think, a fairly clear illustration of the sort of totally uncompetitive and frankly extortionary and irresponsible charges that the State Government is imposing upon port users at Port Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have to say that the South Australian Government does not stand alone as a guilty government in that respect, as I found recently when I was in the State of Queensland. But the Federal Government is also a guilty party in this particular exercise. In the case of Port Adelaide, the Federal Government charges light dues of $11,487 to a shipping company to last it over a period of three months, whereas in Kalang it costs $200 per vessel. One would have to use Port Adelaide a great deal in order to find one's costs per vessel coming somewhere near the costs applicable in the Port of Kalang. In the case of Port Adelaide, where vessels are required in particular by the unions to use three tugs-I think in some special circumstances just two tugs-regardless of the efficiency and capacity of the vessel, it costs $13,000 per vessel on average for tugs; whereas in Kalang it costs slightly over 10 per cent of that, $1,350. Consequently, a port call in Port Adelaide costs $25,000 a vessel, and at Kalang about $4,000 a vessel. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making is that we have to compete with Malaysia. We have to try to compete with most countries of the world. Particularly in a country which is an island and which has no alternative but to use the waterfront for its trade, there is no point in ignoring comparable costs in other parts of the world and expect to be able to resolve one's balance of payments problems. One simply cannot do that. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the solutions that is often put forward, certainly in South Australia by the State Opposition, is to involve private enterprise much more substantially even in the ownership of ports-and the South Australian Opposition has argued that ports in South Australia should all be privatised and made to compete with each other, which is what has happened in many other parts of the world. In the case of New Zealand they have, at the very least, been corporatised and put in a position of having to compete with each other. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to this point I have been making about government charges, I draw a comparison between two ports which are used by CRA Ltd to show how a government-run port is acting as an extortionist in terms of charges-in other words, using that port as a milch cow-compared with a privately owned port. The way to do that is to compare the increases in charges. If one looks at increases in charges at the Port of Cape Cuvier, one sees that since 1981 State tonnage dues have increased by 52 per cent. I do not know whether people think that is a lot or a little. It is quite a long time; it is nine years and the increase is only 52 per cent. People may think that is not too bad. Commonwealth light dues have increased by only 27 per cent and pilotage by 116 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If one compares those increases with the Port of Weipa, one will find at Weipa there has actually been no increase in any of those charges at all since 1986. The Port of Weipa is a privately owned port. Indeed, overall charges fell in 1988 at the Port of Weipa, and the reason that charges have been able to fall in a port like that is because usage has increased and, therefore, returns may have increased but, because of increased usage, the average costs have declined. CRA is obviously in a position where it needs to use the Port of Weipa, but the simple fact is that charges there have at least been kept under control, which is not the case with government owned ports. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is an overwhelming case for corporatisation at the very least, and preferably privatisation, in the case of ports. In New Zealand, as I have mentioned already, corporatisation has been a large and important part of the Government's waterfront reforms. In the United Kingdom there are, and have been for many years, a large number of privately owned ports. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that Felixstowe, a private port, is in fact Britain's most used port because it is the most efficient and the most competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> I know many members of this House have a particular affinity with the country of Chile in South America and, indeed, some members of the Government have been very close to Australians who have invested in that country, or used to be close to them; they are at arm's length now, for some reason. But it is interesting to note that in Chile ports were sold in the late 1970s. If one looks at Chile-it is not a bad country to look at as an average country which has done something quite dramatic like this-one sees that between 1978 and 1988, shiploading time has actually declined from 129 hours to 40 hours per vessel. It is an interesting illustration of the way, through private enterprise and competition, one is able to achieve substantial improvements in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I thought I might tell the House the anecdote of how two months ago I travelled on a container ship between Port Botany and New Zealand. During the course of that voyage-and I had a lot of time to spare on that voyage-I discussed the whole issue of port costs with the crew of the ship. They told me that at Port Botany, when that particular ship-the La Perouse-visits, the rate of loading and unloading of containers is 10 containers an hour. When I got to New Zealand one of the things I did was to visit the Port of Auckland, and I asked the people who run the Port of Auckland what the loading and unloading rates for containers on the La Perouse was in that particular port. They told me that the rate was 41 containers an hour. It seems to me that there is a problem for Australia. The comparison between 41 containers an hour in Auckland and 10 containers an hour in Port Botany underlines the utter catastrophe of the waterfront in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>. It may not have mattered 20 or 30 years ago that our waterfront was inefficient when everyone else had an inefficient waterfront also; but it matters desperately now. As I said at the beginning of my speech, other countries are making such dramatic changes and we are making such slow and gradual changes. A 30 per cent improvement in productivity over the next three years is absolutely hopeless when countries such as New Zealand are able to achieve a 100 per cent improvement in productivity in one year. It is gutless and wrong for the Government to pretend that it cannot achieve, at the very least, a 100 per cent improvement in productivity on the waterfront in Australia-as if we are so inefficient that 100 per cent would not be achievable. It would be easily achievable, but the reason it is not going to be achieved for the next two years is that the unions, and particularly the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, have a veto on government action to try to improve the waterfront. That is why we will remain uncompetitive for a long time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), his comments prove to me one thing: that the conservative parties, when dealing with transport matters but particularly the waterfront, have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. One could almost take his speech and the issues he covered and plant them back in about 1977, when we sat on the other side of the chamber. This is the dilemma for the conservative parties. On the one hand, they want to use the waterfront and the waterfront and maritime unions as whipping boys, as excuses for their failure to develop a more efficient waterfront environment that can make a greater contribution to the national income. On the other hand, they would really like to see something done to improve it. Therein lies their dilemma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member complained about port charges. On the one hand, the same honourable gentleman was very critical of what he sees as a less than satisfactory return on public investment in statutory authorities and public sector businesses. He said that they do not do nearly well enough. That is the message he has given us so many times. On the other hand, the other honourable member for Mayo on another night-it is usually at night-complained about the charges. But today it is an aberration-it is early evening-and he complained about the charges made by the ports. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the Opposition has a dilemma. On the one hand it is saying that public authorities should be producing a substantially increased rate of return. On the other hand, it says that it is too much, that we should compare them with some port in Malaysia and that those rates ought to be applied here. I suggest to the honourable member that he should go back to his constituents and to the employees of the Australian National Railways Commission and say, `Listen, fellows, I have done a great deal for you in Canberra; I have convinced the Government to pay you the same rates that are being paid to employees of Malaysian railways or Malaysian ports'. He should go back and tell them that and we will see how he gets on. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the issue more seriously. What is involved in so much of the debate on this issue is the failure of the conservatives to compare like with like. As far back as I can remember, they have made selective comparisons with no justification of how the comparisons are made. Rather, they are just comparisons plucked out of the air. If the Opposition is going to make comparisons about waterfront performance and if it is going to maintain any credibility at all, then it must make sure that it is comparing like with like. That is not done by the conservative parties. It was not done in the 1970s when they were in government and they still do not do it today. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage in the debate I think it is worthwhile recounting how we came to be in this position. The honourable member for Mayo wants the ports to be privatised. Excluding the Australian National Line and its interest in container terminals, the stevedoring industry has been privatised. It is in private ownership. What is more-this will make the Opposition parties happy-a large segment of it is in foreign private ownership. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course they do; it fits into their policy. We need to remember that down through the years when the Opposition has been in government the Minister responsible for the waterfront, the stevedoring industry, has been a National Party Minister-either the Minister responsible for shipping and transport or the Minister responsible for transport. In 1977 the Opposition deregulated the waterfront. It said, `Let's do away with the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. Let this industry run free. Let's put some competition into the industry and it will become more efficient'. The Opposition's legislation created the environment. The unions did not create it and the proprietors in the industry did not create it. The conservative government at that time-Minister Street brought in the legislation-created it. It occurred during its time in government. What happened? The waterfront and stevedoring industry being an oligopoly-type industry, the employers immediately jumped into bed with the employees. Why would they not? The industry effectively became a cost-plus industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What was the reaction of the conservatives? They thought it was wonderful. They now had a deregulated stevedoring industry, and the waterfront industry was used in that time, on occasion after occasion, as a political whipping boy. There were taunts on the waterfront and attacks on waterfront workers. There was criticism of the fact that-would you believe it?-waterside workers went home for the day. It was a picnic day; it so happened that the picnic day was a provision in their award. But it did not matter; it was a means of taunting the waterfront, taunting those people, trying to create problems, and then using the industry as a scapegoat for the problems of the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until this Government came to office in 1983, after a period of several months when we sought the cooperation of the States in improving port performance and could not get it, that we first opened up this issue in a seminar we conducted in Sydney in 1984. We said to the States, `If you are not prepared to put the industry in order, let's push it out into the daylight where everybody can see it'. It was several years before it finally dawned on the Opposition that there was room for improvement on the waterfront.  It thought, `We ought to have a look at that and maybe we can score some political points against the Government. It does not matter that we created the problem; it does not matter that it is our legislation that is in place; it does not matter that it is our industrial law or our levies that are in place. We might be able to score a point of two. Let's have a look at it and start making some noise about it'. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a very difficult issue to deal with, and immediately after the 1984 seminar we appointed Ian Webber, the Chief Executive Officer of Mayne Nickless Ltd, to lead a task force to look at shore-based shipping costs. That was a long task because he then started to realise the difficulty of the issues involved and the intransigence of both sides-the employers and employees. In fact, I found at the time that there was a greater readiness on the part of employees than on the part of employers to look at methods and proposals for reform. As a result of Mr Webber's report a growing interest was taken in the industry. I then commissioned the Inter-State Commission to carry out an investigation into the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> When we set about doing that we wanted to look at the total transport chain. It is really taking away the priority from issues in transport if we just pluck out one link in the chain. There is the blue water link getting the goods from abroad to the wharf. The next link is on the wharf, and the link with the greatest potential for improvement is the link from the wharf to the destination of cargoes. The reverse also applies, from the origin of the cargoes-the factory, farm gate or mine site-to the wharf and from the wharf out through the Heads on the blue water leg to the country of destination. One has to look at the total transport chain. This is but one link in it. The Inter-State Commission looked at that and its work was a major factor in arousing national awareness of the need for greater improvement. That then became a major part of the Government's micro-economic reform agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> But we have to involve people in this. We are looking at an industry that has had decades to settle down into a very comfortable arrangement created by the conservative parties, and an industry in which, for reasons I have never been able to understand, the users have never invested. It is all very well for the honourable member for Mayo to talk about why there has not been privatisation of ports, but it is far more important to be asking why have not the major users of waterfront services seen fit to invest in those services themselves-some vertical integration-so they have a direct input into the process of improvement. They have never done that, and the role of the conservative parties and a number of the major users over the years has been just to throw stones, to make criticisms, to antagonise and in fact simply to sloganise. </PARA>
<PARA> The hard work that has to be done is being done by negotiation. That is a long, tough road but it is the hallmark of this Government. The reform achieved in the shipping industry, the toughest industry of all, the reform undertaken with the sea-going unions-better training, better standards of entry, fewer crews, new investment, cash grants assistance for new investment and a considerable increase in productivity-was achieved without any conflict at all. It was achieved through the process of consensus. Yes, it might take a bit long, but we should not ever forget that the first people to scream when there is a stoppage on the waterfront are the people who most use the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I very quickly learned, as Minister for Transport in 1983, that the people screaming to take on the wharfies were the people who sent the first telexes when the waterfront stopped for 24 hours, telling me that we ought to get them back to work. So those who clamoured the loudest were the first to say, `Can't you settle this? Isn't there some way you can get them back to work?'. The Minister for Finance, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), is at the table. He shared this experience with me, as the then Minister for Industrial Relations. The very people who screamed loudest to take the bastards on-excuse the term, but I use their words-were the very same people who, immediately that process began, were saying, `For heaven's sake, you must do something, our exports are at risk, our revenue is at risk'. </PARA>
<PARA> You cannot have it both ways. The course followed by this Government has been a course of bringing the parties together, a course of negotiation and a responsible approach to achieving attitudinal change. The Minister at the table was responsible for the agreement reached with industry, trade unions and employers in October last year for a three-year program of reform for the waterfront. That reform process is under way, and a major element is the introduction of enterprise agreements between the employers and their own employees. They will cease to be part of the general pool, and better training methods will be introduced. The lack of adequate training proposals has been a major factor in the performance of the waterfront, particularly in respect of the container terminals. </PARA>
<PARA> All of that process takes time. It requires an enormous attitudinal change. I talked earlier about the conservative parties, and they have not shifted one inch since the mid-1970s in their attitude to people who earn their living on the waterfront. I do not recall ever a word of commendation being passed by conservative parties about Australian men and women working on the waterfront. It is hammer, hammer, hammer, all the way through. They are consistent. They cannot change. They cannot bring themselves to have a different attitude to the people on the waterfront-people whose attitudes we need to change. How can we expect them, Australian men and women who have mortgages and the responsibility of families, to change? We have to do it through goodwill, the way this Government has been doing it. It has to be done through consultation and negotiation. It may take a little longer, but there will not be the disputes; there will not be the conflict we have seen under conservative governments of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> From the information provided to the Government there is no reason to doubt that the enterprise agreement negotiations that are set for completion by the end of this year will be finalised. Sure it takes time. It has taken time to get started. But the attitudinal change required is enormous. How does a union leader go back to his membership and say, `We have sat down with the Government; we have done a great deal for you as members of this union and we have done a great deal with the employers, but we are going to need 3,000 less of you from 1 January next.'? What union leader can do that? What businessperson can do that? No-one can. Or, do we want to take the British style of confrontation, and face it head on? The Opposition has talked a lot about that and some users have always talked about it, but, as I say, those same users are the first people to complain when the industry stops. So the course being followed by this Government is the appropriate course. It is the correct course and it is a course that will get results. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard quite a deal of the debate earlier and the contributions of the honourable member for Mayo and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), who is from the National Party of Australia. I have mentioned the National Party and its role in the waterfront. Those speakers made great play of productivity comparisons. The essential thing in any comparison of productivity on the waterfront is that it be like with like. They are not fooling anybody by making false comparisons. If it is not apples with apples, it is a waste of time and they are only kidding themselves. It is very difficult to compare ports, particularly in this country. It is very difficult to find a port in the world that has the same kind of characteristics in terms of wharf space, whether it handles containers, the age of the cranes in use, the nature and the number of cranes and their availability to ships by the wharf, the operating hours, the servicing to the wharf, how much storage space there is and how quickly they can get containers onto the wharf and off the wharf to storage. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a host of factors to be considered. I heard Felixstowe, in the United Kingdom, mentioned a couple of times. Is the port a dedicated port that deals only with containers, or is it a mixed port? If we are going to make productivity comparisons and we want people to listen to us, if members of the Opposition want credibility, we have to make like comparisons. We can have none of the discussion I heard earlier, in which those opposite plucked out some obscure port to compare. That is nonsense. It is all counterproductive because it makes the task of persuading Australian workers involved in the stevedoring industry to change all the more difficult. In the meantime, they are fooling the users and giving rise to expectations that cannot be fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA> It is claimed that in New Zealand there is an increase in productivity of up to 75 per cent, based on a reduction in the number of waterside workers-down from 3,000 to 1,700 as a result of the recent restructuring that has taken place. We may just as validly argue that the New Zealand reform process was starting from a lower productivity base. If someone is moving one box an hour and that goes up to two, that is terrific. But when a port ought to be moving five-and I am-and I increase it by 20 or 30 per cent, I am still moving six an hour and yet the other port has the increase of 100 per cent although it is moving only two an hour. So let us go back to the basics and make proper comparisons, rather than run with these general percentage terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian waterfront was previously moving more tonnes of non-bulk cargo per man per year than was the case in New Zealand-something like 4,000 tonnes compared with around 2,600 tonnes-so it is nonsense to just bandy around percentages. In the case of the productivity comparison with the United Kingdom, the figure bandied about is a 100 per cent productivity increase. That appears to be based on the number of registered dock workers who have accepted the redundancy package offered by the Government. As at May 1990, 52 per cent of former registered dock workers had left the industry. It is unlikely that this reduction would directly translate into a 100 per cent productivity increase for the remaining work force because there has been some transfer of work away from traditional stevedoring companies. Shipping companies now use their own work force to load ships and also there is no record of recruitment of non-registered employees. That is reported to have occurred in some cases. It also takes no account of the more flexible supplementary labour arrangements introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> So if we want to compare the United Kingdom, we have to make sure the type of port operation we are comparing is the same as here. We cannot take a mixed port with old gear, inadequately trained and older workers, poor working arrangements and say, `Look at what is happening in Australia', when we are comparing it with a dedicated containers only port with the latest gear and eight cranes working while the port here has only two. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter how we make comparisons in Australia with ports abroad, whether it be Hong Kong, a port in the United Kingdom, or Rotterdam, we still have to come to the conclusion, as this Government has, that we can do better, we are going to do better and we must do better in the national interest. That is recognised by the trade union movement, by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and now by the waterfront workers themselves. At last we are getting some movement towards the kind of improvement we need. </PARA>
<PARA> Now is the time, also, to move off the waterfront. The momentum is under way. I believe our efforts will be successful and I believe the momentum for change and improvement will accelerate, but we need now to look at the last leg, the leg where the greatest potential for improvement is-that is, we must consider how efficiently we can get cargoes to and from the wharf, from their origin and to their destination. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased that the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure of this House is now addressing that issue. I suggest to some of those people who have their whinges about the waterfront and who want to make unlike comparisons, or who genuinely feel they have valid suggestions to make and a point of view they can put and back, that they come along to the Committee. We would love to hear from them, and they can make a positive contribution to the process of reform in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), in discussing these vital waterfront issues, raised some matters as a former Minister and as a person who understood the issues before the House. I was amazed that his main argument was that the present Labor Government was bringing about reforms, that it had the answers and that previous coalition administrations did nothing on the waterfront. For a person who has been a Minister and who obviously understands the problems, his answer was that the present Labor Government was negotiating its way out of difficulty and that it has set up a program where these negotiations will continue over three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that nobody has taken up the redundancy package offered. In fact, 200 new people have been employed on the waterfront. The honourable member for Shortland suggested there had been a change in attitude on the waterfront. The Opposition sees no real evidence of that change. All we know is that the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority is moving at a snail's pace. </PARA>
<PARA> Only 10 days ago, I visited the Australian Maritime College at Launceston, where during a briefing I was told that 95 per cent of the world's trade moves by sea. That clearly indicates to both the House and the people of Australia the vital necessity of having a sensible waterfront arrangement and ensuring that import and export shipping works efficiently as a vital part of the export procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 50 years the ports, ships, stevedores and wharfies have been holding up these procedures. The legislation is a small step in the right direction to get rid of the pooling arrangements that have been endemic on the waterfront over the past 50 or 60 years. The in-principle agreement will take three years to achieve. That is a recipe for disaster and a recipe for no action. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1990, there were about 8,418 employees on the waterfront. According to the Inter-State Commission report that number would be reduced quite dramatically. As I said, I understand that there has been no real change in the numbers employed; rather, extra people have been employed on the waterfront. The report of the Inter-State Commission is about the thirteenth report since the Second World War, investigating the problems of the waterfront. Yet no real action has emanated from any of those reports because of the intransigence of the Waterside Workers Federation, the employers and everyone associated with the waterfront. However, the report of the Commission did identify the inefficiencies, delays, work practices and, more particularly, the pooling of labour which had no responsibility to any individual employer, the monopoly of the stevedores and of the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the barriers to entry for anyone who wanted to join the waterfront either as a stevedore or as a wharf labourer, I believe that in many cases one had to be related to somebody actually working on the waterfront before one could get a job. This has been a great impediment to attracting sensible, hard working people to join that work force. </PARA>
<PARA> There were cosy deals between the shipowners and the stevedoring companies so that they could continue so long as the goods were delivered at some time in the future at some greater cost. Either the exporters or the importers were paying the true costs farther down the line and they were not fully aware of these remarkable inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> To be fair, I must admit that the Government has agreed that the pooling arrangements will be changed to enterprise agreements where employers and employees reach a true and sensible arrangement on their employment and work practices. It has been agreed that there should be an improvement to the port authorities and that there should be a more competitive environment on the waterfront around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in Victoria the exact opposite is taking place, where between Melbourne and Westernport, Geelong and Portland, there has been a long running battle between the Port of Geelong Authority and the State Government. The State Government wanted to amalgamate all of those ports to allow no competition and to cover up all the inefficiencies, especially in the Port of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has agreed to the in-principle agreement. It has agreed to the redundancy payments. But, as I mentioned, the honourable member for Shortland had not come to grips with the actual figures, which show that nothing has taken place. There has been no great change in attitude on the waterfront because nothing has happened. In his usual style, Tas Bull will continue to negotiate a status quo position because he knows, from a long period of being in charge of the Waterside Workers Federation, that if one continues to negotiate, talk and get help and assistance from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, nothing will change on the waterfront. That has been the case historically and, if the present Labor Government continues, nothing will change on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to three examples around the world-one in Victoria-where there have been changes and dramatic results because governments have been prepared to act positively, take a line of action and actually do something. I draw the attention of the House to the good example of the Port Phillip sea pilots. They are an independent group who have serviced the Port Phillip area since 1839. They form a high quality organisation, providing a high quality service to the ships and vessels that move through the heads and navigate some very treacherous waters in the Port Phillip area. </PARA>
<PARA> The pilots have made changes and they now provide an effective, efficient service for these vessels. Within their own ranks they are well paid because the numbers have been cut over the past five years from 45 to 36. The numbers of support staff, the able seamen, clerical and other persons, have been cut from 72 to 34. A roster system has been introduced where 16 pilots are on standby with a three-hour call arrangement. They have developed a cooperative attitude towards handling the intermittent arrangements of ships coming and going. They do it effectively in a private enterprise manner. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no demarcation disputes between any members of the team and it has been reported to me that one or two of the personnel were called back from holidays to help out in something of a crisis. The pilots maintain an efficient operation. Only last Monday, I joined Captain Griffith, the president of the pilots association, when my wife launched the George Tobin, an effective, efficient and modern vessel which transports the pilots from Queenscliff in my electorate of Corangamite out to the ships as they come through the heads. </PARA>
<PARA> The construction of that vessel is a great example of the cooperation of the workshop staff who built it to modern specifications to withstand heavy seas. The workshop staff and the pilots have a friendly and cooperative attitude in providing a first class service. I commend them for that. They provide a wonderful example of what can be done on the waterfront by developing a dramatic change in attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to what happened on the New Zealand waterfront. The New Zealand Labor Government had a clear objective-to reduce costs and to improve efficiency. The New Zealand Government set clear goals, which were implemented. Step one: it introduced the Ports Reform Bill and corporatised all the New Zealand ports. That in itself brought about a change in attitude by the port authorities in New Zealand because it introduced a profit motive and a desire within the administrators of the ports to improve efficiency and general operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The second important step the Government took was in 1989 when it introduced a waterfront Bill which normalised the employment arrangements as between the waterside workers and their employers. The age old thing we see here in Australia of pooling arrangements also appears in every other part of the world. The New Zealand Government introduced this legislation to make sure that individual employers employed their individual workers. So the unions and the employers at the stevedores, in the port companies and at the container terminals, had a normal arrangement as between management and the men. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also emphasised the role of the shippers-that the shippers were part of the process, that they had to be very aware of the costs, and not just allow the actual ship owners to operate in an environment where they had always just passed the costs on eventually to the wool growers or wheat growers who had to pay the extra costs in freight further down the line. </PARA>
<PARA> These fairly positive actions by the New Zealand Government were inevitably met with a three-week strike. However, that was overcome because these programs were in place. After the strike, new awards were implemented at the local level and not at the national level because that would make sure that local managements and local members of the work force would be working to local conditions in the north and south islands and at the various port facilities. This, in fact, enhanced the competition as between the ports and the various operators at the different port facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The redundancy packages in bringing about some of these changes totalled $NZ30m. I understand that the work force dropped by about 50 per cent, clearly indicating the remarkable overmanning levels that took place on the New Zealand waterfront, very much like the situation we have here in Australia. The rort of spelling goes back to the early part of the century when the physical work of the waterside workers required them to have some rests. That had been developed to an absolute rort where the spell took about half a day or longer, depending on one's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> The change of working conditions to 24 hours a day, seven days a week was brought in with new technology being incorporated because of the change in attitudes and employment conditions. The work force had a new, positive attitude. It now had to do a day's work for a day's pay, quite an unusual situation on most waterfronts in the Western world, and particularly here in Australia. The employees worked hard. They were effective and proud of the outcome of their work on the waterfront with the new technology, the new techniques and the fact that they could see some results for the change in attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also, of course, this new competitive spirit as between ports. Suddenly one port was competing with another. So we saw some quite dramatic changes. Firstly, in New Zealand we saw a government which made decisions actually to act on the process. Secondly, it had the courage to proceed, even against the strike, and moved forward to make the changes. The Government executed with a certain amount of speed the particular changes proposed, unlike the situation here where the present Government is not prepared to proceed and is prepared to let the decisions lay in principle over a three-year period. We know that that will never really achieve any great results because it will just be negotiated out. The change of attitude in New Zealand has been quite dramatic. It has taken place because of the Government's determination to bring about the change. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just turn to the changes that have taken place in Great Britain. Again, there was a situation where a dramatic change of attitude and approach was undertaken. There were 60 ports and the background to the situation was that it was an offence not to employ anyone else except a registered dock worker. An employer could actually be put in gaol if he or she employed anyone else who was not registered in the union and was not allowed to work on the dock front. The national dock labour scheme prevented any changes of attitude, personnel or management because of the entrenched position of the unions. The unions dominated the recruitment, the dismissal procedures and, of course, discipline. Restrictive practices grew up on those ports and number of them have been transferred to Australia. There was also the problem of ghosting-people being paid for jobs they did not execute and yet they were on the payroll. We all know about those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA> The major breakthrough was the non-scheme ports. A couple grew up in smaller parts of England. These ports developed with some labour that was not in the scheme. They had a new approach. From a very low base of little cargo, they developed to having about 50 per cent of the value of cargo in Britain and about 30 per cent of the volume because they were more efficient, more effective, got the job done and did not have all the delays. Competition was the key factor. Here were these non-union ports being able to deliver the goods and all of a sudden the other more lackadaisical union controlled ports saw that they had to make some changes. That brought about a change of attitude by the employers, the ship owners and everyone associated with the waterfront. Governments of all political colours in Britain were very sensitive, worried and apprehensive about tackling the waterfront problems because of the island nature of Great Britain. A dock strike for any period of time could starve the island into submission, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> The procedures in bringing about some changes included setting up a public and parliamentary conditioning process on the basis that Britain really needed reform on the waterfront. This is just like what is happening in Australia with the Opposition. We are bringing forward the attitudes and changes that have to be brought forward to the waterfront and we are going to really make the change. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some very impressive public relations about the madness of the situation on the waterfront in England with the dockers' power and the sort of output and working conditions they undertook. The public at large understood that the dockers of England did not do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. There was a very strong move to free up the labour market so that normal labour market conditions could exist on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The next major item was preparing the legal ground work so that if a confrontation took place, those people who were bringing about the reform would have very strong legal grounds to implement their reform proposals. The reformers, of course, were very aware of the entrenched union position. The union leaders, union delegates and union members would not give up their entrenched position of power and influence on the dock front. So they needed to prepare themselves very carefully for that. Of course, they were again very determined to change the situation over a period of time and not give up like the present Government, which has a blueprint to do something but has not the courage of its convictions to implement the change. </PARA>
<PARA> The port employers got rid of the national agreements; they were out. The agreements were made at a local level as between the local employers and local work force. New contracts were drawn up that had nothing to do with the old arrangements. There were no demarcation disputes at these local ports. Retraining was introduced so that personnel could be retrained in the newer techniques and the use of modern technology. There were flexible work patterns and, of course, fundamentally the labour pooling arrangements were out. The improvement of technology and productivity went up 25 per cent and 400 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall the honourable member for Shortland suggesting that it was very hard to make judgments about the improvements in productivity. One can certainly make some judgments about the improvements. One only needs to walk around the waterfront to see whether the men actually got up and worked. Some waterside workers have been heard to report that if they did a day's work they would nearly die from the effort involved. I think it is very easy to make the judgment about improvements of productivity by making just some visual observations. </PARA>
<PARA> The real competition that was induced by the change in the system in Britain has now made the British ports competitive with Europe and other ports around the world. Shippers are now prepared to go to England, deliver their goods and collect their exports, whereas they were always fearful that if they arrived in England they would not be too sure of what strike they would encounter and how long they would be there. The situation in these two examples gives a clear indication to the Government that it has a blueprint for change, but it is so hobbled in its attitudes and approach, its in-principle agreement and the never ending negotiating position, that will never bring about any change in the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is committed to bringing about change. When we are elected to government next time we will have a blueprint for action. We will implement it swiftly and cooperatively with the work force, with the stevedores, with the ship owners and with the port authorities. We will move to corporatise and privatise various ports and we will make the Australian waterfront competitive on a world basis because we will have the plan and, what is more, we will have the courage to act and implement that plan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little staggered by the contribution from my good friend the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). All I can describe it as is sad and blinkered. As a fellow Victorian from the country region I would have liked to have seen a little more honesty and creativity in what he had to say. To his constituents who are listening tonight I can only say that in most of the speech he used those platitudes that have been mouthed from day to day around the bush about a fair day's pay for a fair day's work on the waterfront. He spent most of his speech talking about the British example and the New Zealand example. When one comes to the facts of the Australian example, Opposition members really have nothing to say. The honourable member concluded his speech by telling us about all the wonderful things that the coalition would do when it came to office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I may sound a little passionate about this, and I apologise to my friend the honourable member if I do, but I will give him the background. My father was a policeman on the docks in Victoria when I was a young boy. He was the first person to explain to me what actually happened with the waterfront agreement back in the late 1950s when containerisation was introduced. It is something that nobody in the farm sector is ever prepared to talk about. It was an arrangement between the cartels and the unions, fully endorsed by the government of the day at both the State level, under the Bolte Liberal Government in Victoria, and at the Federal level under the Menzies Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangement that was agreed to on the waterfront, the trade-off for the introduction of containerisation, was that no wharfie would lose his job. That was guaranteed and no matter how long it took the only way that manpower on the waterfront would be reduced would be by natural attrition. In the last 25 years a work force of 35,000 has been reduced now to about 5,000 via that process of natural attrition, totally via an agreement between the cartels, the unions and the government of the day. Opposition members will never go out and tell any of their people that fact. They will never own up to the fact that they condoned a lifelong agreement of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I happened to see today in the Australian Financial Review a report about delays on the waterfront costing $1 billion per annum. I looked at that article and thought, `Here we go again on the fair day's pay for a fair day's work stuff', which the honourable member for Corangamite has been talking about. Why is it costing $1 billion on our waterfront? The article reports on a study, the details of which I will not go into; honourable members may look it up if they so wish. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the cost to importers of unpredictable delays resulting from late ship arrivals, port congestion, Customs congestion and industrial disputes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let us go to the question of industrial disputes on the waterfront since 1983. They are quite rare. There has been very little industrial disputation on the waterfront. I know that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), has a very close interest in this. When he was the Minister for Transport and Communications in the last government he actually started this process of waterfront reform. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the process is still going on but the point is that it is a bit like the in-principle agreement. Somebody said to me the other day that the in-principle agreement between the transport Ministers for a national freight initiative in rail is only an in-principle agreement, but it is the first one in 100 years. The present Opposition had 30 years in government and it had its own governments in power in most of the States, yet it could not get anywhere with this stuff. In a relatively short period this Government has produced a number of agreements. A number of the essential components of the in-principle agreement on the waterfront relate to the reduction in manpower by way of the redundancy agreements. This did not occur when the party to which the honourable member belongs was in government, even though it had all the chances to do so. This Government is funding that initiative to the tune of $154m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What actually comes out of all this is the fact that once again we have to go to the heart of the matter. It is all very well for members of the Opposition to come in here and say, `When we are in government we will do it'. But when they were in government they did not do so. The fact is that we are the ones who are doing it. It is sad and pathetic that the honourable member for Corangamite can come into this chamber and continue to roll out this stuff about a fair day's pay for a fair day's work on the waterfront when these agreements are being worked through and he knows very well that the principal causes of delays on the waterfront have nothing to do with labour relations. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been next to no industrial disputes on the waterfront in the last five years. Most of the problems are related to phasing out of these industrial agreements that the honourable member condoned via that container package. They are to do with reinvestment and turning around a number of things that cause congestion on the waterfront, things that we are tackling through the whole national freight initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> This fact is not lost on some of the Opposition's best supporters. I happened to notice a press release from the New South Wales division of the National Farmers Federation. It is always pretty hostile in its attitudes towards us. This was yet another example of it. </PARA>

It is pretty confused. It refers to certain things and then comes to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). The press release states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Primary Industries Minister John Kerin cops much of Mr Taylor's tongue lashing. Mr Taylor said no man in history had done more to single-handedly destroy agriculture than Mr Kerin. </PARA>
<PARA>How about that? Then he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> He has gained wide respect in the bush for his forthrightness and honesty. Mr Kerin's place in history as Australia's best agriculture Minister...</PARA>
<PARA>If that is what is called a tongue lashing I fail to see where the logic is. The logic appears on page two. Opposition policies about the waterfront are of direct relevance to primary producers. Mr Taylor, President of the New South Wales Farmers Association, said about our friends on the other side:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Opposition hasn't exactly been covering itself in glory either. Most Opposition front benchers are performing like political eunuchs unable to lay a glove on the Government during a time of financial turmoil. Doesn't the Opposition want to win office? It should be clearly spelling out to the nation where the Government is going wrong. Its-</PARA>
<PARA>the Opposition's-</PARA>
<PARA>handling of the wool price crisis has been limp and unimaginative. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corangamite and I both know that he represents one of the premier wool growing areas in Australia. We both know that wool growers are as concerned about the waterfront as anyone else. Opposition members have had a chance in the Parliament tonight to spell out their policies, to spell out the way they would approach the problem. The honourable member for Corangamite spoke about some fanciful English syndrome, about the glorious scenario in New Zealand, but he said absolutely nothing about how the Opposition would do anything differently, other than to say that it is all happening too slowly. I have to say about him and about Opposition front bench members that Mr Taylor was right when he said that most Opposition frontbenchers are performing like political eunuchs, unable to lay a glove on the Government during a time of financial turmoil. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to make the point that the in-principle agreement whereby the Government is establishing a framework for new employment arrangements, including the introduction of enterprise employment at major ports, is working towards rejuvenation of the work force by the retirement of 3,000 older employees and recruitment of 1,000 new young entrants, funded by $154m from the Budget. We are working on programs of improved training, award restructuring, and negotiation of revised employment arrangements at regional and grain ports. As indicated, considerable progress has been made so far. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member should not come into this place and say that no progress has been made, when in fact progress has been made. Instead of mouthing platitudes he should read the first six-months report from the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, which is the organisation that facilitates and monitors progress and has responsibility for allocating Government funds for redundancy and training. In that report the Authority indicates that considerable progress has been made. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of mouthing his platitudes, the honourable member for Corangamite should remember the words of Mr Taylor and of the former Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who spoke just before dinner. The contribution of the honourable member for Corangamite was sad and blinkered and full of platitudes to his colleagues among the sheep growers in the western districts. They are the people who ring up and say to him, `Listen, you have to do something about those wharfies'. He stands up in the Parliament and says, `For heaven's sake do something about the wharfies'. The minute someone does something and a dispute arises on the wharves, those people are the first to send a telex saying, `For heaven's sake, get the wharves moving. We cannot have our stock sitting on the wharves, delayed by these industrial disputes. For heaven's sake, work out a better arrangement.'</PARA>
<PARA> That has been the experience of successive Ministers in this Government. Opposition members bleat about these things, but the minute there is any hardship involved they are the first to be banging on the doors, lobbying for relief. All I ask them to do is to cut out the hypocrisy. Next time the honourable member for Corangamite has a chance to make a contribution to a debate he should come in and spell out the programs, spell out the policies, spell out what he would do differently. For heaven's sake, do something. I do not mind Mr Taylor from the New South Wales Farmers Association bagging the Government. I remember that when the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), who is in the chamber tonight, was chairman of the country task force, we regularly met with these people and heard this point of view from Mr Taylor. But when Mr Taylor describes those opposite, his own people, as performing like political eunuchs, all I can say is that they have to do a hell of a lot of work in the reality of policy production. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation. It is part of the continuing process of waterfront reform. It will facilitate the program of reform and restructuring that is built into the in-principle agreement. In relation to this matter the Opposition should go away and have a good hard look at itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I should like to reply to a few of the points that have been made by the Opposition in the course of this second reading debate and to correct some of the gross misrepresentations that have been put forward by Opposition members. Almost every speaker from the Opposition seemed to make the point that what they saw as being fundamentally wrong with the Government's waterfront reform process was that it would achieve only a 30 per cent increase in productivity over three years. I do not know whether that was deliberate, but it is a fundamental misunderstanding and misrepresentation of that reform process. The 30 per cent figure is simply the minimum increase in productivity that is required to maintain output with the reduction in the work force of around 23 per cent that will occur through the net reduction of 2,000 in the work force over a three-year period through redundancy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is looking at a minimum increase of 30 per cent, just so that the business can be handled at the same level as it is at present with a much reduced work force. No-one has ever said or implied-certainly not me or the current Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) or the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley)-that that is all the Government is seeking. The Government expects to get a hell of a lot more than 30 per cent increase in productivity from the fundamental changes it is making to employment in this industry, with employment arrangements moving from the historic industry arrangements, which were tolerated right throughout the decades of conservative government in this country in the postwar period, to the new form of enterprise employment that this Government is introducing. We expect that that reform will lead to a much more competitive environment on the waterfront and to much greater increases in productivity than 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The second point that has been made is that nothing has been achieved, that all of this is just something that is going on, with discussions and talking, and that nothing is happening. Again, that is arrant nonsense. Already some major improvements have been made in operations in some areas, and in our view very large changes will be forthcoming in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of what has already happened under the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) process, in the grain loading terminals changes have been made. I thought that matter would have been of interest to a member of the National Party of Australia such as the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), the Opposition's spokesman in this area. But he never bothered to mention it in his half-hour speech. I understand why: it did not fit in with the theme of his speech that nothing was happening. In this area, which is of fundamental importance to the rural industry, there has been a tremendous change in the 19 grain loading terminals around this country. There has been a reduction in the labour level by more than 50 per cent, and in some parts of the grain loading operations reductions of up to 77 per cent have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Those reductions have been greeted almost with rapture by the industry-by the National Farmers Federation, by the Grains Council of Australia and by the Australian Wheat Board. They have been ecstatic about the kind of change that this has introduced. Without wanting to delay the House too long, let me refer to some of the comments that have been made. In the Australian Financial Review of 4 July the following appeared:</PARA>
<PARA> Former arch critic of the WIRA process, the National Farmers Federation, yesterday acknowledged that it (WIRA) had delivered the `big ticket item. The grains industry has now set the pace for this crucial area of micro-economic reform', National Farmers Federation executive member and Grains Council of Australia President, Mr Andrew Inglis said. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The National Farmers' Federation said the new labour levels represented an``outstanding success in the long running battle to reform bulk grain loading operations.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, from the National Farmers Federation there is tremendous support. From the Australian Wheat Board, Mr Rowden, the Acting General Manager, was reported in the Daily Commercial News of 6 July to have said:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals are a significant step forward in reform of the waterfront and proof that progress can be achieved by rational consultation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition says that nothing can be achieved by rational consultation and that we have to get in there and kick heads. Mr Rowden went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be immediate savings in the cost of loading a ship and there are plans in progress which will cut the time taken to turn a ship around and achieve even greater savings for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>I am delighted with the result, which will mean a more competitive AWB. There is, of course, a flow-on benefit to all other grain exporters from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>We have the honourable member for Gilmore saying that nothing has happened when we have had tremendous change accepted by the wheat industry as being an enormous success and with flow-on benefits. He says nothing has flowed on, that the farmers have been cheated of the benefits of waterfront reform. Here we have the Wheat Board saying this is tremendous for the farmers. So it is just a total refusal by the honourable member to face what is happening. When the Opposition says nothing has happened it really means to say that nothing has happened that it is prepared to acknowledge or that nothing has happened that it knows of. I am not sure whether it is ignorance or just refusal to discuss or face up to the factual situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of nothing having happened, it is also not true to say there have been no redundancies. The honourable member for Gilmore said that we could not count what he called the `night watchman'. I do not know who he thought he was talking about. The gangway watchman classification-not the night watchman classification-has been abolished and as a result of the abolition of that classification 277 watchmen are now out of the industry. They form part of the 3,000 who are to go out of the industry in the three-year period, so they are part of the WIRA process. Their redundancies have been paid for in the way that all the other redundancies will be paid for through the WIRA process; that is, half by the Government and half by the industry. This is the first substantial step in the process of a very large number of redundancies which will occur in the industry over the three-year period. The rest has to wait until the enterprise agreements have been finalised. As I will mention in a moment, they are not far away. </PARA>
<PARA> Rationalisation of the waterfront unions is also coming on at a fast rate with negotiations in place to bring eight of the major unions down to two. Award restructuring is also proceeding. An interim award has been developed and that interim award most importantly gave the green light to negotiating enterprise agreements which have proceeded apace since the middle of this year and the finalisation of that interim award. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to enterprise agreements, can I say that they are the key element of the reform, as I mentioned. The substantial progress in negotiations is occurring in relation to the main operators in the ports of Melbourne and Sydney. We expect that a couple of agreements will be concluded very shortly and that others will follow soon after. The Government is confident that by the end of this year we will see a number of such agreements in place, enabling major reform to take place in 1991 as we move into the new era of enterprise employment. So it is simply not true to say that nothing is happening. A great deal has been happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Already there are significant achievements in terms of dramatic increases in productivity in grain terminals. I should mention one other area where there has been dramatic change and that relates to the coal loading area, which is not directly under the WIRA process but which was pointed out by the Inter-State Commission as being an area in great need of reform and much criticised in its document. It suggested that there should be a change in the way of operations of coal loading. </PARA>
<PARA> That has now occurred in Newcastle where there has been a merger of two companies. As a result of that a much more efficient operation has been put in place with the Maritime Services Board, the New South Wales Government operation, getting out of the industry. As a result of that the general manager of Port Waratah Coal Services, Mr Boyd, was quoted in the Australian of 3 September of this year as saying that the increased efficiencies had shot Port Waratah Coal Services from being ordinary to being up there with the best coal handling operations in the world. It is now more productive than Canada, than Queensland and Richards Bay in South Africa, which is about the same size. That is just another example of the fact that significant change is indeed taking place and next year we will see far more significant change with the introduction of enterprise employment. </PARA>
<PARA> There was much discussion about productivity achievements in comparison with other countries. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) discussed this. I just re-emphasise the point that he made, which was that in looking at comparisons of productivity increase with other countries we have to be very careful to make sure that we are comparing like with like. Just for starters, one should have regard to the starting points. In New Zealand quite substantial productivity achievements have now been put in place at least in some of the major ports, but it was starting from a base of about 65 per cent of the productivity of the Australian waterfront. So of course there is much more scope for New Zealand to get dramatic productivity improvements than there is for Australia, but even so I remain quite confident that Australia will compare very well with New Zealand when our procedure is finalised. It will have been achieved without the problems that New Zealand had of tremendous disruption with massive stoppages on the waterfront disrupting the industry for months last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I just say that what becomes clear in all of this is that the Opposition has no alternative viable plan. The proposals that we hear from it are basically of the form, `Let's rush in and kick heads and throw our weight around'. As soon as it had massive industrial disputation it would go to water as it always has. Last year we saw what the Opposition was like when the nation was faced with the difficult situation of the strike of the pilots. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. We faced up to it. We did not do what the Opposition wanted to do. It wanted to go in there and say, `Let's negotiate with the pilots. We cannot have this dispute going on. It's a terrible thing having this dispute in this port and industry. We have to get everyone back to work. We cannot have this going on.' The Opposition would have given in in the first five minutes. The same would be true of the waterfront. Once there was a stoppage of any length of time the Opposition would be as weak as it always was. It uses a lot of words in opposition but does not take much action in government. For 30 years it had a chance to do something about this and did absolutely nothing about it. When the Government is actually doing something about putting in place a massive reform program which will transform the industry, the Opposition has nothing to say about those substantial elements that have already been achieved. All it has to say is that if it were in office it would do it better when everyone knows that it would not have a hope of doing it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Moving from that subject, I would also like to thank those members from this side of the House who participated in this afternoon's and this evening's debate-the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer)-who all very vigorously and knowledgeably made their contributions to the debate. I just take the opportunity to refer to one or two of the things that actually do impact on the amendment which is before the House this evening and just draw on some of the comments. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened to the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who was the first of the speakers from the Government side this evening. He made a point, which has been restated by other Government speakers and with which I do not disagree-I am sure the honourable member for Throsby would find that unusual-that the problems of the waterfront are not wholly and solely caused by wharfies, the Waterside Workers Federation. I think that is a very fair comment. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had a fair opportunity now over the last 12 months or so to study what has happened on the waterfront in years gone by. Certainly the Waterside Workers Federation and its membership are partly responsible for some of the inefficiencies and bad work practices that exist there, but it is also fair to say that stevedores, shippers and, indeed, governments of the past are also responsible for the problems that now plague our waterfront. So, to be fair, I think the Waterside Workers Federation gets clubbed around the ears a lot for what goes on, but a lot of the problems on the waterfront are not solely its fault. Indeed, many of the people in the Waterside Workers Federation-some of the ordinary members and some of the local branch secretaries-that one meets as one travels around Australia are among the most realistic and straightforward people one will find in conducting discussions with those who are knowledgeable about the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> I had an experience of that only last week when I met a first rate secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation in Darwin. He was a very straightforward talker and, although we did not agree on many of the things we discussed, I thought that the view he put forward indicated that he was as aware as anybody else of the need to create proper reform, to change the work practices and to make our waterfront as competitive as those around the world. So waterside workers are not all to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take up a couple of points made by the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), who made a contribution to the debate tonight, as he does on so many occasions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to the amendment. I thank you, Mr Chairman, for reminding me to do so. The purpose of moving this amendment is to place a timetable on the Government to finish off the program it has set itself. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is at the table tonight, no longer has the principal responsibility for waterfront reform, but he initiated--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, he was moved on. I do not think the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) felt that he was up to the task, but without wishing to be too personal I will go on to say that the Minister at the table, who introduced this legislation into the House on 1 June last year, indicated that the period for reform of the waterfront would be three years-and, on that basis, 1 June 1992 would be the conclusion of a three-year reform program by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister has pointed out, the Government hopes to achieve a reform program that will see an efficiency gain of some 30 per cent. He places it in minimum terms. In realistic style, one would have to say that if that is the Government's minimum that is all that it is likely to end up getting. So I think that a 30 per cent efficiency gain on the waterfront is all that this Government will get. If one speaks to people in the industry, they also say that that is all the Government will get. </PARA>
<PARA> But as I talk of these things I am reminded of the comments of the honourable member for Burke. One of the reasons why the Government needs a finalisation date written into the legislation for its reform program, which is the subject of this amendment, is that the waterfront has had a number of industrial disputes over the past few years and even in the past few days. The honourable member for Burke actually asked, `When was the last time you heard of a strike on the Australian waterfront?'. I can recall a national strike on the Australian waterfront only last Friday. </PARA>
<PARA> I discovered one of the reasons why there are not more strikes on the Australian waterfront when I visited the port of Botany late last year. Indeed, the Waterside Workers Federation people were there and were proposing to call a strike in both Sydney and Adelaide on that day. It turned out that most of the wharfies were on idle time and at home, and there seemed little point in having a strike on a day when most of them were enjoying the pleasures of a day off but being paid in full. They decided to delay that strike and have it on another day when everybody was being paid full time and was actually at work. So, quite often, one will find that there are not more disputes on the Australian waterfront simply because idle time ensures that a strike cannot take place since most of the blokes are at home on full pay on so many days of the week. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one of the problems with this industry. One of the reasons why the Government is going as softly as it is in its reform program is that in the past the waterside workers have shown a degree of militancy and an eagerness to go on strike at the drop of a hat. Of course, in the process, they also have a very close association with this Labor Government, and through that they are causing this Government to move very slowly on reform of the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen examples of reform-and I have talked about them tonight-that have taken place in New Zealand. I note that the Minister claims that the New Zealand waterfront had a very low base to start from and, therefore, it could very quickly catch up and gain some significant efficiencies. However, I point out that, according to the statistics of the New Zealand Labour Government, before its reform program started the Australian waterfront was 30 per cent more expensive to use than the New Zealand waterfront. Today, the New Zealand waterfront, post the New Zealand Labour Government's reforms, is considerably less expensive and, indeed, the Australian waterfront is now 60 per cent more expensive than that of New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister might say that the New Zealand waterfront came from a low base, but according to the New Zealand Government's own statistics that base was not quite as low a base as has been suggested. Also it would seem from the New Zealand statistics that the Australian waterfront was a lot further behind the New Zealand waterfront before its reform programs began. Now, after the New Zealand reform program, the Australian waterfront is even further behind. So that is the state in which the Australian waterfront finds itself. We are falling further and further behind the rest of the world as far as efficiency levels are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment should be passed tonight because the Government needs to have a timetable placed upon it. This amendment is all about having a timetable of 1 June 1992 in order to ensure that the Government cannot wriggle out of its commitment that these reform programs will be finalised within a three-year period. The original legislation, if my memory serves me right, says that the reform program and the levy arrangements will be completed at the discretion of the Minister. This amendment puts a final timetable on it, a timetable which was originally set by the Government itself, and I urge the House to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes this amendment. I do not believe it is at all necessary. The Government has indicated its program quite clearly, and that is to achieve the reform of the waterfront over a three-year period. This Bill is part of the process of achieving that. The Bill proposes arrangements for the phasing out of the general levy which is imposed in respect of Division B waterside workers, those in the non-permanent ports, who are assisted by the cross-subsidies contained in the levy arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal is that, as ports move to the new enterprise arrangements, the cross-subsidies will cease to apply. This will mean that the levy will need to be altered at various times to reduce its level. So there will be a continuous process of the levy being reduced, of the non-permanent ports going into the new arrangements. When all that is complete, which we expect to be within the three-year period, there will be notification, as proposed in the Bill, by the Minister in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of the date on which the levy would be concluded. </PARA>
<PARA> So I do not see the point in having the amendment proposed by the Opposition. We have arrangements here for the phasing out of the levy. They are consistent with the Government's plan for reform of the industry, and there is no need for this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The First Home Owners Amendment Bill is primarily the result of the Government's Budget announcement to abolish the first home owners scheme and to devolve its function to the States. The Bill also fixes 30 June 1991 as the cut-off date by which applications for assistance under the first home owners scheme must be received by the Department of Community Services and Health. The Bill makes two other minor amendments. Firstly, it makes it an offence recklessly to make a false or misleading statement in conjunction with applications made for first home owners assistance. It is currently an offence knowingly to make such statements. The second amendment corrects drafting oversights affecting applications made since last December. These oversights have resulted in the inequitable treatment of certain migrants, generally from New Zealand, in the application of the scheme's income test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The coalition will not be opposing the Bill because, essentially, we believe that the principle behind the devolution of the first home owners scheme to the States is correct. But that is not to say that we do not have some concerns about the way in which the Government has made these changes. In particular, we are concerned about the lack of detail which has accompanied the changes, but I will address those concerns in more detail a little later on. </PARA>
<PARA> First, I would like briefly to outline the history of the first home owners scheme. The first home owners scheme was introduced on 1 October 1983 and it had three aims: to assist low to moderate income earners into home ownership; to stimulate the construction of new home dwellings; and to create new jobs. When introducing the first home owners scheme, the then Minister for Housing and Construction said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>Our program is designed to achieve the dual objectives of ensuring that housing plays a key role in our economic recovery and ensuring that Australian families can gain access to adequate housing at a price they can afford. </PARA>
<PARA>At the time the scheme was introduced, the number of residential unit commencements stood at around 138,000-a number very similar to the 137,000 new commencements in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of that statement in the then Minister's second reading speech and the aims of the scheme, it seems to me strange that it would be changed when similar conditions exist now as existed when the scheme was first introduced. Indeed, this is reinforced by this year's Budget Statements which stated that the first home owners scheme was introduced to stimulate activity in the housing sector at a time of recession. </PARA>
<PARA> By the Government's own admission our economy is now in recession and the housing sector especially is feeling the pinch. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) might care to explain later on in the debate why the Government chose to cut the scheme now, when home dwelling unit approvals are poor and home affordability is also low. I also ask the Minister why the Government did not choose to cut the scheme in the 1988-89 financial year when dwelling unit approvals were at a peak, and when the building industry itself would have been better placed to sustain those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> The first home owners scheme replaced the Fraser Government's home deposit assistance scheme, special tax rebate scheme for first home buyers, and general tax rebate on housing loan interest. Collective expenditure on these Fraser Government schemes was around $360m-some $240m higher than that given under the first home owners scheme in the last financial year. This illustrates by how much assistance to first home buyers has fallen off under this Government, although, when first introduced, the first home owners scheme did work quite well, boosting the number of residential unit commencements to over 152,000 in 1984-85. In the same year the scheme provided assistance to 88,000 applicants. That assistance was valued at over $289m. Shortly thereafter, however, the scheme began to decline and, in recent years, it has become increasingly obvious that the scheme has not been working successfully.</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has consistently tightened eligibility and it has steadfastly refused to increase the income eligibility threshold. Indeed, the income eligibility threshold was not even indexed and, since it was last increased back in 1985, it has been substantially eroded by inflation and wage rises. In fact, the current threshold is so unrealistic that, to qualify for full assistance, a family must be earning so little that they would barely be able to sustain the repayments on even a very small housing loan. </PARA>
<PARA> The actual value of the grant has also not been increased for quite some time. In fact, the value of the grant was actually reduced from $7,000 to just over $5,000 in 1986. Again, the actual purchasing power of the grant has been eroded by inflation and rapidly rising housing prices. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of all these factors, it is hardly surprising that expenditure on the scheme has been steadily dropping. In its first year of operation, expenditure on the first home owners scheme was $141m. It reached a peak of $289m in 1984-85. Since 1985, expenditure has been falling and, in the last financial year, it came in at $119m. That is $26m less than originally allocated. Similarly, the number of applications assisted has also been falling. In its initial year of operation, the scheme helped over 54,000 families into their own homes. The greatest number assisted was in 1984-85 when 88,533 families received assistance. However, in the last financial year, tight eligibility criteria took their toll, with only 25,010 families being approved for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The first home owners scheme is also inequitable. The scheme, as it was, provided uniform grants of the same value to all approved applicants. As such, it did not take into account the variation in housing prices which occurs between different capital cities and between capital cities and regional towns. As a result, a grant given to a home buyer in, say, Wagga Wagga was proportionately worth more than the same grant given to a home buyer in Sydney simply because house prices in Sydney are much higher than those in Wagga. </PARA>
<PARA> Given all of this, it is not surprising that I have repeatedly called for this Government to review the first home owners scheme. But may I say that what the Government came up with was not really what I had in mind. In seeking this review, I also considered that it should be done in conjunction with all other policies affecting the housing sector. In recent years the Government's treatment of both home buyers and the building industry has been less than fair and certainly less than desirable. Indeed, in formulating its policies, the Government has shown scant regard for the housing sector and the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate that point, let us look at the impact of the past monetary policy of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). High interest rates which he has put into place have hit home buyers hard. In less than five years, home loan interest rates have increased by a massive 4 1/2 percentage points from 12 1/2 per cent in July 1985 to 17 per cent in July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> For the average home buyer this has meant a huge jump in the amount of mortgage repayments. Indeed, the amount of income needed to service the average home loan has been steadily climbing and at a rate which far exceeds the growth in wages. According to the home loan affordability index of the Real Estate Institute of Australia, in March 1980, 17.4 per cent of a family's wage was needed to service the average home loan. By March 1983 this figure had increased slightly to 19.3 per cent. By December 1985, 23.3 per cent of income was needed to repay home mortgages. Twelve months later this figure had increased by over 49 per cent to a huge 27.1 per cent-and it does not stop there. By December 1988, families were spending a massive 31.7 per cent of their income just to repay their mortgages. December 1989 saw a further jump of 5 per cent, up to 36.4 per cent. This meant that in December last year the average family was making mortgage repayments of over $1,000 per month, and they started out making repayments of $227 per month. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures are worse still in Sydney. In that city home owners in March 1980 contributed 18 per cent of their salaries towards home loan repayments. This figure had jumped to 24 per cent by March 1986, and by March 1989 the figure needed to service a home loan had escalated to 41.1 per cent. But in June this year home owners were paying a massive 44.3 per cent of their income towards their mortgages. This equates to almost $1,300 per month. Home loan affordability has dropped slightly in recent few months in the wake of the Government's slight easing of monetary policy. Nationally, home loan affordability now stands at 35.2 per cent. In spite of the slight reduction, this figure is still far too high. But the situation would be much worse if it were not for the deregulation of the banking sector which provided an increase in the supply of funds for housing. Deregulation also provided the banks with the opportunity to develop innovative programs to help home buyers. One of the most successful programs has been their fixed interest rate loans, which have been targeted primarily at first home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, the impact of the Treasurer's high interest rate policies on families has been to make home ownership a privilege, and that is wrong. To own their own home should be the right of every Australian family. For those who have managed to cope with the high increases in interest rates, it has meant dramatic changes in their lifestyles. Families have been forced to make great sacrifices-holidays, cars and clothes-and in some cases parents have had to put off having more children simply because they cannot afford to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Most families have suffered significant falls in their lifestyles. In many cases, one salary is no longer enough. As a result, mothers have been forced out to work-forced to leave their children in day care or with relatives-just to make ends meet. In fact, the number of females forced into the work force has increased dramatically in recent years. In 1983-84, 2.3 million females were in the work force. In the last financial year, 3.2 million females were out working. This represents an increase of 34 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Many families have not made it. We are seeing families forced out of their homes and onto the streets by their funding institutions because they cannot afford to keep up with the mortgage repayments. We have seen record numbers of people staying in the private rental market. Waiting lists for public housing have also increased dramatically as more families find it difficult to cope in the private rental market. Public housing waiting lists are currently at record levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Coupled with this declining affordability has been a dramatic increase in house prices. This puts home ownership further out of the reach of many Australians. Nationally, average house prices have increased by 130 per cent since 1980, from $49,000 to $113,000 in 1988-89. In Sydney, however, that increase has been more dramatic-160 per cent in nine years. Indeed, the price of an average home in Sydney is now over $206,000, up from $42,000 in 1980. But there has also been a second flow-on effect from the Treasurer's high interest rate policy, and that has been to drive the building industry into a slump. Given that one of the aims of the first home owners scheme was to provide a boost for the building industry, it is contradictory for the Treasurer to deliberately cut the scheme and force the industry into the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of high interest rates, reduced home loan affordability, high house prices and the pitiful assistance offered under the first home owners scheme, the number of home building commencements has dropped significantly in the last year. Commencements fell from a high of 175,000 in 1988-89 down to 137,000 in 1989-90. All indications are that this number will drop further over this financial year. The effect on the building industry has been devastating. Employment in the industry has fallen from 617,000 in the March quarter of this year to 573,000 in the June quarter. This is a drop of over 7 per cent in just three months. Indeed, I venture to say that it is the building and construction industry which first felt the effects of the harsh economic recession into which the Hawke Government has driven this country. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying is that, given all these factors affecting home buyers and the building industry, the Government's timing in abolishing the first home owners scheme is somewhat inappropriate. I believe it would have been more appropriate to amend the scheme when the building industry was operating at a satisfactory level and was more able to sustain the changes. In changing the first home owners scheme, the Government has decided to abolish the Federal administration and management of the scheme and devolve this administration of the scheme's funding to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, the coalition has no problem with the principle of this. Given the varying prices of houses and land in each of the States, it is appropriate that the scheme be administered in a manner which takes account of those variations. It is the States which are best placed to do this. To illustrate these types of variations, the price of an established home in Sydney is now $206,000; in Melbourne, $127,000; in Brisbane, $86,000; in Adelaide, $89,000; in Perth, $97,000; and in Hobart, $78,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The change to the scheme should also see some administrative savings. The States already administer their own housing assistance programs, while the Commonwealth administers the first home owners scheme. This duplicates work and is somewhat inefficient and certainly more expensive. Indeed, it is inappropriate for two levels of government to administer the same type of home purchase assistance. Naturally, any efficiency savings which can be made are welcome from a budgetary point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> The cruel blow which the Government has struck by making changes to the scheme has been to substantially reduce funding. The Government has allocated only $14m to be distributed amongst the States this financial year and $30m next year. This compares with Commonwealth funding for the first home owners scheme of $119m in 1989-90 and $176m in 1988-89. The paltry amount to be allocated to the scheme this financial year means that the financial assistance to first home buyers has dropped by a massive 850 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It also means that the Treasury has pocketed the money which should rightly have gone to first home buyers. That is typical of this Treasurer. He was not content to force record high interest rates onto home buyers, nor to price home ownership out of the reach of many families. Now he is lining the Treasury coffers with the funds that should have been directed to low income families struggling to buy their own homes. In cutting the funding, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has gone back on one of his commitments. The Prime Minister gave his assurance that when functions for which the Commonwealth had responsibility were transferred back to the States, fair compensation would be given. I hardly call a funding drop of 850 per cent fair compensation. In addition to slashing the funding, the Government has not developed any formula for the allocation of funding between the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Community Services and Health whether the funds will be allocated on a per capita basis, proportionately according to house prices, or will they just be split between the States and Territories eight ways? Until the States know what level of funding they are to receive, it will be impossible for them to start developing a replacement strategy to assist first home owners. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the way the Government operates. Members of the Government get all excited about all these ideas to do things. They are ideas which sound fine in principle, but they make the policy decision, announce it, and that is where it stops. They fail to think about the implications of the idea, the administration, and the implementation, and so it ends up a shambles. That happened with the training levy, and now it is about to happen with the first home owners scheme. We have a very good in-principle concept, but in applying that concept the Government has messed it up. Currently no guidelines exist for the States to assist them in administering the new funding. The Minister stated in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth will develop broad guidelines against which States will develop more flexible deposit assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>But we have not seen them yet. I trust that when developing these guidelines the Government will ensure that the home deposit assistance as administered by the States remains targeted towards first home owners. The Minister also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The new deposit assistance arrangements are envisaged to come into effect from 1 January 1991 provided agreements can be reached with State and Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems somewhat odd to me that the appropriate guidelines and agreements were not in fact negotiated prior to the Government's announcement of its decision. This would certainly have eliminated much of the uncertainty being experienced by both the States and prospective home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> As the new arrangements are not expected to come into effect until 1 January 1991, and that is only provided that the Government and the States can reach agreement, and the old scheme was abolished as at 22 August 1990, there is a time gap where no assistance is available at all. A funding vacuum exists in which home buyers are completely locked out from home purchase assistance. My concern lies with those eligible first home buyers who would otherwise have been approved to receive assistance but, because of this time lag, this vacuum, there is nothing available for them at all. Consequently, those families must either purchase their home and forgo the assistance they would otherwise have received, or hold off until at least January when the State government schemes come into force. However, if they choose the latter option they may miss out on their own dream home. They also will probably have to pay higher house prices in the new year as a result of inflation and increasing supply constraints. These problems will be exacerbated if the State and Federal governments cannot reach agreement and the implementation date drags on. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to touch on the comments by the housing industry on the Government's changes. Generally most housing and building industry organisations applaud the principle of devolving the first home owners scheme to the States. They, too, believe that because of the current inequities in the scheme and the variations in house prices it was appropriate that the States take control. But, like the coalition, they were critical of the way in which the devolution has taken place and also of the funding cut which has accompanied it. The Housing Industry Association said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the absorption of the first home owners scheme into payments to the States for home ownership assistance has the potential to open up opportunities for people in high cost regions, particularly Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>The Association went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But the $40m cut in funds against last years appropriation represents a nasty sting in the tail for home seekers battling to buy a home of their own. </PARA>
<PARA>The Real Estate Institute of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that only 14,000 home buyers will be assisted over the next two years by Commonwealth funding is a sad indictment of the Government's lack of support for home ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales Premier, Nick Greiner, applauded the Government's decision, saying it was obvious that the scheme had not been working, but the New South Wales Government also criticised the funding cuts to the scheme, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it was a further blow to young families trying to buy a house of their own. </PARA>
<PARA>Joe Schipp, the New South Wales Minister for Housing, has estimated that over the next two years only 2,000 families would be assisted by the money given to New South Wales in place of the first home owners scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to make a few comments on the Government's decision to conduct a review of national housing. It is reassuring to see that housing has at last been put back onto the agenda. There is a definite need for a coordinated approach to housing between the State and Federal governments, for a national direction for housing and for a national housing policy framework. It is my hope that the Government will use this opportunity to conduct a wide and far-ranging investigation into all areas impacting on housing, and I believe that the Government should include in this looking at the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The devastating impact of high interest rates on both the housing and building sectors is plain to see. Immigration is also an issue that impacts on housing. But, in addition, the review should also consider the impact of the economic recession we are now in. Changing lifestyles, the ageing population and demographic trends should also be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The Housing Industry Association's paper Housing Toward 2000 indicates that the number of young people purchasing their first home is steadily declining and, correspondingly, the number of people in the 35-to 44-year-old bracket is increasing. Those purchasing homes in the later age group have different needs to the needs of younger families. The HIA report also indicated that as the population grows older, the number of couples in the over 55-year-old group purchasing second homes is increasing. The report suggests that these are for both investment purposes and as retirement or holiday homes. Consequently, the type of housing that they will demand is different from that required by the younger age groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing that I believe the review should consider is the provision of adequate and affordable housing. In so doing, more innovative ways of providing housing should be looked at, and I point out as an excellent example the Green Street project. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I suggest that the national housing strategy look at public housing. There are currently record numbers on waiting lists for public housing, and record amounts being spent on public housing generally. This is not just spent on housing; it is also part of the substantial cost of maintaining and preparing those dwelling units. Indeed, it seems to have been the policy of this Government to create a dependency on welfare and public housing. This trend has to be reversed and it is up to the national housing strategy to set the ball rolling. </PARA>
<PARA> While I commend the Government on its initiative, I am also concerned that it is just another token gesture. Last year the previous Minister for Housing, the present Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), conducted a review into housing, and what came of it? Absolutely nothing. All the opportunities were there, but it is difficult to see that the national housing strategy will be any different. This view will be endorsed by industry. Bill Woolcock, of the Real Estate Institute of Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult to attribute anything coming from the announcement-that is of the national housing strategy-other than a cynical exercise to delay important housing decisions for another 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA>In closing, the Government has got the principle behind this Bill right. The first home owners scheme should be devolved to the States. It is only on the implementation that the Government has stumbled, and it is not so much a stumble but a gigantic fall. It has cut funding for first home buyers, it has not developed a formula for allocating funding, and it has not developed any guidelines against which funding should be administered.  The ultimate effect of all of this will be to put home ownership further out of the reach of ordinary Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the First Home Owners Amendment Bill, and in so doing commend it to the House as a demonstration of the Government's commitment to provide assistance to first home buyers on an efficient and equitable basis, as an example of the Government's commitment to restructuring its relations with the States and as a fitting dimension to this Government's dynamic housing policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first home owners scheme was introduced in October 1983 by the Hon. Chris Hurford, the former member for Adelaide and then Minister for Housing and Construction. It was designed to assist young Australian families purchase their own home as well as to stimulate housing and construction and create new jobs. This was one measure used by the Government to achieve a desperately needed kick-start to the economy, which had been driven into the ground by the former conservative coalition Government. Housing and construction was correctly believed to have a substantial multiplier effect on the employment front for each public dollar spent, and the economic stimulus thereby achieved was considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, home ownership is a traditional Australian means of achieving family stability and independence in life, but at that time the historic slump in the building industry and elsewhere in the economy and a shortage of housing finance were major impediments to many families achieving that goal. The first home owners scheme was just one aspect of the Government's overall housing policy, and it has to be acknowledged that there are always members of the community who are unable to purchase their own homes despite almost any measure of government assistance. As a result, any coherent housing strategy as a whole must incorporate a public housing component to provide for those who cannot enter the home ownership market and for others who, for a variety of reasons, may not want to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> For that reason, I would not support any downgrading of public housing. In Adelaide I work with Tony Elmers of the Housing Trust Tenants Association to ensure the continuation of funds to build and maintain public housing in South Australia. I recently submitted a petition organised by the Association, in which about 1,500 of my constituents called on the Government to maintain public housing levels. It also has to be recognised that for historical reasons unfortunately only about 5 per cent of our national housing stock is in public ownership, though the figures vary from a low in Queensland of about 3 per cent to a little over 10 per cent in South Australia. In my own electorate the figure would be higher again. This probably reflects the historic fact of a generation of Labor as against a generation of non-Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of the first home owners scheme in the private ownership market, however, can be gauged from the fact that since its introduction it has assisted more than 360,000 families into home ownership. This has been at a cost of $1.5 billion but it has been a cost well worth bearing while it was efficiently delivering the targets it was intended to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding this success, it has become apparent to the Government that disparities in real estate prices among the various States meant that the first home owners scheme was not providing assistance on an equitable basis. Obviously, the grants available under the scheme-up to $5,000 over five years-were of more use to families in cities where house prices have remained moderate, as in Adelaide, than in cities such as Sydney, where they have risen very rapidly over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, it was a scheme more useful to people buying in areas of new housing on cheaper land, usually distant from city centres and often devoid of other social services. The number of people receiving assistance under the first home owners scheme has in any case declined by about 50 per cent over the past two years, serving further notice that its efficiency as a mechanism for providing assistance was in fact declining. This was while the number of people benefiting from State-run purchase assistance has more than doubled during the same period, from 16,000 to 32,500. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, it appears that the first home owners scheme has been used by people already benefiting from home purchase assistance arrangements administered by the States. Nationally, around 40,000 home purchase assistance loans are expected to be provided in 1990-91. For example, in South Australia-which I know best-we now have the homesure scheme, which provides assistance according to criteria such as the interest payable on a loan as against the proportion of household income used to meet mortgage repayments. We have the homestart scheme which provides assistance in arranging loans. We have the interest rate protection plan which assists families who do not enjoy housing loans, with a maximum interest rate of 13.5 per cent. We also have the mortgage relief scheme which provides assistance to low income households in meeting repayments for limited periods, such as in the event of illness or unemployment. I am reliably informed that comparable programs are operating in other States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> Not that there is anything wrong with families receiving help from both the Commonwealth and the States, but it has meant that different forms of assistance have been provided to home buyers by two different levels of government. It makes sense, therefore-and I agree with the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) in this respect-to rationalise these forms of assistance in order to prove equity, make them relevant to the circumstances pertaining in each State, which vary, and eliminate duplication of administrative costs. This is essentially what the Bill is all about: a recognition of the changes in the housing market, a change in State sponsored assistance programs and a change in the relevance of a Commonwealth program that was designed in different circumstances seven years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The First Home Owners Amendment Bill, therefore, ceases all new assistance to first home buyers as of Budget night, and there will be no federally administered scheme to replace it. On the other hand, the Commonwealth is now negotiating with the States with a view to increasing funding under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement for home purchase assistance purposes. These funds will be used specifically to assist families establish deposits towards the purchase of their first home. The new arrangements, whereby $14m will be made available during 1990-91, and $30m during 1991-92, should come into effect from 1 January next year. </PARA>
<PARA> As I foreshadowed, these changes have two principal advantages. First-and I agree again with the honourable member for Forrest in this respect again-decentralised administration of deposit assistance will mean that the State governments can develop programs tailored to local market conditions and therefore the particular needs of their residents. The first home owners scheme was deficient in this respect, particularly during the latter few years of its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Each State will be able to place its programs in the context of its overall housing strategy, and will not be hampered by Commonwealth decisions in this respect. The housing environment in South Australia, for example, is very different from that in New South Wales. And in Adelaide we are aiming for a process of urban consolidation. As the city has gradually expanded to the north and the south, the satellite cities of Noarlunga in the south and Elizabeth in the north have become outer suburbs. This has created certain problems which are being redressed by urban consolidation developments such as Westlakes, which transformed swamp land into one of Adelaide's most prestigious suburbs and will be further redressed by the proposed multifunction polis (MFP). The infrastructure provided by the MFP, in terms of public facilities, education and employment opportunities, will be a godsend to the currently underprivileged suburbs to the north of the metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA> We can also aim for urban consolidation through redeveloping the potential of the splendid city centre. In the early days occupants of the city centre were possibly five times the number that they are today, and much of the infrastructure then provided still remains. The potential is there to create a large inner city, town house based population, which could enjoy the innumerable services that city living provides. This would no doubt be partly in private rental, private ownership and public housing, as is essentially the situation today. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the termination of the first home owners scheme will produce considerable savings by eliminating administrative costs which have been duplicated by the operation of similar State schemes parallel with those of the Commonwealth. It is because of these two advantages that the First Home Owners Amendment Bill is additionally noteworthy. It underlines the Federal Government's readiness to review its own activities and those of State governments so that where possible and where it is appropriate a more efficient and cost effective division of responsibilities can be negotiated between the different tiers of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has of course spoken at length on this subject and a special Premiers Conference will soon be held to discuss this matter further and in wider parameters. This Bill demonstrates already the Commonwealth Government's bona fides on this issue. We are not merely talking about a new relationship between the Commonwealth and the States, as did the previous Government but we are implementing one. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of housing assistance, the Federal Government is more than willing to allocate funds for housing but it recognises that the task is best assessed and then performed by the State governments. There will be no overgovernment in the area of housing. But as the Commonwealth gets out of the area of directly assisting first home owner purchase, we should recognise that this was never a housing policy. It was a mechanism for quickly kick-starting a dead economy. It was not an overall housing strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> A housing strategy would examine the distribution of housing and attendant human and community services. A housing strategy would examine the appropriate size and mix of private and public rental stock. And a housing strategy would examine the distribution and affordability of new private dwellings. This will be addressed by this Government by two quite separate initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is the national housing strategy, announced recently by the Federal Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). The national housing strategy will develop a comprehensive program of housing policy reform. It will address the needs of the Australian people and economy into the next century and provide a framework to ensure that housing for all Australians is appropriate and affordable. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, at our Party's national conference held last month-and I was a delegate at that conference-it was decided to conduct an inquiry into the national infrastructure. This will involve coordinating the provision of housing, transport, education, health and employment opportunities for all Australians into the twenty-first century. In short, the first home owners scheme, meritorious as it was when it was first introduced in its original form, had outlived its usefulness. We now need to move, as we are, onto a bigger agenda. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a poor performance! The excuses offered by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), for an overall cut in funding to housing shows the willingness of the Federal Government to skate out from under what is a difficult problem-not face it-and to have another committee conduct an inquiry. We have seen this technique adopted many times in the past, but it is no more painful, no more substantial and no more damaging to Australian families than it is in the area of housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The changes, according to the previous speaker, are supported because they offer administratively clean and decentralised assistance to housing. I pity the Premiers when they shortly come to Canberra. It will mean that the Commonwealth will devolve and cut its programs and then seek to control those programs by guidelines or legislation. It is a very poor approach and a poor start to what could be a major change to the administrative arrangements between governments. If this example is a blueprint for the changes of administration, the rationalisation of funding programs and the cleaning up of programs that appear to be duplicated between the Commonwealth, State and local governments, then I think the State Premiers will go away bitterly disappointed with the so-called categorical commitment by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that this is a genuine attempt to clean up the administration between governments Australia-wide. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the House and to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) that in his second reading speech he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The First Home Owners Scheme (FHOS) was introduced on 10 October 1983 to assist low to moderate income first home buyers into home ownership, to stimulate construction of new dwellings and to create new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>Evidently all of those goals have been met and that is the reason for scrapping the program. In a situation where the economy is driving home to moderate and low income earners the impossibility of achieving their own homes, where it is demonstrable that young couples are postponing home purchase for up to 10 years because they cannot move into that market, the Government moves away and drops this scheme. In his second reading speech the Minister said that the prospect of the first home owners scheme was to stimulate the construction of new dwellings. At a time when the graphs are screaming down to an all-time low for the level of dwelling commencements and the level of dwelling approvals, the Government decides to scrap this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Everything is being done at exactly the wrong time. The very reasons the Minister states in his speech for the Government adopting this program supposedly now exist and so it is going to drop the scheme. It seems incredible that right at this point his own definitions are the reasons for his walking away from his responsibilities. I cannot believe that the Minister would say these words. I do not know who wrote this speech for him, but it should be struck from the record. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason for the adoption of the first home owners scheme was to stimulate construction of new dwellings and to create new jobs. With unemployment rising and approval rates and dwelling construction falling, we again have the very situation in place that the Minister claimed in 1983 was a reason for the adoption of this scheme. He now says that there is no reason that the Commonwealth should be involved in this program. </PARA>
<PARA> On his own definitions there is every reason. There are three bases: the basis to assist low and moderate income earners; the basis to stimulate construction; and the basis to create new jobs. I thought that those would be objectives the Minister would endorse and would have been reasons to continue this scheme. I say that on the premise that the first home owners scheme, which we are tonight wiping out of the system, was of value. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said, in introducing this legislation:</PARA>
<PARA>When FHOS was announced, housing activity was at a 20-year low: only 105,000 dwellings were commenced in 1982-83; housing finance was in short supply and it was rationed. </PARA>
<PARA>If housing finance is not in short supply and being rationed in Australia today, I do not know what high interest rates are doing to the housing market and those seeking to build their own homes or to continue the payment of high mortgages, which are a definite policy of this Government. The Minister went on to say in his second reading speech that the shortage of funds:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . often resulted in `cocktail' arrangements whereby home buyers had to take out a second mortgage at a higher interest rate-thus driving up the overall cost of finance. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the exact description of what is happening today. It is an exact description of the crying need of young people to be able to move into their first or only home when they must take out so-called cocktail arrangements whereby they borrow partly from a finance company or building society and partly from a bank. These cocktail arrangements, of course, underpin the housing market in Australia today. It is the only way people can get into their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech the Minister also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . despite the development of innovative financial arrangements, insufficient savings capacity continues to be a major barrier to home ownership for some lower income people. Lack of savings capacity can in some cases preclude potential home buyers from accessing State HPA. </PARA>
<PARA>I guess that that is a very euphemistic description of the situation that thousands upon thousands of Australians find themselves in today. So the legislation and the speech of the Minister are a poor reason for the changes that the Government is making. There are good reasons why the States should be more closely involved in the housing scene. But to try to present this legislation tonight-the scrapping of the first home owners scheme by the Commonwealth Government-as an administrative and skilled feat that is going to assist home buyers is nothing but dishonest. That is not true. The Government is devolving-I agree with that-but it is cutting at the same time. The Government is cutting the absolute funds and seeking control by guidelines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one moves into the area of cutting, and it appears to me that that what this exercise is all about-saving money-let us have a look at the Government's Budget in the housing area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first point in the Budget Paper in the housing area is a major review costing $1m over a three-year period. That is real dynamic decision taking: conduct a review that will cost $1m. If one has a look at the total Budget allocation for housing, one sees that it has dropped from $1,050m down to $1,028m. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous speaker tried to present this process as support for housing and support for welfare. He cannot have it both ways. He cannot claim on the one hand that he is supporting and at the same time that he is cutting. The total funding to housing has really changed dramatically. Youth housing and mortgage and rent relief-the very areas I thought the Government would have been interested in-are substantially down. In fact, there is a reduction of $22.8m for housing support in the Budget. The Government should not try to present it as something innovative and useful, something supportive of young families in Australia. That is my complaint. I do not complain that the Government has made cuts, but that it is trying to present tonight a sham of what the housing situation is and what it is doing for first home buyers in Australia. It claims that it is going to better target these people through the Commonwealth-State housing assistance scheme funds. I believe that that may well be the case. The major savings initiatives are the termination of the first home owners scheme and limiting the subsidy paid to States for private rental housing in New South Wales and South Australia, saving $7.4m. I know that the housing industry in South Australia is not going so well, but if there is a crying need for support in any State, it is in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major saving initiative in the Budget is to limit the payments under the country water supply improvement scheme. That is not part of the housing program but it is part of the infrastructure costs program. The Minister seeks to present this as an innovation, as support for the housing industry, when actually in the very sensitive areas of mortgage and rental relief it provides nothing but pain for people. The second reading speech says nothing. It contains no initiatives or statements which can be taken up, except that relating to an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has no ideas; it is completely captive to the philosophies and attitudes of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). He is holding the Government captive. It cannot break out of that to offer initiatives. The Minister with responsibility for housing, who is at the table, the Minister for Community Services and Health, endeavoured to break out of that process by making the statement that additional taxation collections should well be returned to the Australian people by infrastructure funding for roads, drainage, sewerage and things like that. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the response of the Minister but there was no response regarding the basic housing needs of so many Australian families. There is no input from the Minister; he is non-committal and inactive in the housing area. The best he can offer is an inquiry and to devolve the stuff to the States. He has skated out from under and cut the budget. If he is going to do that he should not present it as a major feat, a major achievement, for the Commonwealth Government. It is not; it is a walking away from his responsibilities to the Australian people and the Australian home buyer. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the Government's response to a group of desperate people. The `for sale' signs are going up in every suburb in every capital city because people cannot afford to continue to pay for their houses. They cannot afford the mortgages. That is a definite policy that the Government has adopted-a definite policy from the Australian Labor Party. High interest rates will force people out of houses and will force a reduction in building industry activity. If enough people have gone broke and enough are out of jobs, the policy has worked. It is a completely inappropriate policy. To have the front to present it as innovative and helpful is the thing that rankles with the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the money in the system over the last few years one finds that in 1982-83 the finance available to housing was about $7.2 billion from all sources-an average amount of $68,000 per dwelling. In 1989-90, the year that we have just finished, $18.8 billion was available for housing finance, an average of $134,000 per dwelling. That increase in money did not meet the increase in the average cost of a dwelling place in Australia. Despite the increase in finance, which in some government circles is presented as an advantage and as good management, in fact it falls far short of what is an appropriate increase compared with the cost of housing Australia-wide. </PARA>
<PARA> One has only to look at the approval rates for housing in Australia to notice that we are now back to the figure for 1986-87. From the way in which the approvals are dropping it appears that the outturn for the year that we are entering into in comparative terms will be similar to that of 1982-83. The Government is heading towards a situation which is equivalent to a low spot in Australian housing, 1982-83, and is claiming that as some sort of victory, claiming some sort of credit for that approach. </PARA>
<PARA> One has only to refer to the recent publication of the ANZ Banking Group Ltd which, by the way, is not a bank heavily into housing finance but is a bank which does present useful statistics. The bank's housing market surveys indicate that housing finance over the last couple of years has dropped from very high levels to extremely low levels and is continuing to fall. The number of private house starts has dropped dramatically from the figure of two years ago. It has reached the level of 1986-87 and looks as if it will head down in a comparative sense towards the level of 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report published for October the ANZ Bank said that we have an ambiguously weak economy; that the demand for funds is sluggish as business and consumer spending remain low; and there are weak asset prices and high debt levels, which keep borrowers cautious. These are good descriptions: the seasonal upswing in the job market has failed to materialise; there has been a continued weakness in retailing and manufacturing; labour force growth outpaces the economy's ability to create jobs; there is rising unemployment and low consumer confidence; there is a faint glimmer of recovery in housing demand which will not be sustained; there is a stagnant wool market, generally good mineral export but a lower underlying import; a slight pick-up after a large August fall but a downward trend persists in motor vehicle registrations; and governments at all levels recognise the urgent need for micro-economic reform. Nothing happens. This is a bad report. There are bad prospects but nothing happens about it. So much for the ANZ Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The report produced by MGICA Ltd, one of the mortgage insurance organisations in the Real Estate Institute of Australia, shows for the first time to my knowledge that families are spending almost half of their total income each week to sustain their homes. In New South Wales, for instance, the average weekly income for families is about $661. Forty-four per cent of that family income is being spent on mortgage payments. One family income per week out of a total monthly flow of figures used to be dedicated to housing; that is, about 25 per cent of monthly income for a family was used to pay off their mortgage. It has now doubled. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the achievement of this Government. It has now created the situation where, instead of a quarter of family income being allocated to housing repayments, nearly half is. This relates to total family income now; it is not just the single wage earner, the breadwinner of the family, it is total family income-mum, the kids and dad as well. All of their funds have to be taken into account and half of the total income in New South Wales must be dedicated to mortgage payments. In Victoria one-third of total family income is dedicated to mortgage payments. </PARA>

It is not `win win' for them in buying a house; it is `lose lose'. In Queensland 32 per cent of family income goes towards mortgage payments. In some of the States where there is a very sluggish economy a smaller amount of family income is being paid out each month to cover mortgage requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for total dwelling units approved for May and June this year show a very rapid downturn in the figure for private houses and also dwellings. Whether they be home units or houses, the drop-off in approvals is significant. If one compares the figures for May and June in this current year, one sees that there has been something like a 23 per cent drop in number and in finance allocated to housing. That situation looks as though it will continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like many other members of this House I have had occasion to be grateful on behalf of my constituents for the assistance provided to first home buyers by the first home owners scheme. It is with some sadness that I see it go. When our Government first introduced the scheme, seven years ago yesterday if my calculations are right, it was as a means of assisting low and moderate income first home buyers into home ownership. It was also an effective means of boosting construction of new dwellings and creating new jobs, at a time when the economy was greatly in need of stimulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that time the Labor Government had just come to office at the Federal level and the economy was still reeling from the body blows delivered to it by the Liberal-National Party coalition while it was in government. Housing activity was at its lowest ebb for 20 years, with only 105,000 houses being commenced in the immediately preceding financial year. Even though people had the mirage of savings bank home loans at 13.5 per cent interest, those loans were actually inaccessible as housing finance was in short supply. It was not uncommon for people to take out personal loans at a much higher interest rate to piggyback onto their home loans and make them worth having. Whatever the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) might like to say, nowhere near the same number of people are now taking out cocktailing and that type of loan as were doing so at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The first home owners scheme was undoubtedly an important factor in the recovery of the housing industry at that time; with 137,000 commencements in 1983-84 it could hardly have been otherwise. This meant work for up to 40,000 people who may previously have been unemployed. In the seven years since, the first home owners scheme has assisted more than 360,000 families into home purchase. In dollar terms, this equates to $1.53 billion. As I indicated before, quite a few of the people who have been helped now live in my electorate of Cowan and some possibly live in the electorate of Moore. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-89, at the height of economic activity, 175,000 dwellings were commenced. Obviously that level of construction could not be sustained, and the Government made the decisions necessary to slow down activity across the economy, including in the housing sector. The decision to restructure home ownership assistance arrangements and cease the first home owners scheme came about in the context of the need to tighten economic policy, and at a time when duplication of services by Commonwealth, State and local government was under active consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction by State governments of home purchase and/or mortgage assistance schemes of their own further contributed to the perception that the first home owners scheme was no longer required and that it would be preferable to provide funds directly to the States for the expansion of their schemes, as well as via the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. I note that the Western Australian State Government has an excellent mortgage assistance scheme which assists a great many people, some of whom were obviously in difficulties when interest rates were at a higher level than they are now. The key-start loan in Western Australia is also especially relevant for low income families, and it received a funding boost in the recently announced State Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> As outlined in the second reading speech of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), the Federal Government has undertaken to develop guidelines to assist the States to develop more flexible deposit assistance tailored to family needs and local housing market conditions. That point was acknowledged by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) in his speech as a necessary step, given the disparities between the States in terms of housing prices and availability. In other words, the first home owners scheme was more available to people in some States than in others because of the level of cost associated with the purchase of a home in, say, Western Australia compared with New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The new deposit assistance arrangements are expected to come into effect from 1 January 1991, if agreements can be reached with the State and Territory governments in the near future. I have no way of knowing whether those agreements are close to being reached, and I am sure the honourable member for Mitchell does not either. </PARA>
<PARA> As expected, the Opposition is moaning and gnashing its collective teeth about the departure of the first home owners scheme. The truth is that our Government has always paid greater attention to home ownership assistance and public housing than the Opposition parties ever did. Furthermore, the building industry knows that our economic policies are more likely to see construction recommenced in the next few months, whereas the adhockery associated with the Opposition's policies would see it once again nose-diving through the floorboards. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, our Government takes the provision of housing for the Australian people extremely seriously. We have consistently adopted a pro-active approach to this area of policy development and implementation, as we have to every other area of social and economic activity. In that context, it is especially pleasing to note that the Minister for Community Services and Health has appointed Dr Meredith Edwards to head a national housing strategy review. It is expected that Dr Edwards will undertake substantive consultations over the next few years and submit periodic reports on specific aspects of the strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriate and affordable housing is an important element of social justice, a policy that our Government has supported since its election. In fact, it is a policy which has been totally supported by the Minister. Australian families can be sure that the Government will not neglect their needs in this area in the future, as we have not neglected them in the past. On the contrary, the national housing strategy will examine methods of providing secure, affordable and appropriate housing within a broad economic, social and demographic framework. Its progressive conclusions and recommendations no doubt will increase the knowledge base of the Government on the various accommodation needs of Australians throughout the course of their lives and lead to substantive policy initiatives which are soundly based. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the honourable member for Forrest was unnecessarily cynical in his criticisms of this strategy. He has fallen for the Opposition trap of knocking the Government even when what it is proposing is sensible and essential. Members on this side of the House will recall the derision with which the social security review was greeted when it was first announced by the then Minister for Social Security, the present Minister for Community Services and Health. It was subsequently proven to be an essential plank in the Government's reform of income security for the aged as well as the disabled, and for disadvantaged groups such as sole supporting parents whose needs had previously been ignored because they were too hard to fathom. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall all reap the benefits of the national housing strategy if its findings are able to be translated into meaningful and relevant Government policies, as were those of the social security review. The Minister's integrity and goodwill are accepted by the community, and they look forward to the outcome of this latest review, as I do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my maiden speech some honourable members may recall that I eulogised at some length about suburban living and the Australian dream of owning one's own home implied in that lifestyle. In that speech I quoted Sir Walter Murdoch's definitive analysis of the Australian suburban idiom. I take the opportunity afforded by this debate to quote him once again:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Your suburban villa, and even your Shakespeare Society, are just as much parts of the real Australia as Chamber's Pillar; more's the pity, perhaps, but the fact is so. The cities we have built may be mere plagiarisms, but they are as real as the vast sunburnt land on whose outer edge we have chosen to build them. </PARA>
<PARA>I chose the term `eulogise' carefully. One eulogises at a funeral. And I believe that is precisely what we are presiding over here tonight: the death of the Australian dream as it was embodied in the `suburban villa'. This is not to suggest that I have come here to speak in defence of the first home owners scheme; rather, I have come here to bury it. It is now, like the dream it sought to assist low income earners to attain, sadly redundant. </PARA>
<PARA> As stated in the Budget Papers, there was a marked decline in housing outlays between 1986-87 and 1988-89. This was, according to the Budget Papers, resultant from the revision of income limits and the reduction of the maximum benefit from $7,000 to $6,000 in 1984-85. In May 1988 there was a further tightening of eligibility and a reduction of payments. By 1988-89, housing outlays had dropped by 42 per cent from the post-recession peak. One must question, however, the extent to which these limitations affected the numbers seeking assistance from the Government in servicing their loans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget Papers concede that the first home owners scheme was largely demand driven, so one is left wondering how effective the scheme was in assisting low income earners in the first place. Indeed, one must question how realistic it is for a young couple of low to medium income earning capacity in the Australia of the 1990s to expect to be able one day to own a home of their own. Certainly back in December 1983, not long after the first home owners scheme was first introduced, Judith Yates, a senior lecturer in economics at Sydney University, cast her doubts on the continuing effectiveness of the scheme in a paper entitled `Home Purchase Assistance for Low Income Earners'. I would like to take this opportunity to read an extract from that paper as I believe it showed how financially unviable it was then for governments to continue to sponsor first home owners. Judith Yates states:</PARA>
<PARA>An alternative way of looking at whether the scheme which has been introduced is the most equitable way of helping low income earners is to consider the subsidy needed by a household on an income of less than AWE if it is to purchase a typical home in Sydney's outer west region. Calculations performed by Landcom in June 1983 indicate that for a single income household on $289 p.w., (approximately 80% of AWE in NSW), with income growing at 10% per annum to be able to buy a $55,000 home on 10% deposit, a subsidy of $15,000 is needed over a period of seven years. If a lower rate of growth of income is assumed for the first three years (as in projection A presented at the National Economic Summit) instead of the `optimistic scenario' of a 10% annual increase in income then the subsidy required increases from $15,000 over seven years to $18,000 over nine years. These estimates are based on the assumption that the then current building society interest rate of 14.5% is charged, that an interest subsidy of 1% in the first and 0.5% in the second year applies, that the repayment to income ratio is 25% and that a 25 year loan of $49,500 is available. On an income equal to AWE the subsidy required in the first case would be $7,500 over five years and in the second nearly $10,000 over six years. </PARA>
<PARA>After those comments, it can be seen how naive we were back in 1983. Ms Yates assumed in her calculations to ascertain how high the subsidy ought to be if it were to have any viable impact in assisting those who sought to purchase their first homes that building society interest rates would remain static at 14.5 per cent. Even if they had remained at what seems today to be a ridiculously low rate, the cost in outlays implied by her calculations seems to be too high to be feasible. The ideal as it was outlined in 1983 contrasts starkly with the reality as it exists in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Ms Yates quotes a requisite subsidy of $7,500 to $10,000 for those receiving an average weekly wage, which in 1983 was $347.30 or $18,200 per annum. Today those receiving the average weekly wage earn $542 a week or approximately $28,000 per annum. Under the most recent manifestation of the scheme, those with combined incomes of $26,000 to $34,000 and with two children are entitled to only a $5,000 subsidy. For those with a combined wage of $23,000 to $31,000 and no children, a subsidy of $3,000 is granted. This, as honourable members may see, falls well short of Ms Yates estimated requisite subsidy for 1983 of $7,500. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier, she arrived at this figure by adopting an optimistic case scenario which saw rises in the award rate of 10 per cent per annum. The reality, however, has seen increases in award rates of pay of approximately 5 per cent per annum since 1985-86. The Australian Council of Housing Societies has estimated that the after tax earnings of the average Australian family has fallen by more than 10 per cent in the last four years. We must therefore turn to Ms Yates worst case scenario which saw minimal rises in the award rates of pay and from which she proposed a $10,000 subsidy for those on average weekly earnings. These calculations also fail to take into consideration the extraordinary leaps in housing prices experienced nationally as a result of the property boom. In the six capital cities the average price of houses has increased from $75,500 in November 1984 to $112,400 in April 1989. In Sydney the increase in prices is even more striking with the average cost of a house rising from $88,800 in November 1984 to $162,100 in April 1989. That is a rise of almost 100 per cent within the space of four and a half years. </PARA>
<PARA> The discrepancies in property prices between the capital cities has meant that whilst the first home owners scheme may have been in some part effective in assisting low income families in, say, Perth or Adelaide to purchase a home, in Sydney it would have been absolutely untenable. Furthermore Ms Yates made her calculations upon the assumption that building society interest rates would remain static at the 1983 rate of 14 per cent. How positively romantic that figure seems today. Subsequent bitter experience under the current Labor Government has seen these rates climb to as high as 17 or 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the Australian Council of Housing Societies states the case more succinctly in its submission to the Federal Government on the need for a housing strategy. According to the Council's submission, families saving 10 per cent of their income now take 15 years to save the required deposit for an average home. In 1980, the percentage of median family income required to afford the average housing loan was 17.9 per cent. In 1989, this had risen to 35.9 per cent. If anything, these figures demonstrate how sadly untenable the first home owners scheme has been since its very inception. Between then and 30 June 1989 a total of $1.27 billion had been paid out in assistance. If Ms Yates's calculations were correct, then for the scheme to have had any effective impact in assisting low to middle income families that figure would have had to have been doubled. Unfortunately, such levels of expenditure are unacceptable in these days in which governmental restraint is not so much a responsibility as a necessity. But perhaps these examples reveal a broader and more tragic truth, namely, that it has become financially unviable for a large section of our society even to contemplate owning a home of their own today. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it was Russell Braddon who coined the expression, `the two-thirds society', when describing Australia circa 1988. That expression implied that whilst a third of Australians lived an affluent lifestyle the other two-thirds could but live day to day, scraping together the means to achieve an unattainable lifestyle. At the time this struck me as being unrealistic and a distorted betrayal of Australian society. Now, however, I am not so sure. We seem to have reached a stage in our history in which home ownership is no longer a goal many of us can ever hope to achieve. Something that we once took for granted is rapidly becoming the exclusive domain of the few. </PARA>
<PARA> This fact is starkly illustrated by figures quoted in the August 1990 housing report published jointly by the Commonwealth Bank and the Housing Industry Association. According to the report, from the early 1960s the home ownership rate of households headed by someone aged 25 to 34 has dropped from around 63 per cent to 52.4 per cent in 1988. Furthermore, the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1988 housing survey revealed that more than 365,000, or 30 per cent, of private renters considered home ownership currently beyond their reach. Of that group, more than half were aged 25 to 34. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even though high housing costs and mortgage interest rates pose major barriers to entry into home purchase for young renter households, most cling desperately to the dream of owning their own home. Nearly 100,000 such renters received an income of more than $20,000 a year, suggesting that there are some who are prepared to wait until they can afford a house they really want. Nearly 330,000 private renters were saving towards a home, most of whom were aged below 35, indicating a substantial latent demand for first home ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Until recently, the drop in levels of home ownership for the first home buyer was offset by an increasing incidence of ownership among 35 to 44-year-olds. There is now evidence to suggest that home ownership might even be slipping among the population in their 30s and 40s. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the increasing inaccessibility of housing to young couples in a lower income bracket in emotional terms is incalculable. Certainly the social impact has been considerable. To enhance home ownership prospects, couples have boosted family incomes through increased participation by women in the work force and delayed child bearing. In the past 20 years, the labour force participation rate of married women in the primary child-bearing age group of 25 to 34 has nearly doubled from just below 33 per cent to more than 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> As more women have entered the work force, the number of married couples with three or more children has fallen substantially. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 1986 more than 1.8 million married couples did not have dependent children, while 1.9 million had children. Not only are women having fewer children, but the interval between confinements has declined, enabling earlier re-entry to employment. Without the costs of rearing children, childless couples are now able to devote even more income to their housing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only through the participation of both husband and wife in the work force that today young couples can even hope to own a home of their own. The importance of two incomes to home purchase can be seen in the income levels of married couples relative to other income units. In the general population, about six in 10 households have annual incomes below $25,000 a year. By contrast, less than a half of married couples have incomes of less than $25,000 a year. For most married couples, it is the spouse income which pushes the family into the middle and upper income levels. To join the high income groups marriage or, more precisely, dual incomes are virtually a necessity. More than 95 per cent of households earning in excess of $50,000 a year are married couples. This can only place unbearable pressures on the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) will know, the director of the Marriage Guidance Council of WA Inc. in the area of our two electorates, commented recently that the pressures of maintaining mortgage repayments for young families was causing unbearable strains on marriage relationships and, in fact, had swamped the Marriage Guidance Council with an ever increasing amount of work and further demands on their limited facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the notion of the home, set neatly in the idiomatic framework of the suburb, was as synonymous with the Australian ethos as the bushman. Like the pioneers of old, modern Australians have sought to carve out their own selection on tracts of land that have been opened up for development, seeking to build the home that had hitherto existed only in their hopes and dreams. </PARA>
<PARA> The age of the pioneer, of course, passed long ago, and the legends it spawned have sadly become redundant. However, it would seem, like the pioneers of old, that the age of the Aussie home owner is also rapidly passing into history. Tragically, as a result, the hopes and dreams of many ordinary Australians can only ever remain as hopes and dreams. </PARA>
<PARA> As a footnote, and bearing in mind the comments made by the honourable member for Cowan in relation to the first home owners scheme, I comment on an article which appeared in the West Australian in July which reflected some comments made by the Secretary of the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council's Emergency Welfare Foundation, Mr Tony Cooke, who said that charity organisations were being forced to cater for a band of income earners who in 1983 were capable of supporting themselves. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a great discernible increase in the number of clients requiring our services who previously would have been able to manage from their own resources.</PARA>
<PARA>As the West Australian commented:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . inflation has outstripped growth of the median wage by about 9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>The electorate of Moore returned me as its member predominantly because it was hurting from the high interest rates policy of the current Federal Labor Government. I am sure that the honourable member for Cowan, when she was door-knocking in her own electorate during the recent Federal election campaign, would have detected numerous ordinary, average families who were hurting considerably from the high interest rates regime. As one door-knocks in the newer areas of the northern suburbs of the Perth metropolitan area, it is interesting to see the increasing number of houses that do not have carpets, lawns or the basic necessities to run a decent home, the occupiers of which will probably be waiting some time into the future to be able to provide those basic necessities. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, I certainly did not come here to praise the first home owners scheme. As I pointed out, it has been largely deficient in helping those whom it was allegedly designed to help. I came here to bury it this evening and, as I mentioned, it is like the dream it sought to assist low income earners to attain-sadly redundant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first home owners scheme-or FHOS as I understand it has been known-was introduced on 1 October 1983. It has been subject to numerous changes. The income limits have been increased and split for single income earners; the benefit rates have been changed both up and down; and conditions of eligibility have been altered at various times during the life of the scheme. But the fact is that the scheme did not work well from the outset.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On day one, 1 October 1983, the Department of Housing and Construction found itself ill-prepared for the number of people who lined up to obtain their $5,000 grant free of attached strings. The first home owners scheme provided assistance to eligible people who contracted to buy their first home, or who participated as owner-builders starting to build their first home and meeting the required income limits. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-89, FHOS continued to assist low to moderate income people purchasing their first homes. The scheme has been in operation since 1 October 1983 and during that time has provided assistance of up to $7,000 until 16 April 1985 and up to $6,000 until 26 May 1988 when the grant was reduced to a maximum availability level of $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major tests of eligibility was income, generally defined as taxable income earned in the financial year immediately preceding home acquisition. Income limits for the 1988-89 financial year were $23,000 for the maximum benefit, reducing to nil at $31,000 for joint applicants, and similar limits of $11,000 to $15,000 for single applicants without dependants. Applicants with dependent children qualified for an increased benefit. For two or more children, the income limit for maximum benefit was $26,000, reducing to nil for income of $34,000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA> Three options were available to beneficiaries of the scheme. The first was that all payments could be taken in the form of a subsidy over a five-year period; the other two options consisted of varying lump sum payments plus reducing subsidy. Applicants were approved for assistance on the basis that they continued to own and occupy the dwelling over the five-year subsidy period. After May 1988 those applicants without dependent children were restricted to a monthly subsidy over five years. Some 41,058 applications were received and 36,235 were approved in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> Three Ministers, Hurford, West and Staples, have presided over the scheme. There were unquestionably some problems, as I understand it, during that time. One of them was that in some cases previous home owners were able to apply for and receive what was supposed to be a first home ownership scheme assistance arrangement. Another problem was that previous recipients of the home savings grant or the home deposit assistance scheme were also able to apply for and in some cases receive FHOS assistance. In some instances investors set up their sons and daughters, some of whom were unemployed and on welfare, with funds to buy investment properties subsidised by the FHOS grants. Welfare recipients were induced to apply for home loans financed to 95 per cent of the value of a property and subsequently found in some cases that they needed to vacate the property after receiving FHOS because it became too expensive a program for them to maintain. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members may recall that a previous member for Moreton, Mr Donald Cameron, referred to this in 1985 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The newspaper headlines which we read now indicate that some of these poor people who were enticed by the Government's scheme are now losing their homes because factors which are crumbling down upon their heads are preventing them from continuing their repayments. They are simply walking away from the dream that was put there by the Government's scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say to the Minister at the time:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I hope that his Department is monitoring the situation very carefully because it may well be that he will have to re-examine the extent of fatalities along the way . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It could be argued that FHOS became a means of buying votes. It gave money to many first home purchasers who were probably about to purchase a home anyway and would probably have purchased a home without the scheme. It appears to have been ill-conceived. It was certainly popular at various times because most schemes which pump money out in such a way that people cannot resist picking it up invariably win a certain amount of publicity out in the field. From time to time solicitors, real estate agents and banking institutions were very keen to act on the information or knowledge that FHOS administrators were under pressure to move money. Hence loose or lax procedures enabled a significant amount of money to be paid to people who may have had somewhat dubious entitlements to that money. </PARA>
<PARA> I struck one of these cases in my own electorate recently. Just to outline the details of that for the information of honourable members, one of my constituents applied in 1987 for a FHOS grant. He stated on his application that he was the owner of a property and had lived in a house on that property for five years. That reply was made in response to a specific question on the application form. The answer, if checked, should have precluded any payments being made to that constituent. In fact the applicant received his money. Two years later he received a letter from the Department demanding a return of money paid to him. The letter stated that the money was paid due to departmental error. It seems quite apparent that the application form was not checked. One rather distraught constituent, to say the least, found that he had to scrabble around and find some money. Plainly for him, in view of declining rural circumstances, that money was not at all easy to find. That begs the question as to how many more people have been placed in that difficult position. </PARA>
<PARA> The management of FHOS has been the subject of much criticism over the years. The Housing Industry Association (HIA) and the Real Estate Institute of Australia have both been critical of the operation of the scheme. Their criticism centres on the fact that only one assessment of income was made during the period the benefit was being paid over five years. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the scheme has not been working successfully for quite some time. Constant alteration to the scheme has caused threshold eligibility levels to be unrealistic and consequently expenditure has dropped markedly. Additionally, housing price variations between States and within States have made grants given under the scheme inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA> However, one of the major reasons for the failure of the scheme in recent years has been the escalation in interest rates. Young first home buyers or low income earners cannot afford the mortgage repayments; hence there has been a decline in housing starts and a slowdown in real estate sales that we have heard quite a bit about from various speakers tonight. It will come as no surprise that the HIA report indicated that people are despondent and fearful about the outlook of the economy and that the market is extremely soft and fragile, with buyers very tentative, lacking confidence and deferring decisions. The HIA also claims that the real estate industry entered a recession about six months ago. It claims in addition to that that people are despondent and that fear of unemployment is becoming a major factor in their home-buying decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members read the second reading speech of the then Minister for Housing and Construction, Mr Hurford, in 1983 they will be made aware of the fact that he identified the Government's objectives in the area of housing as being `to provide more effective assistance to low income families seeking to buy a first home and to ensure an adequate supply of housing finance at affordable interest rates'. I emphasise `to ensure an adequate supply of housing finance at affordable interest rates'. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that there is no way it can be said that an adequate supply of finance at affordable interest rates is a situation that currently prevails in Australia. The bottom line is that no home owners scheme could ever hope to offset the cost of borrowing for housing in the current economic environment in this country. Home affordability in this country is running currently at all time lows. The ratio of average loan repayments to median family income nationally has been running at around 35 per cent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are there any advances on seven years? In the first place the Government set up FHOS with the laudable objective of helping the battler. Home ownership has always been a great Australian dream and we have always been lucky enough in the past to have been able to provide it to a very high percentage, in global terms, of Australians. But what has happened? The economy has been so badly mauled that the very people who were supposed to be most helped by this scheme are now the least able to afford homes. The Aussie battler has no more hope of buying a home with those opposite at the helm than he has of flying to the moon. The average new home loan in Sydney now is running at $91,700. Even in Western Australia, where I am told a few Labor people had a little bit of trouble at the last election, the average new home loan is $62,514.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The interest chargeable at current rates-even if they have come off the boil a little bit in response to this drastic downturn in the economy that we are currently seeing-puts those sorts of loans out of the question for more and more Australians. For others, who have somehow got themselves into a home over the last couple of years and then found interest rates spiralling ever upwards as their real take-home pay declines, the picture tells a story of economic misery exacerbated for many by the fear or, worse, the reality of job losses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tell a story-it is more than a story. It is a question of the very ability to survive out there at the moment for a lot of Australian farm families. The high interest rates that we have `enjoyed'-if that is the word-in recent years have surely been the product of a poor record in this country on productivity improvement, low levels of domestic savings, rapidly escalating international debt and a deteriorating trade balance. The failure to address these fundamentals in any meaningful or, dare I suggest, any successful way has impacted massively on living standards in general and housing affordability in particular. In the face of the very real need to tell the Australian people the truth about our weakening performance and the need to address that problem, it seems that all we have had is a common resort to insistence that everything is on track and that the turnaround is just around the next corner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, what we should have seen is an honest explanation of the current situation-and the situation as it has been now for several years-to the Australian people and the presentation of some realistic solutions which are going to involve some hard options. But all we hear is rhetoric about the need to be-what is it?-a clever country, to be smarter in the workplace and that sort of thing. There has been little reference to one of the things that I would have thought would have been extremely fundamental, that is, a bit more hard work from some Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) often speaks in this place and outside of the need for Australia to address the twin problems of low productivity and low savings levels. The first need, if we are to boost productivity, is to free up our labour markets. We must give our people the freedom to produce and earn more, away from the drab hand of our centralised wage fixing system. Only when employers and employees in an environment of personal freedom can strike their own workplace relevant agreements, when they can clearly both benefit from doing so, will we start to find the sort of productivity improvements that this country is going to need. Of course, the obvious example that everybody is flying around with at the moment is Power Brewing Co. Ltd in Queensland. There, under a voluntary work agreement, productivity was boosted enormously and the company's marketplace share grew hugely, as did its productivity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I really think that the honourable member should return to the Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to the point that workers found themselves enjoying an extra $7,000 or $8,000 income per year, and I would suggest that everyone benefited and that those people found that home affordability became something that was much more realistic for them. However, those options have now been closed off since the Goss Government disapproves of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would suggest that this, coupled with increased savings levels in this country, would revitalise our moribund economy and that, under those sorts of policy changing, home affordability would be something that might become the product, if you like, of a structural improvement that would see less need for the sort of baling wire approach to keeping the whole building intact. In short, I am suggesting that, laudable as it always is to try and help Australians into homes, we need to start with the foundations rather than sticky tape the walls together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank those honourable members who have contributed to the debate. I will respond to some of the issues that have been raised and some of the contributions which have been made in the course of debate. I say in response to the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), who made the principal contribution on behalf of the Opposition, that the fact is that the Government not only developed guidelines but announced those guidelines and made them available on the night of the Budget. I table a letter that I sent to housing Ministers on Budget night including draft guidelines for State approval. On the assertion that there was no formula for distributing funds, in fact, the essence of the formula was announced on Budget night, which was that funds would be distributed on a per capita basis. The letter that I have tabled includes an indication of the distribution State by State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Forrest indicated fairly clearly that the Opposition supported the thrust of what the Government is about in the sense that he referred to the second reading speech and, in fact, endorsed the essential thrust that, in current circumstances where the problem is not supply of funds, there are problems in terms of affordability and there are problems in terms of the situation that exists in various States. Rather than duplicate schemes at Commonwealth and State level, the fact that States have increasingly taken advantage of the availability of funds and developed home purchase schemes would suggest that it is sensible for the Commonwealth to remove itself, at least for the moment, from the field and allow the States to devise various schemes, which they have done quite successfully, which are much more sensitive to the fact that a number of honourable members referred to-that there are quite different circumstances in the different States and it is possible for the States to devise schemes that address the different housing markets in the various States around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Forrest and other speakers in this debate referred to the current downturn in terms of housing starts, but of course they ought to be reminded of the fact that the current levels are nowhere near what they were in 1982-83 when, under the Fraser Government, the number of starts reached the level of 105,000-an extraordinary level of activity. Clearly, that situation is not close to the situation at the moment where we have certainly dropped back from something like 175,000 starts last year-a record and unsustainable level-to levels a little over 130,000. The availability of housing finance, it ought to be stressed, has grown massively under deregulated housing policies that we have adopted through the 1980s. So the value of housing loans approved has grown substantially from $11,533m in 1985-86 to $22,126m in 1988-89 and an estimated $18,690m in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> The order of money that has been available for housing loans bears very little relationship to the situation that existed prior to deregulation and policies that have certainly led to a great improvement in terms of supply. I want to refer briefly to the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and his contribution. I assure him that I, too, read and appreciate the work that Judith Yates carries out in this area of home ownership and housing assistance. Judith Yates, as part of the national housing strategy, will again make a significant contribution. I say to the honourable member for Moore that his predecessor had an extremely important and worthwhile record in this House on issues of housing, and showed a concern, I think, for the suburban dream certainly equivalent to, if not greater than, the concern of the current member for Moore. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the business of government is not to deal with dreams and legends or to dwell on myths and tell stories, as we heard from the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), but to develop concrete and specific policies. Clearly, the job of the Government is to address the issues that have been raised tonight by honourable members, such as questions of affordability and the supply of appropriate housing. That is the challenge of the national housing strategy that will be led by Dr Meredith Edwards and her team. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is one thing to describe demographic change and to refer to different patterns in terms of the life cycle and formation, matters that were referred to by the honourable member for Moore. It is another thing to find and develop housing policies that can deal effectively with the situation that he described when referring to Judith Yates. I believe that the Government has a number of strengths upon which it can build. </PARA>
<PARA> The public housing policies that have been developed in this country, particularly over the past several years, are certainly highly targeted and they deal with the circumstances of people who are in the greatest need, from any viewpoint. Under the latest guidelines, I think they provide a very good basis in terms of the States. We have moved to a stronger element of per capita funding. We have been much clearer in describing those groups to whom the highest priority should be given, and I think we have achieved a consensus with the States on where that compassion ought to be directed in relation to public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of youth homelessness has been addressed by the Government, not once but on several occasions, by way of major packages. Like other complex housing issues, it is not one to be solved easily and is not one to be solved simply by the supply of money. I believe that the Government has shown leadership in the area of homelessness and has provided a framework, through the supported accommodation program and other youth programs, whereby the States can work effectively with the Commonwealth and, particularly, work closely with the non-government sector to achieve a better result. Of course, questions such as youth homelessness are not easily resolved and, indeed, even when progress is being made it is not always obvious how much there is and how effective that progress has been. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to assure the House that we value the contribution that all honourable members have made to the debate tonight. We recognise that, in terms of the shift of policy that has occurred in moving home ownership to State responsibility-at least in terms of the home purchase schemes that are currently available-we are not by that action alone building a comprehensive housing policy. People make a great play of movements in the level of home ownership, but the fact of the matter is that we have roughly the same level of home ownership as we have had in Australia over the last 25 or 30 years. There is an extraordinary stability about home ownership levels in Australia. I suppose that currently about 70 per cent of Australians are either owning or purchasing their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> However, simply advocating home ownership in a general sense is not enough. There is a need to address the variety of circumstances that people face in Australia, and we need to be much more careful, I think, in terms of analysing the longer term trends and seeking to address those trends with substantial and sustainable policies. Those policies will flow out of the national housing review. It is not, as some honourable members have suggested, an attempt to defer the issue. We will seek to address the various issues that are outlined in the terms of reference of the national housing strategy over the next several years and, as I suggested earlier, I think there are some strong bases on which we can build. Clearly, there are some matters of considerable concern that need to be addressed strongly, and I am confident that we can achieve the changes and reforms that are needed flowing from the national housing strategy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 3 March 1989 the Ombudsman, Professor Pearce, reported to me under section 16 of the Ombudsman Act 1976 that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy had failed to take adequate and appropriate action in response to his investigation of a complaint by Mr G. J. Kennedy.</PARA>
<PARA> I wrote to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Finance on 17 May 1989 asking them to reconsider Mr Kennedy's case, and since that time we have exchanged further correspondence on the case.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government takes very seriously the Ombudsman's reports on investigations he has conducted, and in my view it is only in exceptional circumstances that recommendations by the Ombudsman should not be followed. However, after careful examination of Mr Kennedy's claim, both Mr Kerin and the former Minister for Finance came to the conclusion that the circumstances of Mr Kennedy's case do not justify an act of grace payment. I have written to the Ombudsman advising him of the conclusions reached by Mr Kerin and Senator Walsh and that I have accepted their conclusions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr Kerin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. All shorn wool being offered for first-hand sale is subject to the wool tax which is imposed by the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1-5) 1964. The tax is collected by brokers, dealers, exporters and/or processors and remitted to the Australian Taxation Office no later than the 21st day in the month after the month in which the wool was sold. The Taxation Office forwards the wool tax monies to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy (DPIE), which apportions the monies to market support, promotion and R&amp; according to the various percentages determined each year by Wool Council. DPIE then forwards the monies to the Australian Wool Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> The details and rules under which the Reserve Price Scheme operates are set out in the Wool Marketing Act 1987 sections 66 to 73.</PARA>
<PARA> The rules covering the operating of, and revolvement from, the Market Support Fund are set out in the Wool Marketing Act 1987 sections 48 to 51B.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as Wool Council's `decision rule' on revolvement is concerned, it has been substantially modified over the years, but is currently basically as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> A revolvement of the MSF will occur when the balance of the MSF is sufficient to cover the value of a third of the prospective season's wool clip at the estimated floor price, plus the amount/s under consideration for refund, without recourse to borrowings, but taking into account the next season's MSF portion of the levy'.</PARA>
<PARA> Wool Council at its Annual Conference in Roma in May 1990 resolved to review the revolvement decision rule and further, that no revolvement would occur whilst the Corporation was indebted to external lenders to fund the Reserve Price Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Table 1 shows the amount of wool tax collected each year and the apportionments for each year since 1 July 1974.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Government has no policy to extend payment times from 10 to 14 days to 21 to 30 days for bulk billing practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised by the Health Insurance Commission, which administers Medicare, that there were some minor delays in processing direct bill claims immediately prior to the time of your question. However, the delays were nothing like 21 to 30 days.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the Budget proposals, the Government plans to improve cash management through the introduction of a minimum payment time for Medicare benefit payments by the Commission of 7 days for direct bill claims (excluding specialist pathology) and 10 days for cheque-to-patient or cheque-to-provider claims. Over the counter cash payments will be unaffected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I am unable to give a commitment to never again set the minimum reserve price for wool because of the provisions of sub-section 66(4) of the Wool Marketing Act 1987 which state that</PARA>
<PARA> ``(4) if the Corporation and the Wool Council cannot agree on a price to be published under paragraph (1)(b) for a financial year:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Corporation shall inform the Minister of the disagreement; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Minister shall determine and publish the price that is to be the minimum market indicator reserve price for that year.''</PARA>
<PARA> I do not set the maximum wool tax levy. The maximum rate of wool tax is set through the legislative process under the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1-5) 1964 as amended.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a wide range of responsibilities which affect the rural sector, including the wool industry and, as Minister, I have specific responsibilities under the Wool Marketing Act 1987.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1) &amp;(2) I understand that the `Farrow Group' includes both building societies and a number of companies. The building societies are regulated under the Victorian Building Societies Act 1986 in relation to which the NCSC has no responsibility. The companies concerned are subject to the Companies (Victoria) Code. The NCSC is able to make such investigations as it thinks expedient where it has reason to suspect that there has been a breach of that legislation or that certain other offences relating to companies have occurred. The Companies (Victoria) Code also enables the Attorney-General of Victoria, the Commonwealth Attorney-General or the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities, in certain circumstances, to direct that the NCSC arrange for a special investigation to be carried out in relation to the affairs of companies.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the Victorian Attorney-General has directed that an investigation into the circumstances of the collapse of the `Farrow Group' building societies be held under the Victorian Building Societies Act 1986. I am also advised that, in so far as the activities of companies in the `Farrow Group' related to the building societies concerned, the Victorian Attorney-General has directed a special investigation under the Companies (Victoria) Code into the affairs of companies in that Group. Mr David Habersberger QC has been appointed to head the investigations under both laws.</PARA>

<PARA> However, I note that the Victorian Building Societies Act 1986 specifically states that the Companies (Victoria) Code does not apply to building societies.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) By `private corporations' I have assumed that the honourable member is referring to corporations which are not public authorities or statutory authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> Many Commonwealth Acts of general application apply to corporations, as well as individuals (eg. the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936). For the purposes of this question, I would understand that the Honourable Member wishes that I focus on legislation which specifically regulates the internal management, structure or activities of corporations.</PARA>
<PARA> Some Commonwealth legislation deals specifically with corporations. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, for example, deals in part with acquisitions of shareholdings in Australian companies, with takeovers of Australian companies otherwise than by the acquisition of shares and with takeovers of offshore companies with Australian assets or subsidiaries. The Financial Corporations Act 1974, which is mostly unproclaimed, deals with certain aspects of the regulation of financial corporations. The Trade Practices Act 1974 prohibits corporations from engaging in certain undesirable conduct in relation to their trading activities, such as restrictive trade practices or false or misleading conduct.</PARA>
<PARA> The general regulation of the internal management of companies in Australia is, at present, achieved under a cooperative scheme between the Commonwealth and the States. Under this scheme the Commonwealth enacted the Companies Act 1981, the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act 1980, the Securities Industry Act 1980, the Futures Industry Act 1986, the National Companies and Securities Commission Act 1979 and some ancillary Acts. Each State (and subsequently the Northern Territory) passed legislation which applied those Commonwealth Acts, as if they were laws of that jurisdiction, to companies incorporated or carrying on business in that jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) is responsible for the general administration of the cooperative scheme legislation, but its powers and functions have been largely delegated to State and Territory Corporate Affairs Commissions. Whilst the NCSC is responsible to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities (comprising the Commonwealth Attorney-General and the State and Territory Ministers responsible for corporate affairs), the State and Territory Commissions are subject to direction from their respective Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA> From 1 January 1991 this system will change. Whilst the States will apply the Commonwealth's Corporations Act 1989 (amended to take account of the High Court decision on the States' constitutional challenge) the administration and enforcement of company law on a national basis will be streamlined. The new scheme will be administered by the Australian Securities Commission which will be answerable to the Commonwealth Attorney-General. This will result in clear lines of communication and accountability, and a more flexible and responsive administration.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A number of types of corporations have been excluded from the general operation of the present cooperative scheme legislation, in particular public authorities, credit unions, building societies and cooperative societies. This will continue under the new arrangements from 1 January 1991. It was agreed at the request of the States and the Northern Territory, in the context of negotiations over the future regulation of companies and securities, that the regulation of the internal management and structure of permanent building societies and cooperative organisations should remain a matter for each State and Territory, rather than the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> The regulation of non bank financial institutions is, to the extent that the Commonwealth has an interest, a matter for the Treasurer. Both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have indicated that the Commonwealth would be prepared to assist the States in developing a uniform State-based regulatory regime in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Neither the Farrow corporation nor any companies in the Farrow group are directly regulated by any present Commonwealth corporations legislation. They are regulated by the Companies (Victoria) Code and other Victorian legislation. As regards Mr David Clarke, a director of Pyramid Building Society I am advised he was not at 12 September 1990 a director of any company directly regulated by Commonwealth corporations legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The value of property for the purpose of assessing social security entitlement under the assets test is the market value. Accordingly, the face value of share certificates in the Farrow Corporation building societies will not be recognised unless that value reflects the market value.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Following enquiries with the Administrator for the Farrow Corporation, the Department of Social Security in Victoria issued an instruction to staff on 8 August 1990 to suspend assessments under the assets test against non withdrawable investing shares in the Pyramid, Geelong and Country Wide Building Societies.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) It is speculation what the value of the shares might have been four months before the appointment of the Administrator. At present the asset value of these shares for Social Security purposes is accepted as nil.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Entitlement to Social Security pension and benefits is determined taking account of the prevailing value of a person's income and property.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is contained in the following set of tables, which indicate the percentage change in outlays by function and subfunction (in 1984-85 prices, deflated using the implicit price index for non-farm GDP) for the years 1982-83 to 1993-94.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In interpreting the Tables, the honourable member's attention is drawn to two points:</PARA>
<PARA>* Most figures for the Budget and outyears do not include allowance for within-year increases in Commonwealth sector wages and salaries. Instead a provision is included in the Defence function and the sub-function titled `Contingency Reserve'; and</PARA>
<PARA>* In the Budget papers aggregate data are deflated using the implicit price index for non-farm GDP as a broad indicator of general price and wage movements. However, programs have formal indexation arrangements that utilise deflators other than that for non-farm GDP. For example, pensions and benefits are formally indexed using the CPI. Caution should therefore be used in interpreting the trends evidenced in the tables.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr Bilney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, I have received previously a letter concerning the soldiers who are the subject of the book, ``Heroes Denied-The Malayan Harrier Conspiracy''. It is of interest to note that the author has entered a `statement' at the front of the book which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> `The events and happenings described in this story are the recollections of the survivors of the group of men known as the `The Malayan Harriers'.</PARA>
<PARA> The author and publisher make no judgement on the rights or wrongs of the events described, but believe that the presentation of this story is important for a wider understanding of those times of war'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The personal files of the 15 soldiers have been examined. However, it is very difficult forty eight years after the event to ascertain any evidence of discrimination. Given that the circumstances which prevailed in Malaya in January 1942 and at the fall of Singapore in February that year were very emotive, it is difficult so long after the event, to judge the attitudes, sentiments and actions of people at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no evidence from the records researched to date which suggests that personnel were deserted by their officers. The information contained in the official war diary indicates that the unit sustained very high casualties amongst its officers in the action at MUAR. The diary shows that the unit lost three commanding officers in the period 18-21 January 1942. It would be reasonable to assume that if the survivors of the action at MUAR were dispersed into small groups, a sergeant would be given leadership of one of these groups.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) From the records researched to date, there is no evidence to suggest that the Army discriminated against these personnel or suppressed a proper inquiry into the role of the officers concerned. As in my answer to Question 2, given the circumstances which prevailed in Malaya and Singapore in early 1942, it is difficult so long after the event, to judge the attitudes, sentiments and actions of people at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. Personal records of the soldiers involved show that some members returned to fight in New Guinea and one member saw service in the Middle East prior to service in New Guinea. Others received promotion during later service and all were awarded the appropriate war medals for their service.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Without detailed research of the records of service of the surviving officers, it is not possible to answer this question. The official war diary indicates that only one of the battalion company commanders survived the action at MUAR and the unit sustained very heavy casualties amongst its other officers.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) This question is equally difficult to answer without detailed research. However, the Commanding Officer of an adjoining battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in the battle around MUAR/YONG PENG.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) No, I am satisfied that there is no need to clear the names of these men and that they have been suitably recognised by the award of the appropriate campaign medals.</PARA>
