<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is considering the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill as our ships continue on their way to the Middle East. It is an omnibus Bill proposing various amendments to a series of Acts within the Defence portfolio. I indicate at the outset that the coalition supports this legislation. Indeed, Senator Jocelyn Newman, in the Senate, will give more details in relation to specific aspects of this measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill is substantially the same as the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) which was introduced in November last year but lapsed with the dissolution of the Parliament. The passage of this Bill will see amendments to the Defence Act 1903 and the Naval Defence Act 1910 by removing restrictions on the power of the Chief of the Defence Force to make single service command appointments and organisational arrangements; removing redundant provisions relating to seniority; and modifying provisions relating to the enlistment of soldiers and sailors to enable the open-ended enlistment scheme to operate more effectively. In addition, the Bill will amend the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to replace obsolete references to the offence of rape with references to the current Act provisions that have replaced that former offence.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1985 to remove unnecessary provisions dealing with allotments. It will also amend the Defence Force retirement and death benefits legislation to increase the orphans benefit from $702 to $5,000, retrospective to 30 June 1989. That, of course, is a retrospective benefit and, therefore, certainly will not be opposed by the coalition. Finally, the Bill amends several Acts to replace references to the Joint Intelligence Organisation with references to the Defence Intelligence Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> In indicating our support for the Bill I would like to indicate, nevertheless, dissatisfaction with the fact that it has taken the Government so long to determine the orphans benefit which has significantly disadvantaged this worthy group within our community. It is interesting to see defence back on the public agenda. Why is it, though, that it takes some sort of emergency such as the current Middle East crisis for Australians and, in particular, this Government to focus once again on defence? This Government has run down defence by stealth over seven years. I use the word `stealth' because what this Government has done is give senior officers and defence planners an expectation in relation to future funding. In good faith, and on that basis, Defence has accepted tenders for major capital projects such as the F18 aircraft frigates and submarines and, as is well known, the full expectations have not been warranted because the Government has shortchanged Defence and this has caused great difficulties elsewhere in the defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget presented last night indicated that total defence outlays will increase by a notional $494m or 5.8 per cent representing-I quote exactly from the Budget Papers-`zero real growth using Defence deflators'. Defence is therefore static. I know that my colleague Senator Peter Durack will have more to say about that aspect of this Budget. As a consequence, the expectation has not been realised. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been difficulties in the Defence budget overall and difficulties in the Defence budget specific. Let me give honourable members an example. The Kapooka First Recruit Training Battalion (1RTB) in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) has an intense training program. It has even been the subject of television documentaries such as Ladies in Line and so forth. It requires an horrific schedule for both the recruits and the training staff. It badly needs to update its weapon range system so that recruits can be put through in a much more efficient way without them having to fire, put down their weapons, clear them, move forward, repatch the targets, come back and repeat the whole exercise. Less than $1m is needed to proceed with a super dart type range facility at 1RTB Kapooka. The project has been on various lists to receive that capital priority for construction.</PARA>
<PARA> I had better declare a vested interest. Such weaponry and weapons systems are excellent. They do exist. They are made nearby at Albury. The Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI) facility there used to be known as `Dart Defence'. It is very efficient and effective. We are watching with interest ADI's commitment to Albury. So far, so good. </PARA>
<PARA> These modern systems, relatively minor capital expenditure items, are not seen around Australia at this time because so much of the Defence budget is tied up with massive big ticket items such as the frigates, the submarines, the completion of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft purchases and the like. It could be so much better were these things to get through. The recruits would be able to see on a television screen right beside them whether they were firing high, low, left or right. Their training can be improved very quickly and effectively. Their skills in weaponry can be boosted in about half the time as can happen with the current range situation at 1RTB Kapooka and elsewhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a vicious circle and one for which the Government is wholly responsible. In a sense the Government is requiring much more of Defence, more so in the last month, but has yet to work out fully where it is heading in fundamental terms with regard to the Defence budget.</PARA>
<PARA> It is almost as if the Government has a long-term love-hate relationship with Defence. But Australians cannot have a love-hate relationship with the defence forces; they cannot be turned on and off. We cannot require massive active commitments from the Navy, the Army and the Air Force overnight when another world crisis emerges and then cut down on their expenditure at other times and not give them the necessary priority to maintain the degree of training and readiness. </PARA>
<PARA> The sailors on those ships are sailing from Sydney to the Middle East and are having to receive a great deal of training en route because of the budget cutbacks in the area of general training in the Navy-training which would otherwise have seen them up to standard before boarding. In fact, one of the sailors was going to sea for the first time ever. I wish him well. I think it is quite curious that in sending ships towards the battle zone of the Middle East, towards the horrific saga in the Middle East, at least one of the members of that contingent has never been to sea before. Perhaps that is the tip of an iceberg which reflects the Government's priorities and its downgrading of defence in general.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I realise that many ramifications have to be taken into account with regard to defence, defence expenditure and defence priorities. In this legislation some of those things are rectified. At long last certain restrictions on the Chief of the Defence Force are being removed to empower properly that officer with a headquarters structure and organisational arrangements which mean that he does not play second fiddle to those in control of the fiefdoms at the individual service levels, whether they be the head of the Army, the Navy or the Air Force. That should bring about a better coordinated structure at the very top and enable greater direction in our defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA> The removal of the redundancy provisions and the sensible alterations to the open-ended enlistment scheme are supported. Years ago a person signed on and stayed. It was very difficult not to stay. If a person went absent without leave that person was charged. There is now a more flexible approach which should help in maintaining recruitment.</PARA>
<PARA> In supporting this legislation, I remind honourable members that at the individual level there is a real morale problem in our Navy, Army and Air Force. That is for a mixture of reasons; it is not entirely a budgetary matter. Progress in defence service conditions has been made over the years under both the previous Government and this Government. There have been so many studies, investigations, reports and committees commissioned with regard to the state of the defence forces, and particular aspects of the Navy, Army and Air Force, that the defence forces feel they have been studied to death rather than having been allowed to act upon a study, determine a charter, stick with that charter and get on with the job. At a macro level we have had white papers and the like and then we have had governments walk away from those white papers. We have had more recent developments, too-albeit unpredictable, I concede-impacting on the requirements of the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA> Morale is crucial in the defence forces. Morale requires a great deal of leadership; it requires adequate government policies as well. That is especially required when our sailors and soldiers are going to the Middle East at this most critical time in Australia's history. I cannot emphasise too much the need for adequate morale in our defence forces, and I cannot emphasise too much the need for an adequate command structure and adequate government services and conditions to help facilitate that morale. Progress has been made especially with regard to our Middle East contingent.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not opposed to this legislation. It welcomes many of the specifics contained in it. Senator Jocelyn Newman will comment further on some of the detailed aspects of the Bill. Following the key motions in both the House of Representatives and the Senate yesterday regarding our Middle East commitments, supported by both the Government and the Opposition, I take this opportunity once again to say that we wish our sailors and soldiers well as they go to the Middle East. It is a deadly serious business. It is a no joy commitment. Nevertheless, it is a correct commitment if we are to have an ordered society in this world.</PARA>
<PARA> We hope our contingent will have a speedy and safe return, overcoming in the process, one way or another, the tyranny created by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Above all else, we hope that in that process the 160 Australians still in Iraq and Kuwait will make it back to Australia safely. That is a very tall order. We must not underestimate the task involved. That is why, as it has in the past, Australia will always require an adequate Defence Force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill, which is currently before the House, deals with a number of defence-related matters which have required attention as part of the Government's ongoing program of reform and reorganisation of this important area. As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) said in his second reading speech, the Bill is substantially the same as the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 which was introduced in November last year but which, of course, lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill deals with a variety of matters, some of which are of a housekeeping nature and others which form part of the Government's strategy of strengthening our defence capabilities and making those capabilities more flexible, efficient and comparable with modern circumstances. Major amendments to the Bill include: amending the Defence Force retirement and death benefits legislation to increase the orphan's benefit from $702 to $5,000; removing restrictions on the Chief of the Defence Force's power to make single service command appointments and organisational arrangements; modifying provisions relating to the enlistment of soldiers and sailors to enable the open-ended enlistment scheme to operate more efficiently; amending Commonwealth Acts to replace references to the Joint Intelligence Organisation with references to the Defence Intelligence Organisation; and removing redundant provisions dealing with seniority. It also deals with amendment to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to replace obsolete references to the offence of rape with references to the current Australian Capital Territory provisions that have replaced that former offence; and amendment to the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (No. 1) 1985 to remove an unnecessary provision dealing with allotments. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose to spend time now discussing the amendments which are clearly of a general housekeeping nature-suffice to say that the Minister covered them very adequately in his second reading speech, and they are also well canvassed in the explanatory memorandum. However, I take this opportunity to deal with one or two of the amendments which are interesting in their relationship to wider matters. I refer specifically to the Government's well documented efforts to both restructure the Australian economy and rebuild our defence capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that since the release of the Defence White Paper in 1987, the Hawke Government has worked towards a strategy of building for this country a defence capability which is relevant to its needs. As part of the thrust of the White Paper, the Australian defence forces moved from a forward defence strategy to the more appropriate continental defence strategy. The logical progression of the continental defence strategy has been the integration of the Services into the Australian Defence Force-the ADF. This logical progression has made it essential for the removal of restrictions on the Chief of the Defence Force's power to make single service command appointments and organisational agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> The present arrangements are a result of the 1987 study into the ADF command arrangements. The existing legislation obliges the Chief of the Defence Force to implement single service appointments and organisational arrangements through the service chiefs of staff. There is, of course, a legal impediment to that process. The anomaly will have to be removed to allow the ADF Chief the flexibility that is necessary. The amendment makes the necessary changes to the Defence Act and the Naval Defence Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has made defence capability an appropriate priority in its seven years on the government benches. It has made appropriate equipment purchases, such as submarines, F18 fighter bombers and the recently let contract for naval frigates. </PARA>
<PARA> It was my great pleasure three years ago to serve on the Defence Committee when, for the first time, we decided to build submarines in this country. The defence forces must now compete with private industry for the specialists that comprise a modern fighting force because the capabilities of those people are required in industry. The Government has made important purchases in relation to the joint building of the submarines. It has carried out programs with private enterprise which I hope will be of lasting benefit to industry.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take up one item raised by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I have great regard for him, but I was a bit surprised when he denigrated some of our sailors who are at sea for the first time. If the sailor in question is the one mentioned on a television news program the other night, I am sure that he had been in the Navy only a couple of months. The Leader of the National Party would be well aware that our sailors, Air Force men and Army guys who were involved in the Second World War had never seen a uniform or a rifle until they landed at Gallipoli or wherever they went in Europe. It is unfair to say that the Government is responsible for sending inexperienced sailors to the conflict in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I join the Leader of the National Party in wishing our sailors well in their commitment in the Gulf, and I wish them a speedy return to Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been explained, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 follows on from the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 which was introduced in November. As a number of honourable members have said, it is appropriate that the Bill is being considered at a time when, within 24 hours, members of our defence forces will sail from our shores to uphold freedom and justice for all Australians as well as the free world. I join honourable members in wishing them godspeed as they go to that area of possible conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) referred to the comments by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) about sailors going by ship to the area of conflict. I am sure that the honourable member was not in any way criticising the sailors and that he well and truly realises that in past conflicts ill-prepared and ill-trained personnel went into battle. That has happened in many countries. With our modern equipment and present capabilities, we would not hear today of our personnel going into battle with insufficient training. I am sure that the honourable member did not mean to reflect adversely on the personnel on the ships-the opposite would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last Sunday, a large contingent of returned Vietnam veterans marched through the streets of Springwood, the heart of my electorate. They were honoured by dignitaries and the people of the electorate of Macquarie. It was probably the largest memorial day celebration in Australia of Vietnam veterans. Next year will be the twenty-fifth anniversary and I anticipate that a very large group will parade on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), was welcomed to that function but he was not there. He was very capably represented, of course, by the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free), who was there to fly the flag for the Government. I think it is very sad that these veterans had to fight for recognition and a fair go for their claims in return for the gallant service given by them for their country. We all know that it took years and years for the Government and, indeed, other organisations to recognise that the Vietnam veterans played a very significant part in the defence of the free world. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in the Bill are long overdue when viewed in light of the morale problems that exist in all sections of our defence forces today, and that cannot be denied. I hope that this is a sign that the Government is closing the gates while some of the horses are still there. My concern is highlighted by the fact that I have a very large concentration of defence personnel in my electorate of Macquarie; namely, the Richmond Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base, Australia's largest transport base. When I speak to the fine men and women at the Richmond base and talk about the officer resignations, the loss of tradesmen, technicians, instrument fitters and flight engineers, about the unfair and dangerous workloads and the stressful family situations that exist there-and indeed they are plentiful-I know that more is expected and more is needed from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The message I receive constantly from these defence personnel is one of dismay and disillusionment with the treatment meted out by the Government in all matters related to employment, housing, training, staffing levels and the pressures placed on their families. These are very significant issues. As a member of the foreign affairs and defence committee coalition task force, I have been most concerned about all matters concerning defence and, in particular, defence personnel. I have made many speeches in the House on most aspects of defence in support of our defence forces and have drawn attention to the failures and commended wherever possible positive moves by the Government to address the very real problems we have been facing for many years in Defence Force areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of personnel wastage has been dealt with previously in great detail in the Cross report and debated at length in this House. It is related to the issues that have been raised today in these amendments. My question to the House is this: has anything changed significantly since this very good report was brought to the attention of the Government? I instance a particular part of the Cross report where reference is made to a RAAF squadron which had nine pilots and 18 fighter aircraft; its minimum training level should have been 36. This squadron was at quarter strength, with two pilots for each plane. It lacked a fighter combat instructor and flight commander. Seven of the pilots could not be used at night or in bad weather because of inadequate training. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed last night in the Budget, almost with disbelief, that there will be no real growth in defence spending but there will be cuts in fighter training-I cannot believe it-and there will be the early retirement of two Royal Australian Navy vessels. The problems faced by our defence forces have been highlighted repeatedly in this House. It is only now-seven and a half years later-that the Government has decided to introduce legislation to bolster the sagging morale of our defence forces. I know there have been other amendments and changes have been made from time to time, but we are only now getting into major areas of policy that are going to make life for the defence forces a little easier. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the Government has ignored the need for radical structural reform in the defence bureaucracy. We are seeing some of that overcome by these amendments. Significantly, the Government refuses to allow special treatment of pay and conditions for service personnel and in so doing it reveals its own fundamental policy confusion. It says that service life is unique but insists that it be dealt with within the rigid Australian Council of Trade Unions enforced accord. It says that it recognises the special demands on service personnel and their families but it is constrained by its own inflexible industrial relations system in its capacity to meet those demands and needs. It wants to deal with defence personnel within the same system and on the same basis as it deals with waterside workers. I find it very hard to believe and understand such logic. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Government's inability or refusal to boost pay and conditions outside the accord which reflects the fundamental failure of the Government's response. The perception of a lack of leadership by the Government and a lack of trust in politicians were two of the key areas for concern pinpointed by the Cross report. The Government's response, deficient in particular in its failure to deal with the uniqueness of service life and problems, fails to signal leadership and restore trust. Honourable members should bear in mind that these comments made by the Cross report came out without any minority report. It is driven by minimum public relations concern and is ad hoc. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that the Government fails to come to grips with the unique and serious problems producing our defence crisis it fails to carry out its first responsibility as a Federal government-the defence of the country. Again, we need to witness the comments in the defence budget announced last night where there were no real increases, despite what Dibb and others have recommended in the past. There will be cuts to fighter training and we will mothball a couple of RAN ships. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us also aims to amend the Commonwealth acts to replace a reference to the Joint Intelligence Organisation with a reference to the Defence Intelligence Organisation. In March 1989 I spoke at length in the House about the need to upgrade this country's defence intelligence services and systems. The then Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), actually commended what I had to say and for concentrating on the intelligence matters throughout that speech. We are still waiting for the Minister to come into this place and put defence and security issues ahead of the need to manipulate political perceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at a detailed analysis of the Defence Force wastage rates which are directly concerned with this morale question for the calendar year 1989. We will see that this has revealed a flood of personnel leaving the forces which has not been stemmed. In fact, the position is deteriorating at an alarming rate. Total separations from the regular defence force have reached over 9,200 personnel, which eclipses the worst ever year of 1987. This figure represents an 8 per cent increase in the wastage rates over 1988 and an increase of 29.7 per cent over 1983. A particularly worrying aspect of the statistics are the very high wastage rates which are now occurring in the Army. Other rank, non-officers, separations in this service have increased sharply from 49 per cent of total separations in 1988 to 58 per cent in 1989. Other ranks' separations in the Army and Navy are up on 1988, whilst the RAAF appears to have levelled out, thankfully. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures I have on the resignations in the RAAF, which are of particular interest to me in view of the RAAF personnel in my electorate, number a total of 782 during the five month period from 1 July 1989 to 30 November 1989. An analysis of wastage shows that more than 25 per cent, 17,712, of the current strength of the Defence Force has left the services in the past two years and the strength of the defence forces is at its lowest level for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to highlight one aspect of this legislation. The increase of the orphans benefit from $702 to $5,000, an absolutely massive increase, is retrospective to 30 June 1989. I am not criticising that particular move in any way whatsoever. The figure of $702 has remained unchanged since 1972, so we on this side have some responsibility for not increasing it from that point on, but the Government has the audacity to tell us that it cares for our defence personnel and their families yet for 7 years it has been guilty of leaving the orphans benefit at $702. I believe that is inexcusable and I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to the parliamentary prayer that Mr Speaker recited just 35 minutes ago. The prayer that we hear every day says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Almighty God, we humbly beseech Thee to . . . Direct and prosper our deliberations to the advancement of Thy glory, and the true welfare of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore we look for some of His guidance, and, if we were true to this prayer, we would remind ourselves of the biblical command to care very specially for widows and orphans. It is good to see that the Government has suddenly realised this. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years the coalition has been pushing for an increase to the widows and orphans benefit, but to no avail. Our pleas have fallen on deaf ears, it seems. We welcome the benefits that this Bill has to offer to our defence forces and we hope that the poor morale and disenchantment that exists today can be turned around to the advantage of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-In summing up this debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill I would like first of all to thank all of those who took part in the debate on what is a very important subject, even if the Bill before us does not make huge changes except in one or two respects. As the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) said in his remarks, much of what we are considering today consists of housekeeping amendments, but that is good because it demonstrates that this Government is serious about keeping our defence forces legislation up to date, just as it is serious about keeping the defence of this country up to date, as we have seen in a very dramatic way in recent days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am a bit puzzled by some of the remarks made about morale in the Services. Honourable members who, as I did, went to see the FFGs, the two guided missile frigates, and HMAS Success off on their very important mission to the Gulf could not have been left in any doubt about the morale of the people on those ships, their seriousness of purpose, their training or the formidable nature of the force they represent. Moreover, they could not have been left in any doubt about the readiness of our forces. The order for those ships to go was given on Thursday night, and the two FFGs were through Sydney Heads on Monday morning. That state of readiness would be the envy of any force in the world. The Government is very proud of the morale of our Services and the training which has enabled that degree of readiness on the part of the Royal Australian Navy and the whole Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes a number of useful changes. I appreciate the remarks that have been made about the increase to the orphans benefit from $702 to $5,000. That is long overdue, and obviously it will have support from every honourable member in this House. Reference was made to the Cross report on personnel wastage and the extent to which that has been implemented. From memory, there are some 48 recommendations in the Cross report, the report of a Committee on which I had the privilege of sitting. Of those 48 recommendations, all bar about three or four have been implemented. The Bill being debated today carries that process even further.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member who preceded me in this debate, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), has mentioned, it is true that separation rates from the Australian Defence Force are still not as low as we would like them but the honourable member will be aware that in recent days I have announced a new superannuation scheme, the military superannuation and benefits scheme, to apply to members of the ADF. That scheme incorporates a quite novel feature for Australia-indeed, for the world-which is a retention bonus of a year's salary at 15 years service provided members are prepared to sign on for another five years. The Government has advice that that provision will reduce separation rates even more, and we have already seen a gradual improvement even before that provision has come in. </PARA>

It is vital that we stem the growing importation of illegal goods, drugs and narcotic substances. Illegal goods are considered to be weapons, flick knives, pornographic material, fauna and some technology. The threat which illegal drugs and narcotic substances pose to our society was given the most weight in our decision to support the legislation. We also considered the need to reduce the volume of substances being imported into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Drugs represent an ever increasing problem within our society. The number of people estimated to be using illegal substances increases each year, but what is more disturbing is that each year the age of people trying these drugs for the first time is lower. A 1985 survey conducted as part of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse indicated that 25 per cent of people in the general population had used illegal drugs at some time in their lives. A similar survey conducted in 1988 indicated that 28 per cent of the population had been involved in drug usage. At the same time, the 1988 survey showed that males in the 20 to 39 year-old age bracket were the strongest users of the drugs. Fifteen per cent of that part of the population had used drugs for a consistent period; 8 per cent of males used amphetamines, 5 per cent used heroin and cocaine, while the remaining 2 per cent were users of other drugs, including LSD. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1988 survey also revealed that cannabis was regularly used by 10 per cent of all school students. Three per cent of all students illicitly used sedatives, while 2 per cent used amphetamines. Similarly alarming is the number of drug related deaths. In 1987, some 25,300 deaths in Australia were directly caused by drugs, whether by overdose, AIDS related deaths caused by using infected needles, or accidents resulting from drug usage. The National Drug Abuse Information Centre suggests that one in every three deaths in the 15 to 34 year age group is drug related.</PARA>
<PARA> It is against these figures that the coalition had to weigh the infringements on human rights imposed by this Bill. We have also had to consider that the methods of importation and concealment of illegal substances are becoming increasingly sophisticated. To keep up with this, it is appropriate that the Australian Customs Service be given more sophisticated powers and methods of detention and recovery.</PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate, let me give the House some examples. Drugs have been found to be concealed in false linings of baggage and clothing, in spines of bibles and other religious books, in costumes and cosmetics, foodstuffs and other gifts. They have been found on the person of a priest, a 63-year-old grandmother, a businessman and diplomatic staff.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of internal concealment, in May last year the Customs Service arrested a Thai person internally carrying 93 condoms containing a total of 700 grams of heroin. In the same month it also arrested five Nepalese who were internally concealing over one kilogram of heroin in total. Two other Nepalese were arrested with false passports and internally carrying 1,000 grams of heroin each.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of actually carrying the drugs on the body, the most common way is to strap a small package of the drug to a person's skin, concealing it under clothing. However, this method is becoming more sophisticated with innovative ways of concealment regularly being discovered by the Customs Service.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, in June a Customs officer arrested a Venezuelan national who was carrying five kilograms of cocaine concealed in a chessboard. Another passenger was found to be concealing 700 grams of heroin in the waistband of his jeans. In July a New Zealander was arrested and discovered to have drugs concealed in a false lining of the gym boots he was wearing.</PARA>
<PARA> Reports from the Federal and State authorities and from overseas intelligence organisations indicate that the trafficking in illicit drugs in Australia has continued to increase. The emphasis of law enforcement agencies in combating drug trafficking as well as the general increases in the size of individual seizures by Federal authorities are reflected in this trend.</PARA>
<PARA> The number of seizures made by Customs officers in 1988-89 was 1,068, an increase of 46 per cent on the previous year. The number of cocaine seizures rose by 132 per cent from 28 in 1987-88 to 65 in 1988-89. Seizures of cannabis increased by 53 per cent from 573 in 1987-88 to 874 in the following year. Seizures of other drugs, including barbiturates and LSD, rose by 18 per cent from 68 to 80.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of weight, the volume of drugs seized has also increased. The volume of heroin seized in 1988-89 was 41 kilograms, some 161 per cent more than the 15 kilograms seized in the previous year. Over 19 kilograms of cocaine were seized in 1988-89, an increase of 71 per cent on the previous year. The volume of cannabis also increased, but to a lesser degree, from 4,470 kilograms in 1987-88 to 4,660 in 1988-89. Inbound travelling airline passengers accounted for nearly 16 per cent of all drugs seized by the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence to suggest that this increase in seizures has had any impact on the drug market in Australia. Significantly, this implies that the majority of importers are still getting through the barriers. In view of all these factors, the coalition considers that a case could be made for stronger drug detection and recovery methods. In the process of considering this Bill, we consulted widely with civil liberties groups, looked at the systems in other countries and also considered the legislation as it currently stands.</PARA>
<PARA> The methods of detention and search which many overseas nations have in place are similar to those being proposed by the Australian Customs Service although, in some countries and particularly in the Asian countries, the searches are more intrusive and offer less protection to the detainees.</PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of the House, let me briefly run through the provisions of the proposed legislation and the current situation. Essentially, the new Bill will give the Australian Customs Service more comprehensive powers to detain and search passengers suspected of carrying illegal goods or narcotic substances.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for three levels of search: a frisk search, an external search and an internal search. The coalition is keen to ensure that, as each level of search becomes more intrusive, the controls placed on the Customs officers are also strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the Customs officers only have the power to conduct either an external search or an internal search. These searches must be ordered by a justice of the peace or the Comptroller-General of Customs. The order must be based on a reasonable suspicion of the Customs officer leading him to believe that the person is carrying illegal goods. The searches must be conducted by an officer of the same sex although, in the case of the internal search, they should be conducted by a medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the current regime is woefully inadequate in terms of the protection it offers in respect of the civil liberties and the privacy of travelling passengers. It does not provide for the search to be carried out in private, for the protection of minors, or for language assistance for non-English speaking travellers. Also, the current legislation does not provide the detainee with the right to a lawyer. </PARA>
<PARA> Given this, it is of some concern that the Customs Service has had this legislation on its drawing board for, I believe, some five years. The new legislation tempers the existing search regime by providing for a frisk search. This is defined as an examination of a person by the rapid running of hands over the person's outer garments and anything voluntarily removed by that person. The search is restricted to officers of the Customs Service where an officer suspects on reasonable grounds that a person is carrying illegal goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The term `reasonable grounds' has been defined in section 219L(2), of the Bill to include any or all of the following: the person's travel itinerary; declarations or statements made in the course of travelling into or out of the country; documents in the person's possession; and unusual behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to note that the invasion of the detainee's privacy has been minimised by the right of the detainee to have a frisk search conducted in private, if so wished, and for the search to be conducted by an officer of the same sex. On an administrative matter, I trust the Customs Service will ensure that there are a sufficient number of female officers employed on a rostered duty basis. It is appropriate that a female officer be available at all times to conduct searches as necessary on female detainees.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that Customs officers are currently or will be properly trained in the conduct of frisk searches and in determining the appropriate class of search, and I am also aware that stringent guidelines for Customs officers exist. However, I trust that Customs officers will act in an appropriate and responsible manner when exercising their frisk powers.</PARA>
<PARA> The second level of search is the external search. This is slightly more intrusive than a frisk search. In accordance with human rights concerns, the controls put into place for this search are more stringent. The external search can be defined as a search of the body or anything worn by that person to determine whether a person is carrying prohibitive goods. The search can only be undertaken if ordered by a justice of the peace, the Customs Comptroller-General or an officer of supervisory rank. Consequently, the suspicions of a Customs officer must be strong enough to receive the endorsement of a senior officer before the search can proceed. The search must be undertaken in private and by an officer of the same sex. </PARA>
<PARA> The most intrusive of the searches is the third level-that is, the internal search. It is the level of search which I consider most invades people's privacy. The coalition is anxious to ensure that this invasion is minimised as far as possible and that the controls placed on the Australian Customs Service are sufficiently strong.</PARA>
<PARA> An internal search can be undertaken only where a person is suspected of carrying illegal narcotics in a commercial or trafficable quantity-as opposed to carrying illegal drugs, which is the test applied to the previous levels of searches.</PARA>
<PARA> If the detainee does not consent to the search, it can proceed only following two periods of 48 hours in detention to allow the substance to be emitted naturally. The two periods of detention and the search have to be individually ordered by a magistrate or judge.</PARA>
<PARA> In ordering that next step to proceed the judge must give due weight to all evidence, including any new or emerging facts. The detainee being held for an internal search has the right to a lawyer to be present, or to be represented at the hearings to seek the detention and search order. The internal search is to be conducted by a medical practitioner in a hospital. The legislation provides the medical practitioner with immunity from suits which may arise as a result of the search with the exception, of course, of negligence.</PARA>
<PARA> At all three levels of search the detainee has the right to protection if he or she is a minor, or if he or she is mentally or physically incapacitated. Similarly, a detainee who has problems with the English language has the express right to an interpreter.</PARA>
<PARA> I might point out that this provision was not, in fact, included in the Bill when it was first presented to the Parliament late last year. Its inclusion is the result of an amendment sought by my colleague the previous shadow Minister for customs, Senator David MacGibbon. While it is unfortunate that such protection for non-English speaking travellers was omitted, it was pleasing that the amendment was so readily accepted by the Customs office. It is perhaps an indication of the willingness of the Customs Service to accommodate such human rights concerns.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Customs office has reached agreement with the States regarding the provision of and compensation for judiciary. I also understand that they have reached a similar agreement regarding the provision of medical practitioners. The financial implications of the Bill have been outlined in the explanatory memorandum accompanying it.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like also to touch on the impact of the spent convictions scheme in terms of this legislation. In simple form, the spent convictions scheme allows persons with prior convictions the right not to disclose those prior convictions when seeking employment. It also prevents employers from using prior criminal convictions as a reason for refusing employment of a particular person.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this scheme, a person with prior criminal convictions might be employed by the Australian Customs Service and, consequently, able to conduct searches. I regard this as being somewhat dangerous, particularly if a person has convictions in the area of sexual offences. Therefore, I was pleased to note that as of 1 July 1990 the Australian Customs Service is exempt from the spent convictions scheme. It can, therefore, take prior convictions into account when employing staff and use them as a justification for refusing employment.</PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I would like to touch on some of the comments made by the different human rights organisations with whom we have consulted. Generally, the civil liberties and human rights organisations were happy with the protection afforded to passengers subject to a search. While they considered that the searches did involve some invasion of privacy, they were also of the view that little more, apart from not conducting searches at all, could be done to minimise a person's rights.</PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, the Law Reform Commission indicated that it had long been of the view that barrier controls of the Customs Service needed to be upgraded. The Privacy Commission stated that while it recognised the need for these types of searches, it was concerned about the intrusiveness associated with them. However, the Privacy Commission also said that it believed that this legislation did impose sufficient controls on Customs officers and gave sufficient protection to detainees. It was unsure of what else could be done to protect a detainee, apart from not conducting the search at all.</PARA>
<PARA> One civil liberties group had some concerns about the principle of searching passengers. However, it also agreed that the importation of drugs had to be minimised and did not have any alternative to the proposed system.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which looked into human rights aspects of legislation, regarded the rights of individuals to be adequately protected. It also considered that appropriate efforts had been made to protect persons against the abuse of power by Customs and police officers.</PARA>
<PARA> In all, the coalition supports these views. However, we also consider that the invasion of privacy to which they refer has been adequately balanced against giving the community sufficient protection from traffickers of illegal and narcotic substances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs (Detention and Search) Bill before the House this morning proposes amendments to the Customs Act 1901 to repeal the current power to detain and search persons suspected of unlawfully carrying prohibited goods, and insert in its place a new division containing a more comprehensive range of Customs detention and search powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I are well versed in this matter, as we are both involved with a committee of this Parliament looking into the operations of the Australian Customs Service at the present time. You are aware, as I am sure the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) at the table is aware, that the Australian Customs Service performs a range of activities not only on its own behalf, but also on behalf of a number of other agencies of the Commonwealth-the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and, most significantly in a lot of ways, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> This legislation really provides for, tightens up and puts to rest any concerns that might exist within the community and within legal circles with reference to the powers which may exist already or which should exist to enable Customs officers to search people suspected of bringing prohibited goods into this country.</PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen in our investigations to date through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is a service of the Government which is committed to the work in which it is involved. We have seen at airports and seaports around Australia dedicated men and women concerned about protecting at the barrier young Australians from the evil that is illegal drugs, particularly, and also from prohibited imports coming into this country. It is interesting that what this legislation, in fact, proposes is a series of proposals that will enable Customs officers to take one step further to better enforce the role that they have for the protection of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) has indicated that the Opposition is supporting this legislation. I am also pleased that he raised a number of issues concerning civil liberties in this debate. These are issues which the Government was equally concerned about, as was the Australian Customs Service. As has been indicated, these are matters which, in fact, have been addressed by the Government and by the Australian Customs Service through the Government's willingness to include changes in the proposed legislation before the House this morning.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting that in legal circles there is a view which suggests that perhaps this legislation may not, in fact, be necessary-that there is existing power under the present legislation for frisk searching and so on. There is a separate view-one which I think the Customs Service has acted upon-which indicates that it is preferable to have the power defined in legislation to cover issues arising from civil liberties, human rights and the general question of what Customs officials can and cannot do in their search and interception of illegal substances coming into this country. That is exactly what this particular legislation does.</PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, the Australian Customs Service has four categories of search under section 196 of the Act. It is interesting however that those four categories are not separately listed in the legislation. They are: category 1, outer clothing; category 2, removal of some clothing; category 3, strip search, which of course must be done by a senior officer; and, finally, category 4, which is the internal search requiring examination in hospital by a medical practitioner.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Customs Service is of the view that it is most important to enshrine in legislation now the legalities of these particular categories of searches. As it stands, officers, being either police officers or Customs officers, must first develop a reasonable cause to suspect that a person may be carrying illegal goods before such a search can be undertaken. Those of us who have witnessed Customs officers in action at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and at the Melbourne and Darwin airports would readily have seen some of the difficulties under which these Customs officers work.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Forrest indicated that he hoped that the Customs Service would be an equal opportunity employer and that females would be on duty to conduct these sorts of examinations as required. I assure him that from my observations Customs has been more than fair in that. It is an occupation which the women who are presently employed in the Customs Service take to very readily. They are just as committed as their male counterparts. In fact, from what we have been able to see around Australia, there is more than ample evidence to suggest that there are the appropriate levels of both male and female staff to conduct the sorts of searches that this legislation talks about.</PARA>
<PARA> Following that reasonable cause to suspect, that having been first determined as the legislation currently requires, the Customs officer must then justify that cause to a more senior officer. Finally, at that point, a number of review mechanisms are still available to people who undertake a search or have a search undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> At the moment there is a hierarchy of searches and there are processes before searches are undertaken. This legislation will obviate some of these disincentives to search by enabling a very quick pat down of a pocket or whatever to ascertain that a particular bulge is what it seems, without having to establish reasonable cause for suspicion that a person is about to breach the law.</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to observe Customs officers carrying out their duties. These people have received training in body language. They have received training both within their organisation and externally in techniques of observation and so on. A lot of the work of the Customs people at the barriers is of an intuitive nature. This says something of the people who presently work in the Customs Service.</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation that is being proposed-the quick pat down under the frisk searching regime-will be beneficial to passengers. Suspicions about what may have attracted the Customs officer's attention will be very quickly allayed.</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at the statistics of results. If one looks at searches carried out under section 196 between July last year and June this year one sees some positive results. The honourable member for Forrest gave a number of examples. They were quite reasonable in that they gave a clear picture of the sorts of finds that have been made by Customs officers. Of the 305 searches carried out under category 1, which I remind honourable members is simply the outer clothing search, 18 resulted in positive finds. Of the 1,473 searches carried out under category 2-the removal of some clothing-113 results were positive. Out of some 1,312 searches carried out under category 3, which is the strip search done by senior officers-the sex of the reviewing officer is taken into consideration-there were 90 positive results. Finally, of the 160 searches carried out under category 4, which is the internal search, there were 16 positive results. Overall, there were some 238 positive results out of a total of 3,240 searches. This represents a success rate of about 7.35 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Some people may well argue that is not a particularly good level of success. But in many ways the Customs Service is constrained by a number of issues. It is constrained to ensure that passengers at airports, particularly those coming into Australia, are processed quickly. These people want a turnaround time of a matter of minutes. Many of them, having spent many hours on aeroplanes, want to pick up their bags, get out of the airport and get to where they are heading. They do not want to be hassled at the end of their long journey. In the circumstances, the Customs officers believe that is fair and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA> Customs has actually developed a management technique based on risk assessment. In the circumstances, that is appropriate for the Australian Customs Service. For the uninitiated, risk assessment means that by building up a record on passengers, on origins of aircraft or ships coming into Australia, one can very quickly build up a data profile that shows the likelihood of risk attracted to aircraft, passengers or ships coming from particular areas. The Australian Customs Service officers can then turn their attention to those passengers-but again, always with the view of quickly clearing passengers through the process. That is exactly what this legislation will enable them to do. If there is a feeling that perhaps there is some concealment, then the quick pat down is likely to alleviate any of those concerns. If that pat down reveals something, then obviously the next stage is undertaken and the Customs Service has the right so to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Forrest also talked about his concerns about drug importation and the role being played by the Australian Customs Service to combat that. I can only echo and support every statement that he made. I abhor the practice, which unfortunately shows no signs of abating, of drugs being brought into this country, therefore wreaking devastation and destruction, particularly on many young people in our communities.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a sad fact that at the moment some 88 per cent of the heroin coming into this country emanates from Asia; over 60 per cent of the imported cocaine comes from the United States of America and nearly 30 per cent from South America; and the supply of cannabis comes equally from Asia and Europe-about 40 per cent from each. That shows that the Australian Customs Service, playing the role that it does at the barrier, must be alerted to these particular problems. Therefore anything in legislative terms which will assist it detect at that barrier illegal substances coming into this country must be supported.</PARA>
<PARA> A lot has been said about human rights, the protection of passenger rights and the invasion of privacy. I, like the honourable member for Forrest, am not averse to these sorts of procedures being put in place, provided appropriate screening is done where necessary, provided it is done in an unobtrusive way and provided there is agreement with the passengers concerned. Legislative factors have been built in which protect those human rights.</PARA>
<PARA> But, equally, I am vitally concerned about protecting the human rights, the privacy and the well-being of those many young Australians who could be subjected to those sorts of illegal substances were those substances to come into this country. Therefore, I am not that greatly worried about these sorts of activities being undertaken by Customs officers in the search for particularly heroin, cocaine and cannabis, and also any other of these illegal substances coming into the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Minister, in his summing up, will go to some of the other issues that relate to this Bill and allay any further concerns people have about the civil liberties argument. He canvassed most of those issues in his second reading speech.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by restating my support for and admiration of the work being undertaken by the Australian Customs Service. I can see honourable members nodding in agreement. Those of us who have had the opportunity of carrying out our inquiry into the operation of the Customs Service have been greatly impressed by the dedication of the many young men and women who make up that Service. They are committed: they are committed at the barrier; they are committed at the processing level; they are committed to ensuring that the highest possible level of integrity is brought into the Customs Service. Drug seizures are one of their highest priorities, as is, of course, the speedy processing of passengers through airline terminals and the clearance of cargo, mainly at shipping destinations. This legislation will improve the operations of the Australian Customs Service. I wish it a speedy passage through this House and the Senate, and also speedy implementation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I will not delay the House very long but will make some comments on what has been put forward in the debate. I thank all members who participated and particularly the Opposition for its support of this legislation. It is unfortunate that this type of legislation is required. As was emphasised by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) during the debate, the increase in the amount of drugs being brought into Australia is of continuing concern to the Australian Customs Service. Therefore, this legislation is necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Customs Service has consulted very widely-I commend it on that-with the civil liberties groups, including the Human Rights Commission, and with members of the Opposition. Objections raised by those individuals and organisations have been taken into account and are part of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) raised the problem of the availability of sufficient female officers. A very large contingent of female officers is always available at airports. That does not present a problem. Internal body searches must be performed by a medical practitioner and when that procedure is carried out it does not involve any customs officers. Again, as I say, it is pleasing to have the full support of the Opposition; I thank all those who participated in the debate and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 is an omnibus Bill which seeks to amend or repeal a number of Acts falling within the Administrative Services portfolio. I will briefly touch on the five areas and go into one in some detail. I begin by pointing out that the five areas that are sought to be amended or repealed are the Archives Act 1983, the Naval Properties Act 1925, the Procurement of Goods, Works and Services Act 1981, the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952, the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930 and the Social Security Act 1947.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will deal first with the four less contentious areas and then come back to the one that I am sure very many Government members will be taking a keen interest in. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Free" NAMEID="HG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr Free</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the shipping one, is it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. Firstly, looking at the Archives Act 1983, as all honourable members would be aware, the Australian Archives is responsible for all records generated by Commonwealth agencies since Federation. Its purpose is to ensure the consistent and accountable management of Commonwealth records in the interests of efficiency, effectiveness and equity. I am sure all honourable members would support this point. However, in recent years there has been a move towards the introduction of user charging for services, either on a full cost recovery basis or at a commercially competitive market rate where available. In fact, in 1988-89, the Archives raised a total of $139,000 in revenue compared with a total expenditure on the Archives of $17,870,000. On a cost recovery basis, while the user charging process certainly has something to recommend it, it still has a long way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment that is proposed by this Bill is to allow the Director-General of the Archives to determine charges for discretionary services performed by the Archives. This would allow Archives sufficient flexibility to determine charges in accordance with market conditions. While agreeing with the sentiments, I am not quite sure how market conditions would be set for Archives but no doubt that can be handled. As a means of putting the Archives on a more commercial basis and imposing an economic discipline on other government agencies, this amendment makes a lot of sense and has the support of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the legislation relates to the repeal of the Naval Properties Act 1925. Again, the Opposition has no problem with this because this legislation is redundant and the repeal provides for ratifying agreements between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales governments for the transfer of Cockatoo and Snapper Islands from the New South Wales Government and part of Goat Island from the Commonwealth. Again, the Opposition has no problem with this and does not oppose this move by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The third area covered by this Bill is the repeal of the Goods, Services and Works Act 1981. Again, this Act is redundant. It provided for a 20 per cent discount of Australian tenders to give preference to Australian producers, but it has now been overtaken by a series of purchasing reforms and new preference arrangements which have applied since 1 November 1989. The Opposition does not oppose this. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area relates to the amendment of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930 and the Social Security Act 1947. Since Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services Ltd was sold on 1 July 1988 and it no longer belongs to the Commonwealth, this amendment will remove references to this company. The Opposition does not oppose this.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the fifth point in this legislation, the amendments to the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952, the Opposition has some rather different views. In fact, we intend to move an amendment to this part of the Bill. The proposal of the Government basically is to extend salaries of office for office-bearers other than the President, the Speaker and the Chairmen of Committees of both Houses-this does not affect Ministers-from the time of the dissolution of either House until the polling day.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government obviously is arguing that these office-holders should continue to get their salary of office even though the Parliament has been dissolved and members of parliament would be in full election mode and would be campaigning rather than carrying out the duties that would be expected of them as an office-holder, such as a chairman of one of the standing committees or of one of the joint committees.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition finds this rather hard to accept and we are going to move an amendment to exclude a number of these chairmen of committees because we do not believe that, in holding those offices, they have any duties once the Parliament has been dissolved and they are campaigning during an election campaign. If one looks at the list one can see that the Government has in fact increased the number of committees and the number of office-holders and has arranged for a considerable number of government members-other than Ministers or senior office-holders such as the Speaker or the President-to gain additional salaries for various responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA> It might benefit honourable members if I run through this list. The list includes not only the Chairman of Committees in both Houses but also office-holders such as the Whips and the deputy leaders-the inclusion of which would quite understandably be supported by all honourable members. But if we look down the list, we find that deputy chairmen of committees and chairmen of parliamentary committees receive allowances, some of which are quite significant.</PARA>
<PARA> The list includes the Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Accounts; the Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works; the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters; the Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority; the Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Community Affairs; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training-I have a few more pages-the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; the Chairman of the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology; the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure; and the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That covers the Senate committees. There are about eight Senate committees plus six joint committees. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the House of Representatives, which has another nine committees. I will read the list for the benefit of honourable members. We have the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs; the Standing Committee on Community Affairs; the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts; the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training; the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration; the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology; the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure; the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs; and the Standing Committee on Procedure. In fact, there is a provision for a chairman of a parliamentary committee, not otherwise specified herein, should the House decide to appoint one or more.</PARA>
<PARA> The list of the chairmen of committees adds up to a significant number of people. I am not suggesting for one second that they do not have a responsible role to play in the affairs of the Parliament; I believe that the work of the committees is very important. But one would be hard pressed to argue that, once the Parliament is dissolved, those committee chairmen have any further duties. One can see that the Speaker, Ministers or the Leader of the Opposition all have additional responsibilities even after the Parliament has been dissolved and an election has been called. In many cases, their duties can be quite onerous. I do not think one would argue that their responsibilities suddenly cease completely once the Parliament is dissolved.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that all honourable members would accept that those members of parliament who continue to have responsibilities and duties to undertake after the Parliament is dissolved should continue to receive the remuneration of office. However, we would argue very strongly that that does not apply to people such as committee chairmen. Therefore, the Opposition intends to move in the Committee stage an amendment which would, in effect, reduce the number of people who would be affected by this Bill-in other words, the people who will continue to receive the remuneration of office-and allow to remain only those who clearly have continuing responsibilities after the Parliament is dissolved.</PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to be moved by the Opposition will be in two parts. Firstly, it will seek to omit subsection 5 (3) of the Act and substitute another subsection; secondly it will seek to omit subsection 5A (3) of the Act and insert the schedule which I will detail now and which I will move in the Committee stage of the debate. In essence, we are seeking to remove chairmen of committees but not the Chairman of Committees in the Senate or the Chairman of Committees in the House of Representatives. To avoid the obvious confusion of that statement, I draw the distinction between them by saying that we seek to remove all chairmen of standing committees as opposed to the Chairman of Committees in each House-in other words, the Deputy Speaker in the House of Representatives and the Deputy President in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> But we would seek to include those office-bearers of the Opposition and others who clearly would have a continuing role during an election campaign. That list would include the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the Leader of a third Party in the House of Representatives, the Leader of a recognised non-government party of at least five members not otherwise specified herein, the Chairman of Committees in the Senate, the Chairman of Committees in the House of Representatives and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that all of those office-holders would continue to have responsibilities and duties over and above those of members of parliament, even after an election is called. Therefore, we believe it would be fair and proper that they should continue to receive their remuneration of office. However, we do not accept that the others listed, such as the chairmen of the various joint, Senate and House of Representatives standing committees, have continuing responsibilities. Therefore, we do not accept that they should continue to receive that remuneration of office.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Opposition does not oppose four out of the five clauses of this Bill, but we intend to move an amendment to the clause relating to the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill. But I must say to the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) that it is extremely unusual for the Opposition not to advise the Government of proposed Opposition amendments so that the Government can look collectively at them. I did not see the amendments that the honourable member for Wannon put forward until the debate had well and truly started. It disturbs me that a fairly complex amendment cannot be considered collectively by the Government. I know that the Opposition occasionally makes quite a fuss if it receives an hour's notice of legislation or changes to legislation, but it has come forward with an amendment which we have not had any chance to consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments involve quite a lot of complex changes to the legislation. The chairperson of the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority may well receive representations or be required to meet groups. There could well be other committees where one would need to examine closely whether the chairpersons would be active. One of my best ideas since I have been in Parliament came to me during an election campaign after the Governor-General had dissolved Parliament and before polling day. I recall someone telling me that the Government could wed the twin problems that existed in 1983 of feral animal control and unemployment and could train people in feral animal control. Today, we have a national feral animal control program because that idea came to us during an election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, if you or anyone else in the House happened to chair a parliamentary committee which was considering a major issue-which is what parliamentary committees are there for-and you receive representations and are required to talk to people about important issues, do you automatically go on to a new salary scale? Who assesses it? Without more time to think, the Government should be wary about supporting the amendments which have been put forward so belatedly by the honourable member for Wannon. All of us as members of parliament have to continue to play our role. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister was told yesterday. Obviously, the problem is on this side. I hope that the Minister will give careful consideration to the Opposition's arguments because they require more thought than we were able to give them in the time available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other items covered under the Administrative Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 include the Australian Archives, to which the honourable member for Wannon referred. Under the Archives Act 1983, the Director-General of the Archives may levy charges on Commonwealth agencies with recourse to regulations. It is clear that many areas of Australian Government need to impose an economic discipline on both the suppliers and the users of services, even within and between Commonwealth departments. The Australian Archives charges for services to other Federal agencies. It is important that a charge is made if it seems that that would promote efficiency and effectiveness in both the selling department-in this case, the Archives-and the purchasing department or other federal agency involved.</PARA>
<PARA> Agencies can lose many millions of dollars by providing services at no charge. For many years, Australia Post has been supplying services free to government departments by giving out information and doing work for organisations and agencies within government. Recently, the Government has established a pilot program in the post offices whereby post offices can receive funds from the Government to provide a wide range of services. Under countrylink, through a pilot program, post offices are able to provide services to people in a wide range of areas-for example, the Commonwealth Employment Service, social security and Medicare. There is therefore a link between a wide range of government services and the local community.</PARA>
<PARA> This is happening in Narooma, one of the places selected by the Government for the pilot program. At last, we recognise that people make inquiries at post offices and we are giving the post offices funds so that they can give information and be a link with a range of government departments-a one-stop shop. The legislation allows the Australian Archives to charge the Commonwealth agencies that use its services.</PARA>
<PARA> We are removing legislation in two respects where it is no longer necessary. The Naval Properties Act 1925, to which the honourable member for Wannon referred, provided for ratifying agreements on the transfer of Cockatoo and Scnapper Islands from New South Wales and part of Goat Island from the Commonwealth. In 1985, New South Wales granted an easement in gross to protect the Commonwealth's maritime rights, and that is no longer necessary. The Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930 and the Social Security Act 1947 are being amended where they refer to the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services, which have been sold. There is therefore no need for that reference.</PARA>
<PARA> For some time, the Government has been cleaning up legislation which is no longer necessary. In fact, quite a bit of our time is involved in getting rid of unnecessary and, in some cases, burdensome and troublesome legislation which ought not to be in place.</PARA>
<PARA> The Procurement of Goods, Works and Services Act 1981 provides a legislative basis for a preference scheme in support of the purchase of Australian goods by government authorities and a framework for centralised purchasing. That legislation seems to the Government to be no longer necessary, and I agree that there are better alternatives. Preference for Australian goods per se can encourage mediocrity. If a firm is assured of its sales, whether to the Australian Government or to anyone else, it is less stringent in terms of the quality of its service and the way in which it keeps down costs. We often found in the old sad days of protection that the domestic price of goods could be taken close to the overseas price, even with tariffs, of imported goods.</PARA>
<PARA> Blatant favouritism in the purchase of Australian goods does Australian industry no good. I hope that the new arrangements will be appropriate and that Australian industry will be allowed to prove itself by competing properly. Under the purchasing reforms and new preference arrangements which are being phased in from 1 November 1989-all this followed consultation with Australian industry-we should see better alternatives operating so that Australian goods and services compete and are bought by the Commonwealth Government because they are better.</PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation. I look forward to the speech by the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), particularly on the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The Government will oppose the amendments put forward by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), certainly in relation to chairmen of House of Representatives committees. I speak from personal experience. The honourable member for Wannon says that the work of committee chairmen does not continue after the calling of an election. As a former Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I can assure him that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wannon was a member of that Committee. He knows we released a report in January of this year. There was a great deal of interest in that report. Even during the election campaign I had to continue to act as chairman of that Committee. We had staff in Canberra who had to respond to public requests to get advice from the Chairman of the Committee. That continued right through the election campaign, but as the Chairman of that Committee my remuneration stopped at the announcement of the election. This provision is to enable people to continue to hold those positions.</PARA>
<PARA> In some ways I think the foreshadowed amendment is very sloppily drafted. It refers to senators, and my understanding is that senators are elected until 30 June, except in the case of a double dissolution. So if there is an election other than a few days before 30 June senators will continue to be remunerated as chairmen of committees because those committees continue until the end of the Senate's time. So the amendment is aimed only at members of the House of Representatives and chairmen of House of Representatives standing committees.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government instituted a system of committees in the House of Representatives, something the Opposition did not do when it was in government. We gave some power back to the Parliament by having parliamentary committees. The Opposition is trying to demean that process by saying that chairmen of House of Representatives committees are not as important as chairmen of Senate committees. We do not accept that and we will oppose the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA>As I explained during the debate on the second reading motion, the amendment would have the effect of removing from the receiving of remuneration of office all office bearers other than those listed in the attached schedule. I should respond briefly to some of the comments of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall). I would be the first to admit that when he chaired the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology there was a lot of very useful work done, and I commend him for the work he did as Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out again that the amendment is not in any way trying to demean the office of chairmen of the committees or to demean the work that is being done by committees. I am a great believer in the work that is done by committees. It has enhanced the Parliament considerably and it has allowed members other than members of the Executive to get involved in what is proposed by government and to scrutinise government. This amendment in no way denigrates that or tries to reduce the importance of it.</PARA>
<PARA> I indicate to the Minister and to the Government that the reason for the amendment is quite simply that once an election is called it is generally recognised that the work that is going to be done by the committees is minimal, and in most cases negligible. Therefore, I think the Opposition can rightly say, `We do not believe that once the Parliament has been dissolved there is any need for the remuneration of office to continue for the various committee chairmen'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once more I reiterate that, unfortunately, I think the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has been sold a pup by one of his senatorial colleagues and is here representing the other House by default, not by intent. This really is a quite bizarre amendment. From my perusal, I think it affects only the House of Representatives chairmen because the Senate committees continue. If the Opposition is going to be consistent, maybe it will move an amendment in the Senate. That would be interesting to see, but I doubt very much that it will happen because the senators cherish their committees quite closely. This amendment obviously is based in petty politics. It does not recognise the role of committee chairmen in the House of Representatives. It demeans the House of Representatives and the Government will oppose it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The explanatory memorandum presented when the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill was introduced was missing the final page. I now present a correction which has been circulated to honourable members. I also wish to advise the House that since the second reading speech was presented there have been a number of changes of which honourable members should be aware. In particular, in the Budget context the Government decided that the cost of safety and regulatory services would be phased in by 1993-94; accordingly, from that date the Commonwealth will no longer make a contribution to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) for the cost of these functions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following the Government's decision to consider Nesca House potential accommodation for AMSA, a thorough investigation of the property was undertaken and the extent of the presence of asbestos was discovered. The Government is now considering a range of options for overcoming this problem, from temporary accommodation pending the removal of asbestos from Nesca House to the provision of entirely new office space. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) for making that explanatory statement before the commencement of the Opposition's response in relation to the establishment of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). Some of the matters that he raised answer a couple of the questions that I had intended to ask of the Government in my response this afternoon, and I thank the Minister for doing that; it saves me some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition opposes the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill. We do so on what we consider to be very good grounds. I will go through those reasons as I progress through our response. I suppose the best way to approach it is to start by saying exactly what the Government is proposing in relation to the creation of AMSA. The Government will be bringing together a number of the various disparate groups that provide maritime services on behalf of the Federal Government-groups such as those involved in the coordination of maritime search and rescue services, in cooperation with State and Northern Territory search and rescue authorities, through the Federal Sea Safety Centre; those involved in the administration of the national plan to combat pollution from ships, in cooperation with the States and the Northern Territory; the implementation, application and policing of the maritime safety and pollution prevention conventions on Australian and visiting foreign flagships; the provision of coastal navigational aids; the provision of safety radio services to shipping through OTC Ltd; the setting of standards for the education, training and certification of seafarers; the operation of the seamen's engagement system, under contract to the Australian shipping industry; the operation of the Australian Register of Ships; the provision of an education and awareness program on sea safety for small craft; and the representation of Australia at the International Maritime Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these disparate groups that provide maritime services on behalf of the Federal Government, and that have been housed in various organisations over the years, will be, according to the Government's proposed legislation, put together in this one body called the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe this body is unnecessary, for some very good reasons. Over a number of years the Opposition has developed the basic philosophy that, unless very well displayed savings and advantages can be achieved by the creation of a new statutory authority, we oppose statutory authorities as a general rule. That does not mean that we oppose the creation of all new statutory authorities; it means that unless the Government can display considerable savings to taxpayers or a considerable benefit in the services that the Commonwealth provides, we do not think it is necessary to create a new body. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government is doing with this legislation is creating yet another statutory authority whose functions will go off-budget and which, whilst it will report and be responsible to the Auditor-General, will still not provide to the Parliament the degree of reporting that is necessary so that the Parliament can be fully aware of the activities of this new statutory authority that the Government proposes to set up. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some good reasons for the Opposition to oppose this legislation. We cannot see any great savings to the taxpayer in the creation of this new statutory authority; indeed, we can see some considerable increases in expenses for the industry as a result of the creation of this body. The actual creation of the body, according to the Budget which preceded the one handed down last night, was going to cost about $10.9m-that is, taxpayers would incur an expense of about $10.9m in order to establish AMSA. The original estimate for the creation of AMSA, I am led to believe, was around $7.1m. The cost has blown out from $7.1m to $10.9m, and I predict that the projected cost of $10.9m will probably run out to about $15m to $20m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his short statement just before I commenced this speech, indicated one of the reasons why that cost may blow out. He highlighted some difficulties with the accommodation for the AMSA people relating to the discovery of asbestos in the building and the obvious need to remove the asbestos and make the building habitable for the staff who will work in it. That will not be cheap; it will cost millions of dollars, I suspect, to remove all of the asbestos from the building and make the necessary changes to it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the end of the story. The discovery of asbestos in Nesca House will lead to considerable delays which will cost money, cause inconvenience, and add further to the argument that we believe that the projected costs for the creation of AMSA will blow out well and truly beyond the $10.9m that the Government has informed us it will cost. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Opposition asks, even if it is going to cost the taxpayer some money to set up this body, whether somewhere down the track there will be quite sizeable savings for the taxpayer or the industry as a result of the creation of this new body. It is a reasonable question, one might think. So we look at the detail of the legislation, the speech of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), and the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> At no stage in any of the details that have been provided to the Opposition is there a demonstrable saving to be had by either the industry or the taxpayer further down the track to justify the initial capital outlay on the creation of AMSA. Admittedly, the establishment of AMSA will ease considerably the administration of the organisation by bringing all the different groups into the one building under the one central administration. But is that in itself sufficient reason to justify the creation of AMSA? Indeed, without any cost saving projections being provided to the Opposition, we believe that those administrative advantages will not outweigh the costs to the taxpayer and to the industry in the establishment of this new body. </PARA>
<PARA> We ask ourselves certain questions. Will it save money? No, it will cost money. Will it provide a better service? That is questionable. Will it provide bigger savings somewhere further down the track that will justify the capital outlay at this stage? From our point of view, with the information with which we have been provided, there would be no sufficiently big savings down the track that would justify the capital outlay at this time. It is going to cost a considerable amount of money. We predict that it would cost in the order of $15m to $20m by the time the project is finished and established in its proposed home in Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> That raises the question: Why Newcastle? It is an interesting question to which I know the Minister for Land Transport, who is at the table and who initially brought this Bill to the House, would have some very good answers. We have to ask ourselves about the Minister's interest in the Newcastle area which he represents in this House as the honourable member for Charlton. We must look beyond just the short-term parochial gains that could be acquired by the Minister and some of his colleagues who represent that part of the world in this place. We have to look at the broader interests of the nation, the taxpayer, and the industry itself. So we ask the reasonable question: Why establish the new body, AMSA, in Newcastle and not in Canberra? Why not establish it in Canberra? At present, the bulk of these disparate organisations that provide maritime services on behalf of the Federal Government are located in Canberra. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are highly skilled staff, as my honourable colleague reminds me. They are highly skilled staff who are showing that they are not terribly keen on the move from Canberra to Newcastle. I understand, from what I have heard on the grapevine, that many of those staff will not be making the move to Newcastle, as the Government would like them to do. Redundancy payments will be considerably higher than the Government had anticipated, costing the taxpayer more. As a result of that, those highly skilled individuals will be lost to the maritime services that the Government provides, particularly in the area of maritime search and rescue operations where highly skilled people can save lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The loss of many people in the process of shifting the various organisations from Canberra to Newcastle will come at a cost, that of redundancy payments. An additional cost will be the loss of valuable, experienced staff who will no doubt go to other jobs in and around the Canberra area. Just how many of these staff are not going to make the shift from Canberra to Newcastle? Of those staff who are not going to make the shift, what level of experience and qualification are we going to lose? What will that cost the taxpayer in terms of redundancies? What will that cost the maritime search and rescue operations of AMSA in terms of lost skills and experience? I think these are legitimate questions which are not answered in any of the information that the Government has provided for us. They are questions which we can legitimately ask. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question which I asked a few moments ago is: Why Newcastle? It is Newcastle because the Minister at the table, as I mentioned earlier, comes from that district. He was the Minister responsible for the legislation initiating AMSA. We, as members of this Parliament, do our very best to represent our constituencies. We try to bring as much Government money into our electorates as possible in order to promote the economy in our area, job opportunities and the quality of life. That is a legitimate thing for individual members of Parliament to do. A Minister has to at times go beyond just considering the best interests of his electorate or the surrounding district; he has to go beyond just considering the best interests of his party colleagues and his party as a whole. He has to look at the best interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the House that the honourable member for Charlton has located the AMSA group in Newcastle primarily for his own short term parochial reasons-to make himself a little bit more popular in his own electorate, and to boost the stocks of the Labor Party in the Newcastle region, which, as we all know, need a little bit of boosting at this particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the establishment of AMSA in Newcastle is a legitimate exercise. Why not Sydney? Why not Melbourne? Why not Brisbane? Why not even Canberra? All the cities that I have just mentioned are also legitimate places for the establishment of AMSA. Melbourne is a very big shipping area. Sydney is a big shipping area. Brisbane is quite a busy shipping port. Canberra, of course, was set up for the sole purpose of being the home of Federal Government bureaucracies, Federal Government public services and Federal Government authorities. If we set up Canberra for that initial purpose, why do we suddenly change our minds and take this activity out of Canberra, at great expense to the taxpayer, and locate it in Newcastle? If we keep asking that question, we keep coming back to that point that it is for parochial reasons, and the Minister best knows that. I suggest that the taxpayer is subsidising the Minister's popularity in his electorate and that is something that most taxpayers in this country would not tolerate. Those are some reasons why we can legitimately oppose this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other questions that need to be asked. As I mentioned, the discovery of asbestos in Nesca House, which is to be the home of AMSA, has caused some considerable delays. Yet I note that in recent days the Government has been advertising in the Newcastle region for people to be employed in AMSA. One assumes that advertising positions in Newcastle could mean that the people who will fill those positions may well come from Newcastle. If we are going to be delayed because of difficulties in getting Nesca House or some alternative form of accommodation up and running and we employ these people now, will the taxpayer have to foot the bill for shifting these people temporarily from Newcastle to Canberra until such time as we can shift them back to Newcastle when Nesca House or some alternative form of accommodation is finally established and suitable for people to work in?</PARA>
<PARA> These sorts of delays are going to lead to these sorts of difficulties. These sorts of difficulties are going to add extra costs. If there is advertising in Newcastle for people to work in AMSA now, what is going to be done with them? Are they going to be left in Newcastle until everything moves from Canberra to Newcastle, or are they going to be brought to Canberra in the interim to provide services in AMSA until it can be shifted back to Newcastle when the accommodation is ready? I suggest to the Minister that the appropriate accommodation will not be ready until the middle of next year or even late next year. The cost of bringing people from Newcastle to Canberra temporarily is not inconsiderable. </PARA>
<PARA> Other questions also need to be asked. What, for example, will be done with the sea safety and marine search and rescue operations? Will two systems be set up? Will the Canberra operation continue while the shift to Newcastle is being undertaken, or will the Newcastle operation be set up in advance so that when the operation in Canberra is closed down there will not be a two-week period when there will be no marine search and rescue activities?</PARA>
<PARA> Will there be two sets of radio search and rescue systems in place at the one time, so that as one is switched off the other can immediately be switched on? If that is done, then, of course, that will increase our costs yet again. These questions are legitimate questions, I believe, and need to be answered. I look forward to the response of the Minister for Land Transport later this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the other question that needs to be asked is: What consultation was undertaken between the Government and the industry? When we spoke to people in the industry, many of them were not terribly well informed and claimed they had not been consulted on this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Consultation with the industry is a terribly important thing. Why is it important? It is important because, at the end of the day, the industry will be paying a considerably larger amount for the services that the Government provides because of this shift from Canberra to Newcastle and because of the creation of AMSA. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things the Minister highlighted in his second reading speech was that there will be a far more commercial footing established for providing services and charging for those services. If that is to be the case, if the industry is to be commercially oriented, only one group of people will end up paying for that, and that is the industry itself. What sort of consultation was undertaken between the industry and Government in the creation of AMSA, and particularly in the location of AMSA into Newcastle? Those people will ultimately pay a considerably greater amount of money than they have in the past for the establishment of this particular authority. So, those people need to know. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the costs that industry will be paying, I think, will be considerably greater than in the past. I think industry is going to be in for quite a shock. Many people in industry are concerned that because of the establishment of AMSA, the shipping industry will be paying huge increases in charges for the services that the Commonwealth provides. For example, what is going to happen with respect to light dues? Is the Government going to increase light dues considerably? From what I understand, that is going to be the case. I would suspect that light due fees will go up by 100 per cent, maybe 200 per cent over the next year or two. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen with respect to safety inspections? All commercial ships, after they have been built and before they go to sea, must be inspected by the Commonwealth to make sure that they are seaworthy. These services, I understand, have been provided free of charge in the past. Now, I understand, it is proposed that these services are to be charged out to the new shipowner for what I would suspect will be a not inconsiderable fee. It will be, I suspect, in the millions of dollars. Somewhere in the $5m to $10m range will be the cost of safety inspections which have previously been provided to the industry free of charge. One can argue that maybe the industry ought to pay, but the establishment of AMSA has become the trigger for the creation of these new charges, and as a result of that, industry is very concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen to the oil pollution levy charge? Once again, industry fears that this charge will rise dramatically. What will happen to seamen's engagement services? Will the charges increase as a result of this proposed legislation? I dare say they will. I dare say that the increase in those charges will be in the order of 100 per cent to 200 per cent because that seems to be the logical result of the creation of AMSA. The logical result will be that charges to industry will go up considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> That prospect is causing the industry a great deal of concern because the total amount of these increased charges will not be in the region of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. It is not even going to be in the few millions of dollars a year; it will be in the tens of millions of dollars a year. That cost increase has to be worn by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the industry will not take long to pass that cost increase on to the people who use its services, and many of those people who use its services are exporters. Yet again, we see this Federal Labor Government increasing the burden of our exporters, who are struggling as it is to try and compete in our world marketplace. The Government will be placing more costs on exporters, making it more difficult for those people who struggle in the world's competitive marketplace to try to get their products there at a competitive price. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, this legislation will result in more costs for the industry, which will then pass it on to exporters, and at the end of the day Australia will quite probably lose out in the export market as a result of these increased costs. So, we are going to see the costs to industry go up, and I am predicting between 100 per cent and 200 per cent. That increase will net out in the order of tens of millions of dollars a year. </PARA>
<PARA> So, it is interesting to note the possible results of the proposed legislation. It is interesting also to note that in last night's Budget Speech delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) the income received by the Commonwealth from statutory authorities is predicted to increase quite considerably, by several hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not hard to see why when one considers the creation of groups like AMSA. These groups like AMSA and other statutory authorities that the Government is now setting up, or has set up in years gone by, are being used to create off-Budget tax revenue for the Government. That is the way it seems to me and that is the way the industry views it to be. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister thinks otherwise, he will have an opportunity to say so. But, on the surface, the way it appears at the present time, with the information that has been provided to the Opposition, it certainly looks as if industry will be hit very heavily in the wallet as a result of this legislation because of the Government's desire to set this thing up in the first place and, secondly, to locate it out of Canberra and in Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which, of course, is a spin-off to this legislation is the operations of the Sea Safety Centre, or Sea Search, as it is often called. The Sea Safety Centre has been the subject of some controversy over the last couple of months, controversy relating to the search for the missing crew of the Rockin' Robin. </PARA>
<PARA> Up until the time of the Rockin' Robin going missing, I would have said that the Sea Safety Centre in Canberra had a first-rate record of providing the best possible services, doing the very best that it can to try to seek out people who have gone missing in very difficult circumstances. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is my impression of the Sea Safety Centre and, I think, the impression of most Australians. The Minister said a moment ago that he considers it still is, and I think a lot of people still think it is, but a lot of people also are asking the question: What went wrong in the search for the missing crew of the Rockin' Robin? There is considerable evidence to suggest that certain things went wrong in that search and we need to know the answers to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not unreasonable, I would have thought, for people to question the method of operation of the Sea Safety Centre in relation to the search for the Rockin' Robin. If these questions are put forward and unsatisfactory answers are provided, then people are, I think, legitimately entitled to be a little suspicious. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some suspicion in the community at the moment, particularly amongst the families and friends of the crew of the Rockin' Robin, and to date we have not had satisfactory answers. The Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), and I have asked the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, to have a full inquiry into the search for the crew of the Rockin' Robin. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has responded by announcing that a full inquiry will be undertaken, but it will be undertaken in-house by departmental officials and the investigation will be by departmental officials of departmental officials. Now, many of us who might be a little cynical about the way these things work would rather like to see a proper inquiry undertaken by the Government, but not by people from within the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> We think it is necessary that people undertaking this inquiry be people from outside the Department, people who are independent, who do not have a biased view on the matter, who are not necessarily working shoulder to shoulder on a daily basis with the people who will be under investigation. The Opposition has called for an independent inquiry into the search for the crew of the Rockin' Robin. The Government has only offered an in-house departmental inquiry, which is totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect that is totally unsatisfactory is that the Minister promised on 4 July that this in-house inquiry would be completed by the end of July and that as soon as it was ready the report would be made public. Well, if the Minister's word had been kept, the inquiry should have been finished by the end of July and immediately been made public. To this date, some three weeks after the end of July, we are yet to see one word of that inquiry made public.</PARA>
<PARA> I pose the question to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport: what has happened to that inquiry? Even though we thought it was unsatisfactory, at least it was an inquiry of sorts. Senator Collins promised to make public the results of that inquiry. He promised to do that by the end of July. It is now three weeks later. Why has he not provided us with the results of that inquiry so that we can re-establish the very good reputation that the Sea Safety Centre used to have? If it proves that there was nothing wrong with the way in which the Sea Safety Centre carried out its search for the Rockin' Robin, then no harm is done by having the inquiry. Indeed, a great deal of good is done by having the inquiry because people's confidence in the Sea Safety Centre is restored. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if it is proved as a result of the inquiry that something was wrong with the operations of the Sea Safety Centre in the search for the crew of the Rockin' Robin, then let us know about it; let us find out about it; let us make the necessary changes to operations of the Sea Safety Centre to ensure that this type of mistake does not repeat itself in the future with the possible result of loss of life. Let us get it all out in the open. Let us have a proper and independent inquiry and ensure that, if we do have a Sea Safety Centre operating, it has the full confidence of the public. If it does make mistakes, let us know about them so that we can correct them to ensure that they are not repeated in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The type of inquiry the Government has promised us, we think, is inadequate. We call upon the Government to have a full and independent inquiry into the search for the missing crew of the Rockin' Robin. In the meantime, for goodness sake, the Government should live up to what it promised to do in the early stages of July. Deliver on that promise by providing the in-house report to the public so that we can all see for ourselves exactly what happened with the search for the crew of the Rockin' Robin and so that if there is a mistake we know about it. That also, I think, is not an unreasonable thing for the Opposition to call for. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been criticised by the Government for doing this in the past, but we believe these are the proper and rightful responsibilities of oppositions to engage in. Whilst ever there are reasonable doubts being cast over the effectiveness of the operations of the Sea Safety Centre, we believe we have a responsibility to draw that to the Government's attention. We also believe the Government has a responsibility to act properly by having an independent inquiry so that we know for sure exactly what is going on with the Sea Safety Centre and so that our confidence can be re-established or, if there is a mistake in the system, so that that mistake can be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Opposition opposes this legislation for the good reason that there is no demonstrable gain for the taxpayer; that there are considerable increased costs which are going to be imposed upon the industry; and, ultimately, that those costs will trickle through to exporters. We oppose this because we do not believe that just centralising the Federal Government's activities and locating them in the one place, is necessarily going to lead to more efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> We also oppose this because we are, I think, rightfully concerned that the inquiry might be being moved from Canberra to Newcastle for purely parish-pump politics by the Minister. I know the Minister will say: `What's wrong with Newcastle? You must hate Newcastle'. It is not a matter of hating Newcastle. It is simply a matter of trying to ensure that the best use of taxpayers' money is being achieved by this Government. Where we believe that this is not being achieved, we highlight it. If the Minister has good answers to the questions, we will look forward to hearing them but, in the meantime, the Opposition will be opposing this legislation for what we believe to be very good, sound and proper reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having just sat through that confused and confusing speech by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), one harks back to the remarks made publicly by him in March-strictly to local media in this area only; not to the national media-regarding his actions as a potential Minister responsible for this matter. He did not oppose the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) at all, but said that it would probably stay in Canberra. He then has the audacity to talk about parish-pump politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore outlined a number of the functions that AMSA will pick up, and it would probably surprise most people in our community that such a variety of activities are scattered throughout the Department of Land Transport and Shipping Support, both in terms of responsibility and geography. It is extremely logical and sensible to collect those together and bring them into a single operation. It is also reasonable to accept confirmation from the honourable member for Gilmore that this will provide an ease of administration. However, according to him, that does not mean any possible savings. </PARA>
<PARA> When departments of the Commonwealth have carried out functions on behalf of industry, it has seemed to me that over the years there have been a variety of hidden costs involved which do not come out in the figures. I expect therefore that, with the introduction of AMSA, the cost to industry may well increase-not as a revenue raiser but because, for the first time, the true cost of administration will be known. So, on one hand, we have all the economic rationalists among the honourable members sitting opposite telling us about hidden subsidies and how we should be operating in a much more commercial way. They are then, at the same time, saying that they will keep all these functions buried in the Department where their true cost can never be known. </PARA>
<PARA> One suspects here that there may be some form of deal between the Opposition and some of the parties that may be responsible for the costs. They may recognise that they are being subsidised in a way that the taxpayer does not know of. If that suspicion is correct, and I think the comments of the honourable member for Gilmore confirm it, then in fact there will be a saving to the taxpayer, because those hidden costs will be taken out and transferred across to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments regarding the location of AMSA have obviously become a very moot point. If one goes back to June of last year and looks at the press release from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) announcing the initial formation of AMSA, one sees it actually specified two possible locations: Townsville and Newcastle. In other words, the Minister, at the very start of proceedings towards the formation of this organisation, indicated a coastal location. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a very good and sound reason for that, and that is to do with the expertise it requires not just now, but far into the future. The fact that AMSA is responsible for the certification of seafarers, for marine engineers and for pollution in our harbours means that the people who are experienced in that would most likely live on the coast and, in all probability, would not move from the coast. The capacity for Canberra to attract the personnel needed for the future is very limited. </PARA>
<PARA> The best location, quite frankly, is Sydney; no question of that. It has by far the greatest reservoir of seafarers, experienced marine engineers, captains, chief mates and the like. It has by far the biggest pool in Australia. But, of course, its problem is costs. So when the location was being looked at, they were looking at the coast for the sensible, logical reason that it is where the work force is likely to be and certainly is. There is one exception I would refer to and that is the Navy. Many Navy people actually prefer Canberra to the coast; but not many captains, chief mates or marine engineers prefer Canberra to the coast. So Sydney was the logical location because of its reservoir of personnel, but it also has a high cost structure involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed location that was referred to by the Minister for Finance as having potential, then confirmed by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) after the final assessments were made, was no secret. It was no surprise. There was no parish pumping; there was no need for there to be. But to chose Canberra would be unbelievable parish pumping. To put all those functions from the whole Department of Land Transport and Shipping Support into one authority and then to locate it a hundred miles from the sea would look absolutely stupid, and it would be stupid. There is no other word for it. Yet we have the audacity of this nonsense about parish pumping. I know which parish pump has been pumped in recent months, to the degree that it has dislocated and disturbed the whole process. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just heard about asbestos and what problems it is going to cause. I would like to read from a letter dated 17 August which I have received from the acting agents involved in that particular building:</PARA>
<PARA>From the beginning of our involvement with the building we were aware of the presence of asbestos in the property and were in possession of a report to the owners concerning asbestos. Owing to our previous experience with public instrumentalities it was anticipated that all asbestos would need to be removed. This factor was allowed for in our costing and our timing of the project and contrary to the recent article in the Newcastle Herald-</PARA>
<PARA>and I think also in Canberra-</PARA>
<PARA>the presence of asbestos will not adversely affect the time anticipated to refurbish Nesca House. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tax system has changed since 1985, old son. The honourable member has not noticed. I have noted with interest the decision of the Opposition to advocate a consumption tax. After 7 1/2 years in opposition, Opposition members have finally come up with at least one policy. Unfortunately for them, as I said in response to an interjection, it is five years out of date. It is not possible today to compensate taxpayers for the price impact of a consumption tax except by substantially running down the Budget surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The consumption tax arithmetic simply does not stand up. It has been reported that the Opposition is looking at a consumption tax rate of 15 per cent. For the benefit of the Opposition, the arithmetic of such a tax, if introduced in 1990-91, is that it would raise about $12.2 billion net of the existing wholesale sales tax; add 7 percentage points to the consumer price index, increasing the year average inflation rate to over 13 per cent; require outlays of $3.2 billion to compensate social security recipients; and require personal income tax cuts of $12 billion to maintain the real disposable income of taxpayers. Hence, introducing a fully compensated consumption tax at the rate of 15 per cent would reduce the Budget surplus in 1990-91 from $8 billion to around $5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last five years the cost of providing income tax cuts to compensate for the price impact of a consumption tax has increased dramatically because of the measures this Government has taken to broaden the tax base. The tax base today is much broader than it was in 1985; therefore it costs more to compensate it today than it did then. In 1985 we proposed to consumption tax that income; today we income tax it.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Opposition does not intend introducing a consumption tax which would reduce the Budget surplus. It has no intention of compensating millions of Australians for the extra sales tax burden they would face. The shadow Treasurer made it clear last May that he sees no reason to compensate anybody for the reduction in the real value of savings out of current income. The Leader of the Opposition, in an uncharacteristic burst of candour, said that some people will be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that above all else there can be no reduction in marginal tax rates other than a reduction in the top marginal tax rate-the Box Hill obsession; that is, going to each election with a tax bribe, with a policy to reduce the top marginal rate of tax paid for by taxing the income and savings of the low income areas of society. It would mean taking low and middle income earners and taxing their food, clothing and housing and giving some of those benefits, in an inequitable transfer, to high income earners who in this country enjoy-if they are incorporated-a 39 per cent corporate tax rate. The Opposition would cut the top personal rate at the expense of lower to middle income groups but in so doing would not change the savings balance one iota. Not only would it blow the inflation rate to pieces but also it would do so by reducing the Budget surplus and without changing the savings balance of the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The surge in Australia's inflation rate came from the large depreciation of the Australian dollar. It came from the once-in-15-years large fall in the value of the Australian dollar which came from the lack of competitiveness in the economy rendered by the party opposite when it was in office. We have now been squeezing inflation out of the system--</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has asked the question, and it had better wait for the answer. We have done this with the tightest general government fiscal policy in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the tightest monetary policy in the OECD and a wage outcome which brought wages in last year at half a percentage point less than the Budget forecast. In other words, we took Australian wage and salary earners through a period of demand brought about by a sharp lift in the terms of trade-a period of an almost unprecedented rise in demand-and kept wages at 6 1/2 per cent in average weekly earnings terms for the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So we have 6 1/2 per cent on wages, the tightest general government fiscal policy in the OECD and the tightest monetary policy in the OECD, and the Opposition is asking about incremental reductions in inflation. That will squeeze inflation out of the system. The economy will deflate. Obviously it will take time to get to where our trading partners are, but I might say that our trading partners' inflation rates are now modestly rising, so we will meet them at a certain point. I hope we will do better than them, but we will not do better by adding 7 percentage points to the price system; we will not do better by adding 7 per cent on to the inflation rate. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the gall to ask me about inflation when he is wandering around like someone in a powder magazine with a match finding out where he is; wandering around with a consumption tax which will add 7 per cent to inflation with not a prospect of cutting it from wages.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1985, when I proposed a consumption tax and I could not persuade the unions to cut the surge from inflation, we gave it up because we were not about to destroy our inflation rate. But apparently those opposite think that they have the right to wander around destroying the inflation rate with an unthought-out proposal to put another tax base in the system. They then have the gall to get up and ask me a question about inflation.</PARA>

In three years time we will have it at the level of the 1950s, the time when the Menzies Government first came to office 40 years ago. When we have cut the size of the public sector by such a mammoth amount why would anybody want to build another tax base into the tax system?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last two months that this Government has set about cutting government spending, those opposite have sat around dreaming up a new tax to put another tax base in the tax system. Apparently those opposite think that now, after seven years of work on our part, cutting the size of government spending back to the level of the 1950s, they should hand the political system a new tax base so that they can let their rural rump, the National Party of Australia, blow that tax base on higher government consumption on all the kinds of subsidies it has become synonymous with; that is, bankrolling the farm sector and its pet projects in the constituencies it represents.</PARA>

This policy would take money from those in the community who have saved, particularly the elderly, and those in all parts of the community who will save, and the poor will be worse off because they will need to rely upon commodities which are much more highly priced. For many people, particularly those on low incomes, there is no difference between income and savings; they are all the same-they spend the lot.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is now amongst the lowest taxed countries in the world. Figures released last week by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development show that in 1988, the year of the most recent data, only two countries had a lower tax revenue share to gross domestic product (GDP) than Australia. One was the United States of America and the other was Turkey. Some representatives from Turkey are present here today. We are now a lower taxed country than even Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Budget which I delivered last night, revenue as a share of GDP is estimated to decline for the fourth successive year to 25.5 per cent in 1990-91. This compares with 26.2 per cent in 1982-83, the last year of the Fraser Government. As I said earlier, when we came to office the top marginal rate was 60 per cent, today it is 47 per cent; the bottom rate was 30 per cent, today it is 21 per cent; the rate of tax on distributed company income was 78 per cent, today it is 47 per cent; and the rate of tax on undistributed company income has dropped from 78c to 39c.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1990-91 individual taxpayers will pay less tax than if the personal income tax scales had been indexed for inflation since 1983. That is the position in terms of the revenue base of the Commonwealth and the discipline the Government has exercised on outlays. The Government has changed the Budget balance by just on 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product while having a lower revenue share in GDP than it had when it first came to office. In other words the change in the Budget balance has been accomplished by cuts in recurrent government spending, not by lifting tax.</PARA>

<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition has more front than Mark Foy's to ask that question. In other words, the Government which was in office from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s had the Leader of the Opposition as principal adviser to its Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong, who now sits behind him. He therefore presided over the marked deterioration in Australia's external accounts which had its roots in the deterioration in the public sector's financial position in that period and which the Treasury has said has left the Australian economy with a long task of adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA> In part, page 2.52 of Statement 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA> As private sector net lending gradually declined in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the impact on the current account of the earlier boost in public sector spending and the associated deterioration in public sector saving soon emerged.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a number of questions from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has appeared before the media today discussing the fact that this Budget was not tough enough. I guess, in passing, that he is also not beyond making the odd suggestion that somehow if we have been tough anywhere at all in this Budget, we have been tough on pensioners. It is important that we set the record straight so that it is clear that the Government, which has had more commitment to pensioners than any government in the post-war period, is on track to continue meeting its commitments to pensioners, not by random changes but by a systematic process of reform that builds on the great reforms in last year's Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind all honourable members that during last year we were able to deliver the highest rate of pension in the post-war period-more than 26 per cent. For the first time in recent years we were able to remove all full-rate pensions from the taxation system and that occurs in this current financial year. We were able to put in place a set of reforms that not only look after today's pensioners but also build the basis for a proper retirement incomes policy into the twenty-first century.</PARA>
<PARA> The process of reform for a government that is serious about reform is enduring and unending. We need to continue to deal with those issues that need to be handled to ensure that we are able to continue to sustain the policies that the Treasurer has just described so well. We are concerned about the impact of particular schemes in relation to the Budget. One measure that this Budget goes to is the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which has been blowing out at an incredible rate. It took about 40 years for the cost of the scheme to get to $500m; it took another four years to get to a cost of $1 billion; without changes, that scheme would double every three or four years-a massive increase.</PARA>
<PARA> I will just make some comments about the Government's response as it affects pensions. First, it is true that within this Budget we have introduced a charge of $2.50, with a safety net of $130.00, which will be a consistent charge for beneficiaries, pensioners and all people receiving the family allowance supplement.</PARA>
<PARA> Because we have introduced that charge we have clearly seen the need for compensation. So there will be an increase of $2.50 occurring in full rate pensions at the time of that change. Together with the safety net, which begins at $130, we make it perfectly clear that the Government's intention is that pensioners should be fully protected on the one hand and, on the other hand, that those pensioners who are currently using scripts anywhere near to or below the average rates of usage will, in fact, gain from the increase. By those kind of mechanisms what we have is not an ad hoc change but a part of a significant reform which will, in the long run, save something in the order of $1 billion-mostly from structural changes unrelated to pensioners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The $130 safety net will ensure that no pensioner, married or single, pays more than $130, which is the extent of the compensation provided. We are not seeking to overcompensate, but to ensure compensation. Most pensioners, in fact, will gain from this change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, we have made changes in relation to taxation, to which I have just referred, from last year's Budget. In this Budget we address the question of the treatment of income from pensioners, particularly the question of money and bank accounts. I think honourable members opposite who are well aware of their own practices and, indeed, the practice of business will know that it is unfortunate to receive anything less than a reasonable rate of return on investment, and they certainly would not stand for it for a moment. The Leader of the Opposition did not get his Ferraris by investing money in a bank account at an interest rate of 4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the sensible policy-pursued no doubt by the Leader of the Opposition so that he could make those acquisitions-was to invest money at a higher rate of interest. So we suggest that if pensioners were to maximise their income-and we are providing the wherewithal and the advice through our financial information services; it is the first time that pensioners will be actually getting advice as to the way in which they can invest money-it would be possible for them to achieve a significant improvement in terms of return on that money, over and above the money that would be in a bank account. Certainly it would be in the order of 10 per cent. That would mean that pensioners would gain very substantially. It would also mean that there would be a slight reduction in the pension, which produces a saving. Again, that proposition is a consistent policy and a sensible policy. It builds on what was there last year and it certainly will not act to the detriment of any pensioner in Australia; quite the reverse, it will advantage pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the third major change that affects pensioners in this Budget is the matching provisions. Quite simply, they build on other changes in order to ensure the integrity of the social security system through improving the links between income security and the tax regime-in this case, particularly the use of tax file numbers, which will be required for all pensioners and beneficiaries. Again, this is a proposal which will not affect anyone who is declaring his real financial situation. We know that there are cases where people will declare one set of information to the Australian Taxation Office and another to the Department of Social Security. Without disadvantaging anyone who is acting properly and is providing comparable information to the two bodies, we are able to achieve a level of savings that will assist us in terms of the Budget and that will not disadvantage anyone who is needy.</PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget we see that, rather than being worse off, on the whole pensioners will be advantaged by a number of measures which will help this Government to keep in place a fiscal policy. This has meant that we, as a government, have been able to tackle the fundamental and underlying problems to which the Treasurer has referred.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whenever the Treasury has had to construct a public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) measure, it has always attempted to look at the State recurrent Budget positions. This year we have had even closer consultation with State treasuries by virtue of the discussion we had at the Loan Council and Premiers Conference meeting and also with the transfer of the bank accounts debits tax and subsequent discussions about adjustments to financial assistance grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasury feels that this year it has a closer handle on State Budget programs and spending than it has ever had. That leaves us in a reasonable position to make a judgment about the net call upon savings by the State sector in general and by the Commonwealth authority's borrowing program which is, of course, a specific set of numbers developed for the Loan Council and Premiers Conference meetings. It is then a simple matter as to whether the Commonwealth Budget surplus nets out all of that call by the State sector and the Commonwealth authorities program on national savings. In this Budget the Treasury estimates that it will, and that is why we have the zero in there.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House of the enormous achievement in this area. The recurrent Budget of the Commonwealth, the capital programs of the Commonwealth authorities, such as Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines Ltd, Telecom Australia and all of the other Commonwealth authorities, the State recurrent Budgets and the debts of their authorities-the electricity commissions and the water authorities-all net to zero.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a sense it seems a pity to interrupt the Treasurer's flow, but let me build on some of the points that he has been making today. Essentially, there is an argument between the Government and the Opposition about the appropriate size of Commonwealth outlays. The point that has been made over and over is that this Government has brought outlays down from around 30 per cent of gross domestic product to around 23 per cent of GDP. In that process we have not engaged in some indiscriminate across the board slashing. Rather, we have made sensitive and sensible changes to the pattern of Commonwealth outlays, in some areas requiring quite dramatic reductions and in other areas requiring quite dramatic increases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member invites me to do so, I refer to the expenditure in relation to schools. In this year's Budget we report an increase of $248m additional expenditure, which is a rise of 11.5 per cent for Australian schools. The fact that this occurs at a time of fiscal restraint is all the more remarkable. The reason why we did it is that we recognise that building the skill base of Australia is an essential part of the adjustment process ensuring that we have a more capable and a more highly skilled work force in order to accommodate the enormous challenges that Australia will have to confront in a more competitive world environment. We are not just ladling out more money; we are doing it in the context of an overall education reform process.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me confine myself to the area of schools, which of course requires us to cooperate in a detailed sense with the State governments. We have been able to reach agreement with the States in the context of the Hobart declaration on schooling about a transfer of decisions about the school system to a national basis, which will ensure that the education process is rigorous and relevant to Australia's contemporary circumstances. In other words, the education system needs to be able to respond to national imperatives, and that is what we are trying to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA> We are also keen to ensure that there is a commitment to excellence in relation to the teaching profession and students. For that reason, this Budget commits about $1m to a project on the quality of teaching, which will bring together all the parties, whether teachers or their employers, to try to build on the quality of teaching that already exists. At the same time, we will provide $1m to reward the best and the brightest of our year 12 students by providing the top 500 with a prize of $2,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA> Our actions are not just confined to those matters. Recognising that the pressure of increased retention is having consequences within our high schools, we will provide $60m over the next two years to help build and expand facilities and resources within our high schools in both the government and non-government sectors.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not just a question of looking at the best and the brightest and the students who stay on until year 12; we are concerned also about those who attend other kinds of schools and those schools that serve disadvantaged communities. We have provided a 20 per cent increase in the disadvantaged schools program, to bring the annual expenditure on that program to $52m, ensuring that it can cover half a million students within Australia and improve their opportunities. There will be a further $5m to embark on a new program to assist the learning process at the junior secondary stage in disadvantaged schools. Not content with finishing there, we are providing new and additional assistance for the integration of children with disabilities into the mainstream schooling process.</PARA>
<PARA> We also recognise that geography can provide special problems for access to quality education, particularly in terms of opportunities to complete the full 12 years of schooling. We are providing $6.8m to provide rural hostels close to high schools so that those kids who do not have daily access to a high school will be able to live near one and be cared for appropriately. They will therefore have opportunities more or less equal to those of children who live in metropolitan areas. As well, we have improved--</PARA>

It is important to recognise that during the early 1950s total expenditure on education represented just 1.3 per cent of gross national product but it now represents 5.3 per cent of GDP. One can see that, as a result of the painstaking and intelligent changes that we have made, we have been able to reduce the size of Commonwealth outlays, consistent with the demands of fiscal policy, and to apply additional resources in areas that are necessary for the recovery of this nation's economy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like all honourable members, I imagine, I was greatly disturbed to hear of the support that the PLO has given to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. It is morally reprehensible, and it is also against the interests of the PLO for it to think that it can in any way gain from supporting the aggression of Saddam Hussein. I think that I need spend little time persuading the House that it is morally wrong. As I said yesterday-there is commonality of view in the House-there is no justification for Iraq's invasion and its subsequent treatment of foreigners. As we all assert, that is immoral, illegal and contrary to all norms of civilised behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The support by the PLO for Iraq is not only morally wrong but is also a mistake. Saddam's adventures, faced as they now are with massive international opposition, will fail, and the PLO's association with Saddam Hussein will only further tarnish the Organisation's credibility. It is quite clear that the Arab world has made clear its opposition to Iraqi aggression. By a very clear majority on 8 August the Arab League condemned Iraqi aggression. It refused to recognise its annexation of Kuwait and it demanded the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces.</PARA>
<PARA> I think I would be speaking on behalf of all members of this House when I urge the PLO to come into line with its Arab brethren and to accept both the illegality and the futility of Iraq's aggression, because the consequences of its failing to do this can only damage the PLO's own interests. While we understand that individual Palestinians may have assisted Iraq in its occupation of Kuwait, we are not aware that the PLO as an organisation has yet provided any practical support to Iraq in relation to its occupation of Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has frequently expressed its belief that a settlement of the Palestinian issue is essential to overall peace in the Middle East, and I doubt that there is any reasonable person who can question that proposition. We have also said in pursuit of that proposition, which I think is unarguable, that the PLO has a role to play. While we have condemned PLO involvement in terrorism where it has occurred-as we properly should-we have been prepared up to this point to maintain a high level dialogue where in our judgment that would contribute directly and constructively to the achievement of peace. That position remains at this point.</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard some suggestion that factions of the PLO may be considering action in support of Iraq's position. Let me say quite clearly and unequivocally, without commenting on the accuracy of those reports-and again I believe that I would have the support of all members of the House in saying this-that were the PLO to undertake action, particularly terrorist action, in support of Iraq, we would immediately and very seriously reconsider our attitude towards it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only have we been carrying Gough; we have been carrying Fraser, Howard, Hewson-the lot of them. That is why the Treasury had a few well chosen words for all of those opposite in Statement 2 last night. The fact is that if the honourable member for McEwen had been a member of this chamber even for as long as I have, which goes back to 1969, she would have seen that these were definitely the golden years of change in economic--</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite happy to say that today. The speed of the fiscal change and consolidation here has been unprecedented. The changes in the tax system have been the most profound in its history. The improvement in and generosity of the social security system have produced, as I said last night, the fairest array of spending policies in the history of Federation. As to the really difficult areas of the economy-the micro-economy, the things those opposite never ever showed any interest in or touched on, such as the waterfront, airline policy, telecommunications-all of those deeply rutted problems we are now tackling. Why does the honourable member think we should eschew the term `the golden years of change'? Of course they are the golden years of change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot remember what quote the honourable member used from the May 1987 statement, but let me just say that the May 1987 statement changed fiscal policy by $4 billion in one measure. I remind the honourable member of the last attempt by the former Government-the so-called razor gang-which brought a change of $250m. The honourable member then talked about bringing home the bacon.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did, yes, before we had a very sharp lift in the terms of trade. If the honourable member picks up Statement 2 and looks at the chart which has the overlay of the terms of trade on domestic demand, she will find that every time the terms of trade have gone up, so too has domestic demand. In other words, we had a surge in demand which was unavoidable and which has led to bringing into this country imports we simply did not expect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing the honourable member will find in Statement 2 is a commentary that since the removal of exchange controls we have invested $60 billion offshore. The Treasury makes it clear in its commentary that we are now carrying that debt on the current account for a future generation to enjoy that investment. Of the $100 billion of private onshore debt, $60 billion has been incurred investing in a benefit for a future generation. So if we were not to have had that $60 billion invested onshore, our private onshore debt would be more like $40 billion, and we would have a much more manageable position on our hands. My view is that that longer term investment in Europe, North America and Asia is worth having. That is why it is there.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as to the reference in last night's Budget to the reformation of the economy, what else could it be described as being but a reformation? What else could we describe such fiscal change and structural change as being? I can only put the sarcasm in her question down to her lack of experience in the House of Representatives and to the fact that she is either a very dull observer of events or a slow learner, or both.</PARA>

I am sure he will not mind if I make some reference to the statement of the Opposition spokesman, or lack of a statement, on the environment last night. He put out a document, which some Opposition members might like to read, about Budget recognition of major environmental issues. Most of it was not even focused on the environment portfolio, mainly because the Opposition never focuses on the environment portfolio. Instead, it was focused on the primary industry portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of this wonderful statement on the environment he said, `The big issues remain inadequately addressed'. Let us look at the big issues that are inadequately addressed according to the Opposition. At a time when Federal Government outlays are being cut to the level of the 1970s, which shows this Government's commitment to the environment, what are we funding in the environment? We are funding the big issues in the environment. What are they? We never hear a word from members of the Opposition about what any of them are. There are at least seven new programs being funded in this Budget, plus all existing programs are being maintained.</PARA>
<PARA> The seven major programs that are the big issues relate to ecologically sustainable development. Is that a big issue in the environment? I would say that would be the biggest issue that faces this country in this decade. Is biodiversity a big issue? Yes. Is the establishment of an environmental protection authority a big issue? Yes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received a letter from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of last night's Budget to deliver a package of measures to stabilise Australia's foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA>I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.</PARA>
<PARA> More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places-</PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<PARA> Mr REITH (Flinders) (3.04) Last night's Budget was a disappointment-a disappointment for all those looking for some decisive leadership to address Australia's fundamental problems. It was a disappointment for those of us who agreed with this statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) during the election, `It is not a time for empty rhetoric or glib, wonderful world solutions'. It was a disappointment for those suffering from high interest rates, the young families struggling to buy their first home or the person running a small business, to name just two, who will have to continue to suffer high real interest rates. It was a disappointment for those on low and fixed incomes who will continue to see their savings robbed and their incomes eroded by stubbornly high inflation rates, much higher than those of our major trading competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget was a disappointment for the millions of Australians who must look forward to yet another year of declining real wages. It was a disappointment for the great bulk of taxpayers who, whilst they will get a few dollars by way of bracket creep back in their pockets this coming January, will see great dollops of their funds wasted in this year of excessive Commonwealth own purpose spending. It was a disappointment for the exporters, who have a major role in the future of this country and who face, in the next 12 months, very high labour market costs, very high interest rates and no substantial relief from the ramshackle indirect tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan Wood, a leading economic commentator, said in the Australian newspaper today:</PARA>
<PARA> If you didn't like Paul Keating's economic policy before this Budget, you won't like it any better today. </PARA>
<PARA>Ross Gittins summed it up very well in the Sydney Morning Herald when he described this Budget as `a no progress, no ideas Budget'. The real message of last night's Budget was continuing high inflation, continuing high interest rates, falling living standards for Australian families, further increases in Australia's already enormous foreign debt-in fact, already $124 billion in net terms-continuing abysmal productivity growth, increased unemployment-I think the achilles heel to the Treasurer's plans for the 12 months ahead as the dole queues will grow to 500 million people-and, of course, further falls in business investment. In the latest national accounts which came out yesterday we saw that business investment fell like a stone-16 per cent-in the year to 30 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> We might generously call all these things taken together the Treasurer's economic strategy. The reality is that an apt description would be a failed economic strategy for the management of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I flicked over the pages of the Budget I did so on the basis of attempting to assess whether or not it would provide some of the solutions to this country's economic problems. The conclusion I came to was that the real lasting failure of that Budget last night, the aspect on which this Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Cabinet colleagues will be judged in due course, is their inability to outline a strategy to arrest that growth in Australia's enormous foreign debt. I cannot in any sense overstate the extent of the problem that this lacklustre Government and its Treasurer have imposed on this economy as a result of that high level of debt. </PARA>
<PARA> It took us 195-odd years to accumulate a net foreign debt of about $23 billion, yet in a few short years, seven years, under this Treasurer's management we have notched up a figure of $124 billion. There has been a massive increase from about $20 billion to $124 billion. It really is nonsense for him to come in here and say, `Well, it's all the fault of some previous government'. When I sit down he will refer to the previous Government and attempt to present an excuse for his own failures. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put that astronomical figure into the context of most people's everyday life. I inform the people in the gallery today that that $124 billion represents $7,300 for every man, woman and child in this country. It means that we will all have lower living standards in the future. It means years of high interest rates as the Australian economy will have to attract capital inflows to service its debt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is costing average family households $300 a month, a huge figure, for the repayments and interest on their own homes, paying for a roof over their heads. What does that mean not just for today but also for the future of our economy and for future Budgets? It means less capacity for all the things that we have been taking for granted. It means less capacity for welfare and defence spending and less capacity for maintaining a strong economic and social presence in our region of the world, one of the key objectives that the coalition has set for this country in the year 2000. The greater the problem and the more the debt mounts up and puts strains on our economy, the more strain is placed on the social fabric of our nation. That means a harsher Australia; it means our generation will be handing on to the next generation a lower standard of living than we ourselves have enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA> This was the first Budget after an election, and it was a great opportunity for the Treasurer to bring down a tough Budget that really addressed our problems. It was nonsense for him to start off his Budget by saying that we are moving out of a period of transition. We are moving into considerably worse economic situations than those we have gone through in the last few years. In this Budget the Treasurer has not outlined a strategy for stabilising foreign debt. To get out of this debt trap-the road to Argentina, as Senator Peter Walsh described it-requires a rise in exports on a sustained basis that has not been matched in this country in the last 40 years. It is a huge task. At the national debt summit held earlier this year it was revealed that Australia needs a huge turnaround in its export versus import performance to stabilise foreign debt. Net exports will have to turn around to the tune of 3 per cent if Australia is to be given the opportunity to stabilise the growth in its foreign debt. At that summit the economists prepared a very worthwhile graph, which I seek leave to table. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The graph shows what we have done in the past in our economic performance. The document shows what we must achieve just to stabilise the foreign debt. As that sinks in, we realise the enormity of the task in front of us. As the Budget makes clear, a 2 per cent contribution by net exports to growth in gross domestic product in 1991 is predicted by the Treasurer. On his own figures, that performance is simply not good enough; it will not achieve that basic objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What does Mr Keating give us in this Budget at a time we really need a change in policy? He gives us more of the same-more pain but very little gain, very little hope as to the way in which we will address economic problems in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I turn to some of the strongest criticisms I want to make of this Budget, which are of those things not in the Budget, let me say that in some areas the Treasurer has moved in the right direction. We urged him to cut expenditure; he did not cut enough, but to the extent that he moved in the right direction he has had our support. In the days ahead there will be much talk about the Budget and the focus will be on the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and some others. The Treasurer has said how strong he has been in cutting Commonwealth own-purpose spending but we have to look at that expenditure side in the context of a 12.3 per cent increase in social security spending, an 8.6 per cent increase in health spending and a 14 per cent increase in education spending. The facts speak for themselves. The Treasurer has been very good at cutting funds to the States and everybody else but when it comes to cutting programs at the Commonwealth level his record leaves much to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> Here was an opportunity for a Budget which addressed Australia's basic economic problems. As a result of all the factional brawling going on within the Australian Labor Party (ALP) most of those decisions were deferred. The centrepiece of this Budget was to be the privatisation of airlines and perhaps of some telecommunications assets. That was to be the centrepiece, the basis upon which the Budget was framed. It was all too hard and has been put off to a meeting of some faceless people within the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> Many things should have been included in this Budget. There are solutions to this country's economic problems, many of them already well known and upon which there is much agreement within our community. The Treasurer should have used this Budget as a centrepiece for a three-year strategy of comprehensive structural reform, which necessarily involves an anti-inflation strategy as detailed in the coalition's Economic Action Plan. The Budget should have included industrial relations reforms to free up Australia's stagnant labour markets, again as outlined in the Opposition's industrial relations policy. The Treasurer's own economic advisers at the Economic Planning Advisory Council or the Industry Commission have revealed to him the tremendous potential that could be obtained if only we could free up our labour markets. They quantified that potential as $56 billion, a huge figure, if only the Government had the political will and determination to undertake major reform.</PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget there should have been telecommunications reform involving the introduction of greater competition, as explained in the coalition's communications policy. The Treasurer should have driven towards privatisation of Telecom Australia, Aussat Pty Ltd and OTC Ltd, as we on this side have urged him to do and as we announced as our policy. In this Budget there should have been major transport reform initiatives, including some for reform of the waterfront. We still have the rorts on the waterfront. The Treasurer ought to have been acting in the national interest to pursue and hasten those reforms and coastal shipping reform. The country desperately needs a much more efficient coastal shipping transport system. They are all policies for which we have given a detailed and comprehensive blueprint. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of privatisation the coalition's very detailed plans have been public for years, and the Government is still to catch up. I do not doubt that if the Treasurer could have his way he would privately recognise the importance of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of taxation reform we have bitten the bullet in the decision that we took last week in respect of a major reshaping of the Australian tax system. That ought to be undertaken, as the Treasurer knows. Five years ago, the Treasurer was a great advocate of reform of the tax system. He could not get it through the bully boys in the ideological department of the Labor Party, and that must be one of his great regrets as a Treasurer. We need to see the introduction of a goods and services tax, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and substantial cuts in personal income tax, as recently announced by the coalition. If the Treasurer took up this major reshaping of the taxation system, as we urge him to do, he would have a real chance to get into the black economy and pick off the tax cheats. </PARA>
<PARA> None of these issues has been addressed adequately, if at all, in this Budget. The Treasurer has produced only half a Budget. Half has been left unsaid, part awaiting the decisions of the Labor Party national conference. The remaining part, however, is just too hard for a divided and directionless Hawke ministry. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Treasurer to statements he has made in recent years about economic policy. In September 1987, he said, `This is the great coming of age of Australia, the golden age of economic change'. In 1987, he said, `We have acted decisively to turn the situation around; tonight I can report that Australia is winning'. In August 1988, he was going to bring home the bacon. In April 1988, he said, `That is why Labor not only claims a superior economic strategy and performance; it has proved it.' In 1989 he said, `I can report that we are much further down the road of that fundamental restructuring than we were a year ago'. Last night, to cap it off, he said, `The reformation of the economy is a continuing and at times difficult task'. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that by the end of this term Labor will have been in Government for 13 out of the last 20 years, I ask the Treasurer again how much longer the Australian people have to wait. </PARA>

It referred to increased unemployment while the Opposition has basically jeered the Government when it has talked about its employment successes, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said earlier in Question Time today that certainly on a policy basis I have had my differences with the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). But at least when he got up to make a speech he knew what he was saying. He knew what all the interlinkages were. He understood the texture of it all. He felt it all; he could say it. He might come from a different standpoint or from a different point of view, but at least he understood it. But what is this? This is police court stuff, the sort of stuff that one would expect at the Monday night branch meeting of the Liberal Party from a suburban solicitor with a modicum of police court competence. That is what we have got here. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Give us a go. Then the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) goes on to talk about `no strategy to get on with our foreign debt'. The point is that this is a declaratory statement-`no strategy to get on with our foreign debt'. It is not that which is in place is wrong or inadequate or that there is another alternative posture that the Opposition would adopt; there is a bald declaratory statement of `no strategy to get on with our foreign debt'. And I am supposed to say, `What a telling point', and repair from that sort of flurry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members should understand this point: the problem of the size of the Australian current account is 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) large. The debt stabilised at 2 per cent on the current account. We have been running an underlying basis of 6 per cent. It is 3 points large. We have changed the public sector by seven percentage points of GDP. The savings balance has shifted by twice the order of magnitude of the problem. The fact that it has not evidenced a substantial shift in the current account is that it was taken up with private investment. Why? Because there was a dearth of it for 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamentals remain as of last night-a seven percentage point shift since 1983-84 from 30 per cent to 23 per cent and lower on the public sector borrowing requirement. That is point one about the strategy which is not in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is the factor shares. Budget Paper No. 1, page 2.24, deals with the share of private non-farm corporate sector gross operating surplus, that is the profit share in the product of the private sector. In the golden years-1966-72-the figure was 31.2. Last year it was 34.4-even with the slower economy-and it was slightly lower this year. It is well above the golden mean of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Real unit labour costs which were 100 in the golden years are now 99. Real unit labour costs are down and the profit share is up. So there is a huge shift in the savings balance. The factor share is repaired, and there is a one percentage point forecast GDP drop in the current account deficit consistent with the step down to stabilisation. </PARA>
<PARA> How can the honourable member for Flinders make the claim that there is no strategy? How can he stand up and say a thing like that? Even if he said the strategy was wrong, that I would cop. If he says the strategy is wrong and that he has got a better one, I will listen. But when he gets up and says that there is no strategy, I regard him as a fool, which is basically what he is. </PARA>
<PARA> Then he goes on to talk about a great opportunity to bring down a tough Budget after an election. Apparently he does not think that all the changes on the outlay side last night were tough enough; he thinks we should have done more. But the honourable member decried falling living standards in the earlier part of his address. He decried falling living standards yet attacked every wage agreement under the accord, every one. He has watched the executive salaries in the managerial class rise not by 4 or five per cent a year but by 30, 50 and 100 per cent, and he has never said a thing about them. On what basis are we to accept his rebuke?</PARA>
<PARA> He then went on to say that we should have used this Budget to include a strategy on micro-reform in telecommunications. Why? Why should those things be announced in the Budget statement?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has had the job for a couple of months. Those opposite had the job for 30 years. In taxation relief, the Opposition feels it has bitten the bullet. The consumption tax is now five years out of place with a public sector disappearing into the first and second lowest categories of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Opposition thinks a new base in consumption should be built, basically to fulfil the Box Hill obsession to give Opposition supporters a tax cut. The Opposition would whack some poor little person who has a few savings or a little bit of income, whack them on their food and their necessities of life, all in the name of lifting national savings, when I have presented a Budget which has changed those savings by $30,000m a year. Does the Opposition not ever think about the decency or otherwise of the policies it espouses before it gets into them?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the Liberal Party always believed that in the end commodities would save us all. It always believed that. In 1977 we had the late Phil Lynch, as Minister for Manufacturing Industry, tabling charts of all the manufacturing projects in the so-called resources boom. The adjustments which should have taken place from about 1976 and 1977 onwards were deferred because of the coal phase to Japan. That hole left our manufacturing industry in jeopardy and we watched businesses close in every city in the country. We could not explain it but at the time we all knew it was bad. We only now know how bad. We have to try to rebuild the capital stock. </PARA>
<PARA> We built the capital stock back at 5 per cent each year over the last two years and we are now getting the capital stock back to its critical mass. It will take a while to get that product from it. The product cannot come from it unless domestic demand is sucking those products into Australia and keeping them here. We have got to be able to produce an exportable surplus. That is why the Government continues with this fundamental strategy: keep the public sector change in place; keep the tone on the outlays; keep the surplus in place against cyclical influences; keep a tough monetary policy; go into an election with 17 per cent undeductable interest rates for housing, 20 per cent for commercial rates, something which the Liberal party would never consider, and a wages policy which is delivering a 6 per cent wage outcome from a period of unprecedented demand. That is the strategy we have got in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable members think for a moment that strategy would stay in place if we were defeated? Does the Opposition think that if it got back that it could hold that? Does it really believe that in a growth economy it would have any restraint being shown by the trade unions like the total lack of restraint that was shown by the executive groups in the last period of demand? Of course it would not. Wages would blow out. They would blow out at such a pace it would be stunned by them. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, when the hard numbers of the natural stabilisers working through the Budget started to work against their outlays, all the bravado we hear about cutting outlays would soon disappear and we would see a return to the fiscal cowardice of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite may think that, having had a spell in opposition, they now have the right to come back and that it is their place to come back. I say to them: `Don't for a second believe you could hold the place together. Don't for a second believe that you could maintain under stress all this discipline that we have; if we go, it goes'. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders believes that in government he would preside over a flexible labour market. I suggest that the price for a flexible labour market would be interest rates of 30 per cent. Yes, they would hold wages down-with 12 or 13 per cent unemployment, too. I will give them that. But they would also wreck every business in the country and they would be out on their ear 15 months later. That is the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> So, when the honourable member gives me the Monday night branch rounds speech, delivered with all the flurry of the police court, he should understand that if he actually had the job, he would damn well die trying to hold together the discipline of it all. At night, after throwing around his cheap speeches in this place, the honourable member must go home to his little flat and pull out a novel and think, `Thank God he's in the job. Thank God it's him and not me, because at least he can run the place and hold wages together and keep the fiscal discipline there'. That is the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> Even our colleagues out there in the business community, some of whom might have a Liberal Party ticket burning a hole in their pocket, in their tiny hearts know that, in terms of keeping the show together for the long haul through the adjustment back to the kind of modern economy we should always have been, if that discipline is not held the whole show goes out the door. </PARA>
<PARA> If this debt goes supercritical, as it would under such a policy as the honourable member would be administering, what would he do then-whistle me up again, whistle up dear old Bill Kelty and the Australian Council of Trade Unions asking for a return to the accord, saying, `You had better come back because the show has fallen to bits on us'. What would he do then?</PARA>
<PARA> What would the business community do? Does it say, `We passed all those motions in the Business Council. We had all those years of restraint. We thought it was time for the coalition to come back, but what a mistake we've made'? This is the situation. Honourable members opposite could not hold the system together for five minutes. Members of the Liberal front bench engage in high school debates about which brand of right wing dogma is more saleable in this particular year than the last. That is all they have, but in terms of the real world, the economy, they do not have a clue. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech of the honourable member for Flinders confirms that. He had a chance to stand up and say that he brought down the first alternative Budget in the new Parliament. He is the shadow Treasurer. He has been given a chance over other more competent people. He could have outlined a strategy. Instead, he made cheap declaratory statements-for instance, `there is no strategy', `a great opportunity to bring down a tough Budget lost', `the lasting failure of the Budget', and the rest. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that is what we can expect from him for the rest of his term. We will see. I am quite happy to engage the honourable member in debate, particularly about subjects with some technical merit and strategy, but if we are just going to be treated in this period of the Parliament, like we were in the last two sitting weeks, basically to party speeches, I am afraid the common wheel will not be advanced that much. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, if the honourable member believes that his comments about the Budget we brought down last night amount to what might be termed a `knock-down' speech, he has a long way to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, there are many things about Question Time in this House that I guess all honourable members like, but one thing I like about Question Time in the House is the affectionate way in which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) always finds himself able to refer to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of my speech, I would like to say something about the Treasurer's selective use of the economic and political history of this country. Before I come to that, I would like to say a number of things about the strategy of last night's Budget. I would like to tell the Treasurer where the Opposition believes the Government's political and economic management strategy for the current Parliament has already gone hopelessly off the rails, and in the course of my remarks I would like to say something to the Treasurer about the alternative economic strategy that the Opposition does have in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer invited members of the Opposition to explain why last night's Budget Speech should have contained a program of micro-economic reform. I will tell honourable members why it should have contained a program of micro-economic reform-because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) all said it was going to contain a program of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> All three of them started to say that after the last election. It was only when the bully boys at the Australian Labor Party National Conference said, `You cannot announce a policy change in the Budget without first coming and getting our permission', that it went right off the rails. </PARA>
<PARA> In reality, the Budget presented last night should have been cancelled because one of the major elements of that Budget, in other words, the micro-economic reform program, simply was not ready. The Treasurer, more than anybody else in the Labor Party, knows that a Budget must contain not only economic credibility, economic consistency and economic substance; it also requires a political context. </PARA>
<PARA> The political context of the Budget presented last night, the aspect that was to give last night's Budget a lustre and a quality that it manifestly did not have, was missing. Every commentator around the country has nailed that point today. Even Ross Gittins, who once formed the front row of the adoring audience of the Treasurer's supporters in the financial press, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The sad truth is that Mr Keating's great days are behind him. He no longer has the strength to push the Budget where he knows it ought to go. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that I am objective enough and have an intellectual enough grasp of the economic debate in Australia to say that this Treasurer has made a contribution to economic debate in this country. I have not always disagreed with this Treasurer. He will remember that in 1985, at the time of the Tax Summit, I gave him more support to introduce a broad based consumption tax than anybody in the Labor Party or the Australian Council of Trade Unions, I might say on occasion resulting in considerable difficulty and discomfort for me from my own side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not always disagreed with the Treasurer and, therefore, when he seeks to engage the Opposition in debate, he ought to remember that when he sneers at his opponents, he must do so with totally clean hands. If we are going to be reminded about past Governments, perhaps we could remind the Treasurer about past Oppositions. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we could remind him that whenever the Fraser Government tried to cut welfare spending, whenever we did cut welfare spending, we were always subjected to a vicious scare campaign by the Labor Party. We ought to remind him that when the then Senator Chaney, as Minister for Social Security in the Fraser Government, proposed an income deprivation measure very similar to that announced last night in the Budget Speech, the Labor Party, including the honourable member for Blaxland, the present Treasurer, ran a scare campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members on the other side of the House ought to be reminded that whenever we tried to bring about structural change, for example by introducing the crude oil pricing policy, they ran a scare campaign. At the time the current Treasurer said it was like having a branch of the Tax Office at every petrol bowser. That was one of his famous comments. </PARA>
<PARA> Government members ought to be reminded of the scare campaign they conducted whenever we cut expenditure in Budgets. The Treasurer in particular ought to be reminded that in January 1983, when I, as Treasurer, announced the entry of foreign banks, he said that we were handing the control of the nation over to the foreign moneylenders. The Treasurer does not like to be reminded of those things. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give this man credit when he does something good. We have reached such a perilous economic state in this country that there is no longer any time for mindless point scoring between the two sides of politics. We have our legitimate differences, but let us in this new Parliament engage in a decent and honest intellectual debate and let all of us recognise that drawing too much on the past, whether in reference to a previous Government or an Opposition, is all a bit irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> We can go back to the Whitlam Government; we can go back to Chifley; we can go back to Scullin; we can go back to Billy Hughes. But it is all a bit irrelevant. What really matters is that $140 billion of foreign debt. What was really absent last night was what is needed to do something about that. That, as the Treasurer knows, is a function of the gap between production and consumption, and you can close that gap in one of two ways. You can close it by lifting production-making this a more productive nation-or you can close it by cutting the guts out of consumption, which is precisely what the economic strategy of this Government is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Where we part company with this Government is that we have a committed, integrated program of micro-economic reform that will address the two fundamental weaknesses. One of those is our appallingly low productivity and the other is our parlous domestic savings. They are the two things that have to be addressed and in our proposals on the labour market, our proposals on privatisation, our proposals on the waterfront, our proposals on coastal shipping, our proposals on a broad based consumption tax, we have a strategy to address them. </PARA>
<PARA> Even those who hold a different philosophy than I do on industrial relations-and there are many in the Labor Party who certainly fall into that category, as the new honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) would be aware-will recognise that the enduring problem of this country is the problem of low productivity. Until we get a freeing-up of the clogged arteries of our transport system, until we free up our telecommunications in a genuine fashion and until we free up our cloistered, over-regulated labour markets, we are never going to get that productivity boost. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say this to the Treasurer while we are in the business of giving, I hope, constructive even if, on occasions, gratuitous advice to each other: if he really wants to engage in a logical, intellectual debate in this Parliament about alternative economic philosophies, he will put aside mindless rabbiting on about the past when, in terms of today's economic debate, we were all wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the task and the dimension of the challenge are now so great and so different from what they were in the 1950s and the 1960s when everybody, apart from a few gallant economic revolutionaries at the time, believed that protection was a good thing. At the time they believed in this rather mindless idea, as we now see it, that if you had high tariff laws, you preserved jobs when, in reality, what you did was to divert resources from valuable investment into useless investment. There were no stronger advocates of high protection than the members of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I can never remember the honourable member for Blaxland railing against protection when he sat here. I can remember the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) calling the IAC the `Industries Assassination Commission'. I can remember the attitude of every member of the front bench of the Labor Party. I remember the present Governor-General as the Leader of the Opposition railing against any kind of deregulation of the financial system. If we really want an honest, intellectual debate, what we will do is recognise that the world of 1990 is a millennium away from the world of the 1950s, 1960s and even the early 1980s, and we will engage in decent, honest, intellectual debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Those battlelines have been drawn. We have a program. We have had the guts to embrace a consumption tax. We have a commitment to industrial relations reform and, if we really have the interests of the nation at heart, let us join battle in an honest, intellectual and straightforward fashion for the benefit of the country's economic future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), as is usually the case in this place, has provided a vastly better performance than the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). But still we find him, while he is claiming that we should not invoke the ghosts of the past, claiming that in fact he was unable to bring in the massive outlays changes that he wanted to. He was unable to bring in the structural reductions in outlays that he wanted to introduce because the Labor Party set about the tactic of a scare campaign. Of course, what is he doing is admitting to his failure as one who was the hairy chested cost-cutter that he suggests we should be now. He is admitting to the failure of the previous Government to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept the point that he makes about this debate, and I accept, as he says, that we must admit that we were wrong in the past, because the changes that this Government has wrought in the last seven years would have been seen seven years ago as the solution to the problem. If we had said seven years ago, `We will cut outlays by 7 per cent', then there would have been very few people, very few economic commentators, who would not have thought that this would have been sufficient to turn around our debt situation, that it would not have been sufficient in fact to solve many of the problems we face in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> What I want to point out in the brief time that I have available is that the rhetoric of the Opposition is incredibly inconsistent and, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has pointed out, it misses all of the interconnections. The shadow Treasurer suggested that it was necessary to have an anti-inflationary policy, a strategy for attacking inflation. We then find that a consumption tax is one of the very central tenets of the Opposition's future economic policy. The outcome of that is perhaps the 6 per cent inflation we have now plus 7 per cent, which makes 13 per cent. I hardly see that as being consistent with an anti-inflationary strategy. Indeed, I hardly see that as being consistent with solving that particular aspect of our policy position. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads through the Budget statements and if one looks at the inflationary performance over the last number of years, then one will see that there has been an improvement in the situation. We are the first to admit that it is necessary to go further. The Treasurer has been one of the principal advocates of such a policy. But those decisions are not easy to make, and the sort of structure that we need to put in place an anti-inflationary strategy requires a great deal of discipline on outlays; it requires discipline in respect of wages policy; and it requires discipline in respect of monetary policy. They are all things that this Government has been able to deliver and that the Opposition has historically never been able to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, industrial relations is another tenant of the Opposition's policy for further micro-economic reform, more flexibility in the wages structure. Within the union movement there is a significant move towards more flexibility, a significant move towards restructuring the way in which awards and unions operate. Indeed, we see a plan of action and a strategy by which this can be undertaken as against the laissez faire approach of our opponents.</PARA>
<PARA> Historically, we only need to look back less than a decade to see the sort of destruction that was wrought by the proposals that are now being put forward once again by the Opposition. Honourable members decry the fact that there is not enough emphasis on micro-economic reform in this particular Budget, but it is critical that those important decisions in respect of Government business enterprises and our communications network have to be right before we make them. There is an appropriate consultation period that needs to be part of that.</PARA>
<PARA> If we want to talk about tariff structures in this country, let us remember that it is only the Whitlam Labor Government and this Labor Government that have ever reduced tariffs in this country. It is important for us to remember those things because our opponents do not have the runs on the board and they do not have the record. The honourable member for Bennelong comes in here and says, `We're going to forget about the past. What we need to talk about is the future. What are the Government's plans for the future?'. We saw some of that in the election campaign not long ago. Indeed, I read an article in yesterday's Australian Financial Review headed `Plainly speaking, we need a solution', by John Hewson. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> Before the last election the Coalition identified $3 billion of possible cuts to Commonwealth spending. </PARA>
<PARA>Yes, the cuts were identified. I have the figures here in front of me from the Economic Action Plan-a total cut of $2,708m, close enough to $3 billion. But what he neglected to say was that the same document contained new spending proposals of $2,568m. What we are seeing is about $200m of extra cuts. In this Budget we have identified a further billion dollars in cuts in a deteriorating financial situation. </PARA>
<PARA> If Opposition members are honest and if they believe that they can be the hairy-chested cutters-the people who can hold government outlays down-they have to do better than they did in the election campaign. They identified cuts in a lot of areas-from unemployment benefits to training programs-which made absolutely no sense at all; then they threw the money away by proposing to end the capital gains tax, by giving money for child-care to middle income families, and by giving a free kick by way of the family allowance to many other people who do not need it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the extent of their ability to provide fiscal restraint. That is what we can look forward to in the future, because they have not delivered. They suggested $3 billion worth of cuts and then went and spent the money. That is the degree of consistency that they have. </PARA>
<PARA> On the revenue side, their proposals are for a new tax and I presume the proposal to abolish the capital gains tax may be there, too. They are suggesting a new tax, a consumption tax-something which will be highly inflationary. They are suggesting that, perhaps, as a result of that they will be able to drop the marginal rate for wealthy people. Again, it is a set of proposals which is inconsistent with a constant and worked-out political strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at a strategy for changing the structure of our debt and, indeed, for stabilising it, one will see one of the most critical issues in economic management in this country. The Budget documents show the level of growth that can be expected over the next year as a result of net exports. It is something that is underpinned by a great deal of business investment-indeed, historically high levels of business investment over the last five years, following on from 15 years of business investment of about one per cent per annum. That result was just deplorable. Business investment will be critical. Over the last five years we have been able to obtain it. Of course, it is absolutely essential that this business investment does not go into domestic demand, so it is important that monetary policy and fiscal policy remain tight. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the current account deficit, one is interested to note that since 1959 our current account situation has only once shown a surplus. Indeed, during the 1960s and 1970s it averaged 2 per cent. During the 1980s the average figure for the current account deficit was 4 per cent of gross domestic product; we find that this year there is a projection of 4 per cent of GDP, which is below the historical average for the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> We are starting to turn around our current account situation, but it is a long-distance race and we are only on the second lap. The suggestion from Opposition members that there is a quick fix and that suddenly, given the levers of government, they can solve the problem-that they have a consistent strategy-is absurd, and does not hold water in this place. It is necessary for us to pursue a constant policy position, and we are doing that. </PARA>

It is no secret that crime is increasingly taking on an international perspective. There is no starker example of the international dimensions of crime than the drug trade. Not only is there an importation of illicit drugs but also there is the associated exportation of money from Australia to pay for this filthy merchandise. Often legitimate international business channels are used to make just such payments. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has taken significant initiatives to combat crime within Australia. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 provides for a comprehensive regime of freezing and confiscation designed to attack the very motive for crime-profit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 establishes regimes for the reporting of significant cash transactions, the reporting of suspect transactions and for the verification of identity of persons opening accounts. These measures will greatly assist law enforcement by producing criminal intelligence and creating a money trail for large amounts of cash. </PARA>
<PARA> Having established these measures domestically, the next step is to reach agreements with other nations that will facilitate international cooperation in the fight against crime. The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 provides just such a mechanism. Where Australia has a mutual assistance relationship with a foreign nation, many of these domestic remedies may be available to that other nation. Similarly, domestic remedies regarding the freezing and confiscation of assets in that country may be able to be used by Australian law enforcement agencies. This Government has actively pursued the negotiation of mutual assistance treaties with other nations and to date has concluded nine treaties, with 16 in various stages of negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> Complementary to these measures is the modernisation of Australia's extradition relationships. The Government formed a task force to negotiate modern bilateral extradition treaties or extradition arrangements. So far, treaties or arrangements have been negotiated with 26 countries, with 14 in various stages of negotiations. In 1988 the Parliament passed a modern Extradition Act. In light of the experience with the Act over the past 12 months or so, a need for some technical fine tuning of the legislation has become apparent. The Bill before the House contains those technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose to deal only briefly with the more significant of these amendments. As section 11 of the Act now stands, it is not possible to list in regulations all countries to which Australia can extradite for crimes created pursuant to multilateral treaties such as the hijacking convention and the convention for the protection of internationally protected persons. It is clearly desirable that all Australians be able to ascertain easily the crimes for which extradition can be considered and all the countries to which Australia can extradite for those crimes. The amendments to section 11 are designed to enable the regulations to comprehensively list the countries to which persons may be extradited for multilateral offences. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments streamline Australia's extradition relationship with New Zealand where a person consents to being surrendered to New Zealand. Finally, a new provision is inserted in the Extradition Act 1988 which will give police power to arrest, without warrant, a person who is about to abscond. A detailed explanation of all the amendments is set out in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>

<PARA> The amendments included in the Bill will involve no additional expenditure. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill I am introducing today is to set the legislative framework in place for Australia to ratify the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention provides a mechanism for settlement, by means of conciliation and arbitration, of investment disputes between a state party to the Convention, or any constituent subdivision or agency of that state, and investors from other States party. To this end the Convention established the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, better known as ICSID. Hence, the Convention is often referred to as the ICSID Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Convention, which is the outcome of the work of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank, was opened for signature on 18 March 1965 and entered into force on 14 October 1966. There are currently 91 parties to the Convention including nearly all Australia's major trading partners. Australia signed the Convention on 24 March 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The ratification of the Convention by Australia will be a further important step in advancing the Government's objective of developing Australia's role in international commercial dispute resolution. Honourable members will recall that in 1989 this Government introduced legislation to implement the model law on commercial arbitration, which had been developed by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). </PARA>
<PARA> The adoption of the model law was a major step towards enhancing Australia's position as a centre for international commercial arbitration. Ratification of the ICSID Convention will further enhance this position. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia already has two centres for international arbitration in Sydney and Melbourne, which have been operating for some time. The ratification of the ICSID Convention will enable Australia to build on the expertise developed in those two centres. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also significant advantages which flow from ratifying the Convention from which Australian investors could benefit. In particular, the facilities provided under the Convention for conciliation and arbitration are an appropriate means for settlement of claims by investors arising out of expropriation of private assets in overseas countries. Ratification may also help to promote foreign investment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Content of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to some of the more salient features of the Bill. The Bill will implement the ICSID Convention by amending the International Arbitration Act 1974 and the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963.</PARA>
<PARA> The International Arbitration Act currently gives effect to the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitration Awards-the so-called New York Convention-which establishes rules governing the recognition and enforcement in Australia of international arbitral awards and agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act also implements the UNCITRAL model law. The Bill will amend that Act by inserting a new part and a new schedule to that Act. Thus all Commonwealth legislation relating to international arbitration will be contained in the one Act. The Bill will amend the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act to enable effect to be given to certain privileges and immunities provisions of the Convention by extending the regulation-making power under that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives the force of law to the key provisions of the Convention. It also provides that arbitral awards will be binding and enforceable in the Supreme Courts of the States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>ICSID Convention</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the principal features of the Convention. The Convention established the Centre which incorporates an administrative council, a secretariat, a panel of arbitrators and a panel of conciliators. The administrative council comprises a representative from each contracting state. The President of the World Bank is ex-officio chairman of the council. The panels of conciliators and of arbitrators are made up of persons designated by the contracting states and by the chairman of the council. </PARA>
<PARA> The jurisdiction of the centre under the Convention extends to any legal dispute, arising directly out of an investment, between a contracting State and a national of another contracting State. No proceedings can be initiated under the Convention unless both the state and the investor have specifically agreed to accept the Centre's jurisdiction. However, once the parties have given their consent, it cannot be withdrawn unilaterally. This will enable investment disputes between a State and a foreign investor to be dealt with under the ICSID Convention if the parties agree. </PARA>
<PARA> There is provision to designate constituent subdivisions of a State party and, in the case of Australia, it is proposed to designate those Australian States that agree to such designation. The effect of designation is that a State Government involved in an investment dispute with a foreign national will be able, if the parties so agree, to avail itself of the facilities offered by the Convention. All States except Western Australia have indicated their agreement to be designated. </PARA>
<PARA> The dispute is to be settled in accordance with the rules of law chosen by the parties or, if they fail to agree, the law of the contracting state party to the dispute and any applicable rules of international law. </PARA>
<PARA> Every contracting state is required to recognise arbitral awards as binding and to enforce such awards as if they were final decisions of a domestic court. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development provides the centre with accommodation and basic services free of charge in Washington DC. Under the Convention, parties making use of the ICSID's facilities are required to bear the expenses incurred by the Centre in connection with conciliation and arbitration proceedings. Only in the event that the expenditure of the Centre cannot be met out of charges for the use of its facilities, or out of other receipts, will contracting states be required to contribute towards any excess. It is accordingly anticipated that any impact on Commonwealth expenditure will be minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Governments and Government Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill is substantially the same as the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill 1989, which was passed by this House on 4 September 1989 and which lapsed with the dissolution of the House. The title has been changed because the new Bill contains a provision to clarify the position concerning the application of Commonwealth and non-self-governing Territory laws to State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the Bill is to make clear what kinds of State and Territory laws apply to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities. In particular, it is designed to resolve longstanding uncertainties as to the extent of the Commonwealth's implied constitutional immunities from State laws and to remove problems created by a decision of the High Court in 1986 concerning section 64 of the Judiciary Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal position of the Commonwealth in relation to State legislation is at present very unclear. The Commonwealth has acted on the view-supported in a number of High Court judgments-that, because of implications in the Constitution, the Commonwealth, its servants and agents and many of its instrumentalities have extensive immunities from State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there has been longstanding uncertainty as to the scope of these immunities. For example, in 1953 in The Commonwealth v Bogle, 1953, 89 CLR 229 at pages 259-260, Mr Justice Fullagar, whose view was shared by three other justices, including the then Chief Justice, Sir Owen Dixon, said that a State Parliament `has no power over the Commonwealth' but added that the Commonwealth may become `affected' by State laws. These principles have been subjected to criticism by some eminent writers. </PARA>
<PARA> A proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to the matter of Commonwealth immunities was discussed at the 1985 Brisbane meeting of the Constitutional Convention but no agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and the States. In its final report in 1988 the Constitutional Commission recommended that no alteration should be made to the Constitution in this respect, recognising that the matter could be addressed through Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early years of Federation the Commonwealth Parliament addressed the issue of the Commonwealth's immunities in the particular area of civil liability. Interim legislation was enacted in 1902 modelled on colonial legislation which provided remedies against the Crown. This legislation was replaced, in substantially similar terms, by section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903, which is still in force. !It provides that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party, the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same, and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 64 applies only to civil proceedings to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party. In criminal proceedings under State law the legal position depends on other Commonwealth legislation and on the scope of the Commonwealth's implied immunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Until 1986 the Commonwealth acted on the view that section 64 of the Judiciary Act had a very limited effect in subjecting the Commonwealth to legislation to which it was not otherwise subject. Much Commonwealth and Territory legislation was drafted on that basis. However, the High Court's decision in The Commonwealth v Evans Deakin Industries Ltd, 1986, 161 CLR 254, means that section 64 of the Judiciary Act subjects the Commonwealth, and also Commonwealth instrumentalities, to a wide range of State and Territory legislation as if the Commonwealth were an ordinary person. Section 64 can even subject the Commonwealth to State legislation that does not bind the State, and in some cases to Commonwealth legislation that would not otherwise apply to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> This result was almost certainly not intended by the Parliament that enacted the Judiciary Act in 1903 at a time well before the burgeoning of legislation of all kinds. As a result of the Evans Deakin decision, the Commonwealth is subject to the risk of incurring unforeseeable kinds of liabilities under whatever legislation the States might enact from time to time in relation to ordinary persons. The decision in Evans Deakin would also apply to self-governing Territory legislation and to Imperial legislation still in force in Australia. In the interests of the community, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, the legal position should be clarified and those risks removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has examined various alternative solutions to the problem. One approach considered was to enact Commonwealth Acts from time to time listing by name all the State and Territory Acts and subordinate legislation and instruments that should, or should not, apply to the Commonwealth. However, that approach would be impracticable. Very substantial resources would be needed to monitor existing and new State Acts, self-governing Territory Acts and subordinate legislation-including local government legislation. There would inevitably be delays pending the enactment of the Commonwealth legislation. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth could have incurred obligations or liabilities, or rights could have accrued, where particular State laws had inappropriately applied to the Commonwealth. It would be undesirable to seek to avoid such obligations or rights by means of retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the only feasible approach is to specify in an Act some classes of State and self-governing Territory legislation-defined to include any relevant continuing Imperial legislation-that should apply to the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, and to have regulation-making powers to deal with other classes of laws and with any special problems, the regulations being subject, of course, to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance. This provides the necessary flexibility to respond quickly to new State or self-governing Territory legislation. The Bill follows this course. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to outline the main provisions of the Bill. I mention first that the Bill treats self-governing territories other than the Australian Capital Territory-that is, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island-as though they were States. The position under Australian Capital Territory laws is not affected by the Bill since those laws are either covered by section 27 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 or are ordinances made under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 that can, if necessary, be amended by the Governor-General in Council to clarify the position of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill set out exhaustively, except in relation to Australian Capital Territory laws, the extent to which the Commonwealth is to be subject to Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bill any changes in the existing position will apply only to events or circumstances occurring after the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Bill. Also, a State, Northern Territory or Norfolk Island law will be applied to the Commonwealth only if the relevant State or Territory is itself bound by that law. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 5, the Commonwealth will continue to be subject to Commonwealth and non-self-governing Territory legislation that is expressed to bind the Commonwealth or otherwise shows an intention to do so. In this respect clause 5, in providing that the Commonwealth is not bound unless the law discloses an intention to bind the Commonwealth, reproduces the general rule as recently decided by the High Court in Bropho v. Western Australia (1990) 93 ALR 207. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the following classes of Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation are applied by the Bill itself to the Commonwealth:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) legislation concerning procedure in civil litigation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) legislation codifying, modifying or extending the common law with respect to liability in tort. State legislation on contributory negligence in actions for damages for negligence is one of many examples of such laws concerning tort liability. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of laws codifying, modifying or extending the common law of tort the Bill makes an exception for provisions declared by regulations not to apply to the Commonwealth. This will enable the Commonwealth to be exempted from unforeseeable kinds of State or Territory legislation, although any accrued rights existing at the commencement of the regulations will not be affected (see clause 14 (2)). The Government will consult the governments of the States, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island concerning any proposals to make regulations to exempt the Commonwealth from laws that would otherwise be applied to the Commonwealth by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for other State, Northern Territory and Norfolk Island laws to apply to the Commonwealth if prescribed by regulations under the proposed Act. Since the contents of future legislation cannot be predicted, the Government does not consider it appropriate for legislation falling outside the listed categories to be automatically applied to the Commonwealth. The only feasible approach is to include a regulation-making power to include further State and self-governing Territory legislation. When required, regulations can be made quickly, but will still be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The regulations will be able to make appropriate modifications to the applied State and self-governing Territory provisions-see clause 6. </PARA>
<PARA> Laws applied to the Commonwealth by a provision of the Act or pursuant to a regulation would, by virtue of clause 13, apply only from the commencement of that provision or of that regulation, unless the regulation provides otherwise in accordance with sub-clause 13 (3). </PARA>
<PARA> Regulations would be made so as to apply to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth personnel the provisions of the general motor traffic laws, except in so far as they provide, for instance, for the licensing of vehicles. This will preserve the present position according to the longstanding High Court decision in Pirrie v. McFarlane (1925) 36 CLR 170. The Government does not intend that this Bill should be used as a means for the Commonwealth to avoid the operation of such laws. A similar comment applies, of course, to the application of general criminal laws to Commonwealth servants and agents. </PARA>
<PARA> Until special occupational health and safety legislation is enacted by the Commonwealth, regulations will also be made so as to apply occupational safety laws to the Commonwealth for the purpose of making the Commonwealth subject to an action in tort for damages for breach of a statutory duty. The Commonwealth will therefore continue to be civilly liable under these laws so that the practical result will be the same as in Strods v. the Commonwealth [1982] 2 NSWLR 192 where the employee succeeded in an action against the Commonwealth on the basis of section 64 of the Judiciary Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of difficulties in formulating an appropriate general description of the classes of contract laws that are to apply to the Commonwealth, the Government has decided to apply to the Commonwealth specific classes of contract laws by the regulations. Examples of laws that will be applied by regulations include sale of goods laws, the Statute of Frauds concerning the enforceability of contracts, laws with respect to unconscionable contracts and laws with respect to the frustration of contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> Regulations will also be made applying State laws to the Commonwealth for the securing of the payment of moneys payable to sub-contractors. The provisions of such a State law-the Subcontractors' Charges Act 1974, Queensland-were held by the High Court in the Evans Deakin case to have been applied to the Commonwealth by section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903. Although many of the consequences of that decision are considered by the Commonwealth to be undesirable, the particular law in question in that case is of a kind that, in general, should apply to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be consulting the States, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island to identify the various additional classes of State or Territory legislation that they would wish to see applied to the Commonwealth by the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 7 contains provisions for determining the extent to which Commonwealth servants and agents are to be subject to Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill deal with the application of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws to Commonwealth corporations. While some Commonwealth corporations such as the Australian Postal Commission share the Commonwealth's immunities from State legislation, many do not do so, especially if engaged primarily in commercial activities. However, it is often very uncertain whether a particular statutory corporation shares the Commonwealth's immunities. The present tests involve factors such as the degree of ministerial control. They are very difficult to apply. The Government believes that any Commonwealth statutory corporation should be immune from State legislation only to the extent, if any, provided by or under the legislation establishing the corporation or other legislation. However, the Bill provides that, in respect of laws existing at the commencement of the proposed Act, immunity can be given by regulations made under the Act before its commencement. Such commencement would be deferred by clause 2 (2) for one year to give time for the making of such regulations in all appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation Commission, which is, in substance, a Department of the Commonwealth, is treated under the Bill as part of the Commonwealth rather than as a statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 11 of the Bill provides in effect that, in deciding whether a Commonwealth written law applies to a State or self-governing Territory, including the Australian Capital Territory, the same rule of interpretation will apply as in deciding whether a Commonwealth written law applies to the Commonwealth itself. The rule is that the law will not apply unless it discloses an intention to bind the State or self-governing Territory. This accords with the recent High Court decision in Bropho v. Western Australia (1990) 93 ALR 207. Clause 12 contains provisions for determining the extent to which agents or servants of a State or self-governing Territory are to be subject to laws of the Commonwealth and non-self-governing territories. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 13 limits the retrospective operation of laws applied under the Act. Clause 14 confers regulation-making powers for the purposes of the Bill and contains provisions that will ensure the preservation of accrued rights and liabilities where, pursuant to regulations under the Act, laws cease to apply to the Commonwealth or other persons. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 15 of the Bill provides for complementary amendments to section 64 of the Judiciary Act. Section 64 will cease to operate in relation to rights created by a written law where the Commonwealth is not subject to the provisions of that law in accordance with the Bill or otherwise. The States will also be placed on the same footing as the Commonwealth in relation to section 64. However, section 64 will continue to apply in relation to unwritten laws-for example, the common law of tort which, in the absence of section 64, would not apply to the Commonwealth or a State because of the maxim that the Crown `can do no wrong'. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill 1990 represents a further stage in the Government's strategy to deal effectively with the illicit trade in drugs. As all honourable members are aware, this illicit trade has no regard to national boundaries; it is, by its nature, international. Effective, coordinated international action is, therefore, an essential element in combating this evil. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for this reason that the Government has over the past seven years placed the highest priority on providing and securing international cooperation in the fight against the illicit trade in drugs and organised crime which is dependent on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past seven years the Government has modernised Australia's extradition laws and negotiated and secured 28 modern extradition treaties. In this period, Australia has led the rest of the world in the development of modern arrangements for mutual assistance in criminal matters, thereby securing treaty-backed obligations to assist in criminal investigations, prosecutions, the pursuit of the international criminal money trail and the confiscation of criminally obtained assets. Further, in the international arena Australian model extradition and mutual assistance treaties form the basis of model bilateral treaties developed by the United Nations Crime Prevention Committee for adoption by the eighth United Nations Crime Congress being held in Havana. </PARA>
<PARA> On the domestic legal front the Government's Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 comprise one of the most comprehensive legislative packages for following the money trail in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's achievements have been recognised in the international community, most recently by our inclusion in the Financial Action Task Force established by the Group of Seven major economic nations to advise on the prevention of money laundering. As the International Enforcement Law Reporter stated in its September 1989 edition:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's participation-</PARA>
<PARA>in the task force-</PARA>
<PARA>is significant because it has taken a leadership role in international criminal cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA>Background to the Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It was because of our commitment to international law enforcement cooperation that Australia played a prominent role in the development of a new United Nations convention whose purpose is to ensure that the international community co-operates in the adoption of a wide range of measures aimed at stemming the illicit drug trade. Australia's ratification of this convention will achieve one of the aims of the national campaign against drug abuse, which has the support of all governments in Australia. The States have been aware of the proposed convention and of the Commonwealth's wish to become a party to it from the beginning of the drafting process in 1985, and their views were sought at each stage of the negotiation process. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation represents the first step in the process of Australia's ratification of that convention-the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances-which was signed by Australia in Vienna last February. It is the culmination of almost four years' work by member countries of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. I wish to emphasise, however, that this convention represents only one strand in the international drug strategy, which, as the international community recognises, requires a multi-disciplinary approach. Thus, the Declaration of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Vienna in June 1987 designated four areas for future action: prevention and reduction of demand; control of supply, including programs for rural development involving crop eradication and substitution; suppression of illicit trafficking; and treatment and rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Convention is, of course, directed at the illicit drug trade, it also touches upon these other important aspects of the problem of drug abuse. This, too, is consistent with the approach adopted in the national campaign against drug abuse. This campaign also takes a multi-disciplinary approach with a strong emphasis on education and prevention directed at vulnerable groups, and treatment and rehabilitation of regular users. There is a degree of misunderstanding about the effect which ratification of the Convention will have on policy in the drugs area. Contrary to some views which have been expressed, this Convention does not preclude the re-examination of policy in relation to personal use of prohibited drugs. It is open to governments, within the context of this Convention, to provide that possession which would otherwise be an offence will not be subject to criminal penalties where the possession is clearly for personal use only. Thus, the Convention specifically states that parties may, as an alternative to conviction or punishment in such cases, provide measures for the treatment, education, after-care, rehabilitation or social reintegration of the offender. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, section 17a of the Crimes Act 1914, which provides that imprisonment should be imposed as a last resort, will apply to offences created under this Bill. As a result, when the courts are considering sentences to be imposed on persons convicted of offences in relation to cultivation or production for personal use, they will be required to give preference to alternative forms of sentences which could lawfully be imposed. Such alternatives could include programs of rehabilitation, treatment and education, and the courts would need to be satisfied that none of these options is appropriate before they impose a sentence of imprisonment. Thus, sentencing options already available in the case of Commonwealth offenders enable us to take full advantage of the alternatives to sentencing proposed in article 3 of the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the obligations created under the Convention which fall within areas of Commonwealth legislative responsibility are already covered by Commonwealth legislation such as the Customs Act 1901, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Extradition Act 1988, and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. Other obligations fall within areas of State responsibility, and consultations are under way with the States on action to be taken by them to ensure that their laws are in accord with the terms of the Convention. The Commonwealth has been very much aware of the importance of not encroaching on areas of State jurisdiction in this field and fully supports the continuation of the cooperative approach to drug law enforcement with the State and Territory governments and their law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>Outline of Proposed Legislation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The principal area requiring legislation in the Commonwealth sphere relates to the need to create extraterritorial jurisdiction under article 4 of the Convention. The purpose of the jurisdictional changes envisaged by article 4 is to ensure that drug traffickers cannot escape justice by moving from one jurisdiction to another, for example, to a jurisdiction which for a valid reason is not prepared to surrender the person to the country whose laws were infringed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now outline the ways in which this Bill will extend Australia's extraterritorial jurisdiction. The first extension relates to Australian nationals who have engaged in conduct outside the reach of existing jurisdiction which would constitute an article 3 offence if it had occurred in Australia, and where extradition of such persons from Australia is not sought or, if sought, is not granted for reasons outside the scope of section 45 of the Extradition Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also establishes a second area of jurisdiction where a person who is not an Australian national has engaged in drug-related conduct outside Australia which would constitute an offence against the law of the country where it occurred and also against the law in force in an Australian State or Territory; the person is subsequently present in Australia; and Australia declines to extradite that person. Thirdly, the Bill creates jurisdiction over persons who, outside Australia, engage in conduct with the view to the commission of a drug-related offence in Australia-for example, knowingly growing a crop for subsequent marketing in Australia. The Bill also creates offences arising out of drug-related conduct on Australian aircraft and provides for the exercise of Commonwealth jurisdiction on Australian ships in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Another provision creates a Federal offence which has the effect of applying, outside Australia, State and Territory offences of conspiring or attempting, aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the carrying out of drug-related conduct which is an offence against the law of a State or Territory. </PARA>

<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the first step in the process of ratification of this most important United Nations Convention. Further action will be required by the States before ratification can take place. The Convention seeks to achieve concerted international action against those who, for their own gain and at great cost to the community, engage in illicit trafficking in drugs. The cooperative multidisciplinary approach of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse recognises the need to address the problems of addiction with compassion and to offer treatment and rehabilitation to those suffering under all forms of drug addiction. In no way can it be argued that ratification will prevent a reasoned and complete debate on the merits of the present national approach to drug abuse. The Government welcomes such a debate but remains committed, along with our State and Territory counterparts, to the type of tough and thorough measures prescribed by the Convention in respect of illicit drug trafficking. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 so as to enable Australia to ratify Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions. Protocol I is concerned with the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA> When Australia ratifies Protocol I it will, at the same time, ratify Protocol II which is concerned with the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts. However, Protocol II does not require legislative action to enable its ratification. Protocol II applies to situations of non-international armed conflicts between the armed forces of a party and organised armed groups exercising some territorial control over territory of that party. It does not apply to internal tensions, or disturbances such as riots or sporadic acts of violence. </PARA>
<PARA> The application of humanitarian principles to international conflicts is, of course, an immensely difficult problem, especially where, as under the protocols, distinctions are sought to be made between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objectives and military objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it is true that such distinctions can become blurred and indistinct, and ultimately may even cease to exist in conditions of total war, the reality remains that, in the period of 44 years during which total war has been avoided, there have been many limited wars with grave humanitarian consequences. Sadly, further such wars can be expected to occur. It is in relation to conflicts such as these that the protocols are especially capable of having an important and beneficial impact. </PARA>
<PARA> While, for its part, Australia will continue to work tirelessly to achieve world peace, it must accept that limited wars are likely to continue and take appropriate action, such as is involved in the ratification of the protocols, to promote international adherence to the humanitarian principles embodied in the Geneva Conventions and in these protocols. </PARA>
<PARA> If limited armed conflicts cannot be avoided, it is to be hoped that they will at least be conducted with some regard for the rights of civilians, and that belligerent nations will treat prisoners of war and wounded in accordance with internationally agreed principles. I note in this regard the important protections provided by the protocols for particular categories of persons such as the wounded, sick and shipwrecked, and civilian medical and religious personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that the protocols were developed after exacting work by many bodies, in particular the International Committee of the Red Cross, over an extended period from the early 1950s. Finally, a diplomatic conference convened by the Swiss Federal Council held four sessions in Geneva from 1974 to 1977 to negotiate the final texts. The Australian delegation to these conferences, which played a major and demanding role in the debates at the conferences, was led by Mr Frank Mahony, OBE, then Deputy Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The length and arduous nature of the process of development of the protocols reflects the great difficulties encountered in striking a balance between competing interests while maintaining the principle of absolute and unconditional respect for persons outside the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The frequent involvement of irregular forces in recent conflicts has made the process of obtaining support of some nations for the two protocols more difficult. Nevertheless, some 97 nations have now ratified Protocol I and 87 have ratified Protocol II. The full ramifications of Australia's becoming party to the protocols for the Australian Defence Force and for our civil defence arrangements have been exhaustively examined by the relevant authorities. That examination has revealed no reason for Australia not to proceed to ratification. Indeed, there is every reason to ratify and to encourage other nations to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the development of the protocols. I should also like to take this opportunity to make special mention of the valuable contribution of the Australian Red Cross Society in this regard. A joint Government and Australian Red Cross Society Committee has been formed to discharge our obligations under the Geneva Conventions to disseminate information. The Committee will provide a vehicle for carrying out similar activities in relation to the protocols. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the House amends the Geneva Conventions Act 1957, the principal Act, to give effect to Australia's obligations under Protocol I. I turn now to a brief examination of those clauses of the Bill dealing directly with individual articles of Protocol I. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, clause 5 of the Bill incorporates into the principal Act the `grave breaches' which, under the protocol, are required to be punished. These `grave breaches' are to be found in article 11 and in paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of article 85 of the protocol. They include such acts as physical mutilations and medical experimentation involving prisoners of war or refugees and indiscriminate attacks involving excessive loss of life in the civilian population. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 provides for a certificate under the hand of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade certifying as to any relevant matter to be taken as prima facie evidence of that matter in any prosecution for a `grave breach'. This restates the existing status of such a certificate. Clause 7 vests jurisdiction in State Supreme Courts to hear an application from a person who claims to be a prisoner of war for a declaration of his or her status. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to stress again the importance the Government places on Australia's ratification of these instruments. Despite their limitations, they do provide some measure of humanitarian protection for the victims of armed conflicts. Because the Government believes that this is a vital humanitarian law reform, it also believes that there should be bipartisan support for its passage through this Parliament. The Government therefore calls upon all parties to state their commitment to the protections afforded by the protocols and in particular to all the protections afforded to civilians caught up in the horrors of modern warfare. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 came into effect in 1984 the judiciary has recognised the seriousness of wildlife offences and has been imposing progressively heavier penalties on those convicted of illegally exporting and importing wildlife. This trend, together with the work being undertaken cooperatively by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS), the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, the Australian Customs Service, State and Federal police and State wildlife agencies, is making wildlife smuggling an increasingly risky business. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also developing through the arrangements in effect under the Con- vention on International Trade in En- dangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) an increasingly effective international cooperative effort to stem the illegal international wildlife trade. These efforts are complemented and assisted by the work of the international network of TRAFFIC-Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna In Commerce-offices. The TRAFFIC office in Australia has directly assisted the work of State and Federal agencies and is also to be commended for its work in helping to raise Australian awareness of wildlife smuggling. </PARA>
<PARA> There nevertheless remains the fact that smuggling wildlife out of Australia is potentially lucrative, and in the case of il- legal importations could sow the seeds of an environmental disaster. A court recently accepted that 10 gang gang cockatoos, 23 Major Mitchell's cockatoos and 4 musk lorikeets that a person was attempting to smuggle out of Australia had an overseas value of US$325,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a history of exotic species that have become established in the wild. Rabbits, foxes, cats, cane toads and the prickly pear have either changed parts of the Australian environment or been implicated in the demise of our native fauna. The risks to the environment of uncontrolled introduction of exotic species are clearly as great as the risks of introducing exotic diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that the penalties available to the courts are sufficient to deter those who would smuggle wildlife. Clearly a monetary penalty alone is not wholly effective. In a case brought under the Wildlife Protection Act the judge commented that, considering the seriousness of the offence, he would have considered a heavier sentence had it been available. This Bill therefore proposes that the maximum custodial penalty under the Wildlife Protection Act should be raised from five to 10 years and that the option of imposing both a monetary and custodial penalty should be available. </PARA>
<PARA> The exercise of controls on Australian international wildlife trade requires, in addition to a commitment to effect law enforcement, the efficient and effective administrative control of legitimate trade in wildlife and wildlife products. The Wildlife Protection Act sets out the circumstances under which transactions for scientific research and zoological display may occur and defines the circumstances under which private and commercial transactions may be permitted. Originally the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act did not fully take into account the range of circumstances under which private and commercial wildlife trade may occur, the various ways in which wildlife products are obtained, or the enormous differences in status and biology of the large number of species covered by the Act. The previous amendment to the Wildlife Protection Act largely addressed changes to administrative procedures that have improved operating efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of this Bill addresses changes to administrative procedures that will improve operating efficiency without compromising the protection of wildlife and the Australian environment. These changes have largely arisen from decisions made following the review of government export controls. The amendments will allow a more case specific approach to the requirements for a management program and the type of Australian wildlife and wildlife products. The changes will not affect controls on species subject to commercial utilisation like the kangaroos or species whose status could be adversely affected if levels of utilisation were not strictly controlled, like the estuarine, or saltwater, crocodile. </PARA>
<PARA> There are however a wide range of common species that are subject to small scale utilisation, often by means that have little impact on wild populations. The Bill allows a more flexible approach towards defining the need for information on the biology of the species, and the nature and extent of controls that need apply to these activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with these changes to assessing management programs is provision for approval of programs to be conditional. For example, it would be possible to set quotas or levels of harvest. Such conditions applied to the approval of kangaroo programs would enable harvesting limits to be set in accordance with a recommendation of the House of Representatives Senate Select Committee on Animal Welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes will not apply to endangered or rare species, whose protection and conservation are of special ongoing concern to this Government. To address this concern the Government has established an Endangered Species Unit within ANPWS and an Endangered Species Advisory Committee. This provides an effective framework for the involvement of non-government organisations in the conservation of endangered species. Let me say in passing that they are doing a very good job. The global loss of species is of increasing concern to the community, and the Endangered Species Unit and En- dangered Species Advisory Committee, while mainly addressing problems faced by native species, also direct their attention to Australian activities that can support conservation of endangered species in other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes will not alter the current ban on private and commercial export of live native fauna. The arguments of those in favour of allowing commercial export of live native birds have been well documented in the media. The review of government export controls that gave rise to these amendments also examined this issue. The Government has affirmed that relaxing current controls is unlikely to be effective and is not in the best interest of the species concerned. The ANPWS has provided funding for research on methods of protecting crops from bird damage as this problem is central to the arguments of those advocating commercial export of live birds. It is considered that developing a better understanding of the birds' biology and behaviour and using this knowledge to vary agricultural methods will provide long term solutions while exporting birds will not. I am pleased to note that this approach has been wholeheartedly supported by responsible animal welfare agencies such as the RSPCA. The Bill does however tighten controls on export of birds as household pets by providing for an upper limit on the number of birds that may be taken out of Australia by a person leaving to take up permanent residence overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally the Bill proposes a number of amendments to streamline administration. These include a definition of the meaning of transhipment and a means for people in areas remote from a Customs office to send wildlife products overseas. The definition of `transhipment' is required to prevent importers from using Australia as a holding area for wildlife products taken out of other countries while they arrange buyers and delivery. Other amendment will allow those who are not within contactable distance of a Customs office to export wildlife products without prior presentation of the original permit to a Customs officer. Such exporters must, however, receive the permission of the ANPWS before doing so. The other amendments concern cross-referencing of terms within the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuing loss of global biological diversity, the depletion of the ozone layer, the pollution of our atmosphere and oceans and the associated greenhouse effect is wearing away the fabric of the intricate biological web that sustains life on this planet. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 is part of a global network of legislation, with the ultimate objective to ensure that our utilisation of wildlife and ecosystems is ecologically sustainable. The amendments proposed in this Bill support that objective, give the flexibility that is essential to its effective administration, and increase its strength in deterring illegal wildlife trafficking. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill contains identical provisions to the Australian Heritage Commission Amendment Bill 1989 which was passed by the House of Representatives without opposition on 23 November 1989 and introduced into the Senate on 24 November 1989. The 1989 Bill lapsed with the dissolution of Parliament and the calling of the 1990 general election. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to implement changes to the operations of the Australian Heritage Commission as agreed by the Government following a comprehensive public review of the Commonwealth Government's role in the conservation of the national estate. As a result of the review, the Government in November 1988 reaffirmed its support for the basic principles of the Australian Heritage Commission Act and almost doubled the staff and financial resources of the Commission. It also decided on a series of amendments to the Act arising out of the review process. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of the amendments proposed in the Bill is concerned with one or more of the following matters: clarification and improvement of the Commission's operational procedures; the inclusion of powers for the Commission to administer the national estate grants program, the Commonwealth Government's principal program for funding conservation of the national estate throughout Australia; the removal of a subsection unnecessarily discriminating against Aboriginal sites; the exemption of authorities of the self-governing Territories and Australian Airlines from the requirements of the Act, in accordance with government policy; and administrative changes to clarify certain operations of the Act and correct some minor technical defects. </PARA>
<PARA> Before examining the provisions of the Bill in detail, let me first explain the history of, and the principles underlying, the Australian Heritage Commission Act and the reasons why the proposed amendments are considered essential. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Heritage Commission Act was passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1975 following a major public review conducted during 1973 and 1974 by the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate under the chairmanship of Mr Justice R. M. Hope. The principal recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry was that a Commission be established to administer national estate matters and that its enabling legislation contain provisions obliging all Commonwealth agencies to act so as to ensure maximum possible conservation of all items in the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently the original Act was amended in 1976 following a review by the new Government of then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. The amendment Act of 1976 reaffirmed the key elements of the original Act as recommended by the Hope Committee. The main amendments related to: the removal of specific powers from the Commission to advise the Government on expenditure and grants of financial assistance-the current Bill aims to restore this power; a reduction in the number of commissioners from 19 to 7; a provision to limit the Commission's power to enter Aboriginal places in the Register of the National Estate-the Bill aims to repeal this provision; the removal of permanent head powers from the Chairman of the Commission; and a provision requiring the Commission to seek the approval of the Minister before appointing committees-the Bill aims to remove that limitation. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1976 there have been a number of other changes to the Act but these have been concerned with specific administrative issues such as public service reform. They have not affected the fundamental principles of the Act. The Commission thus comprises a Chairman and up to six Commissioners with various skills and interests related to the natural, Aboriginal or historic environment. The Chairman and Commissioners are appointed on a part-time basis by the Governor-General. They are supported by a full-time secretariat of about 50 located in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's main responsibilities can be summarised as: preparing and maintaining a register of national estate places; advising the Commonwealth Minister responsible for the environment on all matters relating to the national estate; advising other Commonwealth Ministers and Government authorities on Commonwealth government proposals which might affect the national estate; and developing policies and programs for research, professional training and public information and education. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Act requires that before a Commonwealth Minister, department or authority takes any action which might significantly affect the national estate values of a registered place the Commission is informed of the proposal and given reasonable opportunity to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act also requires that no action be taken by a Commonwealth Minister, department or authority that adversely affects a place in the register, unless there is `no feasible and prudent alternative', and if there is no such alternative then all necessary measures must be taken to minimise the effects.</PARA>
<PARA> All Commonwealth departments and authorities are also required under the Act to give the Commission whatever assistance is reasonably practicable for it to carry out its functions. These responsibilities of the Commission, Commonwealth Ministers and agencies have remained unchanged since 1976. However, they were again subject to review in 1978 and 1979-this time by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, chaired by the Hon. John Hodges MP. In general, the Committee concluded that the Act and the operating procedures of the Commission were satisfactory and appropriate. All the recommendations of the Hodges Committee for amendments to the Australian Heritage Commission Act will be implemented by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1985, the then Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, the Hon. Barry Cohen, MP, announced yet another review of the Australian Heritage Commission Act. The purpose was to assess whether, after 10 years, the mechanisms were still adequate and appropriate and to recommend changes where necessary. The Minister invited public submissions from all interested parties including State and Territory governments, local government, conservation groups and development groups. Over 150 submissions were received and a two-day seminar held to discuss the review attracted over 100 participants. The report of the review, which also took into account the Hodges Committee report and previous representations made to the Government on the operations of the Act, was distributed to all interested parties in August 1986. Comments were invited before final recommendations were made about amendments to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members can readily see that the amendments proposed in this Bill have not been lightly arrived at. Since its passage by the Parliament in 1975 the Australian Heritage Commission Act has been the subject of intense public scrutiny and almost constant review by Government or the Parliament. This process has identified a number of desirable changes to the Act to improve the Australian Heritage Commission's efficiency and effectiveness. However, it has also demonstrated beyond doubt the Commission's essential ongoing role in the Commonwealth Government's efforts to conserve and protect the national estate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's achievements have been considerable. It has established a substantial database of places of national estate significance. This includes over 9,000 places entered in the Register of the National Estate and the Interim List of the Register of the National Estate. Using its database, the Commission provides advice on the national estate to a wide range of Commonwealth Ministers, departments and authorities. In 1989-90 the Commission provided such advice under section 30 of its Act on 310 occasions. In addition, the Commission's expertise on national estate matters is acknowledged by State and local government and private firms and individuals. The Commission's advice is often sought even though there is no statutory requirement. This occurred 121 times in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> Educational activities to foster understanding of the national estate have also been at the forefront of the Commission's priorities. The publication of The Heritage of Australia-the Illustrated Register of the National Estate in 1981 has been followed by individual State editions for Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. These have been significant milestones. Film co-productions such as The Land of the Lightning Brothers and the highly acclaimed Nature of Australia: Portrait of an Island Continent have also added substantially to Australians' awareness of and concern for the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Commonwealth Government's principal advisory body on matters related to the national estate, the Australian Heritage Commission has often faced a difficult task in carrying out its responsibilities. The Commission has been required to provide the Government with national estate advice on some highly controversial issues-the destruction of the Bellevue Hotel in Brisbane, the Franklin Dam and the Wet Tropics of Queensland, to name but a few. Nevertheless, its activities are not limited to such issues. Much of the Commission's most effective work is carried out in collaboration with government and the private sector, out of the public limelight. This often leads to real achievement in the conservation of the national estate-without controversy, without confrontation and without public attention or fanfare. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been recognised by the Government in considering the review of its role in the conservation of the national estate. While some legitimate concerns have been raised about the Commission's operations, these can be readily addressed through the amendments proposed in this Bill. The fundamental need for the national estate to be conserved through the continued operation of the Commission is undeniable. Community and government support for this proposition has grown even stronger since its initial articulation in the Hope report of 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not to say that there has not been some misunderstanding of the Commission's role. Indeed, I suspect that this misunderstanding, particularly regarding the effect of having a place listed in the Register of the National Estate, has been deliberately and mischievously fostered by some development interests opposed to Commonwealth Government actions to conserve the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this is the nub of the matter. People and organisations opposed to the Government's overall environmental policies often cannot or will not distinguish the basic concept of the Register of the National Estate from decisions made by government on issues involving the national estate. In fact, the only decisive power of the Australian Heritage Commission is to identify the national estate. Its other functions are advisory, educational or research oriented. The Commission has no power of intervention or proscription. It is the Government which is responsible for deciding about `feasible and prudent alternatives' to actions affecting the national estate. Such decisions are properly the role of government after it has assessed all the costs and benefits including those related to the national estate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also incorrect to claim that listing in the Register of the National Estate somehow locks up areas or forecloses options for economic and social development. There are many examples throughout Australia of listed areas being used for economically productive purposes which do not have an unacceptable impact on the heritage values of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Calls for greater ministerial control of the Commission or the inclusion of other than National Estate criteria-for example, economic significance-in the registration process are therefore particularly ill-founded. Parliament advisedly gave the Australian Heritage Commission an independent statutory role in registering places of National Estate significance and bringing them to the attention of Commonwealth Ministers and agencies. The judgments required in registration decisions are not and should not be political. They should be objective and backed by expert scientific assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that it is only through such a process that heritage values can be guaranteed of consideration alongside other values-land use, economic and so on-when government decisions are being taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the specifics of the Bill, clauses 1 and 2 deal with the short title and commencement date. Clause 3 relates to interpretation and raises a number of issues. The definition of `authority of the Commonwealth' will be amended to remove the authorities or bodies established under the laws of the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island and Australian Airlines Ltd from the requirements of the Act. This is in accordance with the Government's policy of treating the self-governing Territories as States in most respects and with its decision to make Australian Airlines more commercially competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Terms used in the proposed new part of the Act dealing with the National Estate grants programs are also defined. Definitions of the interim list and of the term `owner' as used in describing those persons that the Commission must inform before publishing a notice of intention to register a place are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 4 of the Bill will insert into the Act specific criteria against which places under consideration for entry in the Register will be measured. This will clarify the definition of the National Estate already included in the Act and will reflect procedures which have been used by the Commission for some time. Such procedures reflect the best professional practice in the fields of nature and cultural conservation in Australia and overseas. As noted, they relate specifically to National Estate significance. They do not encompass other considerations such as economics and resource use because these matters are not relevant to determining National Estate value. Such matters, of course, need to be taken into account by government when considering projects that might affect a registered place. However, they have no role in the processes of deciding what constitutes the National Estate itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 will reinstate the original wording of paragraph 7 (a) of the Act as originally passed and extend its provisions to allow the Commission to give advice on identification of the National Estate as well as its conservation, improvement and presentation. The reinstatement of subparagraphs concerning advice on expenditure and financial grants will be consistent with the Hope Committee's original recommendation and with Government's decision to transfer the administration of the National Estate grants program to the Commission. Clause 5 will also insert specific functions in the Act for the Commission to administer the National Estate grants program. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 makes it clear that the Commission may enter into contracts. The Act has no specific provision for this at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 22 (5) of the Act provides for the removal of a place from the Register. Clause 7 of the Bill will provide for the removal of part of a place from the Register. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 8 to 12 of the Bill reflect the need recognised in the review for the operational procedures of the Commission to be more `transparent' to public scrutiny. Hopefully these changes will help inform people of the Commission's role and avoid some of the misconceptions I noted earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments provide detailed procedures for the entry or removal of a place in the Register, including the notifying of owners, the provision of location maps and statements of significance, the handling of objections and clarification of the operation of the interim list. The proposed amendments also enable the Minister to direct the Commission to review particular entries in the Register to determine whether they should continue to be recorded as part of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Although objections to proposed registrations may be submitted on any grounds, the Bill makes it clear that the Commission must give prime consideration to the National Estate significance of places. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments which relate directly to the Commission's decision-making processes will enhance the timeliness of Commission decisions and will substantially increase the degree of independent and public input into the identification of the National Estate. To assist this process, the Bill provides for the appointment by the Minister of independent assessors to advise on the merit or otherwise of objections to listings. Independent assessors cannot be commissioners or anyone connected in any way with the original proposal to enter a place in the Register. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides that objections must be dealt with by the Commission within one year unless otherwise approved by the Minister. If an objection is not dealt with in this time frame, then it is deemed to have succeeded. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 also provides for the repeal of subsection 23 (5), which currently restricts the Commission's ability to enter Aboriginal sites in the Register. This subsection was introduced as an amendment in 1976 to avoid possible conflicts between decisions by the Commission on the registration of land and recommendations by land commissioners on Aboriginal land rights. The subsection is an unnecessary discrimination against Aboriginal sites and, on the experience to date, its removal will not result in the conflicts forecast in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 13 of the Bill will legitimate an existing practice whereby the Commission is normally given an opportunity to comment on proposed actions by Commonwealth Ministers and agencies that might significantly affect a registered place. The proposed amendment will require the Commission to provide comments as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 14 deals with the National Estate grants program and will transfer its administration from the Urban and Regional Development (Financial Assistance) Act to the Australian Heritage Commission Act. No major changes are proposed to the nature or administration of the program except a provision for the Minister to make grants to approved bodies directly as well as, as at present, through State and internal Territory government. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 39 of the Act includes a requirement that the Commission must obtain the approval of the Minister before entering into a contract involving the payment or receipt of an amount exceeding $50,000. Clause 15 of the Bill will increase the amount to $200,000, reflecting inflation and the growth of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 will permit the Commission to appoint committees without restriction, returning to the original 1975 wording of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 will correct technical deficiencies in public notices published prior to 20 November 1979. These deficiencies were minor in nature and the Bill will validate the notices which included them. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill reaffirms the basic principles underlying the Australian Heritage Commission Act while at the same time introducing a series of improvements to the operational procedures of the Commission. These improvements will clarify the Commission's role, make it more open and more accountable, yet retain its independence as the Commonwealth Government's principal advisory body on the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is fortunate in having a unique heritage which in large part has not been degraded or destroyed like that in some other countries. However, this means that we have an even greater responsibility to protect it for future generations. This Bill, together with previous Government initiatives to increase substantially both the staffing and financial resources of the Australian Heritage Commission, should be seen as a measure of the Commonwealth Government's determination to do so. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to various bounty Acts. The Bill's major purpose is to amend the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 to continue the computer bounty scheme for a further five years to 31 December 1995, but with some programmed changes to the bounty rate to align it with other general reductions in protection. The other amendments in this Bill to the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984, Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981, and Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Act 1990 are of a minor technical nature and are explained in greater detail in the clause notes to Schedule 1 of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed extension of the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 reflects this Government's strong commitment to encouraging the development and utilisation of computer based technologies as outlined in the Government's information industries strategy announced in September 1987. In fact, the bounty is a significant factor supporting the thrust of the strategy, which is to foster the development of internationally competitive and technologically advanced industries which pay greater attention to product research and development, innovation and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that the information industries account for some 14 per cent of world trade and are growing much faster than world trade generally. The Australian information technology market was valued at $10.8 billion in 1989 and is forecast to more than double by the early 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous bounty scheme as provided for by the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 expired on 5 July 1990. This scheme in turn succeeded the automatic data processing equipment bounty scheme introduced in 1977. The original bounty rate of 25 per cent on the value added in local production was reduced to 20 per cent in the 1986 Budget and this is the rate which has operated since then. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this historical fact of a bounty being paid on computer based equipment to demonstrate that successive Australian governments have supported, through means which have included a bounty, the development of an internationally competitive manufacturing industry and the need to improve the productivity and the competitiveness of all industry sectors by the wider application of information processing technologies. Indeed, these objectives are central to the continued bounty scheme which this Bill provides for. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty will continue to be paid to eligible producers of computer based equipment, covering mainly computers, microprocessor based controllers and regulators, modems and multiplexers, hybrid circuits, integrated circuitry, and systems software associated with eligible items. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty has been instrumental in the development of a number of industry sectors including computer manufacturers, manufacturers of engineering, medical and scientific equipment incorporating microprocessor based programmable controllers, application specific integrated circuits, hybrid circuits, and electronic funds transfer at point of sale equipment, this latter area being one in which Australia is a world leader. </PARA>
<PARA> The bountiable items are incorporated into a wide range of user applications in almost all industry sectors, including automotive, telecommunications, consumer electronics, scientific and medical, banking and finance, transport and tourism. Due to the expiry of the previous computer bounty on 5 July 1990, this Bill provides for continuation of the new bounty scheme from that date. </PARA>
<PARA> The computer bounty addresses, in particular, two key areas of the information industries strategy. The first is the need to continue Australian industry's efforts in information technology product research and development. Successful commercialised research and development in Australia provides manufacturing with an edge necessary for exploitation in a highly competitive market. The high technology nature of the information industries makes reliance on research and development (R and D) imperative to compete effectively in the major markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) in its Program Evaluation Report No. 8-the Computer Bounty Scheme, released on 22 February 1990, pointed to the high proportion of research and development undertaken by the bountiable goods sector. The sector is a strong R and D performer with an average R and D intensity-the ratio of R and D expenditure to turnover-of 9 per cent, far in excess of the manufacturing average of one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The BIE concluded that the bounty has contributed to the substantial level of R and D expenditure occurring within the sector which it assessed had increased from $13m in 1985-86 to $33m in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is recognised that Australia is at the forefront with other industrialised nations in the taking up of computer based technologies, a judgment as to whether a diffusion of the bountiable technologies to user industries is satisfactory must remain subjective. It would be impossible to attribute increased usage totally to the bounty scheme, nevertheless the Government is satisfied that the bounty has had a major positive impact. </PARA>
<PARA> The BIE's analysis has found that the sector involved in the manufacture of bountiable equipment had, on average, experienced a 25 per cent sales growth per annum since the bounty's inception. This compares with sales growth in manufacturing as a whole of around 10 per cent per annum over the same period, suggesting that the bounty has been influential in encouraging the development of new products which have sold very successfully on the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, movements in the Australian dollar have also been a factor as the sector is very sensitive to competition both here and overseas. However, in the absence of the bounty it is certain that the industry would be much smaller and less vibrant than it is today. </PARA>
<PARA> The second key area of the information industries strategy where the computer bounty plays an important role is the enhanced international integration of these industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The sector's primary orientation lies in the production of goods for niche markets rather than for the mass market. These goods, therefore, have a degree of customisation which allows production volumes to be smaller and marketing more directed in a fiercely competitive market environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The BIE's analysis shows the computer based equipment industry is an outstanding export performer. Its export propensity has averaged between 39 and 51 per cent over the past four years. This is more than double the export propensity of manufacturing as a whole, which is about 21 per cent. The sector's exports increased from some $66m in 1985-86 to $141m in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> The coverage of the bounty has been seen by some as a potentially problematic area, both in terms of its budgetary impact and perceptions about who should benefit from the bounty. Suggestions to limit eligibility have included: restrictions on the types of products eligible for bounty; excluding foreign multinationals on the basis that Australian taxpayers should not subsidise them; removing from eligibility those `screwdriver' operations where product development is not carried out in Australia, or where manufacturing activity is based only on assembly of imported built-up components; putting upper limits on bounty claims to exclude those larger operations which should not need assistance; putting lower limits on bounty claims to exclude smaller firms and thereby reduce administrative costs; and qualifying entry depending on export and/or R and D levels. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is no economic justification for such restrictions. Restricting eligibility to Australian owned firms would distort commercial decisions as many transnational subsidiaries operate no differently from their Australian counterparts and are faced with the same tariff input costs on imported components. To base eligibility on firm size would create anomalies associated with the degree of specialisation in bountiable products or the degree of in-house manufacturing. Uneconomic behaviour would most likely result as firms attempt to regain eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, administration of such restrictions would become increasingly subjective and administrative costs would increase substantially due to additional requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the rate of bounty to be adjusted under the new bounty scheme to: 17 per cent from 6 July 1990; 15 per cent from 1 July 1991; 13 per cent from 1 July 1992; 11 per cent from 1 July 1993; and 9 per cent from 1 July 1994 to 31 December 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> This phasing down of the bounty rate will maintain the relationship between the effective rate of assistance for the bountiable goods sector and that of manufacturing generally-excluding the passenger motor vehicles and textiles, clothing and footwear sectors-and takes into account the general tariff reductions program announced in the Government's 1988 May economic statement. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have previously highlighted, the computer bounty is a significant element of the Government's information industries strategy; and industry, both locally and foreign owned, closely identifies the Government's decision to continue the bounty with its commitment to the development of this important group of industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Continuation of the bounty for five years to 31 December 1995 effectively demonstrates this Government's commitment to these industries and provides a time frame for industry to adjust to the decreasing levels of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, continuation of the bounty as provided by this Bill will effectively mean that Australian manufacturers and users of computer based equipment and technologies will continue to have access to these at close to world prices, and thereby will be encouraged to continue the process of transition to increased levels of international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The cost of extending the computer bounty is estimated to be, at current prices: $37.6m in 1990-91; $38m in 1991-92; $36m in 1992-93; $34m in 1993-94; $32m in 1994-95; and $25m in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA> The other proposed amendments in the Bill have no direct financial implications. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today when I spoke on this matter I made it very clear that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) needs to be located on the coast of Australia and preferably somewhere near one of the major ports. On that basis, the selection of Newcastle as a more economic site than Sydney is a very logical and very sensible one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since that decision was made last year, a series of problems have emerged that give me some cause for concern. I referred earlier today to the remarks of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), during the recent election campaign. His comments, which were made available only locally, were to the effect that the location would be reviewed. I also read a short excerpt from a letter I received late last week from people acting on behalf of one of the organisations concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent weeks, asbestos, heritage and other matters have been put forward as reasons for delaying or reconsidering the previous Cabinet decision. I seek leave to table a letter I have received from Killen and Thomas (NSW) Pty Ltd. I add that I have never met the persons who signed the letter, but the content of it relates to developments and negotiations between the Government and interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is unusual because it does refer to figures, but I table that document because of another piece of correspondence that I have from a Mr Bob Thomson. That letter was sent to one or more estate agents in Newcastle in June of this year, soliciting locations for this Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, of course, the Properties Group of the Department of Administrative Services was negotiating with a number of people for possible locations. That particular piece of correspondence, which I also intend to seek leave to table, specifies costs, including rentals per square metre. In other words, the privacy of negotiations between the Department and possible suppliers was breached in a way that was most extraordinary and, I suspect, results from attempts by some individuals to confuse this whole development. </PARA>
<PARA> This information has been in my possession for quite some time. Until the last week or two it has not perhaps been appropriate to suggest that there may be some people in the Department who may not be acting in the interests of the Authority, or in the interests of normal commercial propriety. I seek leave to table that second communication. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), at the beginning of the debate today, indicated that the Department was negotiating for possible locations. I understand that process is taking place and I have no doubt that will resolve itself. I also accept and understand the uncertainty, confusion and difficulty in terms of careers and existing circumstances being experienced by some officers of the Department who may not wish to relocate. I sympathise with that. However, that occurs to many people in our community. Australia is a mobile society. People do move, whether they be bank employees, teachers or even politicians. So, it is a reality of life that many of us have to face from time to time. I do not believe, however, that that gives those individuals the right to attempt to circumvent the processes that are involved and I regret very much that that has been occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A similar relocation process occurred some years ago when the establishment of the first full-scale taxation office outside a capital city involved the transfer of some 330 people from Sydney. Not one of those people would now go back to Sydney, and I think that many people who transfer to Newcastle with the establishment of AMSA will be delighted at the change and will wonder why they had not moved there previously. I suspect that the fears of some, or the particular positions of some, are being used to confuse many others. </PARA>
<PARA> In totality, this legislation extracts from the Department of Transport and Communications in its various locations, both geographically and in terms of responsibility, the ingredients that make up the Australian sea safety system-matters ranging from pollution control to navigation aids and the like and, of course, the search and rescue centre. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a logical, natural development that this Authority should be established. It is in the public interest and the taxpayers' interest that the costs of administering sea safety are known, recognised and visible and not obscured in some way within various departmental structures. I have no doubt there will be a saving to the taxpayer as those costs become clear, and that in turn will put pressure on the Authority to contain its costs because the industry that will be funding its expenses will be insisting that it be accountable. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment there is a lack of accountability, mainly as a result of the diffusion of responsibilities throughout the Department. When those responsibilities are brought into one authority and made visible, I expect there will be quite severe cost pressures on the functions that are performed. In other words, it will be of benefit at both ends. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than there being a big blow-out of costs for industry, as the shadow spokesman suggested, I suspect eventually there will be a saving to industry because the costs that are being incurred will be visible and publicly exposed and therefore subject to industry pressure. At the same time, any hidden costs which may have been involved which the taxpayer has been meeting will, in fact, be removed from the taxpayers' burden. I give full credit to the Minister at the table who was responsible in the early stages for this legislation. That responsibility has now been transferred to Senator Collins and I wish Senator Collins well in the finalisation of the process. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay tribute to the Minister for Land Transport, who initiated this legislation. I take umbrage at the insult that was offered by the shadow Minister regarding the location. The location, as I mentioned earlier, was proposed by the present Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) back in June of last year as a possibility, but certainly the coastal aspect of it was very clear. I find it difficult to understand how the Opposition on one hand can oppose the legislation and yet on the other hand be supposedly concerned about public efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the legislation to the House as a very important piece of legislation and I have no doubt that in years to come it will be seen as a landmark change in the administration of sea safety in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill was presented by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). In his second reading speech the Minister stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision...to establish a maritime safety authority as a further element in the total restructuring of Australia's shipping and waterfront industries undertaken by the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's future prosperity depends on our ability to compete effectively in overseas markets, overseas markets which are themselves becoming increasingly competitive. Australia's almost total reliance on shipping for trade means that maritime regulation and Government services to shipping must be efficient, sensible and relevant. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition agrees with those sentiments but opposes the Bill. The coalition has an in-principle objection to the creation of new statutory bodies unless very good and substantial reasons have been established for their creation, including cost savings. The Government has offered no proven cost savings as a result of the creation of the proposed authority. On the contrary, establishment costs will amount to at least $10.9m, with the only demonstrated benefit being administrative ease. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has called for micro-economic reform. The Prime Minister has stated that we as a nation must get smart. We in the Opposition are quite sure that it is not smart, particularly at this stage of our economic life, to be creating a new statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has stated that the Maritime Operations Division of the Department of Transport and Communications has an excellent record. Most of the functions to be taken over by the proposed authority are currently performed by the Maritime Operations Division of the Department of Transport and Communications. The Division's current responsibility for the investigation into casualties to ships will remain with the Division and will not be transferred. </PARA>
<PARA> The functions to be transferred to the Authority include the coordination of maritime search and rescue services in cooperation with State and Northern Territory search and rescue authorities, through the Federal Sea Safety Centre, and the administration of the national plan to combat pollution from ships. </PARA>
<PARA> The implementation, application and policing of maritime safety and pollution prevention conventions on Australian and visiting foreign ships will also be transferred, as will the provision of a comprehensive network of navigational aids around Australia's coastline; the provision of safety radio services to shipping through the Overseas Telecommunications Commission; the setting of standards for the education, training and certification of seafarers; the operation of the seamen's engagement system under contract to the Australian shipping industry; the operation of the Australian register of ships; the promotion of sea safety for small craft through a public education and awareness campaign; and, lastly, the Australian representation at the International Maritime Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, the Maritime Operations Division function of investigating casualties to ships will not be transferred to the Authority but is to remain with the Department of Transport and Communications. I repeat: the Minister in his second reading speech has already stated that the functions being transferred to the Authority have all been effectively performed by the Department of Transport and Communications, and Australia has an excellent record in maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment from ships or pollution. We repeat: why create a statutory authority when the process is working to the excellent standard as stated by the Minister? Certainly, why create the authority-once again, I repeat-while Australia's economy is in somewhat of a state of despair? Why spend $10.9m on creating this new Authority?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government proposes to locate the new Authority in Newcastle. I listened to the comments from the honourable member for Newcastle very carefully and I felt that he made a good case. I believe in decentralising Federal instrumentalities as much as possible. However, we wonder why it is necessary to change anything at this stage? He suggested that Sydney was a better site than Newcastle in many respects but that it would be cheaper to establish this new Authority in Newcastle. I, personally, wonder why we have to go seaboard. I suppose that fits in with my thoughts as to why we have to create the Authority at this stage anyway, and why the Maritime Services Division cannot continue to do its job. </PARA>
<PARA> The location in Sydney, of course, would probably appeal to the present operatives, the people with the expertise at this stage. But he makes the point that over a period of years personnel get used to being relocated and decentralised and eventually they do not want to return to a capital city. I can understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wanted to make some comment about the recent public criticism of the Sea Safety Centre. I am not sure whether that criticism is warranted or not; however, it certainly exists. I would like to remind the House of the incident that has created some criticism.</PARA>
<PARA> On 8 June, the sloop Rockin' Robin sank off the coast of North Queensland in very heavy seas. An extensive search was made in the course of which the crew was sighted in an unsinkable life raft and photographed by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The life raft should have been adequate for 10 persons and, therefore, more than adequate for the crew of Rockin' Robin. The families of the crew financed a continuing search after the Sea Safety Centre called off the search. The families then gathered evidence which indicated that the Sea Safety Centre was not totally in possession of all the facts when the decision to call off the search was made. These included photographs of the crew in the life raft taken by the RAAF. Apparently, there were major inconsistencies in the information used by the Sea Safety Centre and the information gathered by the RAAF and the families. These were documented by the families and sent to the Government by the Opposition on 4 July. </PARA>
<PARA> On 4 July, the Opposition shadow Minister for shipping, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), called for a full, objective, comprehensive and independent inquiry into the conduct of the search for the Rockin' Robin. The response from the Minister responsible for shipping was to announce that an internal inquiry was under way. This did not meet Opposition criteria for independence, since the bodies which conducted the search were undertaking the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> My own personal experience in this type of inquiry-I have been very much involved in major bushfire inquiries in Victoria-is that an internal inquiry is never successful. Such inquiries never solved the problems to the same extent that a formal inquiry did with participation by people outside the organisation making an input into the inquiry. Always by far the best post mortem and best results came out of that form of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The report required by the Minister was to have been completed by the end of July and was to have been made public on completion, but so far this report has not been made public. On 11 July the Opposition shadow Minister gave the Government further information concerning a possible sighting off New Caledonia and relayed an offer of assistance from the French authorities. On 22 July, the Opposition renewed its call for an independent inquiry into the conduct of the search. On 23 July, the Opposition again called for an independent inquiry, notwithstanding the internal departmental inquiry under way. On 26 July, the Minister replied that the internal investigation was adequate, and undertook to make a formal statement when the report was released. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to criticise the performance of the Sea Safety Centre, but I really do believe very sincerely that an open aspect to the inquiry would be far preferable to the internal inquiry or, if there had to be an internal inquiry, that there should have been a second and open inquiry so the public could be informed of what actually took place. In that way, we could get the maximum result and the very best performance possible with future sea searches. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to reiterate that the Opposition opposes the Bill on the ground that we do not want to create a new statutory authority at this time or possibly at any time-but certainly not at this time when we are calling for micro-economic reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be speaking in support of this Bill to establish the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is long overdue and another welcome reform by this Government. It is part of a long process that began seven years ago and which reached another magnificent milestone with last night's Budget. This proposal will provide enormous benefits to the shipping industry and is another step in the major process of micro-economic reform embarked on by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Shortly, new initiatives will be announced in aviation and telecommunications which will follow earlier initiatives taken by the Government in the transport sphere. More rail and road policy reforms will also be unveiled. These microeconomic reforms are vital for they affect the infrastructure supports for some of our greatest industries: our ports, railways and roads. </PARA>
<PARA> We must be as efficient in providing transport and communications services as our competitors, for the cost at which these services are made available are significant factors in the overall cost structures of Australian business and, therefore, the price at which they can market their products on the domestic market and international market. I know that the Opposition is concerned about this matter as a result of the matter of public importance it presented today.</PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation are excellent examples of how the establishment of a new authority can assist the relevant industry. The creation of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority will be no less successful. Its establishment will do much the same for the shipping industry as the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation have done for aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> The authority is to be established on 1 January next year and its headquarters will be in Newcastle. It will cover all the major functions that the present Marine Operations Division of the Department of Transport and Communications undertakes, including the maintenance and provision of marine navigation aids; the combat of ship sourced oil pollution; the administration of regulatory functions relating to the safety of ships and the qualification of marine personnel; and the operation of the Federal Sea Safety Centre. The investigation of casualties to ships will not be transferred to the authority. This function requires a totally independent examination and, like its aviation counterpart, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, its investigations will be conducted separately. </PARA>
<PARA> In broad terms, the functions of the new authority are cost covered, cost recovered or provided as part of the Commonwealth's community service obligations. Its largest single function, in terms of personnel and budget, is to be the provision of navigation aids. This service is now fully cost recovered from the shipping industry through light dues. These functions are to be carried out like any other commercial business. In these circumstances it is entirely appropriate that the operation is not carried out from within the Federal bureaucracy but, rather, set in a more commercial environment. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be achieved in two ways: First, through the establishment of the authority itself, with direct lines of accountability to a board with experience in the commercial world; secondly, through the establishment of the authority in Newcastle, thereby clearly indicating to the industry that the Government wants the authority to develop a commercial, rather than a bureaucratic, culture. After all, Canberra is a lovely city but it is hardly brimming with entrepreneurs, especially outside the pornographic film industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The board of the authority will include representatives from the broad spectrum of government, community, business and industry. Representatives of the commercial sector will no doubt pay close attention to the cost of the navigation aids, and they will be aware that the industry itself will be footing the bill for them. In this sense, from an industry point of view the new arrangements will be far more satisfactory than the existing arrangements where the input of industry to the decision-making process is far less direct.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the major advantages of this legislation is that the authority will be established like a business and will be run on business lines by people with a knowledge of commercial activities. Such accountability will give the authority a much more commercial slant than currently exists in the Department of Transport and Communications. After all, public servants do not undertake their careers for commercial objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Another function which it is intended the authority will undertake is the combat of ship sourced oil pollution. This is particularly important in a world very sensitive to oil slicks and on a seaboard only too conscious of the effects of coastal pollution. Again, this service will also be fully cost recovered from the shipping industry, as it is now, through charges, but it is in a sense a general service to the community as much as to the shipping industry. The damage that can be done by ship sourced oil pollution is enormous, as we all know. It is essential that Australia is vigilant to ensure pollution does not occur in the first place but, if it does, that we have the capacity to respond quickly and effectively. This function again has been rightly transferred to the new authority where a quick response will be easier to achieve than under existing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The authority will also administer the important regulatory functions relating to the safety of ships and the qualification of marine personnel. These are essentially technical operations, but they are of vital interest to seafarers unions and shipowners. Accordingly, these functions are best administered through an authority where the industry and unions can have a direct input through the board rather than through existing bureaucratic arrangements. Such a decision is typical of the consensual approach that this Government has tried to take when making structural changes which affect workers, unions, management and industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The authority will also operate the Federal Sea Safety Centre, and this aspect of the authority will be funded through the Government's community service obligations. It will operate on a 24-hour a day service basis. As a former yacht racer-very much former, I am afraid to say; time constraints on members of Parliament, as I am sure all my colleagues here today will acknowledge and know, make it very difficult to remain a yacht racer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members opposite point out, it tends to be a rich man's sport these days. However, it was once more accessible to the lower classes of which I have been a proud member all my life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I formerly engaged in this sport, I am very much aware of the value of the Sea Safety Centre. A couple of years ago a friend of mine from the club that I used to race out of competed in the Southern Cross Series-a very prestigious operation sailed mostly in Sydney, where there are four races, and then in the Sydney to Hobart in the great ocean-racing classic. He did quite well, he enjoyed himself and he probably had a few attitude adjusters on his way back up to South Australia. Seeing the lights of Adelaide he was overjoyed, and enjoyed nature's facilities at the stern of the boat. There was a slight rocking motion and he unfortunately exited. I became very conscious of the need for safety search operations when he was rescued in the first sea mission of the new helicopter provided by one of the commercial television channels in Adelaide. We are all eternally grateful for that, and he has lived off the event for his bar consumption in the 10 years between then and this day. Good on you, Wilbur!</PARA>
<PARA> Given the number of racing, cruising and fishing craft that are active in Australia, particularly in the waters of the east coast, it is clearly desirable that such a facility be provided on a 24-hour basis for recreational and sporting reasons, particularly if we are to maintain our reputation as one of the leading yacht racing nations in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years there has been enormous pressure for change in the shipping industry. I am proud to say that many of the issues raised by the critics have been addressed in this Bill. The shipping industry, on a worldwide basis, has been forced to contend with rising costs in the climate of intense competition and rather depressed freight rates. It has been demanding increased efficiencies and, understandably, seeking reductions in the costs of the services which have been provided by the Government. It has also been asking for greater input into the decision-making processes and wants to examine more closely the basis of the charges which the Government levies on it. It has been striving to have this greater input and the Government has acceded to these legitimate requests by the shipowners and shipping unions. These requests will be acceded to by the passage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, with the implementation of a three region structure, as proposed by the Bill, to replace the previous six States structure as administrative regions, there will be an immediate and positive improvement in the costs. In any case, the existing land based regions are, like so many of the Government structures in this country, based on colonial boundaries that were drawn up one hundred years ago with the technology of that day. With a modern late twentieth and early twenty-first century outlook in mind, this legislation addresses the problems of the authority in a modern context of three major coastal regions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a significant benefit in moving to a statutory authority which will be similar to those achieved in the case of the Federal Airports Corporation where staff numbers have been reduced-please note-by 20 per cent and revenue has substantially increased, nonetheless. One of the major reasons for the success of this Corporation was its transfer from Canberra to Sydney. The transfer brought the Corporation closer to the aviation industry and sent a strong signal of the need for a commercial rather than a bureaucratic approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has, quite rightly, decided to take the same attitude in moving this authority from Canberra to Newcastle. I can think of no better location for this authority-other than Adelaide-than Newcastle. Unfortunately, Adelaide is a bit crowded with its program these days, having the Grand Prix, the world's best festival and now a multifunction polis which will be the envy of the civilised world. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Newcastle does have a large port and is the home of major shipbuilding and shipowning interests-Carrington Slipways Proprietary Ltd is one of Australia's principal shipyards, and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd is a major establishment in Newcastle. Newcastle will provide an ongoing source of highly qualified personnel for the authority, while the Department has had difficulties in attracting suitably qualified staff to the Marine Operations Division because professional staff have been unwilling to relocate in Canberra. This is not really surprising since the best sailing to be had in Canberra is a board on the lake. It is not really good for blue water men, as the honourable member for Kingsford Smith (Mr Brereton)-who is absent, unfortunately-would be ready to attest, I am sure. </PARA>
<PARA> There are abundant workshops in Newcastle and it is a low cost centre from the point of view of administrative overheads. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three other excellent reasons for relocating the authority in Newcastle. First, it is vital that this Government send a signal to the residents of the Hunter Valley area that the Commonwealth Government is prepared to invest in and support the development of that region following the disastrous earthquake of a few months ago. Secondly, it is important that we continue to strive to achieve the objective of decentralisation of as many activities as we can into regional centres such as Newcastle. Thirdly, after all, Newcastle is adjacent to the best winemaking area in Australia, outside South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, there will be a number of advantages springing from this legislation. First, the authority will provide the framework for recruiting top management to the organisation. At present, this has been difficult to achieve. Its managers will work in a commercial manner and be responsible to a board that is in tune with the needs and requirements of the maritime industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, by clearly differentiating itself from the bureaucracy in Canberra, the authority can promote itself as a focal point for expertise in a technically specialised area. The sharp focus given to the authority and its location will enable it to draw from a wider pull of quality recruits. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, by providing a much more direct accounting framework back to the industry, including industry representatives on the board, a much closer liaison between the industry and the authority will exist than is presently the case. Fourthly, the commercial orientation of the authority will ensure that costs are kept to a minimum. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, AMSA's location in Newcastle will promote the Government's decentralisation objectives and assist in the rebuilding of Newcastle following the earthquake. Because of these very cogent reasons and arguments, I commend this legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill 1990, which is particularly important as it establishes the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, whose functions will include combating pollution in the marine environment, a matter which I, as Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts and also as a member of the coalition environment committee, am very interested in. The authority will also be looking at the provision of search and rescue services and their coordination and the provision of services to the maritime industry on a commercial basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of these areas have been spelt out very clearly. A number of criticisms have been issued to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) and to the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), who have sat and taken these criticisms in good spirit. </PARA>
<PARA> I will again list some of those. I think that when the Minister responds he will have some ready answers. In November 1989 the Minister announced that the Government had decided that the headquarters of the authority would be located in Newcastle. Of course, having been born on the outskirts of Newcastle, I am a bit biased. I am not terribly worried about the fact that this organisation will be located there. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier the Minister suggested that the location site would be either Katoomba, in the middle of my electorate, or Newcastle. Nevertheless, the decision has been made to place it in Newcastle. That is what this Bill is about. The criticisms about the decision to locate the Authority in Newcastle have come from Opposition and unions representing staff in the Maritime Operations Division of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot for one moment believe that the Minister, who is at the table, would ever think of pork-barrelling his electorate by placing the Authority in Newcastle. That would not be possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for these criticisms, among others, is that this move will do nothing to increase the division's efficiency. It will disrupt families in Canberra. The move is expected to involve more than 200 Canberra based staff. Staff in the division will be given six months to decide whether they wish to move and the Government has given no guarantees that there will not be any retrenchments. This comes on top of a move from Civic to Belconnen in this city last year that cost more than $1m. I am sure that the Minister will comment on each of those points and on others raised by honourable members on this side of the house. </PARA>
<PARA> The main thrust of my speech today is aimed at the provision of a search and rescue service. The whole Bill has been dealt with in quite considerable detail by the shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the matter of search and rescue services has already been canvassed by all the speakers on this side of the House. I am particularly interested in the recent search for the Rockin' Robin which sank off the coast of Queensland. Crew members who were lost were my constituents. Some of their family members are still members of my constituency. I have had regular, almost daily, contact with them since the whole drama began. I have had the most minute details of all aspects of the search relayed to me. I was also the independent observer at a long family and departmental conference that took place at air headquarters at Glenbrook, just a little out of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I have in my hand a copy of a letter written to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) from the family regarding this very matter. I will quote some passages in summary so that honourable members have a clearer idea of what happened. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> On the 8th June last the yacht began to take water-</PARA>
<PARA>I mention this because this search organisation will be part of the Newcastle set up. From the information I have-it does not matter where the organisation is based-on this occasion its efficiency left a lot to be desired. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> in bad weather some 600 miles east of Gladstone and radioed for assistance. The task of arranging for crew members to be saved in such circumstances had been entrusted by the Commonwealth Government to the Department of Transport which had set up the Federal Safety Centre (``Sea Safety'') to provide for, amongst others, this very contingency. </PARA>
<PARA> The vessel and crew could have been saved by dropping a petrol driven pump and equipment enabling the vessel to remain afloat until the weather had eased. If this had failed, an appropriate lifecraft with supplies and an EPIRB (radio beacon) to enable the raft to be relocated should have been dropped. Neither of these essential steps was taken by Sea Safety. </PARA>
<PARA>This constitutes an area of grave concern. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> As a direct result of its negligence in these respects, four men were set adrift in heavy seas some 600 nautical miles off the Australian coast with no means of finding them except by an immediate thorough and concentrated search of the area during the following day. No adequate search for the raft was made. </PARA>
<PARA>A search was undertaken but when one considers all the facts one sees that it was certainly not adequate. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result it is now very probable that four men have lost their lives-</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very serious matter-</PARA>
<PARA>leaving four widows and six fatherless children aged seven and less. </PARA>
<PARA> The families seek the immediate release to them of a full copy of the Marsar file kept by Sea Safety with respect to the Rockin' Robin, a public enquiry into the conduct of Sea Safety and compensation for the loss of their breadwinners. </PARA>
<PARA>As has been mentioned a number of times, the departmental report was promised by the end of July and was to be made public. We are all wondering where it is. The Minister might like to advise us on that later. </PARA>
<PARA> Sea Safety, having exclusively undertaken the task of saving the lives of the crew, was under a legal obligation to carry out that task in a responsible and prudent manner and to employ methods, resources and equipment appropriate to achieve a successful result. </PARA>
<PARA> I and the families believe that that just did not occur and that Sea Safety was, inter alia, quite negligent because of a number of factors. First, as I mentioned before, it failed to drop a pump, which is quite a recognised method of engaging in a rescue mission when a vessel is distressed at sea. In the United States of America the Coastguard drops these pumps, which are in a special watertight package, down with fuel. They are dropped to the boat. They have all the necessary equipment on board to put lines down. The pumps and the motors start very easily, even in the roughest conditions. The boats can then be kept afloat. I understand that on the day such a pump could have been dropped. Pumps were available but one was not called for. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there was the failure to provide an emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) for the yacht. For years these radio beacons have been regarded as essential equipment for any vessel which puts to sea on the shortest coastal trip. All vessels are advised to have these radio beacons on them in case there is a problem and they need to be located. Every marine authority exhorts all persons who go to sea to carry an EPIRB because experience has shown that it is extremely difficult to find a small vessel at sea. It is obligatory that an EPIRB be packed in all life rafts carried on commercial vessels. The Rockin' Robin carried an EPIRB, which was abandoned with the vessel when the crew boarded what appeared to be a large, commodious, well-equipped raft dropped by the Royal Australian Air Force. I might say that the role of the RAAF in this whole exercise has been exemplary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Banshee, another yacht which was abandoned at about the same time and in the same storm, also carried an EPIRB which also was left on board when it was abandoned because the sailors thought there probably would be one in the rescuing raft. </PARA>
<PARA> The RAAF dropped a radio marker beacon at about the same time as they dropped the raft but it did not secure this beacon to the raft. The marker beacon floats low in the water and its drift is affected far more by currents than by the wind. The opposite applies to the drift of a raft, so that after a short time there is no necessary relationship between the position of the marker and that of the raft. The RAAF tracked the position of the marker electronically during the night but in the morning, as was to be expected, the raft could not be found. It should be noted that rafts carried by aircraft are often fitted with EPIRBs by the manufacturer as standard equipment. But in this event the rafts that were dropped did not have any radio equipment whatsoever on board. When we consider that the beacons dropped by the RAAF were not attached to the rafts at all, it was quite ludicrous to think that they would be of any use in finding these men in the raft the next day. </PARA>
<PARA> Other details could be given, for example those relating to the charge that the Sea Safety people failed to institute a proper search. When we go into all the details-I have them and they are included in the letter that the family wrote in great detail at the end of July to the Prime Minister and to which no response has been received as yet-it appears that there was considerable neglect and what seems to be a lack of expertise in terms of the proper organisation of this search. I do not want to delay the House any further by going into all those details but the Minister responsible for this particular area and the Prime Minister have thorough details. </PARA>
<PARA> The family were limited by the information available to them. Some of the information contained in the letter to the Prime Minister may, in minor areas, be contradicted but that is because family members were never allowed to see the maritime search and rescue report. Though the family members asked many times for the report to enable them to engage in their own activities in terms of a private search, they were refused access to that particular report. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I want to mention that there were a lot of very wonderful and brave people associated with this search. The mother of the home, Mrs Wiltshire, whose husband, Grant, and son, Robert, were both missing, and Andrew Young and Jeffrey Smith and all the family members associated deserve the absolute highest commendation for the fact that in spite of the seeming odds against them, they pushed on. I include in that acknowledgment the efforts of members of the public, the community, who contributed in excess of $100,000 towards continuing the private search. Incidentally, the search undertaken by the relatives cost approximately $280,000 which was provided by gifts from families and, as I said earlier, by the community and from the insurance on the boat. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to place on record the excellent work undertaken by Mr Mike Woods, a brother-in-law of one of the lost men, who spent hours and hours engaged in the searches out of Townsville and other areas on the east coast of Queensland trying to track down this missing raft. I also want to mention David Isaacs, who was also very much involved; Chris Smith, the brother of one of the missing men; and Roy and Shirley Smith, the father and mother of Jeffrey Smith, who tirelessly put in efforts to maximise the activities that they had to engage in privately because of the fact that the sea search was called off so prematurely. I also note the efforts of Mr Laurie Gruzman, who owns a plane which is excellent for this type of search and who worked in his own time at a very reasonable rate. He spent hours and hours helping the family search. I would just like to place on record that assistance and those commendations to the members of the family for their excellent efforts in spite of the fact that they all would have been grieving considerably, having lost their loved ones. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving that matter altogether, I want to say that recently I addressed the House and expressed my concern about the safety of the Great Barrier Reef and the necessity to frame legislation to protect this very special part of Australia. There are insufficient restrictions placed on large vessels which pass though channels in and adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. We want rules and regulations that will make it impossible for vessels such as tankers containing polluting materials to cause damage to the reef should they ever come to grief in that area. I trust that this authority when it comes into operation will make that a priority so that there will be no threat to the reef from oil and waste spillage from passing ships and that the policing of that particular area will be very strict. As we all know, the Great Barrier Reef is one of the great wonders of the world today. I look forward now to hearing the Minister's response to the comments of the honourable member for Gilmore and other comments made on this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I congratulate and thank the honourable members on both sides of the chamber who have participated in the debate on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) Bill: the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris); the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley); the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp); the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron); and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). I also thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for allowing the debate to be perhaps a little more wide ranging than may have been strictly permissible within the terms of the legislation. The questions that were raised were legitimately raised and reflect the concerns of honourable members who took advantage of the opportunity to speak. I have no criticism of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One concern expressed initially by the honourable member for Gilmore, who led the debate for the Opposition, related to the general question of the Government's position on establishing AMSA in Newcastle. This concern was taken up by other honourable members generally as some sort of criticism from the Opposition and some measure of endorsement, approval and applaud from Government speakers, which is only to be expected. While some of the comments may have been a little facetious, honourable members generally would appreciate and understand why AMSA will not continue to be located in Canberra. I do not believe it would have been appropriate, especially when about 60 per cent of the total operating costs of AMSA are met by the industry, which operates not in Canberra but in maritime locations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore appropriate that this new Authority be established in a maritime location. As the honourable member for Newcastle indicated, the best location would have been Sydney but the cost of transferring, the cost of establishment, the continuing cost of operations, would have made it prohibitive so we looked at the next best option which was Newcastle, unquestionably. It is just coincidental that my electorate adjoins Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> The close proximity of Newcastle to the maritime industry, together with the lower administrative and overhead costs and the beneficial effects on regional development, will all provide significant benefits to the shipping industry. From an industry perspective, Newcastle has quite a number of advantages. For example, it provides a major source of highly skilled potential employees for AMSA. That is supported by the excellent applications which have been received for the recently advertised AMSA positions. Well in excess of 1,000 have been received, and we are very impressed with the quality of the applications. I am not suggesting that the staff at the Canberra location were anything less than qualified, competent and dedicated-all of the staff associated with those activities in Canberra were particularly dedicated-but there was a problem, as they would acknowledge, in recruiting appropriate staff in the first place because maritime activities were being carried out in a non-maritime location.</PARA>
<PARA> Newcastle is also a major and growing international port. It is a major centre for Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd activities and, in particular, its coastal shipping. Newcastle has its own significant shipbuilding industry, including Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd. It has a wide range of workshop space available for AMSA which the alternative locations would not have had. The ongoing operational and administrative costs tend to be lower in Newcastle than in many of the other centres. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is clear from what has been said that had the decision of the Australian people been otherwise and the Hawke Labor Government not been re-elected, AMSA would not have gone to Newcastle. The people of Newcastle need to understand that a coalition government would have reversed that decision. I emphasise that the decision to locate AMSA in Newcastle was based on objective reasons. Newcastle was the best location for AMSA. If the Opposition-had it become the Government-had taken advantage of the opportunity to reverse that decision, it would have been an act of vindictiveness against Newcastle and against the people of Newcastle. The people of Newcastle know and understand that; as they should. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of establishing the Maritime Safety Authority, Opposition members referred to what they considered to be the inappropriateness of establishing another authority. The point I would like to emphasise in connection with that is that we are giving the Authority, essentially, a commercial charter. It will have a more commercial manner of operation; and I would have thought that the Opposition would have applauded that. The Government decided to create AMSA as part of its major program of micro-economic reform. This initiative is consistent with the Government's other maritime reform measures, including the creation of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority and the Shipping Industry Reform Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The creation of AMSA will unquestionably result in major and long-lasting benefits to the industry, including a much more cost-effective administration and greater efficiency as a consequence of the Authority adopting a quasi-commercial approach to its activities, and a much more direct accountability to the industry, with the Authority developing programs in consultation with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters that were raised included the question of the possible loss of staff in the transfer to Newcastle. I indicate that about 130 members of the present staff currently exercising those functions in Canberra have been asked to consider transfer to Newcastle. They are not required to respond to that request until December, so we cannot say how many of them will choose to transfer and how many will choose to stay in Canberra and perhaps find alternative employment within or outside the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Transport and Communications will ensure that during the transfer period sufficient staff will be available to guarantee that operational requirements will continue to be met. A question was raised concerning the transfer of the Federal Sea Safety Centre to Newcastle. There will be a duplication of the Centre's essential operations and equipment to make sure that no lives will be put at risk during that transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> A question was also raised concerning the costs to the industry. I emphasise that the cost of the establishment of AMSA in Newcastle will not be paid by the industry; it will be met entirely by the Commonwealth. One of the objectives in establishing AMSA was to ensure that the maritime services provided by the Commonwealth to the shipping industry were run along more cost-effective lines. AMSA will operate in a quasi-commercial environment and will have greater freedom to initiate cost-containing measures. It will also be more accountable to industry through its Board. Accordingly, the industry will have a greater opportunity to examine the various cost elements of AMSA's operations. </PARA>
<PARA> A question was asked concerning the level and extent of consultation with employees and with the industry. This Government has quite consciously pursued industrial democracy and attempts have always been made to ensure that there is adequate consultation with employees when their circumstances are likely to be affected by any Government decision. Of course, that was also the case here. I consider that there was adequate consultation with industry, and I believe that industry will applaud the transfer. As it is the maritime industry which will be funding the greater proportion of those services, I imagine that it would prefer that those services be carried out in a maritime location where the maritime activities are being carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> There were also references to the loss of the Rockin' Robin and the search and rescue operations associated with that. A question was raised about the report which the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, said would be publicly available by the end of July. The only reason that it was not available at the end of July was that the completion of the report took longer than expected. There is no question of whether it will be made public; it will be made public. I do not want to pre-empt any of the questions that have been raised, and I am not being critical of those people who have raised issues. I was in touch with members of the family of the crew during that time as they live in the Newcastle area. I think the personal heroism, courage, commitment and dedication, in terms of both their personal financial resources and their time, reflects outstanding credit on those people. I suppose that only they really know the traumas that they experienced as a result of those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Macquarie indicated, there was a lot of good moral and financial support from the community. Whatever the causes were, it was a tragic development with enormous implications for and a tragic impact on members of that family and the people associated with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question raised was as a result of the tabling of two documents by the honourable member for Newcastle. He referred to the question of the presence of asbestos in the building. It has been suggested that in some way that may have created additional difficulties. The document that the honourable member tabled from the real estate agents associated with the building states:</PARA>
<PARA>From the beginning of our involvement with the building we were aware of the presence of asbestos in the property and were in possession of a report to the owners concerning asbestos. </PARA>
<PARA>They also make the point that that had been costed. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA>This factor was allowed for in our costing and our timing of the project . . . The presence of asbestos will not adversely affect the time anticipated to refurbish Nesca House. </PARA>
<PARA>The other document tabled was a copy of a fax from Mr Bob Thomson, Assistant Director, Maritime Crews, which was sent out under a Department of Transport and Communications letterhead. I do not want to pre-judge that matter, but it appears that Mr Thomson may have exceeded his authority. Mr Thomson is also a union official and, as he indicates in the document, he is a member of the accommodation working party. I have no doubt that Senator Collins will look at that matter and inquire about it. It may be that Mr Thomson has exceeded his authority with regard to the approach taken. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee stage, the Government will move a number of amendments. At this stage, I simply want to express again my appreciation for the contributions by the five honourable members from both sides of the chamber who participated in the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that the Opposition again states the basis on which it opposes the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Bill. We do not accept the establishment of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority because it is a needless example of the Government establishing a quango or quasi semi-autonomous government authority without proper reason, thereby adding to the extraordinary expansion of government which has occurred by this method in recent years. This action, which has been a hallmark of the Labor Government, has been taken to avoid the need for hard decisions to be made by accountable Ministers, answerable to this place. We will not sanction adding to the ever-growing list. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is yet another example of the unnecessary establishment of a quango. That is the basis on which we oppose the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments may not reflect immediately on the coalition's basic proposition, but the burden of proof lies with the Government to justify the high expenditure involved in the establishment of this quango. Its siting is not in question. The issue before this place is the establishment of a semi-government statutory authority, or quango-whatever terminology one uses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow on from the words of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), but first I thank the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) for the answers that he provided to questions put by members of the Opposition, including the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) and me. Not all our questions were answered. We are still left very much in doubt as to the true financial gains that will be achieved through the creation of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Gippsland pointed out, we are opposed to the creation of another quango, another tier of government activity. We are not necessarily opposed to the location of the Authority in Newcastle. We are not opposed to its being located in any particular place, as long as we can find out the precise reasons for the choice of location and that those reasons are justifiable in economic and service terms. The answers with which we were provided today still leave us in doubt as to the veracity of the Government's decision to locate the Authority in Newcastle. I know that there are problems as a result of the asbestos found in Nesca House, which has made things even more difficult. The honourable member for Macquarie put the point well. Rather tongue in cheek, he said that he was sure that the Minister for Land Transport, who was responsible for locating the facility in Newcastle, had not considered the possible electoral gains that might flow from that decision. We still maintain our opposition to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I apologise to the Minister for ducking out during part of his explanation, but I had to attend to an urgent matter. I will discuss with him later the bits that I missed. We are still looking for better answers. I am pleased that the Minister dealt with the matter of the Rockin' Robin. It was somewhat generous of Mr Deputy Speaker to discuss that terribly important issue. We are looking forward to the inquiry results being made public and to all of us being satisfied with them. Until we have an independent inquiry, I do not think that anybody will be totally satisfied with the results. </PARA>

The Opposition suggests that we need reform, commercial imperatives and commercial constraints on the operation of many of these public sector activities, as long as nothing changes. One of the essential reasons for our establishing the Australian Maritime Safety Authority was to take out of the present transport and communications bureaucracy those functions that were clearly related to maritime operations and to bring them together in one body. That body happened to be called an authority, but it has been and will be given commercial responsibility to operate as commercially as possible. Of course, the financial benefits will not be apparent until the Authority is operating and the costs and benefits can be determined.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill actually covers only dried vine fruits. Dried tree fruits such as apricots and prunes are covered in separate legislation, and that legislation has enough room between the present maximum limit and the desired maximum the Government has set of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production (GVP) of that industry to be able to reach that maximum figure without any legislative change. This target of 0.5 per cent of GVP has been set by the Government for the approximately 20 agricultural commodities which have their own legislation or combine together for rural industry research arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment the levy on prunes is $12 per tonne and this will increase to $13 per tonne, which is the magical 0.5 per cent. The current levy on dried tree fruit is $10.25 per tonne. That will increase this year to $13.25 and the year after to $17, which is also that maximum level. This Bill is just one of similar pieces of legislation to collect rural industry research and development levies. The legislation sets the maximum levy and the operational level is then set by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Commonwealth pays dollar for dollar for the amount of money raised for this research up to the level of 0.5 per cent of GVP, most rural industries are now endeavouring to lift their levy payments to that maximum level. I believe that is a commendable target to maximise research. The coalition parties support that target. There has been a long and successful bipartisan attitude to rural industry research. One of the reasons why rural industry retains its superior productivity and export ability in this country is that it is more committed to research than are many other sectors of our economy. Referring to this Bill, the dried vine fruits industry currently pays a levy of $4.50 a tonne, which is 61 per cent of the 0.5 per cent of GVP. The industry intends to increase the levy to $5.75 a tonne this year and will reach the 0.5 figure with $7.40 a tonne next year. </PARA>
<PARA> The dried vine fruit industry has been and continues to be a very successful horticultural industry and a consistent exporter of high quality product. Amongst its current programs is the development of its own brand of Sunberry in Germany, where Australian fruit will be shipped in bulk to Germany and then packed under the Australian label and marketed through one of Europe's top distributors. </PARA>
<PARA> The dried vine fruit industry, probably more successfully than any other horticultural industry, has maintained its market share in the European Community against the imposition of the common external tariff of the EC and of heavily subsidised local production. I believe that is a great credit to the dried vine fruit industry. But there are problems for the industry with subsidised production and imports from Turkey and Greece. The industry has conducted a successful campaign against Turkish imports to make the point that the quality and overall standard of the Australian product are better. I suppose that is not surprising when one realises that Australian dried vine fruit commands premium prices throughout the world-a world that is subject to very heavy and subsidised competition. One of the reasons for that, apart from very good quality control, is that along the Murray River the industry is able to use the natural advantage of the sun to dry the fruit rather than having to use the artificial means of assistance that are required in some other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The campaign against Turkey has been easier, I understand, than the problem with Greece. Greece is a part of the European Community and is receiving huge export subsidies. According to the Chairman of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation, it is costing the European Community $70m a year to protect the Greek product. In Greece the grower sells to the packer for $2,100 a tonne. Then the packer sells to the buyer for $1,700 a tonne and the EC pays assistance to the packer of $1,300 a tonne, as well as $25 a month storage charge. So after all that subsidy, Greece last year had to feed 25,000 tonnes of its 78,000 tonnes of production to livestock. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of problem faced by the dried vine fruit industry and, for that matter, by a range of our horticultural industries. But it is not just the European Community that presents problems. The United States gives its industry $12m a year for promotion. Horticultural industries in the United States are able to gain access to the targeted export assistance program (TEAP), which in the horticultural industries is equivalent to the nasty-that is, if one is not in the United States-export enhancement program (EEP) for grain producers. The figure for Australia is $100,000 a year assistance through the export market development grant scheme. So that is the sort of difficulty the industry faces. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a successful industry. There has been an Industry Commission inquiry into it, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is now proposing that what has been a successful corporation in industry should be put under the wing or become an adjunct of the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC). The Corporation has been in existence for about two years. It has received $2m to $3m of government money and, so far, has no demonstrable success to its credit. But to be fair to the Australian Horticultural Corporation, it really has not the power to achieve any success.</PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the crux of what I understand to be the position with the negotiations at the present time, and that is the retention of the export power for the Dried Fruits Corporation; or, if the industry is to accept the Minister's proposal, the Dried Fruits Board under the AHC. His proposal is that the industry can have that export power only if it accepts his proposal. I presume that is so that the Government can say that at last the AHC has a success, because here we would have, as part of the AHC, a very successful horticultural industry that exports. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand what is being negotiated, it is a little like the wheat industry legislation of last year. That is, the industry would lose any domestic market price control. There would be an open market, but it would retain the export power and possibly it would have underwriting. I will leave it to the industry to negotiate; that is for it to determine with the Minister. The only point I make is that when one looks at these export industries where there are many sellers in the sense of many growers and where there are problems with other countries and the forms of assistance they receive, I believe the export power is the single most important power any marketing authority can have. I am sure that was the case with wheat and I believe it will turn out to be the case with dried vine fruit. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons why Australia has a patchy record with horticultural exports is that in my view some industries have had this power and some have not. We can look at their competitive ability or comparative success compared with countries that are strong horticultural exporters, and I think here in particular of South Africa and New Zealand which have that power in more general terms than we do. They have been able to guarantee a more stable price and quality image. That is without referring to the other horticultural export countries which have export subsidies. It does not matter in that sense because they just beat the market down and meet the market. I think in particular of the United States and the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA> I was recently in South Africa and was talking, amongst other groups, to Unifruco, which basically is the statutory export marketeer for fresh deciduous fruit. It has a remarkably successful record. Those honourable members who have been to the different fresh markets of Europe would agree that it has a quality image second to none. I note that the Minister was referring recently to this need for quality in our horticultural exports. I certainly agree with that. The point I am making is that some are able to achieve this better than others. One of the reasons why some countries have been able to do it is this ability to control their horticultural export quality situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather ironic that there are supposedly trade sanctions against South Africa. The South Africans have increased their exports of fresh deciduous fruits dramatically to Western Europe and to a range of non-white countries which supposedly have trade sanctions against them. Australia does have an inherent quality ability. If one looks at the production cycles on our farms compared with other countries they are relatively free of some of the heavy chemical problems. I do not mean heavy in the sense of heavy metals. I am referring to heavy chemical applications. We are not heavy users of chemicals in our agriculture, even in our horticulture, compared with other countries. We are comparatively free of industrial pollution and we do set high domestic standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems begin from that point on. I want to refer to fresh fruit on the one hand and processed on the other. I make the point again that there is a lack of quality control. Some of that is on the farm, or in the packing shed. I acknowledge that. We also have to acknowledge that there is a difficulty of distance, of selling our product, other than if we are selling to South East Asia where we will be selling and are selling more and more. Considerable distances are involved. That means time, particularly with some of the shipping schedules. Time is critical with regard to fresh quality. </PARA>
<PARA> I represent the major deciduous fruit area of Australia and the major fresh fruit export commodity of Australia-that is, fresh pears. I am aware, from the frustrations of the fruit growers in my area, of the problems beyond the farm gate. I refer, firstly, to the waterfront. Time is critical with fresh fruit. There are inherent problems of guaranteed quick delivery across the waterfront. Beyond the waterfront there are problems with container quality. There are never-ending debates, brawls and contests between the shipping companies and the fruit growers on who is the cause for the lack of quality at the other end. I acknowledge that some of it is caused by the packer, the grower himself. There is plenty of evidence, particularly with the time required with regard to Europe, that there are real problems with the temperature control that is needed and is critical if we are going to maintain a fresh product. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite a number of the best growers will no longer export. This is a tragedy when this country needs export and when the pear is considered one of the great fresh fruits of the world. They will not do it because there is enough uncertainty in horticulture without that additional uncertainty of what happens when it leaves their packing shed before it reaches the other end. That is apart from the import restrictions that a number of countries place on fruit. Unfortunately, a number of those countries are in Asia where we really should be developing our markets. If one wants to talk about using quarantine as a non-tariff barrier some of the Asian countries are past masters at that. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at processed fruit, processed horticultural or processed agricultural products generally, there is a problem because there is a trend to fresh products around the world. That is made more and more possible now by growing products in different parts of the world and better storage ability so that in many ways we can obtain a fresh product, provided we pay the price, almost all year round. There should be opportunities in Australia for value adding, for processing and for employment in regional Australia. There are plenty of Government reports saying that this should happen. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if one looks at what is happening in the horticultural areas of Australia, employment is actually falling. There is a threat which is far outweighing the possibilities, in my view, of increased employment. There is a threat to reduce employment for a variety of reasons. It is to do with the question of the ability to sell the processed product and sell it economically or profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, our total labour costs are far higher than that of our competitor countries. One does not have to look to South Africa for a comparison. We could look at the United States. I have been to enough food processing factories around the world to know that in many cases, even compared with the United States, our total labour costs are 50 to 75 per cent higher than that of our competitors because of the different work practices, restrictions and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem is increasing import barriers. One can think of the European community. I think more recently, particularly for deciduous canned fruit, of Canada where the United States-Canada free trade agreement has been established. A tariff disadvantage of 1 1/2 per cent a year is being placed on our exporters, our fruit growers. That is a further threat to employment. The third problem is the subsidised exports of processed food, processed agricultural products and processed horticultural products to Australia. A dramatic increase is taking place in imports of these products at a rate of about 20 per cent a year in total terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Dried vine fruit is similarly suffering from those rapid increases. Greece, through its subsidised exports, now has about 20 per cent of the vine fruit market in Australia. The deciduous canned fruit industry is approaching 20 per cent, with pineapples at 20 to 25 per cent. Tomatoes are not that high but certainly rising rapidly, as are asparagus, fruit juice and so on. There is a real threat to maintain employment and production for processed horticultural products. </PARA>
<PARA> During the recent election campaign we made the point that there is a need for fair trade with those imported products. If dumping or export subsidisation is taking place, there should be an ability to act more quickly than is presently the case with either dumping or countervailing duties. The procedure has stretched out from the 55 or 60 days of some years ago to almost 12 months now, and considerable damage can occur in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, we have the softest developing country preference arrangements of any of the countries that I have studied. One can argue, the way the United States does, that none of the Asian tigers are any longer developing countries so their developing country preference can be removed, or that if a country has an industry which leads the world in exports, like Brazil with citrus, that is not a developing industry. That is the view in the United States and New Zealand.</PARA>

One could look at Japan, with a whole range of horticultural products, as well, and certainly rice is a critical one. So this question of developing country preferences, I believe, also needs to be addressed in relation to this industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But to return to the dried vine fruit industry-and I thank you for your courtesy in this regard, Mr Deputy Speaker-one of the other problems of horticulture is the ability to transfer from fresh to processed product, and that creates some uncertainty sometimes in the market. But the dried vine fruit industry has the additional problem of grapes: grapes can be made into wine to a certain extent, table grapes or dried vine fruit. Dried vine fruit basically is the end of the line; for certain types of grapes it is the remainder that is not used elsewhere. People involved in that area have the additional problem of coping with this variable end use, and they have done it very well. </PARA>
<PARA> Table grapes are an example of a potentially good export industry that has been ruined, at least for the time being, by some contradictory, inappropriate and unsuccessful export quality control arrangements. It is very sad because that is one of the really booming horticultural products for which there is demand around the world at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the legislation, and I understand we could be talking dried vine fruit again before the end of parliamentary session. This industry, which is very important in certain regional areas of Australia and has a good quality image for its product and for maintaining exports in difficult circumstances, is worthy of sensible and sound negotiations between the industry and the Minister. I hope those are realised with the legislation we will probably see later in the year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill 1990 has been introduced to provide for an increase from $5 to $10 per tonne in the maximum amount of levy for dried vine fruit destined for research and development. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has given a very good background into the industry. I will not repeat many of the things that he said in support of this Bill but I am appreciative of the fact that the Opposition is supporting the Bill, as it supported many other research and development levies that were brought in in the life of the previous Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The dried fruits industry covers dried vine fruits-in particular, of course, sultanas, currants and raisins-and dried tree fruits such as apricots, plums, prunes, nectarines, peaches and pears. It is unfortunate that the majority of these products are not grown in my electorate. Because we have the most equable climate in the world, we do not have the cold weather that is needed to produce some of these fine Australian products. </PARA>
<PARA> The dried vine fruit industry is located predominantly in the Sunraysia region of New South Wales and Victoria and the Riverland region of South Australia, and the dried tree fruits industry is concentrated in southern New South Wales and the Riverland region of South Australia. The average production for the industry is around 85,000 tonnes, of which dried vine fruits make up approximately 80 per cent. The average value of production is estimated at over $150m, which is a big contribution to the economy and to agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill 1990 has been prepared at the request of the dried fruits industry and the Dried Fruits Research Council in order to accommodate the continuation of a rolling program of increases to the operative research and development levy rate for dried vine fruit. Under the rolling program it is proposed that operative research and development levy rates will bring the industry contribution for research and development up to 0.5 per cent of the average annual gross value of production of dried vine fruits by 1992. The operative levy rates will continue to be set by regulations under the Dried Vine Fruits Levy Act 1971. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has undertaken to match industry funds raised for research and development on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the average annual gross value of the industry's production. As I have said, this is the same as has occurred with many other agricultural industries. The dried fruits industry has taken a forward-looking approach to its research and development program and is in the process of phasing in levy increases for research and development in a rolling program to reach the target of 0.5 per cent of its average gross domestic product by 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> More and more, agricultural industries are coming to understand the need for research and development. As the honourable member for Murray said, quality has been one of the key reasons our dried vine fruit products have been able to gain access to world markets and even fight against unfair trade practices. At the end of the day, if one has quality one has an edge. Research and development is important if we are to maintain that quality and capitalise on technological change that is affecting agriculture just as much as the manufacturing world-and in many cases even more. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes without saying that Australian farmers are the best in the world at getting farm product to the farm gate. There is often debate on whether we are the best in the world at marketing and so on, but for farm product there is no disagreement whatever that we can deliver the goods. In every agricultural debate there is basic agreement on both sides of the House that it is unfortunate that in our pursuit of export markets we still have to compete against nations that may have a bigger economic base than we do but are economic cowards when it comes to free trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, it is our responsibility to continue to fight and lead the way in the debate on free trade because we have most to lose if protection barriers are maintained, given the fact that we are a small nation with a population of 17 million people in a continent of 3 million square miles and that the majority of our farm product-80 per cent plus-has to be sold overseas. If we were ever to take our bat and ball and go home-and I do not think anyone would ever suggest that-we would be the biggest losers. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we can continue to embarrass the major trading nations by the courageous way in which we have fought to get a fairer playing field. At the end of day, all the major trading nations are achieving-I have said this before and I will continue to say it-is inefficiency in their own agricultural sectors. By creating massive subsidies they are propping up inefficient farmers in their own countries and creating inefficiency themselves. In an ordinary marketplace they would not survive. One day they will have to face the repercussions of this in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA> The American farm Bill, as tough as it is and as hard for us as it is, puts pressure on the European Economic Community. I take the view that the EEC countries are the biggest culprits in this world. The fact that the American farm Bill has impacted against us as a nation does not help us much. But we have done it tough in the past and we shall again. We will continue to fight to make sure that we get better access to markets, and that is why it is important that we support and promote research and development to maintain that edge in quality. Part of that quality concerns getting the product to the farm gate but there is also quality in marketing, delivery, promotion, selling and presentation. In the past presentation has helped our sales of agricultural products, but for dried vine fruits there has not been enough emphasis on promotion and presentation as such. Research and development will go a long way towards improving that. </PARA>
<PARA> Horticultural industries in this nation are expanding and I am proud to say that in our area we are now the biggest producers of tomatoes in Australia. One of the other things that the honourable member for Murray said that I agree with is that we do not use as many chemicals in many of our agricultural products as other nations do. We must continue to work with technology to reduce the amount of chemicals we use to an optimum level. Of course, we cannot stop using chemicals, but we need to reduce their use where we can. </PARA>
<PARA> An integrated pest management program is now in place for the horticultural industry in Bundaberg. Consumer preference now is for eliminating or reducing the amount of residue in chemicals used right across the board. Research and development in these areas is important. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the dried vine fruit industry exists in drier areas than my region is very relevant to the Budget that was brought down last night. It was announced that funding for the Murray-Darling basin initiative would increase from $6.7m in 1989-90 to $10.3m. Funding for the Murray-Darling basin natural resources management strategy has been increased from $1.9m in 1989-90 to $5.7m. In 1990-91, $38.9m is to be provided to the States and the Northern Territory under the Federal water resources assistance program. A new Land and Waters Research and Development Corporation is to be established with an initial allocation of $8.52m, and funding for the national soil conservation program is to be increased by 9 per cent to $21.8m in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> I think these are important initiatives because the most important resource of all with regard to agriculture, the very base, is our land and soil. It is good to see that our land care program has been supported right across the board, from conservation groups in the city to farm groups such as the National Farmers Federation, which has played a leading part in this regard. It is important that we work together to maintain the viability of our agricultural land. Certainly, all honourable members would recognise some of the salinity problems we have in some areas in which dried vine fruits are grown. There is still a lot more work to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the observation that the greatest problem with regard to conservation today is that of conserving our agricultural land. It is a pity that sometimes some of the trendies who live in the leafy suburbs in the cities think that it makes for good television coverage to wave placards in other areas. They have got the right to do that, but they often miss the fact that the biggest area that needs to be addressed-for the economic future and the conservation needs of this country-is agricultural land because it covers the majority of this country. Often it does not provide the greatest television pictures, and there are some people in the extremes of the conservation movement who I think are a little hypocritical when it comes to this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that those on both sides of the House are supporting this Bill. I believe it will go a long way towards improving research and development funding. As I have said, it is necessary that we improve our quality and maintain the advances in technology. If we do not, we will be left behind. I hope we will maintain our lead as a fine exporter of products and so earn more export dollars for Australia. </PARA>

If this is to be the decade when we worry about what we consume, how good it is and how well it is done using existing natural energy resources, there are few crops that can match the dried fruit industry. This is an industry that, like most rural industries, is close to nature. This is an industry which, as the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) well knows-and I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) is in the chair because his electorate is vitally concerned with it as well-is entirely dependent on the Mediterranean climate of the South Australian Riverland and Sunraysia area. It is, as the honourable member for Mallee has said, an industry that uses solar energy to dry its product and hastens that drying by the use of what are relatively non-toxic chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> The focus of the debate tonight is on the vine fruit industry and on the principal vine varieties: sultanas, muscat gordo blanco-or gordos, as they are commonly known, which, when dried, become raisins-and currants. As has been acknowledged by previous speakers, there is also a tree fruit industry that cannot be ignored when talking about the dried fruits industry in Australia. The principal tree fruit crop is apricots, followed by peaches, pears, nectarines and prunes. As I said, most of Australia's production of dried fruit comes out of the Sunraysia and Riverland area because of the climate. There is the capacity in that warm summer climate to dry fruit using solar energy, and that is why this area is so predominant in dried fruit production.</PARA>
<PARA> The area is entirely dependent on irrigation. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) has waxed eloquent about those things that the Government announced last night in the Budget in order to assist the Murray-Darling Basin Commission by raising its funding. Of course, I applaud any increase in funding for the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and what I hope will be the consequently improved quality of water flowing into South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the honourable member for Hinkler claims too much credit for this Budget decision to further increase Murray-Darling Basin Commission funding-and anything else would be scandalous neglect-let him consider for a moment the incentive offered by the Fraser-Howard Government in order to do something about the environment of the Murray-Darling basin when it said, `Let us make sure that we offer real tax deductability for water conveyancing', and an accelerated tax deductability program was introduced. It did not cost the Government a lot of money, but, as a result, every irrigator along the river was anxious to get away from the old-fashioned flood irrigation techniques he had once used and move into more modern irrigation techniques. No single initiative did as much as that tax deductability for water conveyancing to improve drainage and minimise salinity flows back into the Basin. The water needed to irrigate our dried fruit crops was improved by that incentive. When the Hawke Government came to office, the incentive was lost. So let the Government not claim too much credit for Murray-Darling basin funding or salinity falls. </PARA>
<PARA> The dried fruit industry, so dependent on good water, is a labour intensive industry. This House should remember that this labour intensive industry, involving labour which must frequently work in 40-degree heat, has also been told by this Government that if it wants labour from the Commonwealth Employment Service it will have to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA> As a one-time dried fruit producer, I do not mind paying to get labour sent to me if what I am offered is good, but I am yet to have anyone come with a guarantee to perform in 40-degree heat. Nothing used to irritate me as much as having young bucks come to me half way down a row of vines and say, `Boss, this is soul destroying work, I'm off', while the 40- or 50-year-old women who had worked for me for years were still there singing a song as they made their way down that row of vines. If the Government wants me to pay for labour, it should send me someone who wants to work. The conditions are not bad. They just call for a bit of guts and determination, which happens currently to be in short supply in our present unemployed work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the dried vine fruits industry. This labour intensive industry employs techniques as old as the pharaohs. Although the techniques may be old, they bring with them in Australian terms a measure of ingenuity and innovation that is characteristic of Australian primary producers. What is it that has enabled our industry to survive in an export market? The factor that has made it possible for the majority of Australian dried tree fruits and the majority of Australian dried vine fruits to be exported has been the innovation and ingenuity of Australian producers. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about an industry that is a world leader. In the areas of irrigation, cultivation and trellising, Australia shows the rest of the world how it ought to be done. Most of all, in the labour intensive area of drying techniques, Australia has adopted techniques that are the envy of the rest of the world. When I was a schoolboy, all apricots were dried by the painstaking effort of slicing each one, removing the stone, sitting them all on trays, stacking the trays, exposing them to sulphur dioxide, placing them in the sun, picking them up if it looked like rain, placing them in the sun again, and finally scraping them off the tray and sending them off to be processed. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more labour intensive and even more uncomfortable was the dried vine fruit technique which entailed picking grapes into a bucket, taking them up to trellised racks, dipping them in caustic, throwing them on the rack, waiting for them to dry, shaking them off the rack-itself a very laborious technique-placing them out on hessian runs in the sun, folding them up every night and raking them out every day. These labour intensive techniques are beginning to disappear thanks to the ingenuity of Australian producers. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, Australian dried fruit producers, instead of going through the technique I have just outlined to the House, drive past their grapes with a spray plant and spray the bunches of grapes on the vine, having cut the canes to ensure that the bunches of grapes are no longer getting nutrient from the vine. They then let the grapes dry on the vine and machine harvest them with a harvester not unlike the harvester used for wine grapes. This has been able to be done because of Australian ingenuity. </PARA>
<PARA> As if that were not enough, growers are introducing root stocks that allow them to dramatically increase production. In Australia from 1950 to 1955, the average production of sultanas was 2.21 tonnes to the hectare. In 1986-87 the average production was 4.44 tonnes to the hectare. This increased production is a credit entirely to adventurous Australian growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Because growers recognise the need to increase production, they are prepared to fund what it costs to find new and innovative production techniques. That is what this Bill is all about. This Bill will allow the dried fruit industry to charge itself up to 0.05 per cent of its average annual gross value of production. As is now its practice, the Commonwealth will match that amount dollar for dollar. So the cost to the industry, the cost to the growers in the electorates of Barker and Wakefield and Mallee will go from $4.50 a tonne to $5.75 a tonne and then, next year, to $7.40 a tonne. Under the present legislation, the maximum a grower can contribute is $5 a tonne. The growers have sought this change to allow them to make a greater contribution to research and development and to continue to do for the dried fruits industry what they have done for it in the past 70 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The dried tree fruit industry has already used this legislation to its benefit. As the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) said, the dried tree fruits industry will make a contribution of in excess of $13 a tonne in order to maximise the research and development funds at its disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the House is designed to encourage innovation. Most of all, it is designed to allow the industry not to adopt techniques from overseas-there are none-but to develop further techniques so that it can continue to lead the world. What marks this industry as different from other world competitors? One word-the honourable member for Hinkler to his credit used it-quality. It is quality product that distinguishes Australian dried tree fruits and Australian dried vine fruits from that produced by the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> By world standards the Australian dried tree fruit industry really is a very small industry. Australia is the second largest producer of dried apricots in the world, yet we produce only 10 per cent of global production. In a good year the Australian crop in dried apricots might amount to about 3,000 tonnes. Last year the Turkish crop was 35,000 tonnes and, with the trees already in the ground, it is known that it will rise to 50,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifty thousand tonnes of dried apricots is an awful lot of little, shrivelled orange balls. These little, shrivelled orange balls are being imported into Australia. Is it any wonder that the Australian industry, so indignant at what was happening to it, put out an advertising campaign on the sides of buses that said, `One of these apricots is a lemon'. </PARA>
<PARA> What were those apricots? One was an Australian apricot and the other was Turkish. There are no prizes for guessing which was the lemon and no prizes for guessing why the Turkish importers were a shade indignant about this very effective advertising campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian fruit was and is distinctly different from Turkish fruit. From a cost of production point of view, it cannot match Turkish fruit, but if you will pardon the pun, Mr Deputy Speaker, it eats the Turkish industry when one looks at a comparison for quality. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to suppose that there are not things that we can learn from the Turks. The Turks, for example, have some varieties of apricots that are better than the ones available to Australians. We could do well to import some of those varieties in order to raise the sugar levels of our fruit. We know that, and part of the technique that dried fruit growers want as a result of their research and development is the opportunity to develop better root stocks. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn from the dried tree fruits scheme to the dried vine fruits scheme. Once again, by world standards Australia's production of fruit is relatively small. We would not produce 10 per cent of dried vine fruits. Last year the production of sultanas around the world was estimated at 721,000 tonnes, of which Australia produced 57,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians, knowing that the product they get from the Australian producer is the best product available, are, in fact, the highest consumers of dried vine fruits in the world, and that level of consumption is rising. </PARA>
<PARA> The average per capita consumption of dried vine fruits by Australians has gone from 2.07 kilograms per capita-that is what it was; the highest in the world-to 2.16 kilograms per capita. I am pleased and proud to say that there are those in this very chamber who have made a real contribution to the increased consumption of Australian dried vine fruits. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) will forgive me if I use his name, but not in vain. Not everyone in this chamber would agree with the politics of the honourable member for O'Connor, but no-one in this chamber could deny that he has to be among the most enthusiastic and energetic of all 148 of us. Where does he get his energy? He said to me-and I hope he will not mind the story-`I love porridge or muesli, but what it needs is a handful of sultanas sprinkled on top of it. So I called the Angas Park Fruit Co., picked him up a 15 kilogram cardboard carton of sultanas and dropped them into his office. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, he came to me and said, `I finished those off, Neil', and he is a picture of health, you would have to agree, Mr Deputy Speaker. `I want to get another two cartons and I am heading back to Western Australia this weekend, driving through the Riverland; where can I do it?'. So I rang Ian Thorn of the Australian Dried Fruits Association who left two cartons of dried sultanas for him in Mildura on Friday. He is one who knows that you really can be a ray of sunshine if you get yourself into the sultana industry and help to lift that consumption. He is one who has helped to get the figure to 2.16 kilograms per capita. </PARA>
<PARA> But all is not sweetness-pardon the pun-and light in the dried sultana industry because that industry, like the apricot industry, faces a real threat from imported fruit being dumped in Australia. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) made the point that the Greek industry has a subsidy that the rest of the world would envy, and that subsidised fruit is now being used to replace, in some cases, Australian fruit and, in other cases, Turkish fruit. It does not matter where it comes from; it is making it harder for Australians to sell a product that now only sells because of its quality. What do we do about it?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not find my realistic dried fruit growers crying out for tariff protection. I find them saying, `Let's make sure that, when countries choose to dump inferior product in Australia, they are obliged to do two things: they are obliged to match our labelling standards, and they are obliged to ensure that there is some sort of rapid track anti-dumping procedure in place. They are the two things they want from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that, they will do all they can to ensure that they continue to have the most efficient industry in the world and they continue to produce product which is the envy of the rest of the world. Mr Deputy Speaker, nowhere else will you find product as clean. There is nothing worse than grit in dried fruit, but the Australians have done more than anyone else to eliminate it. Nowhere else is product as clean; nowhere else is product as competitive. Why? Because Australian growers, like primary producers right across this nation, are prepared to put their hands in their pockets and make money available for research to ensure that their production remains ahead of the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In common with the rest of the primary producers in this country, the dried vine fruit growers are prepared to make a contribution that the Commonwealth has said it will match. That will help to keep this industry competitive and for that reason the Opposition is pleased to support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a former resident of Sunraysia and having worked on fruit blocks on a number of occasions, having lived in the region for quite a while, I must say it is with great pleasure that I speak on this legislation. In fact, without wishing to divide the National Party and the Liberal Party, I must say that I think the best dried fruits come from the Mallee electorate and just over the border in the electorates of Riverina-Darling and Farrer. So it is with great pleasure that I speak on this Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill. I was interested to hear that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) consumes 15 kilograms of dried fruit at a time. No wonder he is not in favour of the consumption tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) adopted the old Tory habit of knocking Australian workers to some extent, as often happens. I do not know whether he has actually seen the fruit pickers' side of things occasionally but, having travelled on trains with pickers, I can tell him that one can hear some pretty rough stories about conditions that have been provided to them. I am really pleased to know that conditions are now better on the fruit blocks of Australia since the days I used to travel on those trains. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say to the honourable member that, like every employer, he needs to have some tolerance of the workers, especially young workers when they start, because experience counts. It may well be that older people can pick better and pick more, and it certainly takes experience to be able pick fruit properly. In any sort of seasonal job like that, it takes time and experience, and I agree that you certainly need a very high dose of enthusiasm in the first week or two of picking. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the industry is right when it says that it wants more research and development, but it is not to be denied that important research and development have occurred in past years. The Australian Dried Fruits Corporation commissioned, only a couple of years ago, the Flour Milling and Baking Research Organisation to look at the suitability of sultanas and raisins for baking in bread and cakes. </PARA>
<PARA> It was shown that Australia outperformed or equalled the performance of its competitors in every category when sultanas or raisins were incorporated in fruited bread and cakes. They outperformed in cleanliness. They did well with the low sulphur dioxide shown in the dried fruit. Moisture and moisture uptake recorded well for Australia, and soluble solids recorded well. These tests are very important because about a half of Australia's sultanas to Europe are for manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting, in spite of the fact that the honourable member for Wakefield was critical of the Turkish fruit, that Turkey and Australia shared highest average volumes in the tests, so Turkey was not all that bad. In fact, I should say that today particularly because we have had a delegation to this Parliament from Turkey. I acknowledge that there are some areas where Turkey has done well but, for cleanliness, Australia topped the list and we all know, as the honourable member for Murray said, that there is more that can be done in Australia in the dried fruit industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been export markets developed. In fact, expenditure on that has nearly doubled since 1980, and there has been heavy promotion in the Federal Republic of Germany, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway and Asia. As well as that, there has been good cooperation with the sultana and raisin producing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice Mr Bruce Milburn is in the advisers' section of the chamber. As Assistant Secretary of the horticultural branch of the crops division of the Australian Department of Primary Industries and Energy he chaired a conference held in Melbourne in 1988. He was able to welcome visitors to Australia from a number of countries. That conference set aims and objectives to pool the knowledge of all those countries involved; to avoid the disasters which can occur to any industry from low prices; to encourage scientific research into production and into disease; and to develop new markets. So it set some pretty important aims and objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of that work that has been done-research, development, having a look at coordinating with other countries of the world-there is still much to be done, and I agree with all the previous speakers that it is extremely important that this legislation is passed and that they are able get on with the job of good, sound research and development. There is potential. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States of America exported to Japan 12 times the amount of dried fruit as Australia did in 1988. In the United Kingdom most of the dried fruit was obtained from the European Community. In the Federal Republic of Germany, where we have done a degree of promotion, Australia is exporting twice the amount that the United States is exporting and about 30 per cent more than Europe was exporting. In New Zealand an amount of subsidised dried fruit is obtained from Greece, but Australia provides about two-thirds of its raisins. It is extremely important that we provide for the increase in the maximum rate of levy for dried vine fruit destined for research and development, and it will be moving from $5 to $10 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> I applaud the legislation and believe that we ought to hear the industry's concerns that legislative provisions may prevent it from being able to raise these funds to the level the Commonwealth has undertaken to match. It is with great pleasure that I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleagues on both sides of the House for the support they have given tonight to an industry that is an integral part of my electorate of Mallee and the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian dried fruit industry by any criteria is, I think, a miracle of modern horticulture in Australia. Here we have a highly labour intensive industry, a high cost of production industry, an industry involving intensive management on small holdings but with excellent quality standards, responsible packaging and processing, significant contributions being made to research and promotion programs and, above all, dedicated and competent leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> This industry has, for years, defied general trends. As a contributor to our national income, the dried fruit industry is not large but its importance and contribution to regional Australia-in particular, to the Sunraysia and mid-Murray sections of my constituency-are immense. Estimates range from about $120m to $150m on an annual basis. It is also, of course, a vital sector in relation to the diversity of horticultural crops that, together, weld a success story of regional growth and productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of my colleagues have given statistics relating to the importance and significance of dried fruit throughout Australia to the House tonight, and I do not wish to delay the House by repeating many of those statistics. I just say that production for 1990 was approximately 57,000 tonnes of sultanas, with significantly lower but important tonnages of currants and raisins. For the year ended February 1990, the total Australian consumption of dried vine fruit was 34,809 tonnes. I mention this because the industry has a significant domestic market in Australia and, as a result, very successful marketing practices which-as other members have pointed out-on an annual basis have raised the consumption of dried fruit in Australia because of its excellent quality and the industry's promotional activities. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it also indicates a very heavy dependence on international markets. The immediate prospects appear very favourable for our dried fruit crop, in spite of our very high dollar, our continuing inflation and our high interest rates, combined with an increasing flow of imported fruit into this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three closely related events that have the potential to dramatically affect the viability of our dried fruit crop in the 1990s. All three are products of policy determinations by the Government and Opposition parties, many of them aimed at forcing surviving Australian industries to be more internationally competitive, particularly by discouraging inefficient use of the nation's resources, and by a pursuit of a freer trade philosophy in Australia in order to encourage reduced protection and assistance to the industry worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not disagree with these policies, and the objectives are fine. They are fine, of course, provided it is not your industry that is one of the inevitable casualties that we have seen over the last few years. The industries have been forced to compete in a corrupt international trading environment and compelled to pay arbitrary prices for Australian labour and government services-fuel, power, water, et cetera-in many cases with diminishing or non-existent support for disciplined marketing arrangements, or even protection from injury from dumped or subsidised surpluses from other nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Imports of heavily subsidised or cheap fruit of questionable quality have been spoken about in this chamber tonight. This is occurring at a time when Australia is in the process of reducing levels of tariff protection to our own industry. I simply ask the House-and particularly point out to the Government-is it fair to continue with some of the developed country preferences that we now provide? A country like Turkey, that was producing and exporting fruit to the world before the pyramids were built, is on a 5 per cent tariff preference as against the Australian product. I believe the Government must immediately look at this preference that is provided to the Turkish crop. </PARA>
<PARA> I also ask the consumers who may be listening tonight whether they know that when they buy most of the home brand products of dried fruit in our supermarkets they are, in fact, purchasing fruit that has been imported from overseas countries, particularly from Turkey. In line with many of the changes that are taking place in relation to protection in this country, it is important, on the other side of the scale, that labelling laws, quality laws and practices of marketing in this country are adequately looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> Imported fruit in this country is not inspected to comply with the standards we expect of our own product. These products will continue to undermine consumer confidence in dried fruit generally and will destabilise prices on the excellent dried fruit market that has, as I have mentioned, been developed by the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Under attack at the same time, and facing a challenge, are many of our past marketing arrangements for Australia's primary produce. Many of these arrangements have been judged to be capable of sustaining domestic prices above world price level. Statutory equalisation of returns, underwriting and statutory arrangements to support the orderly marketing of primary products are in the firing line and, of course, will be the subject of legislation in this Parliament possibly later this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say to Government members who have spoken tonight with such enthusiasm about the significance and the efficiency of the Australian dried fruit industry that I look forward to similar support, when that debate takes place, to ensure that the growers of the product are able to have some say in the destiny and marketing of that product. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry's disciplined and structured approach to marketing has been developed over many years in the school of hard knocks, and it has now had a century of experience. The industry continues to strive to moderate the severity of a number of policy decisions that it sees impacting on its future. Given this scenario, it has never been more important that the industry maintains its own structured and disciplined approach to marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of horticulture, unfortunately, in this country demonstrates the pitiful returns for growers that result from a fragmented marketing effort. The voluntary unification of our marketing effort through the Australian Dried Fruit Corporation's cooperative structure is crucial to every grower's viability in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> As other speakers have pointed out, the Dried Fruits Levy Amendment Bill which we are discussing tonight is one of many pieces of legislation used to collect rural research and development levies. As the Parliament knows, the Commonwealth pays $1 for $1 from the amount of money raised for this research up to a level of 0.5 per cent of the average annual gross value of industry production. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, most rural industries in Australia today are endeavouring to increase their levy up to that level to obtain the maximum government support. The maximum rate that the industry can levy is $5 a tonne and, under this legislation, that will be increased to $10 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry currently pays a levy of $4.50 a tonne, which is 61 per cent of that 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product that I mentioned. The industry wants to increase that levy to $5.75 a tonne this year and reach that 0.5 per cent level of $7.40 a tonne next year. This is the intent of the legislation we are debating tonight. It has the support of the industry and of this Parliament and it will be passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian dried fruit industry has always placed great emphasis on research and development. In recent years the focus of research has changed from the currently large number of small projects to a greater concentration of projects with higher returns to the industry. At present, approximately 33 per cent of research funds have been allocated to improving the efficiency of dried vine fruit products. Just over one third, 35 per cent, have been allocated to improving fruit quality and 15 per cent to developing new products. These are just some of the projects being undertaken by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> High interest rates and the insecurity created by a reduction of market power in the industry caused by the withdrawal of some legislative support from the industry's marketing arrangements create a hazardous environment for an industry that has been extremely creative in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, we look forward to legislation coming into this Parliament that will affect some of the marketing structures of the industry over the years ahead. I say to the Government: please approach this industry with care; take note of the view being put forward by a very competent leadership, particularly in relation to the maintenance of export markets by the industry; and look into the suggestions that have been floated that the Australian dried fruit industry be placed under the umbrella of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a specialist industry. It has been highly successful in a volatile world trading environment. This industry deals with perishable products whose production worldwide, as well as locally, is always severely affected by the fluctuations of demand and climate. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past, under its existing structures, it has been successful in meeting these challenges and I have no doubt that it will be successful in the future if it is allowed the opportunity to continue basically with the same arrangements that it has at present. We do not want to see the awful mess created in this industry that has been created in other sectors of the grape industry, particularly in the table grape industry, over recent years. That industry has been left in an horrendous situation-in a debt situation which is affecting the whole of the grape industry in the wine and dried fruits area. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by taking a little bit of licence, as most of my colleagues have done tonight, and simply mentioning the impact of grower levies as far as the Department of Primary Industries and Energy budget is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> We see from the Budget Papers that in 1989-90 the Government contributed some $445m to primary industry. The budgeted figure for this financial year, $423m, is a reduction on that sum. The projected figures for the next three years are again reductions to $356m, $349m and $308m respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems a paradox that at a time when Australia is trying to increase its export returns-and the most valuable industries are the rural industries-the Government is reducing its contributions on an annual basis. While it is doing this it is claiming that it is putting more money into the primary industry sector simply because of the fact that grower levies are increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the rural community will pay some $1,369.9m in levies and charges. It is possibly the only department in Federal Government responsibility whose major costs are being funded by grower levies and the industry itself. I am sure that this is not generally recognised either by the community or by many people within the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I acknowledge the return in the Budget of tax deductability for expenses relating to the protection of our most vital resource-our soil. Soil, water and sun are the major ingredients behind the successful and efficient production of the Australian dried fruit crop. Tax deductability for fencing and soil conservation works will go a long way towards ensuring that the future of this industry in areas prone to damage is assured. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that this is only a restoration of a tax deductability arrangement that existed under the coalition Government. It is quite legitimate for this Government to now restore this measure. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent years a major revolution has been taking place through the irrigated areas of the Murray Valley. A lot of this has been as a result of on-farm improvements in management practices and techniques by Australian horticulturalists. We can spend a lot of money through statutory arrangements, through ministerial councils, through River Murray commissions-all of them are important-but any great success in bringing about massive changes to the problem of salinity, and to the inflow of nutrients into our major rivers and streams, will result from the Australian farming community. And it is. I just hope that the Government recognises this and maintains and increases support to this vital area. </PARA>

<PARA> At the outset, I indicate that the Opposition, whilst allowing this Bill passage, will be moving an amendment which is now being circulated.

It is to be registered as a normal company with all of its shares, however, owned by the Commonwealth and the Minister having the power to give directions, which are to be published in guidelines. I might say that I cannot find them in the Act, and as far as I am aware they have not been made available. There are also other requirements that the Government is imposing into the Act. It is a major step in implementing a change to the operation of government activity. During the course of this speech I will provide criticisms and reasons why we believe that this is but a halfway measure. Nevertheless, we support it as a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth Serum Laboratories was established in 1916. It followed World War I as an arm of the quarantine service so that Australia could be self-sufficient in vaccines in times of war and peace. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories has progressed with great distinction. All of us in this country are grateful for the work it does and will continue to do. In 1923 it was one of the four laboratories world-wide to produce insulin. In 1944 CSL enabled Australia to be the first country to supply penicillin to its civilian population. I am sure that the Minister for Science and Technology, who is at the table, can testify to the great ingenuity and scientific capability which Australians have and which are quite often too little recognised in our community. During the time that I was shadow Minister for science that was very apparent. When we look at the achievements of Australians, particularly in the science field, we see that many have been very distinguished but little recognised. Those who work within CSL today and who worked with that organisation in those early days fall into that category.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1961 CSL became a statutory authority. Its charter focused on the performance of national interest functions and, in particular, the manufacture of prescribed biological pharmaceutical products and serums. At that time provision was also made for limited commercial operations using any excess manufacturing capacity. That is the key word-commercial. In 1961 the decision was made to allow CSL to become more commercial. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1989 the government of the day finally recognised that CSL ought to be far more commercial. It, in common with many other government business enterprises, was having difficulties in maintaining its market share. It was calling upon the Commonwealth for additional capital, as is the case with so many government business enterprises, and it was felt, rightly, that those enterprises ought to be made far more commercial and that there ought to be more line management capacity within those organisations. That is partly why this Bill has been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the profits that are being made by CSL, one sees that its sales revenue increased from $33m in 1981 to $127m in 1988-89. Pre-tax profits have increased from $1.5m to $11.5m in the space of about eight years. That is a particularly good record. The Commonwealth is drawing from that a 40 per cent dividend on CSL's post-tax profit and the organisation was subject to State payroll and land taxes, as well as corporate tax. So in many senses CSL has been acting as a separate company. This Bill seeks to take an additional step further down that path. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the amendment that I am moving tonight seeks to negate this middle, unnecessary step. I pose the question to the Government: Why not take this final step and let CSL enter the marketplace, let the shares that are being held by the Government be offered in part to the staff-if they wish to take them up-and to the wider community in what is demonstrably a successful government business enterprise?</PARA>
<PARA> I pointed out that this announcement was made on 16 August 1989. For a whole host of reasons, which perhaps the Minister for Science and Technology or some other Minister may reveal when summing up, this Bill arrived in the House only today. Meanwhile, what has been happening? These delays occasion great difficulties for business enterprises when they feel uncertain about their future and they are also unable to meet some of the commercial activities that their charter requires them to meet. This is certainly the case with CSL. Indeed, if one goes back to the 1988-89 annual report of CSL, one sees a revealing paragraph on page 18 which talks about the future in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Rapid change is occurring world-wide affecting the pharmaceutical industry. Regrouping of market forces at national and continental levels, mergers and takeovers of major firms in the industry, escalating research and development costs and technology advances are factors which seem to make the future of small nationally confined firms increasingly uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously that report was written at the beginning of 1988 to be issued halfway through 1989. No formal decision has been taken by the Government to finalise its position until this Bill came before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), will talk in more detail about the necessity for and the impact of this increasing globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry and the need to allow those that are in this area to take off the shackles and be competitive in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading speech reveals some interesting things. The CSL, once this Bill is passed and it is a fully fledged company but with its shares wholly owned by the Government, will have to produce a corporate plan. It is interesting when we look at the Inside CSL publication-the newsletter from the CSL-to see that there is a new Managing Director, Dr Brian McNamee, and we wish him well. On the front page of the June-July newsletter Dr McNamee says:</PARA>
<PARA> Securing federal government agreement to our Strategic Plan is our first step in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> As soon as the plan is approved by government, I will talk to staff about the details of our new strategies. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the very point I am trying to address in our amendment. Why is it necessary for experts, who are charged to run a commercial enterprise, to have to fix up a strategic corporate plan in Melbourne, based on what they perceive to be the marketplace opportunities for them, both nationally and globally, and then come to Canberra, tug their forelocks before the Minister and say, `Here is my strategic plan, Minister, do you agree?'. It is a nonsense. It is not necessary. I am asking: Why not go the whole way and put CSL up for sale? It will operate in the national interest as it always has done and always will do. CSL is returning a profit now. That profit can be more beneficial to the nation if it is returned to the enterprise than taken from the enterprise for the broader purposes of government. There is no necessity to have that additional filter, that additional group of bureaucrats in Canberra, to oversee and supervise its strategic plan. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the June-July issue of Inside CSL indicates clearly a fundamental flaw in the arrangement of this enterprise. Where we have this type of arrangement in government, we will not get the best out of those organisations or those enterprises to benefit broadly the taxpayer but, more importantly, the consumer of the product. Admittedly, the CSL product is vitally important. But its community service obligations, I was advised by the CSL today, are very limited. They constitute about one to 2 per cent of snake venoms. CSL takes the view that they would be more than happy to continue providing those in a fully fledged commercial environment purely for the good public relations that it generates. Many companies that are not part of government but are in the commercial field have very much the same attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> From reading the annual report of the CSL and the Inside CSL newsletters, I have the distinct impression that that organisation is itching to get going and to get away from the controls of government. I ask: Why is it necessary for the Government to hold on to that organisation? It is not necessary. All it is doing is providing government with additional funds by way of taxation. If CSL is to meet that point about its future-that is, meet national and international competition and be a major player in the globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry-it will need further equity capital. Where does it go if it wants to get equity capital? If CSL wants more money to expand, to build new laboratories, who does it go to? It goes to its shareholders as every other company must do. It goes to the Government and asks for the money. What will the Government say?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government had to wait until the death knock before it could find $100m to give to Aussat Pty Ltd. We know the problems in Aussat are great. But the Government had to find $100m for that organisation. Qantas Airways Ltd wants about $500m urgently. Australian Airlines Ltd wants $300m urgently. All of us in this place know the pressures on government finances. We know the pressures on the borrowings of the Government, yet we are seeing that these enterprises either come to the Government for further equity funds or go out and borrow. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has included CSL in this new arrangement to be subject to global borrowing requirements. So what will the Government do when CSL comes along and says that it wants to borrow? The Government will look at its total public sector borrowing requirement and say, `So you want to borrow $200m to pursue a commercial opportunity which your strategic plan shows us is necessary to make you increasingly competitive, to hold your market share'. Will the Government then turn around and say, `No, we are sorry but there is a higher priority. Because we can't make a decision about what we want to do with airlines, you will have to wait in the queue because the airlines are the ones that will get access to the limited financial resources that are available to us or because of the impact on total government borrowings'?</PARA>
<PARA> That is the very point about privatisation. We are looking at industries or government business enterprises (GBEs) that do not need to be in government. This is a classic case of one that does not and it ought to be delivered to the marketplace, subjected to the disciplines of the market and also the advantages of the marketplace so that it can go to a broad range of shareholders for additional funds and it can continue to expand and offer the service that it has offered so well in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The principles of privatisation were spelt out by us at the last election and even over the last several days the Opposition has made major decisions with regard to privatisation. Indeed, yesterday we made a major decision with regard to telecommunications and the ultimate privatisation of the third leg of the telecommunications triad in Australia. We have already indicated that OTC and Aussat should be fully privatised. We are opposed to the monster-com that is proposed by the Government and we are in favour of privatising Telecom when that is able to be done, once we have far greater commerciality and competition within the telecommunications network in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> When one makes a major decision like that one canvasses all the issues, but foremost in one's mind is what benefits will accrue to consumers and taxpayers. That is the primary principle and it is the responsibility of those of us who pursue privatisation. If one applies that test to CSL, there would be only benefits to the consumer and the taxpayer if CSL were to be privatised. There is no down side that I can see. In fact, when one reads the second reading speech of the Minister, one can see some very stark conflicts. On page four he states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . as a truly commercial enterprise that can respond quickly in the market place free from day to day government regulatory controls. </PARA>
<PARA>But that is not true. It cannot respond quickly because it has an ongoing restraint of access to future capital. It has to tug its forelock when it brings its strategic plan to Canberra to the Minister and it is also subject to the controls of the Loan Council. If that is not a conflict, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that it wants to encourage value-added manufacturing within Australia without the requirement for underpinning by the Commonwealth. Yet underpinning by the Commonwealth still continues. We would all applaud value-added manufacturing, but we want it done efficiently and effectively and we want it done in the best interests of the taxpayer and the consumer. Just as the Government has been unable to make decisions with regard to the airlines, in allowing this Bill to come forward, it has been unable to make a decision about this particular enterprise. If the Government cannot make a decision about CSL-one of the smallest and most obvious government business enterprises for privatisation-how will it ever be able to make a decision about the more vital areas, in terms of the impact on the economy, such as our airlines?</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the Budget yesterday missed an opportunity. The leaked letter from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) revealed that micro-economic reform was the priority issue. The community was led to believe that decisions would be made about the airlines. They have not been made. When will they be made-some time after September when the unions and the emerging power of the left wing of the Labor Party have cast their opinions at a special conference?</PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, things get worse. Have Government Ministers talked to the airlines? Have they really heard what is happening? The airlines are facing massive increases in fuel right now. They have borrowing and leasing programs in place and they are starting to lose market share-certainly Qantas Airways Ltd is concerned about its international market share. Yet we have had these continual delays. In fact, there is almost a discounting of the price that might be returned even if the Government were to agree to privatise these enterprises fully as we propose, because the Government has delayed. There has been a 12-month delay in relation to CSL and it has slipped in terms of what is happening globally. I believe that the Government has been negligent in addressing the interests of the consumers and taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, there is such great confusion about the approach that the Government ought to take with regard to this area that it ought to be of real concern to those more rational elements on the other side of the House. Mr Hawke in his famous `light on the hill' speech of 21 September 1987 said:</PARA>
<PARA> What in the name of reason is the justification for breaking up and selling off the great and efficient national assets, like the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, TAA and Qantas . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Yet on 9 July this year in the Sydney Morning Herald Mr Hawke had an about-face. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> They've got to ask themselves whether it is the best use of scarce resources to fund airlines, which means if you do that, there's less available to fund obligations towards private citizens which the private sector will never undertake. </PARA>
<PARA>What about the Treasurer (Mr Keating)? I felt that he was deceitful today during the discussion of the matter of public importance when he said to the shadow Treasurer (Mr Reith), `Give me an intellectual argument why the micro-economic reform package ought to have been announced in the Budget'. We do not need to give an intellectual decision or reason. The Government established the agenda, made the announcements and led the community to believe that the issue of micro-economic reform would be the major issue. It led the Opposition and the community to believe that further important decisions with an impact on the public sector borrowing requirement and an impact on the inputs and costs to business to benefit taxpayers would be made in the Budget. But they were not. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the Opposition that is saying this. Some of the Government's friends in the media are saying it today also. One can read in any of the editorials that a very important component of the whole Budget process-the impact on the community and the economy-is missing from yesterday's Budget in this area of micro-economic reform. I say again, if the Government cannot make a decision about CSL, which is one of the easiest decisions that it could make in the micro-economic area to benefit taxpayers and consumers-by removing the shackles of government, by privatising it fully and by allowing it to progress rather than stepping down this path ever so carefully and gingerly-we are not going to get any decisions of lasting benefit to the broader community in relation to these major GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer joined the Prime Minister in an about face on this issue. In the Hansard of 23 May 1985, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party will fight tooth and nail to keep these public authorities in the hands of the Commonwealth. We are about refurbishing them and keeping them strong. We are not about wrecking them and selling them. The great public services they provide will continue to be provided while ever this Government has the breath to defend them. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation AM radio program on 23 May 1988, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . basically, I don't think the Government ought to be running airlines. And that's why I think their equity ought to be sold down. </PARA>
<PARA>He has now changed his mind. There is nothing wrong with changing one's mind, so long as it is a reasoned decision and is in the best interests of the people that we are all here to serve. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knows the difficulties that we have in this country because of the stewardship of this economy. Whether we accept the Government's arguments that they are externally imposed or the Government accepts our argument that it is the Government's fault, the Australian public knows that there has been a decline in living standards and it is our duty to look for solutions and policies that can lead to a better standard of living for every Australian, regardless of how he or she votes. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that is clearly necessary is the privatisation of business functions that do not need to be in the hands of government. CSL is a classic example. If the Government were to take a decision tonight to withdraw this Bill and allow CSL to be privatised immediately, where would be the damage to the taxpayers or the consumers? What about the advantages? There is no down side in privatising CSL. Yet we have sat around for 12 months; CSL has waited, unsure of its future, and the community is not sure where it is going. Yet this could have been a prime example for the Government to illustrate to the community that it was not wedded to the in-concrete position in its platform, that it was flexible and was recognising the financial and economic dilemmas that this country faced; but, no. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that this Bill that has crept in late at night could have been a flag issue for the Labor Party. It could have been one on which it displayed some leadership and displayed that it was not going to take the ever cautious approach; that it did see that some vision was needed in order to provide some light and hope for people in Australia in terms of where we are going and what the economic impact of these policies will be. But, no, it is more of the same. It is almost ironic that this Bill has sat around for 12 months and now comes forward the day after the Budget. As many said in editorials today, it is yet another damp squib; it is more of the same. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it intriguing that the Government has not taken that opportunity. If one looks closely at the Minister's second reading speech, one can see that he is almost saying, `Yes, we believe in commercialisation and we believe in corporatisation in terms of turning these business enterprises into companies'. Certainly, there will be greater efficiencies, and the Government is giving greater line management to people and allowing them to be far more performance oriented. We applaud that. That is why we are supporting this legislation and want it to pass. I would have liked to have seen it pass some 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not really necessary to have this middle step, this halfway house, which is only a brief stop on the way towards the inevitable. I say to the Government as so many people inside this place and outside are saying: Why not accept that the inevitable must happen and take that bold step to the benefit of the taxpayers and consumers? The Government can call it something other than `privatisation' if that word sticks in its craw, but for goodness sake do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just had an interesting trip around many countries. It does not matter what ideology people pursue; privatisation is embraced in 83 countries in a range of areas. Consumers and taxpayers are benefiting. More importantly, governments of different political persuasions-Austria, Somalia, South Africa, Israel, the United States of America and Great Britain-have all benefited by pursuing this path. This has not been done in an ideological binge; it has been done in a measured, pragmatic way to bring benefits to taxpayers and consumers. I have to keep saying that because it is the underlying principle of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Until the Government accepts and understands that it is all right to change its mind and act in the best interests of Australians, this country cannot go forward. Let us look at the size of government business enterprises (GBEs) and at transport and communications. There are eight GBEs in this area, and the book value of the assets representing the debt, equity capital and retained earnings of the enterprises was $28.5 billion. As at June 1989, this amounted to an estimated investment of $1,696 for every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the 1989-90 public sector borrowing requirement, the share for Commonwealth public authorities was $2.65 billion, of which 80 per cent was for GBEs in the transport and communications portfolio. The aggregate number of employees in the eight GBEs and the Federal Airports Authority and Civil Aviation Authority in 1989 was 163,477, or 3 per cent of the Australian work force. In terms of inputs into the production of goods and services by the private sector in 1986-87, business paid $29 billion for government-provided goods and services, of which 40 per cent was provided by Commonwealth authorities, principally transport and communications. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not talking about a small impact on the Commonwealth's total business sector. Unless the Government starts to make some of the small decisions, which will inevitably lead it to the big decisions, we will never get anywhere. We have to root out the inbuilt inefficiencies and featherbedding. As I said, other countries, regardless of their ideology, have recognised this principle and embraced it to their benefit and that of their consumers, taxpayers and citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> We must recognise that governments have a limited role. It is not their role to take up every business opportunity and to say that because they took up that role in 1911 or 1916, nothing can change. It can. It was interesting this afternoon to hear the Treasurer say, `Look, things have changed. The 1990s are not the late 1970s or early 1980s.' Things have changed, and we on this side of the House recognise that. That is why we have put forward the amendment. That is why we made a decision about the goods and services tax. That is why we made a major decision yesterday on telecommunications. That is why tonight we announced a decision on a reduction in tariffs and protection. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to take this country somewhere in the 1990s. We do not want to wed ourselves to the past. That is what the legislation indicates. The Australian Labor Party takes a little step forward a little at a time, ever cautious, always looking over its shoulder to see what is happening with regard to the interpretation of the platform by the troglodytes and the left wing. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time-this is my personal view-under this Government, the executive of the Labor Party is being dictated to by its extra-parliamentary wing. That is what the September conference is all about. It is no longer about good government. It is about letting the Party start to assert itself. We have seen Ministers going off in various directions on basic decisions about privatisation, all of them jockeying for position. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the concern about what should happen for the taxpayers? They know that borrowing limits have to be imposed and funds rationed. Now is the time for us to seize the opportunity as a nation to get out of the businesses in which the Government should not be involved. Let those businesses go out into the marketplace to raise their equity more widely so that they not only maintain their market share but also grow. If that happens, we will get a far healthier economy and a business sector that is much more responsive to the needs of the people of this nation. Overall, we will have a far better society. More importantly, we will address the basic needs of Australians by ensuring that their tax dollars are being used on what they really need-welfare, education and infrastructure, such as sewers-rather than being diverted into activities where they are not needed and where others are prepared to provide funds by way of equity and investment in enterprises such as CSL. It is a pity that we have reached this stage with the Bill. Therefore, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>``whilst not opposing the passage of this limited Bill, the House is of the opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) CSL should be fully privatised immediately; and</PARA>
<PARA>(2) there should be a full and complete divestment of all the Commonwealth interest and control in CSL as is proposed by this Bill''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the Australian dictionary is about to be redefined and rephrased. Day after day, we hear that micro-economic reform means flogging off. It is about selling government business at whatever price one can get, just getting rid of them and not thinking of national interests. I can understand the logic that is used by conservatives in this place. Once government businesses are sold, they are someone else's problem and they are no longer the responsibility of the owner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We heard almost 30 minutes of a speech by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) focused on his ideological conclusion that the best answer for the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) is to sell it. He implied that people in CSL cannot wait for it to be sold. The reason is simple-they will get access to capital. I have news for them: Go into the marketplace as a company manager or secretary and ask a board for capital and see how you go. I have news for CSL: If it thinks that being flogged off will give it access to capital, it is in for one hell of a shock. </PARA>
<PARA> Another suggestion is to sell off the lot, but we were not told whether it would be sold to Australians or to someone else. That was not mentioned in the amendment or in the speech by the honourable member for Bass. Who in the world has enough cash to buy CSL? The employees will sell their shares as soon as they are worth while. CSL will therefore become a nice little segment of one of the major international companies. That is micro-economic reform-transferring a skills centre of international excellence into one of the numerous overseas companies which has the cash and capital available to take it over. Over the past half hour, that was the nub of the speech by the honourable member for Bass. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the components. We have heard that the public service component under section 19 of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act is only about one per cent. It does that for nothing; it does it for free, as would apparently many other drug companies. How come then that it has been getting so much money in the Budget? How come it has been getting so many million dollars if that component is only one per cent? On my calculations, in 1989-90 the figure was much closer to 10 per cent on section 19(1)(b), let alone the other parts of its products that the Government actually purchases. Does anybody seriously think that today Australia would have funnel-web antivenom if the Government did not own CSL?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest that the honourable member talk to the people I spoke to three years ago at CSL who were doing that. They told us the kind of costs involved and that the commercial world did not want to know about it because the demand was so low. The other potential was if the State governments and the Commonwealth were forced to buy it. No-one would buy it commercially, and the situation was similar for snake antivenom. I find it interesting that in 1961, when CSL was made a statutory body with primarily a public responsibility, there was a conservative government in power. In other words, the other side helped make CSL great. That Government established it because no-one was doing the things that were needed. They were not viable commercially.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government put tax dollars into CSL to do things the country and the community needed but were not sufficiently profitable for the market forces that those opposite talked about. Having done that, they are now saying we should sell it off. I suppose the corollary would then be that in the future, if there were another public need that the commercial market did not want to solve, we would start a new body. Otherwise they would have to tell the taxpayers and their constituencies that if there is a future public need they will not address it. Yet their predecessors did, and that is what I find so ironic. It is a wonder that the party that helped to establish a number of Australia's statutory bodies, which have been unique in many ways, is so eager to say how badly those bodies have done. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the figures for CSL, the honourable member for Bass quoted the improved profit and turnover figures over 6 1/2 years. I cannot think of many companies that have improved that much in that time. In fact, I cannot think of any at all with that kind of performance record. Yet, according to the Opposition, we must sell it because it is inefficient. By default, because it is government-owned it must be incompetent. That is what he is saying and that is what those opposite have been saying all the way through. That is what they are saying to the CSL employees, their management and everybody else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened very carefully. I suggest that those people who believe that being privately owned makes a company good should spend a little time working for the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. They would find out how efficient and effective it was privately owned. An organisation like CSL, which is government owned, is clearly efficient and effective. Selling it will not make it good, but it will mean that within a very short time it will be overseas owned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bass knows, as I do, that some of the CSL technology is unique and has enormous potential. Overseas companies would love to get their hands on it, and we know that. Australia has a bad history in investing, particularly in scientific research and manufacturing that flows from it. If there were a 100 per cent sale, there is no doubt that the scientific capacity CSL has-some of its biotechnology has enormous potential-would very soon be being bought from overseas companies by the Australian Government under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. So the parties that formed CSL to address a public need are now quite intent on making sure that what it has achieved will very shortly be controlled by overseas capital and overseas interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that in the global pharmaceutical market there is a role for Australian companies-not to try to match the pill making capacity of Roche Products Pty Ltd and various others or their distribution systems, but to apply our scientific research for the base materials, for the active materials, and for their delivery systems. There is a whole range of ways in which Australian companies can joint venture with a range of companies from around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We expect that CSL will be joint venturing with international companies. That is why it must stay government owned. If it is join venturing and privately owned, it will not joint venture for very long. Its intellect will be bought out very quickly. If one looks at the changes in pharmaceutical technology, it is very clear that companies the size of CSL have the capacity to make the active feedstock that will be the major ingredient in pharmaceuticals of the future. </PARA>
<PARA> By the end of this century, virtually most pharmaceuticals provided under prescription will have been bio-engineered. The companies doing that will not necessarily be the large companies. Honourable members know that; I know that; and CSL knows that. If CSL was put on the market, it would be vastly undervalued. It would be a very specialised assessor who would know its value, and I do not believe that any Australian companies could, in fact, do that. Multinational drug companies do know its value because they know what research it has carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is very clearly micro-economic reform. It is saying that a Public Service operating under procedures, rituals and habits to serve the community across counters with social security services and a whole range of other services is inappropriate to run scientific research and development operations. There is no question about that. Sure, this legislation should have come in sooner; there is no argument about that, either. If we had not had so much time wasting late last year by the Opposition, perhaps it would have done. I can remember all the nights we spent here, all the quorums and all the time wasting debates we had on nonsense issues. Then we hear complaints about why this legislation was not brought in. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that corporatisation of organisations like CSL will give them the potential not to change their ways and not to become different in the sense of their research, but to live, respond and perform in a commercial environment in which they operate. They cannot be reporting back to Canberra every second day for approval for everything; but, mind you, they will find that the board they have will expect of them what most commercial boards would expect of their companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I find this process in many government organisations ironic. They somehow think that if they were privately owned, life would be very different. I just want to reiterate that from talking to factory managers, industry managers and business managers who have the task of approaching their boards for funds, I can see their boards are much harder to get money from than most of our Ministers are. So the idea of privatisation therefore giving access to capital is an absolute nonsense. It is about time the Opposition faced up to that reality. The only way that that could happen is if, in fact, CSL were sold to overseas organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this legislation will continue that tremendous progress of CSL over the last seven or eight years. It will allow it to joint venture more readily. It will allow it to develop better corporate planning, better investment strategies and better research strategies. I do not expect that it will in any way change the Government's commitment to the public liabilities for prescriptions, venoms and the like that has been so strong. Certainly, if the Opposition's position were adopted, that would happen. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that CSL continue its public interest responsibilities, a role that it has played so well and one that has put Australia way ahead of most countries in the world in terms of some of these smaller areas of pharmaceutical need which the commercial market can never and will never service. Those eventually must come back to being the responsibility of government and taxpayers. If CSL is not owned by the Commonwealth Government, that function could not continue. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Bill 1990 provides for the conversion of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) into a public company completely controlled by the Government. The background to CSL is very interesting. I will touch upon some of these issues only very briefly this evening because they have been so ably addressed by my colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The CSL came into being at a time of crisis during the First World War. It was created by an Act of Parliament in 1916 and therefore made Australia independent of overseas vaccines and sera, supplies of which were under threat by virtue of the war which was occurring then. Since that time it has had a very illustrious career. It has been linked to a number of major advances in therapeutics over the whole of that period. It has developed a whole range of antisera and antivenoms against specific Australian pests in particular, the most recent being the one mentioned by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), the funnel-web spider antivenom in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I might point out in passing in regard to the remark that the honourable member made-that is, that funnel-web anti-venom would never have been made-that that is complete nonsense. The difference would have been, as opposed to the financial arrangements which were in force at that time-that is, that money was injected into the company and there were no end points in sight-that there would have been a contract for the preparation of the funnel-web spider antivenom. There is no doubt in my mind that the Commonwealth not only has the ability to make those sorts of contracts, but also it should encourage them. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSL was constituted under the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act in 1961. It has a whole range of functions-producing, buying, importing, supplying, selling, and exporting on an increasing basis a whole range of pharmaceutical products. Also, very importantly, it conducts vital, and in many cases unique, research. It also provides a range of technical assistance not only to Australia but also to foreign governments and other organisations, in particular in relation to pharmaceutical products. Where the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) so determines CSL may, in relation to pharmaceutical products, conduct research and maintain production plants, procure reserve stocks and collaborate with either our Government or any other government. </PARA>
<PARA> CSL is structured into four business divisions which are, loosely, pharmaceuticals, veterinary, diagnostic and blood products. It employs something like 1,200 or 1,300 employees, has over 2,000 product lines and could be considered the largest pharmaceutical manufacturer in Australia. Its total operating revenues in 1987-88 were $121m, of which the vast majority, $115m, came from commercial operations, making it an ideal company to be out there competing in the marketplace free of government interference and supervision. The remainder was what came from departmental appropriations, some $6.8m from the Department of Community Services and Health, and that finances a range of services which are maintained in the national interest. There is no question that those particular services need to be maintained. We would suggest that they should be maintained on a contractual basis. As a government, we should pay the market price for those particular services and those procedures which are run by CSL. CSL maintains an emergency capability and involves itself in a lot of research and development projects, particularly in relation to pharmaceutical products which in many cases may be difficult to sustain on a commercial basis if the Government were not the purchaser in those particular projects. There is no suggestion that the Government will not purchase those particular products when CSL is privatised, as it undoubtedly should be. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently its sales have been increasing very rapidly. In 1988-89 sales grew by 14 per cent to $126m. Pre-tax earnings at that time reached $11.5m, an increase of 69 per cent. Those increases have been achieved by increasing the market share as a result of very efficient productive research and developments, good promotion and increased manufacturing productivity. It has even been the winner of a number of export awards. It is the only manufacturer of human vaccines in Australia as such and one of only two producers of biological veterinary products. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on for a long time but a few recent comments illustrate CSL's situation. In recent years CSL's marketing in Australia has moved to a commercial footing, but its ability to develop new products has lagged. For example, CSL has been largely forced out of producing insulin and penicillin. Also, it is only through product innovation and alliances with strong international companies that its survival can be assured. It is not well known by the public and it is very easy to understate the importance of CSL to Australia's chances of maintaining a toehold on the pharmaceutical scene. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, it is virtually the only source in Australia of active ingredients for pharmaceuticals. Most of the pharmaceutical companies in Australia import actives and merely formulate, package or form them into tablets here. That is a value added process of some benefit. Starting from raw basics, as CSL does, is something which is unique and very worthwhile to the economy of Australia, and it is something which we should encourage. This Government is not very good at doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very clear to me, and to anybody who has looked at the record of CSL over the years, that there has been a gradual derestriction, in terms of government interference in the way CSL is run. This Bill is one further step along that pathway towards freedom from government interference, and we support this step. We would like one more step to be taken, and this is the subject of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith)-that CSL should be privatised. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that anybody would disagree that CSL is a major asset to Australia and it needs to be fostered and nurtured. Having this sort of manufacturing base in Australia is absolutely critical in this growth area. Our pharmaceutical manufacturing industry is going downhill rapidly. The imposition of extra bureaucracy and extra fees, recently suggested by this Government, but sensibly overturned in the Senate, would have done even more damage to this industry which is in such dire straits in so many areas. In his second reading speech, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The objective is to establish--</PARA>
<PARA>CSL-</PARA>
<PARA>as an efficient and commercially focused organisation able to compete profitably and effectively with the private sector and the domestic and international market place. </PARA>
<PARA>That is something that we would wholeheartedly endorse. I am delighted that the Minister has indicated that government regulations should not be a part of the running of CSL. His speech further stated:</PARA>
<PARA>CSL can succeed in these areas only if it is allowed to operate as a truly commercial enterprise that can respond quickly in the marketplace free from day to day government regulatory controls. </PARA>
<PARA>We would endorse that completely. We would have no problems whatsoever with that approach. If in fact that is the case, why is the Government proposing to exercise control? Again, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister responsible for CSL will exercise control, on behalf of the Commonwealth as the shareholder, in a similar manner to shareholders in any other company. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed memorandum and articles of association will provide for the Minister responsible to have the power to appoint and to dismiss the CSL board of directors. Also, the Minister responsible for CSL will be able to issue guidelines to the board. </PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand the Minister is saying that he does not want the Government to interfere in the running of CSL, yet literally two paragraphs later he says that the Government will interfere in a whole range of issues-indeed, the control is almost absolute. He points out in his second reading speech that CSL will be a public company and therefore required to operate in accordance with the Companies Code and, of course, we support this. It will provide for the protection of the shareholders of the company which, under the Government's plan, will be the Commonwealth, but which ideally should be the public. The public should be allowed to purchase shares in CSL and we would make sure that the shareholders involved would, in large part, be the employees of the company. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also points out that the community service function of CSL would be made more efficient and accountable by a formal contractual arrangement with the Commonwealth. We have no problem with that. There is no reason why that could not be done under a privatised CSL. All of these functions would work better under that system. The Minister's plan is clearly to avoid direct government funding of CSL, but to allow negotiations on a marketplace basis for those particular services which the Commonwealth deems necessary for CSL. Again we have no problems with the principle and it fits perfectly with our proposed amendment which is that CSL should be privatised. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately what is actually happening here is the big brother approach. The Minister seems to be saying that he, as the responsible Minister, or any of his successors, will know best. It is the big brother approach of `I am from the Government and I am here to help you'. The Orwellian era is very much alive and well in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Time and time again it has been demonstrated that the Government does not know best in these areas and that these organisations are best left to commercial enterprises to run in an orderly fashion according to an appropriate set of regulations-under the Companies Code, for example-and to be responsible to a set of shareholders who do not have ulterior motives other than the well-being of the company. If we compare that with the motives of government in some of the other areas in which the Government has stuffed up, we can actually see the difference in motivation. There are no political motivations behind the shareholders; they want the company to run efficiently, and that is the way it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> The damning indictment, of course, of the Government's plan is in the centre of the Minister's own speech when he said that the arrangements proposed for CSL are essentially the same as those for Australian Airlines Ltd, another government business enterprise. What is happening at this moment as we talk? There are meetings left, right and centre-literally in more ways than one!-of the Australian Labor Party Caucus. Members of the ALP are discussing how to get Australian Airlines out of the big hole it is in. Australian Airlines is short of capital, and without the injection of capital Australian Airlines will never be fully competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question about that aspect of the problems facing Australian Airlines; the only question is whether this Government has the guts to do what it should do and privatise Australian Airlines. There is no doubt about that in my mind or in the minds of many others on this side of the House. We have a major schism on the other side of the House, however. Another of the Labor Party's interminable summits is coming up in September to deal with this matter. The Government is still unable to decide how best to fix up the mess which was created by virtue of Australian Airlines being a government business enterprise in the same way that it is trying to make CSL a government business enterprise under the control and the influence of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is crazy when we think about it. CSL will face the same problems as Australian Airlines but will just be five or 10 years behind. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself has said that the Government should not be in the business of running airlines. Equally, the Government should not be in the business of running CSL. It should get out of running these sorts of enterprises and leave them to commercial interests. We need to put in appropriate safeguards to make sure that the functions of CSL which are vital to the community are maintained, and we have no problem with that at all. It is the Government's responsibility to the company, to its employees, to those people who rely on its products and, in the end, to the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the benefits to the Government of this approach as opposed to our privatisation approach? In the short term there may be some financial benefits in making CSL a public company but in the end there are greater benefits to the Government by moving into the privatisation area, increasing efficiency and return and therefore increasing the benefits to the Government through taxation. There is a lean, hungry and efficient mechanism rather than one which is less lean and less hungry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is another example of what we saw in the Budget Speech last night. The Government does not have the guts to make the tough decisions, in particular in relation to micro-economic reform. Remember that we were promised these micro-economic reforms on a big scale. We have not seen any real evidence of these at all. The Government's economic reform is so micro that usually we cannot even see it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt at all in my mind that the appropriate direction for CSL is complete privatisation. The Opposition has moved an amendment to this effect, and any sensible member of this House will surely support this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is instructive to look at who led for the Opposition in this debate. It was the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who I understand is the shadow Minister for privatisation. This debate is about the Opposition hell-bent on pursuing its Thatcherite policies in regard to the privatisation of government business enterprises. Certainly the honourable member for Bass did not come here to debate the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) or the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Bill, which develops a structure for CSL which provides for freedom of operation as a company while remaining in public ownership. I was a little disappointed in the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), who fell into the same trap-and I do not know how it fitted with his capacity as shadow Minister for health-of going along the privatisation trail in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Little attempt was made to discuss the organisational needs of CSL or its social role. Those opposite suggested we should just flog it off to some others so it can become their problem. The honourable member for Lowe, who ventured into the privatisation debate, suggested that, in the proposal that perhaps the Opposition wishes to consider, some sort of share option would be open to the employees of CSL. Has he looked at the overseas experience when those sorts of share options have been undertaken? Has he looked at the experience with British Telecom and the way in which that offer was made? Within months those shares were sold off to other people. It is nonsense to come here and expect people to believe that we will have an ideological debate about privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some general aspects about government business enterprises. Government business enterprises play an important role in Australia's mixed economy. This can be illustrated by the size of their share of the labour force. Approximately 50 per cent of the Commonwealth civilian employment, or around 3 per cent of the total Australian work force, are employed in government business enterprises. Their gross fixed capital expenditure accounts for about 75 per cent of the Commonwealth total and about 5 per cent of the national total. </PARA>
<PARA> GBEs provide a substantial range of services directly to industry and the public. The Government's 1986 discussion paper on government business enterprises recognised that:</PARA>
<PARA> They make an important contribution to national unity and social equity through the provision of essential services in remote areas and to potentially disadvantaged groups who would otherwise lack access to them. </PARA>
<PARA> They provide infrastructure and services on which private industry and commerce depend. At the same time they are also substantial customers of the private sector . . . Both as investors and employers they contribute to the performance of the national economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government has recognised that changing conditions call for flexible and responsive performance from government business enterprises. Accordingly, as part of the process of micro-economic reform and within the context of continuing total public ownership, this Government has taken the steps to remove GBEs from many aspects of day to day regulatory control and place them on a more commercial footing. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Government has retained strategic oversight, as this will ensure that GBEs lead the way in raising community standards in such areas as equal opportunity, industrial democracy and occupational health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth Serum Laboratories is illustrative of many of these general points. As a public enterprise, it has a proud record of achievement and service to the Australian community. At least speakers opposite have been gracious in outlining those significant contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> CSL was first established in 1916 during World War I. Its original objective was a social one, so that Australia could be self-sufficient in sera and vaccines in times of war and peace. As the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) indicated in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1923 CSL was one of four laboratories worldwide to produce insulin and in 1944 CSL enabled Australia to be the first country to supply penicillin to its civilian population. </PARA>
<PARA> CSL has developed anti-sera and anti-venoms against specific Australian pests, the most recent being the funnel web spider anti-venom in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>When CSL became a statutory authority in 1961, its charter focused on the performance of tasks in the national interest. This is typical of the role that the public sector has played in Australia. If we examine the historical development of public enterprises in this country, as the Evatt Foundation did last year, an inescapable conclusion emerges:</PARA>
<PARA> The essential and unique quality of public enterprises lies in their achievement of social and economic goals which are largely ignored by private firms. An overview of the history of Australian public enterprises reveals that there were common reasons for their establishment. Most important here is that the private sector has been unable or unwilling to develop adequate infrastructure and address issues of national importance including the social commitments of governments. </PARA>
<PARA>CSL also serves as an example of how, as a government business enterprise, it has led the way in implementing government objectives in areas such as equal employment opportunity. In its first equal opportunity report in 1987-88 CSL stated:</PARA>
<PARA> CSL has always been conscious of the need to avoid discrimination in employment . . . The equal opportunity legislation supports CSL's management thinking in this sensitive area. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the legislation reveals that the reform package is designed to review several legislative constraints to enable CSL to operate on a more commercial basis and therefore to be competitive in its own right. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories will be able to seek new objectives. It will be able to adopt a role as an Australian manufacturing base for biological pharmaceutical products. It will continue to supply critical blood products at no additional cost to scarce Government resources. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides the opportunity to ensure the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories' position as an internationally competitive Australian manufacturer in an industry that seriously needs Australia's input. Some three years ago the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) visited CSL as a member of a Caucus working group investigating the 1986 report on pharmaceutical products of the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC). As he mentioned, there is a need for a strong Australian pharmaceuticals industry to continue to play a role. </PARA>
<PARA> The objective of this legislation is consistent with the Government's macro and micro-economic policy objectives for building export-based manufacturing industries. The future of a successful Commonwealth Serum Laboratories will lie in its being an independent Australian-based company. Where are the assurances from the Opposition in its holus-bolus sale that we can ensure that CSL will remain an independent and Australian based company?</PARA>
<PARA> The viability of CSL in the long term is a significant issue for Australia in maintaining our capability in the manufacture of blood products, pharmaceutical vaccines and other human biological products. There is no doubt that this is a highly competitive marketplace. I am confident that with this Bill the CSL will have a significant role in that marketplace and take its place at the cutting edge of the pharmaceutical industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories is currently constructing a state-of-the-art complex at Broadmeadows and, through a series of improvements aimed at streamlining this important industry, will pursue its place in the sector and maintain its market share. This complex is in Camp Road in Broadmeadows which was, under the old boundaries, part of the Scullin electorate. It is to be completed in 1993 and will ensure that CSL will continue to play its role in the production of blood and plasma products. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that with the benefit of this Bill the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories will be well placed to make use of the undoubted skills that it has gathered and marketing knowledge based on its history and will continue its role as a significant player in the pharmaceutical industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister proposed and asked us to ponder the claim that there is no down side in selling off government business enterprises such as CSL. He does not explain what would happen after we have the sale and we gain capital in the flash sort of fire sale that it would have to be. He comes in here to use the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories as an example of what he believes should be done for government business enterprises holus-bolus across the board. He does not talk of the continuing dividend which the activities of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories have made to the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no explanation of how, as both he and the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) suggested, in some magic way the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories would become more efficient if it was privately owned. There is no explanation of that. If the honourable member really has gone around the world and studied government business enterprises, he will know that it is not the case that making such enterprises privately owned results in the gaining of inherent efficiencies. In fact, there is much evidence of recently privatised government business enterprises where this is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to have this type of debate, let us not put the question as a challenge to people who wish to have organisations remain in government ownership so that they have to prove the case. There is certainly going to be a great need, if it is at all possible, for those who choose to come in here as privateers to explain to the Australian public what is in it for us. Why do it? I refer to the Industry Assistance Commission's report of 1986. I do not know whether the IAC was ever recognised for overwhelmingly portraying great social nous in the way it conducted its investigations, but I wish to quote from the report. In talking about the pharmaceutical industry, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The pharmaceutical industry cannot be reviewed on the same basis as the majority of the Commission's industry specific reports. In most industry inquiries the primary focus is on tariffs or direct financial assistance to the industry. In this inquiry these issues are dominated by Government involvement in support of consumers, public health considerations and other social policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>If we do not have a reason why CSL should not be kept in government ownership, I do not know what honourable members opposite require. It is clear that, in carrying out that role within this industry, the ownership of CSL is a very important aspect of government policy. The IAC report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Because Government actions in this industry are primarily motivated by concern for consumers, proposals for change must take account of this continuing concern. </PARA>
<PARA>In nothing that I have heard in the speeches of those opposite was there any consideration of those aspects in the position of the coalition on the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. I think it is important that honourable members opposite address these matters on a case by case basis. As they look at government business enterprises they will be required to consider their attitude about whether these enterprises are to remain in public ownership. To not do that is inadequate. This is an area where there is a real need to have that sort of rigorous examination. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that as a result of the Bill before the House the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories will continue to grow and prosper. I acknowledge, as has been indicated previously in the debate, the appointment of Dr Brian McNamee as Managing Director. I have already alluded to the investigations that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and I were involved in in early 1987 when we visited Fauldings. I know that the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) has a particular interest in this industry. He was also part of this working group. We met with Dr McNamee. I think at that stage he worked for Fauldings. I believe he illustrated to the working group that he had a very good knowledge of the requirements of a successful Australian pharmaceutical industry. He is well placed to lead CSL in a very positive way so that it can play a clear role in Australia's pharmaceutical industry. I have no doubt that CSL will continue to grow and prosper and serve all Australians in public ownership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Less than two weeks ago, on 10 August, our country lost, to quote the Sydney Morning Herald, `a good bloke who became a hero'. On 31 May in this place I referred to a manly man and a friendly friend in describing His Excellency Rear-Admiral Sir David Martin, the then Governor of New South Wales. He was a man stricken with a terminal illness in the prime of his public life, a man who had been both a distinguished naval officer and a great Australian, a very humble and private man with a deep affection for people and the sanctity of family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Born in Sydney on 15 April 1933, David Martin entered the Royal Australian Naval College in 1947 with the knowledge that his father, the late Commander W. H. (Pincher) Martin, had offered the supreme sacrifice during his naval service as executive officer of HMAS Perth-lost in enemy action in the Sunda Strait in early 1942. </PARA>
<PARA> A natural and gifted leader and a professional gunnery officer, David Martin rose quickly and deservedly through the officer ranks of the Royal Australian Navy, being one of the few officers of that distinguished service to have held four major warship commands in a career spanning 41 years. </PARA>
<PARA> He was New South Wales Father of the Year in January 1988, retired as a Rear-Admiral the following month, was made a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George later that year, and was installed as the thirty-fourth Governor of New South Wales in January 1989. He held that office with great distinction and a deep sense of the importance of the ordinary person until ill health tragically forced him to relinquish that office on 7 August this year after less than two years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unlikely, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he was afraid of death, although clearly he was troubled by the incompleteness of his life. He was a man of great personal courage right to the end. As the Anglican Bishop of Sydney, the Most Reverend Donald Robinson, said at his passing, `he combined a deep humanity with an absence of pomposity'. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir David will be remembered by many people for many things. The history of the RAN will attest that he rendered untiring and devoted service in a long and distinguished naval career. He was always a fine example to those he led. He possessed enormous personal qualities, none more well developed nor more appreciated than his compassion and concern for those under his command. Those of us who were privileged to serve with him will hold dear those memories of time spent in his company. </PARA>
<PARA> When he became Governor of New South Wales the Australian people very quickly developed great respect for and held him in the highest regard. He shared with them his enthusiasm for life and his interest for people. He displayed great kindness and was always generous with his time. It was for these reasons that his illness, with its tragic consequences, came as such a shock. Yet even then his inner strength, longing to serve others and his devotion to duty enabled him to continue as Governor until only days before his death. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir David Martin brought an unparalleled warmth and a spirit of commitment and generosity to that high office. I know that everyone in this place would wish to join with me in passing on our deepest condolences to David's wife, Susie, and their family at this trying time. May David's sense of national purpose live on in the Sydney City Mission Foundation for Troubled Youth, which I hope thousands of Australians will support financially in the weeks, the months and the years ahead. God rest the soul of an officer and a gentleman. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, in recent times there has been much debate in rural Australia about incomes of farmers. In Queensland in particular the National Party has certainly been spreading the fires of dissension. Only today Senator Bill O'Chee was critical of the country task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and of me in particular. In response, I believe there are a few points that need to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, in 1989-90, the prices received by farmers are down by 2.2 per cent while costs are up by 6.8 per cent, which means in real terms a decline of approximately 8.4 per cent. In the two previous years the ratio of prices on farm to costs rose by 2.1 per cent and in the year before it rose by 12.2 per cent. So prices are coming down from a much higher level. Certainly, volatility in world markets, floods and droughts have, and always will have, an effect, and there will always be farmers at the margin who will have to face some tough decisions and who are susceptible to the vagaries of climate and world demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Added into the reduction in 1989-90, of course, is a depreciation of $3 billion. If that is taken out, the whole perspective is changed. Farmers do adapt and change as a consequence of declining prices, as they do with increases in prices. I believe that it goes without saying that farmers here in Australia producing farm product to the farm gate are the best in the world. When it comes to marketing it is often a different story, and the wool debate demonstrated the fact that some leaders in the wool industry failed to grapple with the realities of the commercial world. The maintenance of 870c per kilo was an unrealistic approach to make. </PARA>
<PARA> Moving on to the Prime Minister's country task force, I recently had the privilege of taking the task force to the seat of Kennedy. In the very short time of two days, we had the privilege of meeting with and taking submissions from 41 different groups. We were successful within one week in solving a problem for six women in Ingham who had been relocated as a consequence of World Heritage listing by extending their terms of employment over and above the time they had by six months. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the biggest issues that I have found in rural Australia is the need to expand rural health and general practitioning. In Mount Isa we had the privilege of every general practitioner in attendance at a seminar for more than an hour while in Ingham every doctor attended, except one who was delivering a child and another who was in Brisbane. The Federal Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) will be making further statements in October of this year regarding a rural health unit. We have a great opportunity to encourage more people to go into the medical profession and into general practice. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most glaring problems, though, that we found in Kennedy was 32 years of neglect by the former State Government. It is an embarrassment to the National Party of Australia. On Mornington Island, over 1,000 people are on water rationing for six hours out of 24. Were that to be the case in a rural community, I am sure that 60 Minutes and Jana Wendt would have run the story right around Australia. These people in the Aboriginal community have had to endure water rationing for a long time. That is going to change, because both the Federal Government and the new State Labor Government are working to overcome this water shortage problem. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most constructive meetings we had was with banana growers in north Queensland. They are very keen to switch to rail in order to freight their products to Melbourne and Sydney. As a result of the initiative for an integrated transport system and the cooperation between the Federal Government and the States, I believe we have an opportunity to produce the integrated transport system that we need. We have for many years paid the price for having different rail set-ups in the six States. That is not cost effective and would not be tolerated in the commercial world. </PARA>
<PARA> The rhetoric and some of the practices of people like Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee, who are changing the rhetoric as they change their audiences, are not what farmers want to hear; they want to hear it the way it is. Farmers recognise that there needs to be tight fiscal policy, responsible monetary policy and effective wages policy. If that embarrasses those in the National Party, that is their problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased that we have been able to get out to the rural community and let them know that we do care and that we are not interested in rhetoric and in platitudes and we are certainly not interested, as the National Party is, in telling the beef producers--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on behalf of my constituent, Mrs Karen Palmer, who lives in Montrose. Mrs Palmer's son, Roger, is a 20-year-old, almost 21-year-old, man with severe athetoid cerebral palsy. He is non-vocal. He uses a combination of a communication board and VOCRISS, which he accesses by a knee-switch, and gestures to communicate. Roger is fully dependent for all areas of daily living. He requires maximum assistance with dressing, toileting and eating. He has no functional hand skills. He requires one-to-one assistance to access the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Roger is able to use a wheelchair in a safe, structured setting but because his disability impairs his driving skills he needs to be pushed in a manual wheelchair when he is in the community or in an unfamiliar environment. He has skills in maths, time, money and simple word recognition. He can use and enjoys using a computer, but needs assistance to set up, access and trouble-shoot. Roger is at times very frustrated with the limits imposed on him by his disabilities. He can become very angry and/or depressed. He has shown considerable maturity in recent years and has a good sense of humour, but he is often depressed with his current circumstances. He is an adult who wishes to make his own decisions and to lead an adult lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, since 1987 Roger has been in the Glen Waverley Special School, despite his very keen wish to leave there. It is considered by family, teachers and care-givers that the school is an inappropriate environment for him. He is very frustrated with the lack of adult activities with very few options available to him. The Spastic Society of Victoria has put forward a proposal, supported in total by his parents, that Roger be allowed access to Spastic Society facilities during the day to give him some limited use of his limited abilities, but the Government unfortunately finds itself unable or unwilling to make funding available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has in recent years relied to a great degree, it appears to me, on rhetoric which says that our mentally and physically handicapped should be deinstitutionalised, placed in community or home environments and given assistance where required up to and including a one-to-one basis. Unfortunately, it is my experience in my electorate since 24 March that the rhetoric is not matched by funding, services, facilities or reality. </PARA>
<PARA> We have, through the Department of Health and the disability services in Victoria, made specific requests on behalf of Mrs Palmer and her son that 3:2:5 funding be made available to allow Roger access to the Society's facilities at Knox which are deemed by everyone who is involved with Roger to be the most appropriate setting for him. Unfortunately, we are advised that that funding is not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and I call on the Government to address this situation and to provide to my constituent the services which he requires which the Department advises are made available universally to all those in the community with severe mental or physical handicaps. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the parliamentary recess, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base at Amberley, which of course is in my electorate, celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. It was interesting that the seventy-fifth anniversary of Anzac forces landing at Gallipoli in April this year displayed just how united we are as Australians and how much pride we have in the work done by our service men and women.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. It was good to be part of these important celebrations at Amberley on its fiftieth anniversary. The celebrations were handled by the Chief of the Air Staff Ray Funnell, who opened the new gate to the Amberley Royal Australian Air Force base. He was supported by Air Commodore Bruce Searle, who is in charge of the base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The base had its beginnings when it was announced in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette back in December 1938 that an area of land of about 882 acres in the parish of Jebropilly had been acquired by the Commonwealth for defence purposes at Amberley, Queensland, on 12 December 1938. Of course, Amberley grew from those beginnings. Since the highest priority was to find an area with good all-weather conditions, it was decided to use Amberley and it has now been in existence for 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA> During the celebrations we had a fly-over of F111 aircraft, based at Amberley, and a fly-over of a Moth Minor. It is a lovely little aircraft and it added to the prestige of the whole day. The Moth Minor was the first plane that flew to the base when it began operations. The Moth Minor landed at Amberley on 4 July 1940 and that special event marked the start of what is now the largest operational RAAF base in Australia. The landing of the Moth Minor was a spectacular display. So we had a flypast of the old and the new, with the Moth Minor contrasting with the F111. It was incredible to witness how in a period of 50 years aviation has moved ahead so greatly. It was a great day and was enjoyed by all. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to put on record my sincere appreciation for the efforts of all the personnel involved at the Amberley RAAF base. I refer not just to the current personnel but to the many people who have been involved with the base for so many years. The Amberley base is without doubt the largest employer in my electorate. The personnel from the base mix very well with the local community and the base plays a vital part in our local economy. Certainly we work closely together. </PARA>
<PARA> To show the sort of cooperation that we receive from the defence people, recently a number of members of parliament from State and Federal legislatures were invited to a familiarisation day at the base, which was enjoyed by all. The delegation contained quite a number of members from this House. I believe that it was fitting that members attended on that occasion. Certainly there have been some noise problems from the F111s and it was a very good public relations exercise for the RAAF to get members of parliament to the base and to tell us of the work they carry out and the important role they play. It was also most interesting to see the capabilities of the F111 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> I express my appreciation to Air Commodore Bruce Searle for organising that particular event. I am sure I speak on behalf of all my colleagues who took the opportunity to attend on that day. I wish to extend on behalf of the people of the Ipswich community our congratulations to staff at the Amberley base for their contribution over a period of 50 years not only to our local community but to the defence of our nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent years there has developed in this country an intense propaganda effort by trade union officials to describe any person who disagrees with their policy or objectives as confrontationist or divisive. Any person who agrees with trade union officialdom is commended as consensual and cooperative. Trade union officialdom apparently has taken to heart the statement of Samuel Johnson:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>What I mean by an agreeable man is someone who agrees with me. </PARA>
<PARA>The policy is a clear and coordinated attempt to intimidate people into supporting Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) objectives by declaring them confrontationist, divisive or even ver-boten if they dare to disagree. </PARA>
<PARA> The trade union movement apparently does not countenance even the possibility that its demands, its objectives and its actions could ever be divisive or that there are strong and overriding reasons why, in the public interest, many of its prescriptions should be opposed. The ACTU is no longer merely a spokesman for wage and salary earners on the question of wages and salaries. Under the accord it has sought and obtained a right of veto on all aspects of economic and political life from wages, to spending, to health care, to privatisation and to tax policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the trade union movement that vetoed Treasurer Keating's deeply cherished desire to introduce a consumption tax. Today it holds the power of veto over Treasurer Keating's passionate plans to introduce competition to Telecom and airline privatisation. If anyone wants to know whether the Government will privatise, do not ask the Treasurer; ask the ACTU Secretary. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday members were treated to a candid disclosure of the ease and arrogance of power that now dominates ACTU thinking. The disclosure was made unintentionally by the immediate past President of the ACTU, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), who was defending a recent boycott by him of a Master Builders Association (MBA) conference. The honourable member had agreed to speak at an MBA conference-that is, until he found that others had also agreed to speak and, dare they do it, express views contrary to his own. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an outrage to modern ACTU thinking. How could an employer association dare to invite someone to express views contrary to ACTU policy? How could a Minister of the Crown be insulted in such a way? The honourable member for Hotham reached back into the old lexicon of the industrial armoury and decided on the tried and true answer-the industrial boycott. This hardly sounds like the language of cooperation, consensus, dialogue or discussion. What is wrong with someone going to a conference and attempting to convince an audience of the superiority of his views by argument and discussion? No, it was the language of boycott-of divisiveness and confrontation-that was spoken to the MBA; a language it understands all too painfully by reason of its experience in the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest you think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this policy of boycott was unreasonable, hear the magnanimity of the position:</PARA>
<PARA> I am not going to hold this against the industry. All is forgiven. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member was saying that a heinous offence was committed, the MBA invited a speaker he disagreed with, but he would not hold that against the industry. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am prepared to work with the industry because I think that it has a constructive role to play. </PARA>
<PARA>If the MBA does not have a constructive role to play in the building industry, there will be no building industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The piece de resistance of this little episode was a statement to this effect:</PARA>
<PARA> I should also indicate . . . there was an international request . . . from the international trade union movement, including that of the Soviet Union, which said that this mob who had been invited was not an appropriate group to try and improve industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>If Soviet Union unions believe the speaker is not appropriate, why should an Australian Minister attend a conference where such a person speaks? This reminded me of other proceedings in this House when Dr Evatt produced a letter from Mr Molotov to say that the whole Petrov case was a conspiracy. The honourable member for Hotham would do well to remember that incident. The views of Soviet Union unions on industrial relations are unlikely to hold great sway in this House. A Minister of the Crown would do better to base his actions on more reliable authority than that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter for the attention of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). I regret that the Minister is not still in the House, but I direct the matter to the attention of the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin) at the table and I ask that she raise this matter with the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter was briefly touched upon in the Budget Papers at section 3, page 107 of Budget Paper No. 1, regarding the proposed closure by the Government of 10 Medicare offices in country Victoria. I understand that the Government has proposals to close these offices and, in fact, has already indicated that Portland and Maryborough will close their offices. The office at Maryborough, particularly, is of concern to me because it is within my electorate and services 10,000 residents in that electorate and does provide a very valuable service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims that Medicare is a universal health service. I trust that it is not backtracking on that obligation to the Victorian community, particularly the residents of Maryborough. It provides a payment-of-claim service across the counter. It would certainly be an inconvenience to elderly people in the Maryborough area were that office to close. </PARA>
<PARA> My understanding is that the Government will close that office on 31 December this year. Members of the staff both at Portland and at Maryborough have been advised that they will be losing their positions. I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that that office will be kept open or that an alternative service will be provided to the residents of that area. It is quite a hazardous exercise to make a claim and fill out all the paperwork. Quite often elderly people require assistance in the passage and processing of those claims. The two offices nearest to Maryborough are at Ballarat and Bendigo. People would have to travel quite a distance. That service would not be available to them in Maryborough. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Local Government to take that matter up with the Minister for Community Services and Health and advise me of his recommendations in this matter-whether he will close those Medicare offices or whether he will continue to keep them operating, particularly where they service a number of residents, as is the case at Maryborough, where 10,000 people are involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some from the honourable member, too. One which caught my attention today relates to Australia signing the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I understand that Australia signed that Convention today in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise this issue because, if these treaties are to be signed by Australia, it is high time that they not be agreed to by the Executive Government without their being debated by this Parliament. This issue goes to the heart of how this nation functions because it is about how family life functions. We ought to consider the family unit as the fourth tier of government because if the family unit does not function successfully, no other tier of government can function successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> This Convention is detrimental to this country. I will relate the ludicrous position. The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) says that even though we have signed this Convention there is no need for this country to introduce any legislation. If that be the case, why do it? Why have regulations and rules placed on people, particularly mums and dads, with regard to how they should look after their families?</PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Government does not like this being talked about but it was part of the Bill of Rights almost word for word and Australians around this country rejected it overwhelmingly. Article 13 of the Convention states:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art or through any other media of the child's choice. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The exercise of this may be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we really do not know what the restrictions would be on the children in expressing these rights. By our signing this document it is totally open-book and it undermines the authority of parents. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to my first point. If governments of Australia intend signing these types of conventions or treaties, the Parliament should at least debate them. That is the real issue. Unfortunately, we do not have the opportunity to debate this one but it should be debated out in the community. I highlight to other honourable members that today we have signed this Convention without debating it in the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of the CAI's comments on the subject of salary increases for heads of Commonwealth departments.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am not aware of the level of salary paid to the Director of the CAI.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The salaries of the heads of the Treasury and the Department of Defence were recently increased by 19 per cent by legislation. This is the same increase as that granted to the top level of the Senior Executive Service. The salaries received by executives in the private sector are much higher than those of these two Department heads.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) On 28 March 1988 the Prime Minister met with major employer groups (including the CAI) and the ACTU to explore the causes of the rapid increase in executive remuneration and to examine what could be done to encourage restraint. While the need for restraint was generally agreed there was no agreement over the extent of any such restraint.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The CAI has consistently advocated at National Wage Cases before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that economic conditions demanded that there be no or very little wage increases granted to wage and salary earners. The CAI has not expressed a view, as far as the Government is aware, on executive remuneration recently but in 1988 an article in the CAI Industrial Review stated `There are market forces pure and simple at work, and it is these alone that determine, and should determine, how fast payments to managers and executives should rise'.</PARA>
