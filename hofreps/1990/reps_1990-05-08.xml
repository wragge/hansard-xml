<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A personal friendship begun 25 years ago in Young Labor politics makes it especially pleasurable today to propose the nomination of the honourable member for Grayndler, Mr Leo Boyce McLeay, to the high office of Speaker of this House. Our respective careers have taken us down different parliamentary paths in the intervening years until my own swearing in as a member here today. Some would say I have been slow to catch up. As my first act in this House, it is both an honour and a privilege to propose this nomination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since his first election some 10 years and 10 months ago the honourable member for Grayndler has demonstrated a deep commitment to the parliamentary institution-a commitment to its workings and to its traditions. His efforts as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure were marked with distinction. The Government's home and community care program was developed as a result of his urgings and the persuasiveness of his Committee's report into nursing homes. He has always believed in the value of the committee system as being vital to the workings of an effective democracy.</PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Grayndler played a pivotal role in the development of the first comprehensive committee system for this House. As a result, members on both sides have a greater opportunity to participate in the affairs of our nation. In turn, the citizens of Australia have a parliament more closely in touch with their needs and their aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Grayndler has demonstrated representational skills of the highest order. He has represented this Parliament both at home and overseas, and he has done so with considerable success. He enjoys the responsibility of office and he is an excellent ambassador for this House. In the months since his election as Speaker, he has already demonstrated the qualities that will see his term recorded as that of an outstanding speakership. He will continue to strive at all times to apply the Standing Orders and the practices of this House with sound judgment, with commonsense, with fairness, with firmness, with authority and with impartiality. His commitment to protecting the rights of individual members is, of course, well known. However, I trust that his concern for our well-being will not see him injured again while testing the Parliament's sporting equipment. I know that all honourable members appreciate the new maintenance program for the Parliament's pedal cycles since last month's unfortunate collapse and the resultant broken elbow. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot reflect on the qualities of Leo McLeay without acknowledging his very great warmth and the dryness of his sense of humour. They are strengths that have assisted him in winning the admiration of honourable members on both sides of the chamber and they will serve him well in maintaining the respect that underpins the authority of the Speaker. The honourable member for Grayndler has a great knowledge of the workings of this institution. He will continue to deeply involve himself in improving the standards of management of the Department of the House of Representatives; the efficiency and the effectiveness of its bureaucracy will occupy his close attention. </PARA>
<PARA> In his first remarks as Speaker on 29 August 1989, Leo McLeay noted that his appointment demonstrated that in Australia it is still possible to be whatever one wishes to be. The people of Grayndler, so many of whom hail from countries where there is no such thing as parliamentary democracy, are proud of him and of his achievements. It is characteristic of the honourable member to demonstrate a very real modesty and to share generously his successes. High office has never seen him forget his origins; rather, it has seen him work even harder to improve the lives of his constituents. His personal qualities complement a deep commitment to this institution. He will continue to serve it with dignity and with distinction. I commend the nomination to the House. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="5" SPEAKER="Reith Mr P.K." NAMEID="WI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="FLINDERS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Flinders)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great pleasure to nominate James Donald Mathieson Dobie, the honourable member for Cook, for the position of Speaker. He would make an excellent Speaker, and we need an excellent Speaker in this institution. I urge all honourable members, including some of the new faces on the other side, to put aside party political motivation. They ought for once to take the benefit of a secret ballot to decide this issue on its merits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Dobie was first elected to the House of Representatives for the seat of Hughes in 1966, which, I might add, was a vintage year for Liberal politicians. He was re-elected as the member for Cook in 1969 and, except for the dark years of 1972 to 1975, has been re-elected at every subsequent election. I add that to lose one's seat is a salutary experience that I have shared; I recommend it to many honourable members on the other side of the House. It is one of the experiences that help honourable members to keep their feet on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> The tasks of Speaker are, of course, many. I believe that Don Dobie's experience would qualify him well for the position. Prior to his entry into the Federal Parliament, he was a management consultant. For many years he was on the staff of the Bank of New South Wales. He holds a bachelor of commerce and an MBA from Columbia University in New York. This background lends itself to the position of Speaker, which, of course, includes the important responsibilities of running the parliamentary departments and the efficient running of the Parliament itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Don Dobie has an excellent and well-earned reputation as an active parliamentarian. I first came in contact with him as a new member back in December 1984 when he was the Opposition Whip-and a good Whip he was. The sense that I got from Don Dobie, which is important on today's occasion, is that he has a real feel for the institution, which is a very important quality in a Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> His parliamentary contributions have been many and varied. He has served as an Assistant Minister. He has given great service to many of the committees of the House. On three occasions he has been Deputy Chairman of Committees, from 1970 to 1971, from 1979 to 1983 and during the last Parliament. He has been Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts, a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. All honourable members will remember the work done by Don Dobie and other members on the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more difficult tasks as a committee man is to be on the Arts Advisory Committee for the new Parliament House. Honourable members will see from the Parliamentary Handbook that he has participated in a number of parliamentary delegations and contributed to international forums and meetings of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. In addition to his long and distinguished record as a member of the Parliament, he is an active electorate person, testified to by the fact that he had a good swing in the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I think we do need a Speaker who can command the respect of both sides of the Parliament and who can enforce the authority of the House. We need a Speaker who will command respect by the quality of his decisions as Speaker. Our great institution of Parliament needs people of calibre, people who can see beyond party political interests and work for the system as a whole. I nominate Mr Dobie in that spirit of healthy competition in politics which we on this side believe in. It is no reflection on the other candidate in this race, as I am sure that in due course reflections will be made on his performance. I therefore have great pleasure in commending to all members the honourable member for Cook as the next Speaker of this House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Barton)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure and an honour for me to second the nomination of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay) for his re-election as Speaker of the House of Representatives. In nominating the honourable member for Grayndler some four years ago for the position of Chairman of Committees, I put to this House that his record of involvement and achievement in the activities of this House unquestion- ably qualified him for that post. In endorsing those sentiments, this House obviously felt that its judgment was vindicated because some 3 3/4 years later, on 29 August last year, it bestowed upon him its highest honour; that is, the speakership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then, as now, the honourable member for Grayndler displayed a record that has lived up to those expectations. The administration of the Parliament, together with the President of the Senate, and the control of this House are vital to the health of our democratic system. The speakership, like the presidency of the Senate, however, is a lonely and demanding position. It is certainly not a ceremonial sinecure, especially given that at times this House does not offer up an image as a host of angels. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 29 August last year, the honourable member for Grayndler has shown diligence, dignity and strength in the position of Speaker. I submit to this House that his record speaks for itself: his quick and thorough command of the rules and procedures of the House; his tireless dedication to the committee system, the current form of which, I might add, owes so much to his development on a previous occasion; and his dignity in representing this House and indeed the Parliament as a whole, which, I submit to honourable members, is now so much more important than ever, given the age of cynicism in which we live. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I submit that the honourable member for Grayndler's accessibility and his maintenance of a genuine and friendly disposition to all members of this House regardless of their politics, as symbolised by his opening up of the Speaker's way, is of itself merit enough. I commend to this House the candidature of the honourable member for Grayndler. I know that all in this House will not be disappointed with his performance from here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great privilege and honour to stand here and second the nomination of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) for the position of Speaker of the House. As I look around the House I see many new faces. I think most honourable members realise that this is a transient place and that many of us are here for only a short period. As most members would agree, it is a great honour to be elected to this House. For the honourable member for Cook to have been a member of this House since 1966 says something for the ability of the man and the trust that the people of the electorate place in him. He has been absent from the House for only a short time over that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have all grown to know the honourable member for Cook and appreciate his ability. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) has spoken of his service to the Parliament through the various committees and many of us have served under him on these committees. He has been a Deputy Speaker, a Deputy Chairman of Committees and an Assistant Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the strongest attributes of the honourable member for Cook would be the fact that he was once a Whip. We all know how tough these Whips are. The training he has had as Whip will stand him in good stead. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the members who have been here before and those who have served in other places and other parliaments know what the position of Speaker entails. It is a very lonely position on many occasions. One has to take resolute action that sometimes does not please one's own party. I know that the honourable member for Cook would take that action if it were necessary. He is a fair and just man, as we all understand. His experience as a member of overseas delegations will stand him in good stead. He has added to the dignity and the standing of these delegations. </PARA>
<PARA> To be a member of parliament requires-I know most of us would agree-that one keep one's sense of humour. To be Speaker requires a great sense of humour. When all around seems to be falling apart the Speaker has to keep it all together and sometimes a sense of humour helps. I believe that the honourable member for Cook has all the attributes to fill the often lonely position of Speaker. I have much pleasure in seconding his nomination by the honourable member for Flinders for election to the position of Speaker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the nomination of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) to the position of Speaker. I take this opportunity, also recognising the large number of new faces that we see on the Government benches, to give them some advice and assistance that they may need in representing their own electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If they cast a vote for the Government's nominee they are going to discover that they will have the opportunity to ask collectively somewhere between five and six questions a day-less, of course, the dorothy dixers that Ministers will hand to them. Their nominee has historically allowed Ministers to take up to 20 minutes to answer a single question. They will discover that their Prime Minister will keep a very close hold on the 45 minutes allowed in this Parliament for Question Time of which they as backbenchers of their Party will get half. If they vote for their nominee they can rest assured that their chances of asking a question in the interests of their electorates will be very limited. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, were honourable members opposite to vote for the nominee of the Opposition they would find, based on past experience, that he would take a very firm position regarding the more loquacious of their Ministers, such as the Treasurer (Mr Keating). He often gives us 1,800-word answers. Our Opposition nominee would tell them to contain their answers to a respectable two or three minutes, which would guarantee members a chance to represent their electorates properly. </PARA>
<PARA> Their electorates expect them to ask questions of the Government, the same as our electorates expect the Opposition to ask questions of the Government. If members opposite were doing their job properly they would be demanding of their front bench that they do not waste time, that they give proper and simple answers containing only information and that they get on with the job. But if they cast their vote in the way I expect they will, they should remember my words when day after day they stand and do not get the call. </PARA>
<PARA> They will stand only one at a time, because they are regimented and required to ask questions only when told. It will not make much difference anyway because they will not get a chance to ask questions. Their Ministers will use Question Time, as history has shown, to answer 10 or 11 questions because their nominee will not control their answers to a reasonable length. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, let me say again that the only person who can give honourable members the opportunity to represent their electorates properly and get numerous questions asked of the Government is the honourable member for Cook-a man who has authority and who is not afraid of the front bench. He is just the person who can ensure that they will get a chance in this place to ask a few questions. I consequently request that when this secret ballot goes forth honourable members opposite give themselves a chance and vote for the honourable member for Cook. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Allow me to be the first to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your re-election to the post of Speaker of this House. I note with some pleasure that some people on the other side took the advice of their Deputy Leader and put politics aside in the vote. Mr Speaker, again you take on a very responsible and, at times, difficult position. This House is indeed very fortunate to be able to call again on someone of your proven and long parliamentary experience and expertise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By definition, politics, which is essentially reflected in the business of this House, is partisan, but your position as Speaker must be above that. It requires the fullest exercise of the virtues of skill, integrity, judgment and fairness. It also requires a deft hand and, when the circumstances warrant it, a strong hand. In your previous service to this House as Chairman of Committees, as Deputy Speaker and then of course as Speaker, you have shown a notable ability to meet those high standards and high requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House and those opposite must straightforwardly concede that we have not always made your task easy. Both Government and Opposition can lift their standard of behaviour and the resulting quality of debate in this place. I commit this Government at this time to work for such an improvement. Such a commitment will prove difficult to implement in practice unless there is cooperation on all sides. </PARA>
<PARA> There is on us all a responsibility which we have not met as often as we should have. That responsibility is to give to this Parliament its proper status as a forum which commands respect within the community. We can expect that respect only if we earn it through the relevance of what we discuss and conduct those discussions in a positive and constructive spirit. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mean that this chamber should become a place where differences between us fail to gain active, forceful and, at times, even colourful expression; on the contrary, it is not only proper but also vital that the exchanges between us both elucidate and emphasise the undoubted differences that exist between us. I do, however, mean that some of the judgment which we could exercise, particularly those of us on the front benches, in advocating our policies or in criticising perceived failures on the other side, should be exercised for the purpose of lifting the respect with which the nation views this place. Should it prove of value to this process for certain reforms to be introduced, we should be prepared to look at them. Once again, on behalf of both myself and the Government, I extend our congratulations and our best wishes to you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members on both sides of this Parliament have commented during the recent election campaign on the public cynicism, sometimes bordering on contempt, for politics and politicians in Australia today. Indeed, in seconding the nomination of the Speaker, the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) echoed some of those sentiments in his remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In rising to congratulate you on your election to the high office of Speaker, I believe it is important that you, the party leaders and honourable members should take action to raise the standing of the Parliament. The public attitude to politics and politicians is best described as a plague on both our Houses. This attitude is bad: it is bad for our parliamentary system; it is bad for democracy; it is bad for Australia. The former Speaker, Mrs Joan Child, in her farewell comments as Speaker of this chamber pointed to this danger, arguing:</PARA>
<PARA>Anything that lowers respect for the democratic parliamentary system leaves that system vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say that, if honourable members by their attitude appear to lack respect for the institution of Parliament and Standing Orders, their attitude will be reflected in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> An important reason for the cynicism we see can be traced back to this very chamber and to the performance of this Parliament. I believe that the standard of parliamentary conduct has continued to decline and possibly reached its lowest level in memory during the last Parliament. Members of the public, rightly, are appalled by the personal attacks and by the bad language that so frequently mark debate in this chamber. They have seen Question Time, which is one of the most important features of the Parliament, corrupted by longwinded answers which have no relevance to the questions. They have seen it corrupted by dorothy dixers being used as a device for making what, in effect, are ministerial statements. </PARA>
<PARA> As an illustration of how Question Time has been degraded, during the Budget sitting an average of just over 10 questions were asked each day-the lowest on record. By contrast, in 1970 the average was almost 17 questions and rose to 19 questions in 1976. Under the Whitlam Government, the number of questions asked during each Question Time averaged about 15; and under the Fraser Government it averaged 16. Mr Speaker, you personally are on the record as supporting that Question Time be extended to allow 16 questions to be asked. It is worth recalling in this regard that in 45 minutes an average of about 40 questions, including supplementary questions, can be dealt with in the Canadian House of Commons. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are many other issues which need to be addressed if we are to restore the Parliament to its proper dignity and to regain the respect of the public. Many of the recommendations in the third report on the Standing Orders and practices which govern the conduct of Question Time could make a significant improvement to the functioning of this chamber. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure should be provided with all the resources necessary to facilitate this work. As Speaker you may have some views as to how the work of this Standing Committee can be advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> Not all the problems I have referred to can be corrected by amending the Standing Orders. I am strongly of the view that you, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), as he acknowledged, and I can do more to raise the standard of this House than any set of standing orders. By its actions, the Government can contribute significantly towards helping restore public respect for Parliament. Management of Government business must ensure that sufficient time is allowed for debate on important pieces of legislation. Notwithstanding the election, I think it is a matter of some concern-it certainly is to members on this side of the Parliament-that the Parliament will meet for only seven days in the first seven months of 1990. The Government will present a very large number of detailed and very complex Bills, without adequate notice. It is little wonder we are seeing an increasing tendency for the Government to make significant policy statements outside of this chamber. The Government itself must show more respect for the Parliament. I invite the Prime Minister to join me in making a commitment to ensuring the highest standards and the proper functioning of this Parliament. I was encouraged by some of the Prime Minister's remarks today down that track, in particular his emphasis on the word `bipartisan'. </PARA>
<PARA> You, Mr Speaker, because of the authority that is vested in you and the traditions with which your office is associated, have a vital role to play in protecting this institution. In accepting this great office today, Mr Speaker, in enjoying the considerable privileges that flow from this office, you have also accepted one of the central roles in ensuring the proper functioning of the Westminster system. </PARA>
<PARA> An authoritative text on the role of the Speaker in the House of Commons suggested that the chief characteristics which attach to the office of Speaker are authority and impartiality. I suggest that the great Speakers of this Parliament are remembered for these qualities-authority and impartiality. May I respectfully suggest, Mr Speaker, that in some of your rulings it has been strongly argued that you have not fully exercised the authority that Standing Orders and traditions have vested in you. </PARA>
<PARA> We congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your election to this high office. We will give you every support in seeking to improve the standards of the Parliament. It should be a matter of bipartisanship. However, I should make it plain that the Opposition will make its views heard if it appears that proper standards are not being maintained. We will have failed as an Opposition if we do not insist on Government accountability and that this Parliament, including the conduct of Question Time, fulfil its proper institutional roles. </PARA>
<PARA> I finish my remarks by offering my commiserations to my colleague Don Dobie. A great opportunity has been lost by this House. But I can assure the House that next time we will get our nominee for Speaker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on behalf of the parliamentary National Party, I extend congratulations to you on your election as Speaker of the House of Representatives. I express my commiserations to the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) in respect of the ballot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the House that the role of Speaker, of course, extends far beyond merely the deliberations of this chamber. I commend the work and the commitment that you have brought to that additional role, including your work with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I particularly commend the quick action that you took in conjunction with the President of the Senate and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to facilitate at the last minute the recent parliamentary delegation to Turkey, given the hitch that arose which caused extreme difficulty. I know that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and I very much appreciated the privilege of being present at Gallipoli for the seventy-fifth anniversary of Anzac Day. That that was so was only as a consequence of some quick footwork in a very difficult circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> I support strongly the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I also support those portions of the comments of the Prime Minister with regard to the conduct of the Parliament. The challenge in the 1990s is surely to make this Parliament, this House of Representatives, more relevant to the nation and more relevant to the people and the problems that they face.</PARA>
<PARA> In that context, I make three points. The first concerns issues such as the devastating floods which have caused so much damage over much of Queensland, New South Wales and Gippsland in Victoria and which are still moving downstream in parts of New South Wales. Mr Speaker, I hope that these sorts of issues, which are not partisan and which do not seek to draw blood, will not be portrayed as being soft issues and in some way less than important. I believe that issues such as the results of the horrific floods are equally important to the proceedings of the Parliament as they reflect the genuine concerns and massive problems faced by so many Australians. These types of issues need to be considered carefully by back bench members, front bench members, the Executive, the Speaker and others represented in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point that I would make, Mr Speaker, is that over the last seven years a very interesting ratio has built up with regard to the question of suspensions on the floor of this House. If in a rugby league match one side received 28 penalties and the other side received just one penalty I would venture to suggest that the sporting pages would have headlines questioning the integrity of the referee. The facts of the matter are that one side of this House has had 28 suspensions in the last seven years and the other side has had one suspension. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside that which relates to any one member in our ranks, let me say that even the most biased judges would have to submit that that reflects an unfair proceeding. More particularly, from the fact that the ratio is 28:1, it cannot be said that the behaviour of one side of the Parliament is 28 times worse than that of the other side. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that in part of all your deliberations with regard to the proceedings of this House it is essential that an even-handed and fair-minded approach be proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of these proceedings for the election of the Speaker, I add that in the House of Commons the precedent exists whereby the most senior person in terms of years of consecutive service, the father of the House, is called upon to conduct the election. Without in any way reflecting on the efficient conduct of our clerks, I point out that, given that situation, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) would be called on to conduct the election. We could do well to look at that procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> Tomorrow, 9 May 1990, this Parliament enters its ninetieth year of operation. We owe a great deal to the institution of parliament and to the achievements flowing from the institution of parliament, in this case the Parliament of Australia. We all have an obligation to lift our game and to make a contribution to see that this Parliament works better in this crucial decade of the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief, Mr Speaker. I wish to congratulate you on your re-election to the high office of Speaker. In fairness to the Parliament, it is necessary to refute one or two of the remarks made by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). It is true that opposition members are subjected to suspensions at a far greater ratio than are government members. It does not matter who is the Speaker and it does not matter which party is in opposition. The fact is that tomorrow, the ninetieth birthday, the honourable member will have great difficulty finding a handful of government members who have been suspended during those 90 years. There are two reasons for that. Firstly, the frustrations of opposition-I have spent 13 years on the opposition benches in this Parliament-are very great and it is extremely difficult at all times to maintain the same level of decorum in opposition as in government. Secondly, members from both sides of the Parliament when they are on the government benches are under far greater pressure to conform to the requirements of the House than are opposition members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been occasions when serial suspensions have taken place as a planned political tactic, but not on the government side. Suspension should be the absolute last resort of any presiding officer. But, no matter how trivial the original offence, if, following that offence, a member refuses to comply with a directive of the Speaker to withdraw, to apologise or to desist from some behaviour which the Chair finds unacceptable and for which the Chair has chastised that member, the Chair has no other option. A government member would not normally refuse to withdraw because of a different set of pressures.</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics do not mean anything in this case. In 90 years this House has had, with accidental exceptions, a Speaker chosen from the government side. It has never practised the Westminster system. As a person who was defeated in a ballot in this chamber, I can attest to that. All the Speakers whom I have seen and all of those of whom I know from reading have done their job as best they could, given the limitation of the powers vested in the Speaker of the House of Representatives; those powers bear no relationship whatsoever to the powers vested in the Speaker of the House of Commons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise to congratulate you on your appointment to the speakership of this House. I wish you well. I must tell you that I did not expect to win. It may come as a surprise to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). I am amazed that he thought he would have won. I would like to thank the three members who spoke on my behalf for their kind remarks and the others, too numerous to mention, who wanted to speak. However, I remind my nominator that when he mentioned parliamentary delegations I did whisper, `Not enough'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also say to you, Mr Speaker, that you still remain the second youngest Speaker ever appointed to this Parliament. The only younger Speaker was Mr Makin, who was appointed before I was even thinking of coming to this House. I wish you well. I extend to you my continuing personal friendship. I am very sorry to hear that you have a broken elbow. We on this side cannot tell whether it is your right wing or your left wing that has been damaged, but we have our suspicions. I do extend to you some concern on the matter raised by my new, decisive and good leader-that comment may get me a trip-who mentioned the fact that as you are going to have only seven days of presiding in that chair in an eight-month period you will be short on experience at the start of the sixty-fourth session. I therefore suggest to you, if I may, in the spirit of debate that seems to have developed on the appointment of the Speaker, that it would be my hope that, in the many other days and months that you have to consider the administration of this building, you take the time to see that a full curatorial staff is appointed to look after the 2,800 items of art we have in the building and the 70 major items of art that are part of the structure of the building. I hope that something will happen early in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank members on both sides of the House for their remarks. I think it is very important that we should all take on board the remarks of both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) that the Parliament is made up of the sum of all of us. I do not think our electorates expect that this should be a sedate debating chamber. I think that they would expect that there should be passion and some heat in the determining of the future of our country. But I do think that those people who have paid us the great honour of sending us to this Parliament expect that we should behave a little better than we have in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point raised by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) is worth while considering because, having been both in government and in opposition, I am aware, as he was, that there are probably more pressures on members of the Opposition than there are on members of the Government. The important thing for us all to remember is that we represent 148 different electorates in Australia and that we are very privileged to be here. We owe those people who sent us here a great debt of honour, and we should discharge that debt quite properly. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that at some time today all of us should pause for maybe a second or two to think of the 33 of our colleagues who are not with us this time. Some have retired and some were defeated at the last election. I hope we all remember that the one thing that is as sure as death and taxes is that ultimately we all become ex-members. We should ensure that we pay our colleagues, be they on one side or the other side of politics, the courtesy of looking them up in the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the House very much for the honour it has bestowed upon me and upon my electorate. I think it is something the people of Grayndler are very pleased about, and it is something that I am most certainly pleased about. </PARA>
<PARA> I can give honourable members my undertaking that I will continue to apply the Standing Orders fairly. No doubt on many occasions people will think that they have been badly done by. I would hope that those occasions would be getting fewer and fewer. My door is always open. If honourable members feel that they have been badly done by in any way, shape or form, they should not get angry about it but come and talk to me. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank all honourable members once again for the great honour that they have bestowed upon me. I give my undertaking to do my best and to see that this Parliament does discharge the debt to the Australian people who have done us the honour of sending us here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to report to the House that the House this day attended His Excellency the Governor-General in the Senate chamber, when His Excellency was pleased to make a speech to both Houses of the Parliament. The speech will be incorporated in Hansard for record purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Members of the Parliament of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> On 24 March, the Australian people gave to the Labor Government an historic and decisive fourth mandate-a mandate to continue the urgent and sweeping task of national reform in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA> In carrying out its mandate, and to implement the commitments it made during the election campaign, the Government will bring before this Parliament an ambitious and far-reaching legislative program.</PARA>
<PARA> As in the Government's previous terms, these proposals will be designed to work towards two overriding and complementary goals: the establishment of a stronger, more competitive and environmentally sustainable Australian economy, and the creation of a fairer and more compassionate Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has already made good progress towards realising these goals. Further progress will require a continued and united effort, underpinned by sound economic management; determined micro-economic reform; substantial and targeted measures of social assistance; and implementation of strategies for ecologically sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue its disciplined framework of macro-economic policies and with great vigour pursue the ten point plan for micro-economic reform outlined during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will set about ensuring Australia is indeed not just the lucky country but the clever country-with new measures to enhance, dramatically, Australia's scientific research efforts, and to improve the capacity of children of low and middle income Australian families to complete school.</PARA>
<PARA> And with an unprecedented expansion in the supply and affordability of child care and the creation of better job training prospects for the long-term unemployed, this Government will continue to open opportunities for all Australians, especially Australian women, to enter and re-enter the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Economy</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy has expanded strongly in recent years, with business investment reaching record levels and employment growing rapidly. However, major challenges remain. In particular, the current account deficit remains at a level which is adding unacceptably to external indebtedness, and inflation needs to be further reduced.</PARA>
<PARA> The main focus of macro-economic policy must now be on improving Australia's external accounts and reducing inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> A tight fiscal stance, continued effective incomes policy and firm monetary policy, have removed the excess domestic demand that was evident in 1988-89. Significant improvements in the current account deficit and inflation are expected and policy will be maintained in order to meet these expectations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also believes that improving the health of the Australian economy requires the implementation of a continuing agenda of structural reform.</PARA>
<PARA> The recent strong growth in employment and the surge in business investment, together with the ongoing agenda of industrial and labour market reforms, has already started to enhance the efficiency, flexibility and competitiveness of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to pursue broad-based structural reform. Reform is planned in trade protection measures; telecommunications and broadcasting; aviation; land transport; the waterfront; and international shipping. The newly established Industry Commission, with its wide charter and robust work program, is to play a key role as a catalyst for change. References to be forwarded to the Commission include railways, energy, statutory marketing arrangements and exports of health and education services. The co-operation of the States and Territories is vital to the success of these initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prices Surveillance Authority will continue to play an active role in ensuring that consumers benefit from micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that economic restructuring will impose adjustment costs. A feature of the Government's policy strategy is that this cost burden be spread equitably across all sectors of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA> All levels of government in Australia will need to exercise further fiscal restraint to assist with the task of stabilising our external indebtedness. The Commonwealth will be expecting the States and Territories to accept their share of the responsibility to restrain overall public spending and borrowing in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already announced its commitment to a major study aimed at simplifying the income tax system for taxpayers and the tax administration by reducing uncertainty and complexity in the law. The study will provide further progress in modernising collection and taxpayer service arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will reintroduce legislation to give effect to superannuation reforms announced in the August 1989 Budget. It will also examine measures aimed at enhancing the efficiency of superannuation funds and life offices, making them more accountable to their members and clients.</PARA>
<PARA> In the area of industrial relations, the Government's immediate priority is to ensure that the processes of labour market reform are continued and accelerated. The Government will foster an acceleration of the process of award and trade union rationalisation along industry lines. In particular, it will ensure that there are no legislative impediments to the rationalisation process.</PARA>
<PARA> As a fundamental goal, the Government seeks the retention of a wage system which is fair, and delivers wage outcomes appropriate to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Trade and Industry</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will establish a series of Co-operative Research Centres and will provide additional funding for this purpose, rising to $100 million a year after five years.</PARA>
<PARA> The centres will play a vital role in ensuring that Australia will benefit from the combined strength of the nation's science and technology resources. They will help ensure that Australian research and training will remain at the forefront in those areas of greatest importance to this country or in areas in which Australia has special expertise.</PARA>
<PARA> Research and development is fundamental to productivity and innovation in Australian enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> Research and development has grown substantially since the introduction of Government tax incentives and grants designed to boost our efforts to world standard, and the research and development tax concession will be extended to 1993 at 150 per cent and from 1993 to 1995 at 125 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also extend Research and Development Grant Programs to 1995 to ensure that an integrated package of measures is in place. To encourage leading edge research in fields of importance to our future, environmental technologies and services will be made eligible for grant assistance. Also, research programs for the eradication of Mimosa Pigra and for the control of the cane toad will be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the revision and extension of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme for a further 5 years from 1 July 1990, a new export development fund will be introduced to support established exporters to enter new markets and launch new products. Smaller companies will be encouraged to form approved trading bodies to achieve the critical mass required to build a sustainable export base. In future, key services also will now be eligible for export grants. Of particular significance is the extension of grants to inbound tourist operators from 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA> The greenhouse research program will be extended for a further three years, while forestry research will be upgraded with a new forest research laboratory for CSIRO in Tasmania, and a Tropical Rainforest Centre in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be aiming, as well, to ensure that Australian industry meets the highest environmental standards through processes such as the guidelines established for the potential development of pulp mills.</PARA>
<PARA> The current program of phased tariff reductions will be completed in 1992 and the Government already has indicated that further tariff reductions will occur beyond that time. In recognition of the long lead times involved in major investment decisions, the Government will be considering post-1992 tariff arrangements at an early stage to ensure a predictable policy framework for industry.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the Government will continue to seek a fairer and more open international trading system, most notably through its leadership of the Cairns Group in the Uruguay Round. It will continue its efforts to integrate the Australian economy with dynamic regional economies through the active pursuit of bilateral trade opportunities, and the promotion of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation process.</PARA>
<PARA>Small Business</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises the importance of small business to the Australian economy. The recent House of Representatives Committee Report on Small Business in Australia (the Beddall Report) outlined steps that could be taken to increase the productivity and efficiency of the sector. Progress on some of these steps has already been made and the Government is giving high priority to developing a full response to the Report's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>Transport and Communications</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that a national approach to our transport problems is required. With the co-operation of the States and greater involvement by the private sector, the Government will be moving to upgrade substantially the national transport infrastructure and to improve the efficiency of our transport systems.</PARA>
<PARA> Shipping reforms will progressively put the operating costs and manning levels of Australian flag shipping on a par with those of our major trading partners. Trans-Tasman shipping will be a particular focus. The program for waterfront reform will be actively promoted, and the Government expects that the major enterprise agreements will be concluded this year. Performance indicators are being put in place for both shipping and the waterfront, which will enable an accurate assessment to be made of progress in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA> Pursuit of a national rail freight initiative, following a feasibility study of the establishment of a national rail freight organisation, will be a priority.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will also maintain its strong commitment to further uniformity in regulation of road use, and improved safety standards for our roads.</PARA>
<PARA> Deregulation of the domestic aviation industry will take effect in October, and the Government will ensure that new entrants have fair access to major airports. The Trade Practices Commission will take a high profile in ensuring effective competition, with the full support of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Environmental Impact Statement on the third runway at Sydney Airport will be completed this year and, subject to the outcome, construction is due to commence in early 1991. In the next three months, measures will also be announced to alleviate the current congestion problems at Sydney Airport, and a decision taken on the introduction of a second international freight carrier, and further liberalisation of passenger charter arrangements. The Government will closely examine the merits of merging the Australian and New Zealand aviation markets as part of the Closer Economic Relations process.</PARA>
<PARA> There is scope for significantly greater competition within the telecommunications sector. The outcome of the review of the existing boundaries between the carriers, and the response to a number of Austel reviews, are due over the next three months. The long term future of Aussat will be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA> In the broadcasting sector the Government's review of the Broadcasting Act will be completed, and a further program of reform announced this year. In the current session the already announced efficiency package of reforms to the Broadcasting Act will be introduced. The regional television equalisation program will continue to be implemented. Other aspects of broadcasting on which decisions will be announced this year include the moratorium on pay TV, the future policy framework for Remote Commercial Television Services, and the second stage of the National Metropolitan Radio Plan.</PARA>
<PARA>Employment, Training and Social Justice</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's initiatives in education and training have already done much to provide a firmer base for a more competitive, dynamic and adaptable economy and a fairer society where opportunities are open to all.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will strive for higher national standards at all levels in the education process and a more effective relationship of education and training outcomes with employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA> A central theme of the Government's social justice strategy has been to assist disadvantaged groups into the workforce and reduce welfare dependence through an active approach to social policy that assists such people with education, training and employment needs in a co-ordinated way.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will build on its successful Jobs, Education and Training (JET) and Newstart programs. In 1991 it will replace the Unemployment Benefit with an active income support structure. Job Search Allowance will be available for those unemployed for less than 12 months and Newstart Allowance for the longer term unemployed. Income support and greater opportunities for training and other employment assistance will be effectively co-ordinated and delivered to those who need them, in conjunction with a stronger job search obligation on the individual.</PARA>
<PARA> An essential element in addressing disadvantage is to ensure that all young people, regardless of their background, have access to educational opportunities. Building on the dramatic improvement in school retention rates to over sixty percent in Year 12, a special allocation of $30m will be made in 1991 and 1992 to assist in improving facilities and equipment for schools. The Disadvantaged Schools Program-the cornerstone of the Government's commitment to equality of opportunity in education-will be expanded to cover a total of 500,000 children, and enhanced by a new program to improve literacy and learning skills.</PARA>
<PARA> Low to middle income families will be assisted to keep their children at school through the Education Completion Allowance-two payments of $300 each year which will subsume Family Allowance in these cases.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to introduce legislation for a Training Guarantee, as a means of increasing the level and quality of industry training.</PARA>
<PARA> Massively increased access to child care together with the unprecedented growth in jobs under the Accord and the success of innovative programs such as JET, are all helping ensure that women have a real choice and real opportunities to escape the cycle of disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA> Building on this, the Government will be improving further both the supply and affordability of child care. An additional 50,000 community child care places will be provided by 1995-96, including 10,000 new centre based places, 10,000 new family day care places, and 30,000 new outside school hours care places. An estimated additional 28,000 new child care places will be provided also by employers and private centres in response to the Government's decision to extend fee relief to approved private child care centres. The existing fee relief system for users of community-based child care will also be improved to ease the cost of child care for low and middle income families.</PARA>
<PARA> These measures represent a substantial contribution to a fairer and more prosperous Australia, providing opportunities for all Australians to contribute to, and benefit from, the nation's wealth generating processes.</PARA>
<PARA> During the Government's fourth term they will be complemented by an increased emphasis on improving services for people in the communities in which they live and work, so as to address the locational disadvantages that too often face families living on the outer fringes of our major cities and in rural communities.</PARA>
<PARA> Family Resource Centres will be established, marriage counselling and family mediation services will be expanded and public transport improved.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that education characterised by quality and excellence is of critical importance to the social and economic development of the nation. This fundamental principle will continue to be supported by the Government through new and existing funding programs for schools; through the Government's initiative of a National Negotiation on the Quality of Teaching in Schools; and through its reform program in higher education initiated by the White Paper Policy Statement in 1988. New initiatives, including a charter of institutional autonomy and academic freedom, will be introduced.</PARA>

<PARA>Law and Justice</PARA>
<PARA> A high priority of this Government is the enhancement of Australia's ability to combat crime successfully-in particular, the prevention and detection of money laundering and international drug trafficking-through the continuing program of establishing extradition and mutual assistance treaties, and through effective co-operation among law enforcement agencies both within and outside Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> The major machinery of Government reforms the Government put in place in 1987 have shown significant benefits and no major adjustment has proven necessary. Several refinements have, however, been made including the appointment of a Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable Members of the Parliament of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes the initiatives of economic reform, social justice and protection of the environment I have outlined are essential to its programs to enable the Australian nation to meet the challenges of the 1990s.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my privilege, for the second time, to nominate the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) to be the Chairman of Committees of the House of Representatives. Last time I nominated Mr Edwards we all anticipated that he would do well because a number of us had known him for quite a while and had seen his natural ability in a number of areas. Within the Parliament and as a representative of the Parliament both in the electorate and overseas Mr Edwards has proved himself to be a worthy member of this House and has always acquitted himself well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As you will remember, Mr Speaker, on the previous occasion the Opposition put up Mr Clarrie Millar, a very distinguished member of this House and possibly the best person it could have put up. On this occasion it has nominated Mr Cowan, another member who is held in high esteem in this House. I can say to Bruce that even though I am speaking in support of my good friend Mr Edwards nothing that I say detracts from my appreciation of his efforts and contribution to the House. I must have made a fairly persuasive speech last time because Mr Edwards was elected quite comfortably. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this is the second time that Mr Edwards has been nominated to be Chairman of Committees of this House. We could say, with the wisdom of experience, that he has shown his fairness and ability when occupying the chair. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that stands out with Mr Edwards, certainly when he is sitting in the chair, is his ability to run the House in a very orderly and fair fashion. In fact, I have never heard any comment from Opposition members that Mr Edwards has shown partiality for this side of the House. Certainly he is a member who has kept the business of the House moving. For that reason, as well as the others I have mentioned, he should be the Chairman of Committees in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Edwards is eminently qualified to take up the position. I will not go through all his qualifications but, as chairman of the economics and industrial relations committee of the Government, he has shown an ability to bring forward to this House some of the most substantial and far-reaching legislation in terms of our record in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> His dedication to the people of Stirling has seen him re-elected to the Parliament. In the last election we had a few problems in Western Australia and the result was very close. On election night many of us watched the broadcast and looked at how our seats were going. A lot of us were looking particularly at how Ron, who was the most marginal member in Western Australia, was going. It is a sign of his dedication to his seat that he was able to hold the seat for the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I can say with some confidence that there is not another member of the Labor Party in Western Australia who could have held the seat of Stirling in the last election. He has shown within his electorate that he is a member who listens to what people say. He is dedicated to serving the people in the electorate of Stirling. For the fourth time he has been re-elected to serve those people. I am sure that the dedication he has shown to them he will show to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember hearing the comments of Commonwealth car drivers when I came back to Canberra after the election. If one wanted to hold a straw poll as to how any honourable member of this House was going, one could ask the Commonwealth car drivers what opinion they held of members of this House. To a man, they all said that they were very happy to hear that Ron Edwards was re-elected in Stirling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No harm in trying! It is my honour and privilege to nominate the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) as Chairman of Committees. I acknowledge the expertise and value of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). He would be the second best choice for Chairman of Committees in this place-that is, directly after Mr Cowan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lyne is a very experience elected representative. He was in local government for eight years. He was in the New South Wales Parliament for 14 years, including time as Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. He has now been a Federal member for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> He has particular expertise which suits him for the post of Chairman of Committees. For example, he is an ex-member of the New South Wales Parliament. I think there are nine of them here-five of whom have just come in-so he would be able to recognise them very easily and be very wary of the tricks that they evidently get up to in the New South Wales Parliament. He is also an ex-auctioneer, so he would be very adept at looking around the House and picking up the bids for people who wanted to speak. He has also been a Deputy Chairman of Committees for five years and would bring that great expertise to his position of Chairman of Committees. </PARA>
<PARA> He would also add to a very long line of outstanding National Party Chairmen of Committees over the years-Sir Charles Adermann, from Fisher, Phillip Lucock, and our most recent Chairman of Committees, Clarrie Millar, who at that time was the honourable member for Wide Bay and who I see is in the gallery this afternoon. All of these National Party Chairmen of Committees are renowned for their impartiality, their ability to control the chamber and their calmness and coolness. Over the years they have gained the respect of both sides of Parliament. Mr Cowan, as the honourable member for Lyne, has also gained that respect and recognition in his five years as a Deputy Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> Last time I nominated Mr Millar, but he did not quite make it. Perhaps I could throw this extra bait to everybody this afternoon so that they will change their minds: if five words were required by the Chairman of Committees on an issue, my good friend Mr Millar would probably use 10, but Mr Cowan would use only three. Taking that into account, and in recognition of the name of his electorate, I ask honourable members to cross party lines and support Mr Cowan. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TD4">Dr CHARLESWORTH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Perth)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election, Mr Speaker. Eight months ago I had the opportunity here of putting forward the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) as Chairman of Committees. On that occasion I mildly chastised Ron because his face kept appearing on television screens in Western Australia under the caption of `member for Perth'. I might add that the publicity did not do him any harm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, if the honourable member for Stirling is anything, he is resourceful. When it comes to getting publicity, he is always coming up with a new scheme. Six of seven weeks ago we saw one of the best yet devised-a scheme whereby a person is able to get coverage on television, radio and newsprint every day for two weeks. It happens in this way. A candidate goes very close to losing at a general election. For the next two weeks during the counting of preference votes and absentee and postal votes, that person appears on the media every day saying, `It's too close to call; I am cautiously optimistic and if media members contact me tomorrow I will probably have a definitive result and would be happy to tell them about it.' That worked very well for the honourable member for Stirling six or seven weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I should not be flippant for too long because the honourable member for Stirling's electoral success in very difficult circumstances is a reflection of the thoroughness with which he has done his job, the diligence with which he has pursued the aims and aspirations of his electorate and his genuine honesty. When one first meets Ron Edwards, one starts thinking that this guy is too good to be true. It is only after knowing him for a number of years that one realises that he is too good to be true. </PARA>
<PARA> His electorate is next to mine. I find him very cooperative. I am very well aware of how hard he works and I know how he is respected and well-liked in his electorate and throughout Western Australia. When we nominated him last year we suspected that he would do a very good job. His performance has confirmed that expectation. He has been a very fair chairman. He has been firm. He has shown commonsense and carried out his duties with a sense of humour. If that is not enough, he hates late nights. I think that Ron Edwards is the best choice for this job and deserves the support of all members of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker, and congratulations on your recent appointment. It gives me considerable pleasure to second the nomination of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) for the position of Chairman of Committees. Throughout his 10 years of parliamentary service and particularly in his role as a Deputy Chairman of Committees, Bruce Cowan has ably demonstrated his recognition of and commitment to the essential and basic requirement of maintaining the dignity and authority of the Chair. His reputation for fairness and firmness, his vast reserves of patience and commonsense, and his understanding and upholding of the procedures and traditions of the Parliament are all qualities which will stand him in good stead to perform the duties and responsibilities of this position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This morning we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), and you, Mr Speaker, emphasising the need for an improvement in the performance and conduct of the business of this House. No-one has greater influence over the standard of debate and conduct than does the person in the chair. If the proceedings of this House are to be conducted in an orderly and disciplined manner, that person must have the knowledge, the experience and the authority to exercise properly the powers at his or her disposal. That person must also be recognised by both Government and Opposition members as having the ability, the capacity and the commitment to control proceedings in an impartial manner, without fear or favour, and in accordance with Standing Orders. Bruce Cowan is such a person. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1980 he has most ably and conscientiously represented the electorate and electors of Lyne in this House. He has served with distinction in numerous capacities on various committees, both parliamentary and party. He was first appointed as a Deputy Chairman of Committees in February 1985. He has carried out his role with impartiality, with dignity, with tact, with discretion and with great respect for this institution and all that it stands for and represents. He has earned, deserves and enjoys the respect, the trust and the friendship of members on both sides of this House. One of the greatest privileges I have enjoyed in the six years I have served in this Parliament is to have had the opportunity to come to know Bruce Cowan as a willing listener, a wise counsellor and a good friend. Not only do I respect and trust him but also I admire him enormously as a dedicated and efficient parliamentary colleague and, perhaps more importantly, as a man who, in the face of the personal tragedy of his wife's sudden death, displayed qualities of courage and determination which allowed him to confront the challenge and sadness of his great loss and to overcome it in a manner which was an example to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> I am honoured to have been given this opportunity of seconding the nomination of Bruce Cowan for the position of Chairman of Committees. I do so confidently in the certain knowledge that he has the depth, the qualities, the commitment of character, the experience and understanding and the undoubted ability to undertake and fulfil the significant duties and responsibilities of this position in an exemplary manner. I commend his nomination to all members of both sides of this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the years a certain routine has developed in the matter of the election of the Deputy Speaker in that, before offering my very sincere congratulations to the victor, I have always prefaced those remarks by addressing a few words to Clarrie Millar, who was always the unsuccessful candidate. I always said with total sincerity that my joy in the election of our candidate reflected in no way any sense of demerit in his candidature. I am sure that all honourable members share my joy in seeing our good friend Clarrie Millar in the gallery. The good wishes that we always extended to him on those occasions continue today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On this occasion the difference is that I preface the remarks I want to address to my friend Ronald Edwards by saying similiarly to Bruce Cowan that what I want to say to the successful candidate in no way reflects any feeling on our part that he would not have discharged the important duties of this role with distinction and integrity. Our good feelings and good wishes are with him. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to take this opportunity to be the first to extend the heartiest of congratulations on behalf of myself and the Government to my friend and colleague Ron Edwards. His success in this contest can only have made more sweet his victory against the odds, but in the end with a very comfortable margin, on 24 March this year. His position carries with it the same responsibilities that I referred to when talking about the position of Speaker. I have the utmost confidence that Ron Edwards will show, as he did in the previous term, all those qualities of tact, judgment and strength which are necessary to support you, Mr Speaker, in your role as he discharges his as your deputy. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying to Ron Edwards that in his period in this Parliament he has earned, more than any other person that I can think of right across the board, the affection and respect of all members. He goes into this important task with an enormous reservoir of goodwill. We on this side of the House know, as I am sure our friends opposite know, that he will discharge his important duties with very great distinction. </PARA>

I am very encouraged by the remarks made today about parliamentary behaviour. I think those views will be shared across this chamber, and certainly in the wider community. I particularly thank my colleagues the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) and the member for Canning (Mr Gear) for nominating me and for their remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very interesting that we have one thing in common in this place and that is that we all have to learn to live with uncertainty, and the uncertainty of the electoral process is always with us. There was one very gratifying thing about today's ballot; I was a little more certain of the outcome, and it was conducted more quickly. The House might be interested to know that such is the uncertainty that surrounds us all that, in fact, I am on the mailing list of the former members of parliament. I advised Gordon Bryant-in terms that referred to Mark Twain and exaggeration-that that really was a bit premature and there were 234 votes in my favour, and I understand that he is going to delete my name from that list, if he has not deleted me from this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly thank my colleagues in this Parliament for their kind remarks about me which reflect what is very special about this place. There is no doubt that the House of Representatives is the main game and to those who have just joined this Parliament I say, `Welcome to the main game'. This is a very important game, and all of us have had bestowed upon us some very special privileges by our voters. I am happy that more voters have bestowed those privileges upon us than they did upon the other side, and that will be continually reinforced during the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> In making these remarks I also say that one of the things that all members in this place should respect is that a democratic chamber of this kind is a very important place, and we are seeing the people in eastern Europe striving to set up what amounts to a chamber of this kind. I hope that all members of this House understand and respect it-I am sure they do-as much as I and others do. </PARA>
<PARA> The former member for Wide Bay, Clarrie Millar, has been of great assistance in conveying to me the notion of what parliamentary behaviour and conduct is about, and I thank him for that. I say to all voters out there that all of us must be troubled at times when we see their cynicism about our process and reflect upon how seriously people take that process in other countries. I hope we are able to engender a good feeling about the parliamentary process in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I particularly thank my family-my wife is here today-and my staff. I thank my parliamentary colleagues and I bid a warm welcome to my team which will be working with me in this chamber. The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) will be working with me, colleagues on his side of the House and colleagues on my side. We will have a very interesting three years in this chamber and I look forward to working with all members of it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the House of Representatives expresses its deep regret at the death on Sunday, 18 March 1990 of Robert Katter, member of the House of Representatives for the seat of Kennedy from 1966 until his retirement earlier this year, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Bob Katter was born on 5 September 1918 in Brisbane. He grew up in Cloncurry where his family ran the general store. He attended school in Charters Towers where he was an athletics and football champion and active in local theatre and public speaking. He studied law at the University of Queensland and served as an infantry captain in World War II. Before entering Federal Parliament Bob was a councillor for the Cloncurry Shire from 1946 to 1967, including two periods as chairman. He served as a member of the executive of the Local Government Association of Queensland and he was chairman of the Local Government Association's Canberra committee on local government. He was one of Federal Parliaments longest serving National Party members. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob was appointed as Minister for the Army in the McMahon Government in 1972. He served on various Commonwealth delegations and on parliamentary committees, including the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety, of which he was Chairman, from 1976 to 1983, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. Throughout his long public life, Bob represented the people of north Queensland with dedication, and he represented them with energy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, there are many occasions when this House expresses its sorrow at the passing of former members and there is always sincerity at the passing of those motions. On this occasion our sadness, I believe, is particularly keen, in part because Bob Katter was so recently our colleague in this place. Our memories of him, our fondness and respect for him, are therefore also much fresher in our minds. </PARA>
<PARA> I have particularly fond memories of Bob. On a number of occasions during the heat of political battle he went out of his way privately to engender the comfort of his personal support for me on some controversial issues. He did this without fuss and with conviction. I had a very special respect for him. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Government I extend to Bob Katter's family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I wish to join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in expressing our deep regret at the death on 18 March of Bob Katter. I know that he will be sadly missed by his many friends on both sides of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The late Bob Katter epitomised the typical outback Australian. He was a man of the land who understood the rigours of life in one of the harshest parts of Australia. Bob Katter came from a pioneer family in north-west Queensland. His father went to Cloncurry in the gold rushes of the 1890s. Bob was born, as the Prime Minister said, in Brisbane in 1918 but spent most of his life in north-west Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> He was understandably proud of the fact that his father was one of the two dozen original investors to start Qantas and of the fact that perhaps two of the most famous Australians, Qantas and our national song, Waltzing Matilda, were born in his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob was politically active for much of his life. Indeed, he could be considered as a political enigma, having been a member of all three major parties. As a member of the Labor Party, he worked as a union delegate on the Brisbane wharves. He stood as a Liberal Party candidate for the State seat of Flinders in 1957. He finally won the seat of Kennedy for the then Country Party in 1966. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister said, prior to coming to Parliament he had been a councillor on the Cloncurry Shire Council for 20 years, since 1946. Bob believed passionately in the principle of a fair go for all. As a councillor in Cloncurry he introduced some major reforms at the local government level. Chief among these was the construction of the first pensioner units provided by local government in Queensland, which were built in Cloncurry in the late 1950s. This initiative was considered a radical idea at the time, but to Bob it was completely in character to want to help those who could not adequately provide for themselves. Another local government initiative implemented by Bob was to provide Cloncurry residents with refrigerators. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hardly surprising that Bob was extremely well loved by his constituents. He was rewarded highly by Australians of European descent, just as he was by the descendants of Australia's original inhabitants. As a councillor and later as a Federal member, Bob was committed to promoting the welfare of Aboriginal people. At one stage while he was in Cloncurry, Bob took over the local picture theatre. His first action was to remove the steel railings which separated the Aboriginals from other Australians. It is difficult for many of us to imagine that such restrictions were commonplace in Australia only 30-odd years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in many areas we do not seem to have made much progress. For example, in the late 1950s in Cloncurry there was a spate of police bashings and cell deaths involving Aboriginals. Few people had the courage to come out in public and fight for the protection of Aboriginals, but Bob Katter did. As a result, he aroused enormous respect in the Aboriginal people in his area. </PARA>
<PARA> The name of Bob Katter was synonymous with the city of Mount Isa. Mount Isa is in frontier country and its people are a special breed of toughness and mateship. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob's election to Parliament in 1966 came in the wake of industrial problems in Mount Isa and was due in part to a view that a conciliatory approach was needed to reduce the extent of restrictive work and management practices. Bob was such a conciliator and, as I noted before, he had a strong record in trade unionism. Perhaps one of Bob's most famous achievements was his involvement with Reg Williams and Hugh Sawrey in establishing the Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach. Bob was the founding chairman of that enduring memorial to outback endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA> As the local member for one of the largest Federal seats in the country, Bob was well aware of the tyranny of distance. He probably travelled more miles in his life in covering his electorate than did any other member of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob was Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety from 1976 to 1983 and, during his time as the member for Kennedy, he saw major improvements made to the condition of roads in north-west Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob was one of the last of the old-time bush politicians. He had many of the traditional old Labor characteristics. He had a great respect for those on the other side of the House who also, in his opinion, still espoused those values.</PARA>
<PARA> As a newcomer to Parliament in 1987 I personally benefited from Bob Katter's advice and from the tremendous stock of his experience in this House which he had built up over almost a quarter of a century. I am sure that many other members have benefited from that advice, as the Prime Minister has indeed acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob's parliamentary colleagues will remember him as a man who was generous to a fault, who worked to the best of his ability for the good of all Australians. Above all else, Bob was a man of the people. He will be sorely missed not only by his electorate but by members of this House. I am grateful for the opportunity to extend, on behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia, our condolences to Joy and his children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great sadness that I rise to support this condolence motion on behalf of the Parliamentary National Party. The Hon. Bob Katter was a man who served this country selflessly as the member for Kennedy until his retirement earlier this year. I entirely agree with, and support, the comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who have highlighted his local government and other activities in his electorate. I would like particularly to draw attention to Bob's maiden speech to the House, which he made in February 1967. He covered the topics of defence, foreign affairs, trade, the need for decentralisation, the promotion of `frontier development' and, of course, roads. These subjects were to continue to receive his attention throughout his long and distinguished parliamentary career.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bob Katter was a Minister in the McMahon Government in 1972. He was the last Minister for the Army as a separate portfolio. Through his committee work he was instrumental in the establishment of Norforce and 51 Far North Queensland Regiment. Quite often I had lengthy conversations with Bob Katter about northern defence-the importance of the issue of northern defence and the requirements associated with it. He gave that whole policy area a great priority of attention. He built on his experiences from World War II and his work as Australia's last ever Minister for the Army. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of Norforce and related units as regional forces which utilise the talents and local knowledge of Army Reserve members in the Northern Territory and northern Queensland is a testimony to the farsightedness of Bob Katter. As the Prime Minister has said, Bob's committee work also allowed him the opportunity to achieve much in the areas of road safety, Aboriginal affairs, foreign affairs, defence, trade and family law. I would like to highlight Bob's efforts regarding the introduction of random breath testing and his support for that, at times, extremely controversial proposal. Once again, he made the statesman-like decision to support what he believed was right even though some of the patrons of watering holes in his own electorate may have had a different view. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, above all, honourable members will remember Bob Katter for the way he went about representing that huge electorate of Kennedy and making himself available in the remote and isolated communities right across Kennedy. I know that if he were in operation today as the member for Kennedy he would be doing all he could in relation to the devastating floods in parts of Queensland. Even though the main thrust of those floods was just to the south of his electorate, he would be out and about doing that which he could with regard to the crisis facing constituents and electors in Queensland generally.</PARA>
<PARA> It was a privilege to attend the very moving funeral service to Bob Katter held in Mount Isa in the last week of the election campaign. The Katter family and I recognised that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) was present representing the Government in what was clearly a very busy week. The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) and many National Party members and senators were also present at that very large service. Perhaps the most moving moment of the service came when Bob Katter's grandson walked out ahead of the coffin carrying that magnificent brown hat of Bob Katter. In one sense that said it all, along with the magnificent address made by Bob Katter Jr on the occasion of that service.</PARA>
<PARA> Bob Katter will be sorely missed by all those who ever came into contact with him. His passing is a great loss to the National Party and the nation. On behalf of members of the Parliamentary National Party, I extend my sympathy to Joy Katter, who I know is listening at this time, and to members of the Katter family. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Herbert)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bob Katter was widely respected by the people of north-west Queensland. He came from a true pioneering family. His father, Carl, had settled in the Cloncurry area in 1896 where he established a family drapery store in Ramsey Street. I ask honourable members to picture the state in which they set up that business in Cloncurry in 1896: vast distances; primitive medical care-almost every service we take for granted today absent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bob was educated in Cloncurry, probably by the nuns, and completed his secondary education at the Mount Carmel College at Charters Towers-his alma mater of which he often spoke with great pride. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said, he commenced a law course at Queensland University. When war broke out in 1939 he enlisted in the Australian Army and rose to the rank of captain. </PARA>
<PARA> His service in local government was notable to the extent that he served on the Cloncurry-Mount Isa Shire Council from 1946 to 1967. Honourable members would be aware that he was Chairman and Deputy Chairman of that Shire Council at a time of great rapid growth in north-western Queensland with the development of the mining industry. He played a pivotal role in the economic development of that region. The stories of his assistance to the people are legion. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) alluded to two of them. The one quality that he had in a land of adversity in north-west Queensland was that special western sense of humour. An article published in the North Queensland Register of 22 March this year recounts a glimpse of that western sense of humour. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> While he was chairman of the Cloncurry/Mt Isa Shire in the 1950s he had lobbied unsuccessfully for a new hospital in Cloncurry. The State Government of the day refused to budge. He and a cohort set a plan into motion over a bottle or two of Scotch where they would burn down the hospital, thus forcing the government to fund a new one. Hughenden had only recently got a new hospital after its old one was destroyed by fire, so the plan they thought, was sound. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only after an hour-long entreaty on the part of the Catholic priest that the pair abandoned the plot and resumed the more legitimate practice of lobbying Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that story!</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, and I believe the Leader of the Opposition, mentioned that Bob was involved in the trade union movement. He was a member of the executive of the State Service Union in Queensland and was also a member of the executive of the tally clerks division of the Federated Clerks Union in Queensland. He had a long history of active unionism prior to his entry into public life. </PARA>
<PARA> His appointment as Minister for the Army in February 1972 gave him great joy. He was very proud of the Australian Army and took great pride in singing the praises of the Services when he was Army Minister. I served with him for five years as a member of the Defence subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. On all occasions he expressed a tremendous interest in ensuring that this country had an adequate and capable Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> He also had a special interest in African affairs and was a member of the Australian parliamentary observer team to Zimbabwe in 1980. Only last year, he and his family revisited Zimbabwe to look up people whom he had met, and to visit places that he had been to, during his trip in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was listening to the Prime Minister and to the Leader of the Opposition I thought of Plato's words: Call no man blessed until he is dead. If only Plato had had the slightest notion of the rich positive truth of that statement. Bob Katter knew what that statement meant. He had a deep and abiding Christian faith, a closeness to God and a closeness to his fellow man. He was able to instil that presence of closeness to his fellow man and closeness to God in other people. That is why, above all, he is respected by the people of north-west Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> He leaves behind him two sons, Bob Jr and Norman, a daughter, Geraldine, from his first marriage, his wife, Joy, and their sons, Carl and Richard, and their daughter, Bernadette. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the occasion to speak to this motion. This is really a sad occasion for this House and for those of us who knew Bob Katter. To try to describe Bob's characteristics in five minutes in a parliament in which he served for some 24 years is not easy. I would like to reflect more on his latter day activities. I became acquainted with Bob Katter in 1964 in local government. He held the local government movement very close to his heart. In fact, in his latter years he took pride in the fact that he serviced 33 shires in his electorate and that he knew each one individually. When I got to know him in 1964 he was one of the movers and shakers of local government, particularly in north Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My next association with him was in 1974 when I ran for the seat of Dawson and he became my mentor. We became very close. He had just lost his first wife and so took me into his confidence as to his future. He was meticulous in every way. Campaigning in a country seat is not easy but every time we came to a small centre Bob would stop the car, get out, polish his shoes and say, `If you're going to present yourself, present yourself well'. And then in he would go with polished shoes. It was my first occasion of coming face to face with a real politician. He was a big man in heart and a big man in structure. Over the time I came to know him very well I also came to know Joy very well, whom he married in 1976. I remember the night that the National Party celebrated that. Those of us who where there would not want me to repeat what was done on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob Katter was a big man with a big heart. He was a great Australian. In fact, when he retired last year the Parliament lost the last real character. A character is someone who is entirely predictable-one can tell from one moment to the next what he or she will do. Bob was very predictable: he was always looking for a telephone or somebody else to talk to and he was always picking race course winners. I am not sure whether he was successful in that but he was known for it. He was predictable in his great support of north-west Queensland and northern Australia. He was a firm believer in the potential and resources of the north. Right through to the end he championed that area above everything else. The fact that the Governor-General has just indicated that more defence forces will be sited at Weipa would have given him some joy. He was interested in the development, the potential and particularly the defence of the north-west. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob Katter became a folk hero in the west. Some of the stories may not be true but one does not spoil a good story for want of the truth. He went to America for the launching of Crocodile Dundee. He took a lot of joy in that. I think he bought his first Akubra hat for that occasion. He came back with many stories about it. I want to relate two stories which really reflect the man and the manner in which he was held in Queensland, particularly in the outback. He was once going along a country road-unbitumened, as they still are, Mr Prime Minister-with a big cloud of dust behind him. A car was coming from the opposite direction. Outback roads have only two-wheel ruts. Bob was determined to keep to the wheel ruts and the other car was forced off the road. As the other car passed, a woman put her head out of the window and yelled out, `Pig'. Bob immediately retorted by saying, `Bitch', went down the road about 200 yards and hit the biggest boar that he had ever seen. This boar had been hidden by the dust. </PARA>
<PARA> The other story can be testified to by people who were at the occasion. It shows Bob's ability to talk to anyone and agree with everybody. Some honourable members will recall the Blackwater miners housing dispute. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bennelong might be able to confirm this. I understand that a big meeting was held at Blackwater. The chiefs arrived, went in and sat down. Bob came later, as usually happened. He went in the front door. On the way in all the miners said, `Give'em heaps Bob. Tell them what to do'. Bob sat there all day and, predictably, left the meeting early. He had said his piece and as he was going out the chairman of the meeting asked-and this is keeping in mind the fact that Bob had just given a 20-minute speech-`Bob, can you just tell us one thing before you go-are you with us or against us?', and Bob said, `Yes, that's right'. And out he went.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A comment was made about the fact that he had a deep interest in road safety. Bob was always keen to get out a press release. The best press release that he issued was when the Volvo being driven by his wife over some of these country roads turned over. He immediately wrote a press release saying how good safety belts were because they had saved his life. I am not sure whether he championed the breathalyser for the same reason. </PARA>
<PARA> He was also predictable in his pride to this establishment and what it meant to the people of Australia. He was a parliamentarian. He believed in so many things that this institution stands for. I agree with the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). When he was Minister for the Army he took a very active interest. He told me on many an occasion that at that time he had the opportunity of naming a new helicopter for the forces; he called it the Kalkadoon, the name of a rather fierce tribe of Aborigines that originally settled around Mount Isa. He was quite proud of that. </PARA>
<PARA> He was also proud of his relationship with the Aborigines. I believe that his attitude towards all others has produced one of the best Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs that Australia has seen; his son Bob Jr. He was most predictable in his belief not only of his family but also all the families who settled in western Queensland. He was predictable in his Christian faith and on all occasions he was prepared to stand by it. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end I came to know Bob Katter in a different way in that I understood his predictability in his courage. It would come as no surprise to many around here to learn that over the last three or four years to belong to the National Party in Queensland and to be a federal representative has not been easy. Bob was always prepared to give his opinion-and he did it to his own detriment within the Party circle at times-as to the way in which he felt things were being run. That took a lot of courage. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, he showed courage in his last few months when he knew that his illness was terminal. Since August last year he had not been a frequent attender in this chamber and some of us were not sure why because we could never find out exactly how deep and serious the illness was. </PARA>
<PARA> When I came back from Bob Katter's funeral at Mount Isa, I spoke to a person who had driven him just before Christmas-two months prior to his death. The car driver said that Bob Katter had come out of the aircraft and had sat in the car with a pillow that he had to use. When the car driver commented on his complexion, saying, `Are you ill, Mr Katter?', Bob said, `No, it has been rather hot lately'. At that time, Bob Katter knew that the end was imminent but he was not prepared to indulge in self-pity. I think that takes a lot of courage. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention Bob junior's tribute to his father at the funeral service. That took a lot of doing, too. Young Bob praised his father's dedication, his devotion and his belief in all of those things that I have mentioned tonight and in many others. Bob junior said that those values were part of the father that he knew and respected. Things have not been easy between Bob junior and Bob senior. Again, many here will realise that, if one is a federal politician, one is not felt much of by State politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> It happens that in family circles tensions rise and fall to a pretty low ebb at times. But the Katter family was a great one and the relationship between Bob junior and Bob senior, though stormy at times, was always one that I respected, in particular when Bob junior mentioned that his father's motto was: play hard, work hard and pray hard. Those things reflected his life. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made of the Stockman's Hall of Fame. Big as that Stockman's Hall of Fame is, it is not as big as the man that we knew as Bob Katter. He was a man who was big in so many ways. On behalf of many of my colleagues in Queensland who are no longer in this chamber and who retired at the last election-Mr Adermann, Mr Millar, who is sitting in the gallery, Mr Ian Cameron and other members-and particularly on behalf of those people in the north and west of Queensland who knew Bob Katter as the character that I have known, I want to pay my respects to Joy, his wife, a person we hold very dear, to the children of his first marriage, Bob, Norman and Geraldine, and to the children of his second marriage. I believe that the Katter family has lost a very fine husband and father. The Parliament has lost its last real character. And the nation has lost a great Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the people of the vast electorate of Kennedy, I would like to endorse the words of sentiment and condolence voiced here today in relation to the late Bob Katter Sr, or Old Bob as he was affectionately known throughout the electorate. There can be no doubt that the late Bob Katter Sr was a man of the people who really put his constituents above the hurly-burly of politics. He was just as much at home addressing a Labour Day march in Barcaldine, as he did in 1987, as he was mixing with royalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bob Katter Sr was an individual with an awareness of the needs of country Queenslanders. He always strove to improve the lot of those living in remote areas. As we have already heard, he stood up for what he believed in and, indeed, knew foolishness when he saw it. He was the Queensland National Party's most outspoken opponent of the abortive `Joh for Canberra' push. He hit his Party bosses hard in 1987 when members of the Queensland parliamentary National Party were directed to leave the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob Katter Sr, Old Bob, was accurately described in a newspaper article published in the Australian earlier this year as one of the last of the old-time bush politicians, a straight shooter who at the height of the Queensland State election campaign last year was prepared to put politics and, indeed, his serious illness aside to greet the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at Mount Isa Airport during one of the Prime Minister's visits to the area. I am sure that the Prime Minister will remember that meeting well and fondly. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the late Bob Katter Sr was considered by his electorate as a great bloke. He will be sadly missed. On behalf of what is now my electorate, I offer my sincere condolences to Bob's wife, Joy, and to the entire Katter family. </PARA>

He had that certain something which, I have to admit as a Victorian, only a Queenslander can achieve: that is, the legendary outback Australian. This was recognised in the United States, where he was in some demand as a successful promoter of Australia and of that particular image.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bob represented a huge and diverse electorate for over 24 years and he did so with style and distinction. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has mentioned quite a number of those forms of style, but he left me one story to recount. Bob appeared at the Remuneration Tribunal on one occasion. He was explaining the difficulty of covering his huge electorate. It was put to him, `Well, what do you need in facilities, equipment and assistance to cover this electorate?'. He said, `I need an aeroplane, a car, a four-wheel drive and a camel'. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob had a distinguished parliamentary career. He was Minister for the Army, and reference has been made to his association with the Army and his pride in it. He was also proud to be the representative of this Parliament at the General Assembly of the United Nations. He had a special concern and consideration for local government which continued in this place long after he ceased to be a local government representative. He also had that special association of Qantas with his electorate and the achievement of the construction of the Stockman's Hall of Fame. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob was a strong supporter and upholder of traditional family and community values. This was reflected in his own family, of whom he always spoke with great pride. It also says something of the family relationship which the honourable member for Dawson has mentioned that Bob junior, his son, also entered politics. I wish to express my sincere sympathy to Joy and to the family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my remarks briefly to those made here today. Bob Katter was a longstanding National Party member in this place. It would not be appropriate for those of us on this side of the House to claim him as one of our own. Bob Katter, however, would have wished us to do so. He had a delightful way of being a friend to everybody who he felt had a piece of historical tradition which he wished to share and to discuss with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the most delightful features of my first term in this place was to be a member of a committee that Bob Katter chaired, the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. The nature of that Committee was such that it was close-knit and its members frequently toured Australia. On those tours Bob took the opportunity to educate me in the Labor politics of what I would describe as the back blocks of Queensland. In that context he certainly thought of himself as being within the Labor Party tradition. In the last election campaign I noted that a number of people who have been in the National Party in the last couple of decades and who are coming back to the Labor Party, including as Party members, see themselves as such, in a very similar way to Bob Katter. </PARA>
<PARA> He saw himself as so much a part of that tradition that he felt constrained to bring various National Party councillors down to see me to ensure that we got our history right for next year and that Barcaldine was, indeed, the place where the Labor Party was founded. It would have been a matter of enormous disappointment to him if subsequently our committees of historians decided, in less than accurate historical tradition, to try on something else. But he really was a strong advocate of that. </PARA>
<PARA> So far honourable members who have spoken have mentioned him largely in a local, political and social context. He made a serious material contribution when he was here as well as representing his electorate effectively. The subcommittee to which I referred earlier lost its blandness with Bob Katter as chairman and became known throughout the country as the Katter Committee. Subsequently, when Manfred Cross picked it up it was effectively known from that point on as the Cross Committee. It had that character largely because of what Bob Katter did with it. He ensured that the committee was relevant to the defence debate of this country-indeed, not only relevant but also central. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee reports that came out in the period in which Bob Katter was chairman, over which he presided and which he ensured were written to his satisfaction, were amongst the best contributions to the defence debate of this country ever written and certainly ever emanating from this Parliament. So he was a serious contributor via that committee process to our national life. Those of us who got to know him will miss him deeply. All of us will want to express the sincerest sympathies to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When Bob Katter died on Sunday, 18 March somebody who perhaps reflected better than anybody I have known in recent political life the enigma of western Queensland died too. Much has been said of Bob Katter as a man and as a parliamentarian. Unlike most others, I remember well his first campaign. When this brash bush fellow came out at the time of the aftermath of the Mount Isa industrial turbulence I think all of us wondered just what sort of contribution he could make on the national political scene.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has just referred to the fact that as a backbencher Bob Katter achieved some prominence, justifiably, for his role in the Katter committee on defence. In fact there was a Katter committee on road safety and a Katter committee on local government. As a backbencher he made quite a unique and positive contribution on each of these three committees. Without going into the record in respect of each of those committees, there was a positive input to government policy which still stands on the statute books. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) spoke of the difference that Bob Katter had with the Queensland Government as chairman of the Standing Committee on Road Safety. I well remember the fairly vigorous campaign that he undertook against the then National Party Government in Queensland on the question of driving under the influence offences and his preparedness to go out on a limb and suggest that it was wrong at a time when it did not really take kindly to dissent. </PARA>
<PARA> Many aspects of Bob Katter's life have been mentioned in this place today. At the funeral Bob Katter Jr spoke of their past. I think few of us realised the humble origins and the extraordinary difficulties and hardship that the people of western Queensland suffered during the days of Bob Katter Sr, Bob Katter Jr spoke of living in a galvanised iron house with no power and no refrigeration. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) mentioned the decision of the Cloncurry local government that refrigerators should be issued to everybody in Cloncurry. Bob Katter recognised that the people there had no money with which to buy refrigerators of their own and that the nature of their life in that climate was such that they were seriously deprived without them. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob Katter was very much a man of the people. I am glad that mention was made of his involvement in those difficult times with Aborigines in Cloncurry and Mount Isa. Bob was very much seen as a champion of the Aboriginal people. They were Australians as far as he was concerned and he supported their rights to be equal in any context. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I was interested to read the eulogies in the North-West Star, a paper from Mount Isa. Mrs Chris James, a contract cleaner from Mount Isa, said, following his death:</PARA>
<PARA> I am really sad . . . He was always there for people . . . You could go to him any time and he'd always try to help you . . . He'll be greatly missed. </PARA>
<PARA>We will miss him. I know that all of us who knew him are glad that we had the pleasure of his friendship and his company. To Joy, Carl, Richard and Berna- dette and to Norman, Bob Jr and Geraldine, the children of his first marriage, I would like to extend, on behalf of Rosemary and myself, our sincere sympathy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also am greatly saddened by the death of Bob Katter. Very many aspects of his life and work have been referred to. One aspect that I would like to emphasise concerns his commitment in terms of being an ambassador for Australia-his commitment in international affairs. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) and I led a delegation to the European Parliament only a few months ago. At that time Bob Katter was ill but, nevertheless, was part of the delegation. Even though he was ill he participated fully in the proceedings. He asked questions. He did everything to show that he was going to be a proper and a good representative of Australia in what was obviously a very turbulent time in Europe. He was really enthralled by what was happening in Europe. I think he has been a very great ambassador for Australia in all of the parliamentary delegations of which he has been a member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Reference has been made to the fact that he was very proud of his participation in the original Zimbabwe committee. Although he was very interested in defence matters, he was a man who believed passionately in peace. Certainly, he believed very much in the equality of people of all races. In that sense he was very proud of his participation in the events in Zimbabwe. As has been mentioned, he returned to that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember him also because he would come to a member and discuss problems that one had in the Parliament. This happened in the early days when I was first in this Parliament. That friendship continued. As has been mentioned, he also had some problems with his son at a critical point when there were some conflicts in relation to the Joh for Canberra situation. I remember his feeling great agony about the fact that he was in conflict with his son. However, he was able to discuss it with friends. I think that was just a measure of the man-the fact that on the one hand he stood up for what he believed in but on the other hand he felt deeply about his family. </PARA>
<PARA> One story about Bob which I often tell people concerns the time when we were members of a parliamentary delegation to China. Of course, he was always interested in military matters. As one would know, parliamentary delegations to China have a few banquets. One of those banquets was attended by some generals from the military. Of course, he thought that was wonderful. He talked to an old general from the armed forces. They had drinks together and got on greatly. At the end of the function when we all suddenly got up and left, he came outside and said to me, `Theo, that general is a great bloke. But what is this Long March he keeps talking about?'. Bob Katter always had that great sense of humour. He was a great individual, a great parliamentarian and a great example to all of us. I also want to send my sympathies to Joy and his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage of the condolence motion, many things have been said about Bob Katter. I want to associate myself briefly with the condolence motion. I think my relationship with Bob Katter was probably unique amongst members of this House in that I had a very close working relationship with him in my time as a senator for Queensland. We did in fact share an electorate even though we did not share the same political party. I think it was just fairly typical of Bob Katter that from the time I became a senator he took the initiative. He was very kind to me. He always emphasised and extended to me the courtesy of the services of his office whenever I was in what he regarded as his electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not everybody would realise just how enormous his electorate has been at times. When I was first elected to the Senate in 1974 it stretched nearly to Kingaroy. In those days there were not the charter allowances available that there are now. I used to encounter Bob Katter at the extremities of his electorate. He would have travelled there by car over those terrible roads that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) referred to. In fact, he was away from home for weeks at a time serving his electorate, which was always referred to wherever one went as Katter country by all the people who lived in it. He had an almost symbiotic relationship with his electorate and his electors. It was not just a case of their knowing him as the member. He knew them. </PARA>
<PARA> I had family who lived in his electorate and who had no particular occasion to have much contact with him but who had met him. When I mentioned them to him and he pursued where they lived and their names, he could recall them. It was that real caring knowledge that he had of the people that he represented that made him so successful politically. In my experience he was a man of great reason and humanity who cared deeply about those things that were fundamental to him. Anybody who knew him knew what was fundamental to him: his church, his family and his nation. On matters of principle he was absolutely immovable. I refer briefly to the enormous pressure he and others came under in early 1987. He was very outspoken and adamant about what he believed in as a matter of principle. </PARA>
<PARA> His hard work in his electorate and on committees is legendary. I also served with him as a senator on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and saw his work there. I had a couple of personal associations with him and his electorate. There is one other person whom I should mention in this debate and who I know would want me to mention him. I refer to the returning officer for Moncrieff, who has held that position since only last year and who came there from Kennedy. He made sure early in the piece that I knew that he came from Katter country. I have no idea what that gentleman's politics are but, when I was having a bit of contact now and then with him as the returning officer for Moncrieff during the election campaign, as word was coming through that Bob had not made a recovery from his surgery late the previous year-which was unexpected to me as I was not as in the know as some of his colleagues were-he and I shared a number of anxious conversations. We were very sad to hear, just before the election, that he had died. </PARA>
<PARA> I was sad that, after all his hard work-he had a hard life-he did not have a chance to enjoy the retirement that he had been looking forward to. I feel particularly sad for Joy and his young family who did not have a chance to have some more of him in his retirement. He was a very dedicated husband and father. Many of us will miss him for many reasons. I extend my personal condolences to Joy and to all those who cared about him. There are many people who cared about him because they were people whom he cared about too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to add a few words of tribute to Bob Katter, a man whom I liked very much. His background was even more interesting and complex than the previous tributes have indicated. He certainly came from a pioneering family in Queensland, but it was a pioneering family with a difference-a Lebanese family. The original family name should be transcribed as Kat'r. The affectionate description of him as `the old camel driver' really reflects this Middle Eastern origin. He was a cousin of the famous romantic poet Kahlil Gibran. I remember pointing this out to Gough Whitlam. Gough replied, `If I had only known, I would have had my staff combing the works of the Prophet'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His consciousness of and indeed his pride in his background, which has not been mentioned so far, was one reason for his tolerance and humanity on racial issues. He stood out like a sore thumb or granny's tooth in the Queensland National Party context in his forward-looking attitude on racial issues. He was very courageous in that area, as he was, as a number of people have said, in 1987. He was also very sympathetic to `old Labor'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) remarked that Bob Katter had been a member of three major parties. He could also have mentioned the Queensland Labor Party, under whose banner he once stood for Kennedy. Despite the Catholic background that has been mentioned, I think he was very briefly a member of the Communist Party. It used to be said of Billy Hughes that he had been a member of every political party except the Country Party. But, as he said, `You have to draw the line somewhere'. </PARA>
<PARA> I always enjoyed Bob Katter's company, his humour and his generosity of spirit. As the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has said, he was the last character in this place. I used to appreciate the fact that, if he liked a speech or an answer to a question, he would send a little note of approval. All of us who knew him have lost a very good friend and I pass on my respects to Joy and to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There would hardly be a member of this House who knew Bob Katter and who could not entertain us endlessly with stories of his unique character and immense charm. In view of the tributes that have gone before mine, I wish to keep my contribution short except to say that, when I was first elected in March 1983, I had the distinct pleasure of being seated next to Bob Katter. As I had been a student of politics during the 1970s, the name Bob Katter loomed very large as a well-known identity, and being seated next to him was something of a thrill for me. After a few days Bob realised that I was a solicitor and he excitedly said, `Peter, there is a matter of great importance that I need to discuss with you. I will ring you in the next couple of days'. I was very young and impression- able and very excited at having such a legend take such an interest in seeking my advice. When the phone call came through a couple of days later, he asked me to attend his office late at night. I went and he sat me down opposite his desk-I well remember it-and said, `Peter, I have a very serious problem. I have received an inheritance of a substantial land-holding but a number of problems have occurred on which I need your advice'. I replied, `That is interesting, Bob. What exactly is the problem?' He said, `There has been substantial damage to the titles office, and indeed the landscape which might identify my real estate has been altered.' I said, in a puzzled voice, `And just where is this real estate located, Bob?' to which he replied, `Beirut'. It cheesed Bob off no end for the remainder of his life that he was cheated of this substantial inheritance. In fact, a couple of years later, when he knew I was to visit the Middle East as part of a parliamentary delegation, specifically to Israel, he asked me whether I was interested in going to Beirut to identify that property, to which I replied, `No more than you are, Bob'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply say that Bob had three great loves in his life: his family, his Catholic faith and horseracing, although he was much more circumspect about the third than he was about his family and his Christian faith. People have touched on his political problems surrounding 1987. Bob often spoke about them, but I advise the House that he said that they were nothing compared with the great split within the Australian Labor Party in the 1950s which saw him leave the ALP and join the conservative parties. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been said, Bob was a unique character-a man of great charm with so many stories about the outback, which he loved so well. He loved northern Australia and particularly his electorate of Kennedy. He used to tell so many stories about how he operated the picture theatres when he was the ticket seller, the usher and the projectionist. There is no doubt that Bob was a fantastic character. We could also talk long into the night about the time he was chosen by the Australian Tourist Commission, following the great success of the Crocodile Dundee film in America, to act as an ambassador for Australia. He was courted by movie stars at premieres and receptions, all of which he took in his stride. He never lost that essential humility that was so apparent in this very great man. I wish to join with all the other members in expressing my sympathy to Joy and to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all members who have spoken here today have said, Bob Katter was indeed a remarkable man. I picked up one comment about him going to the airport to meet the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) when he was visiting Mount Isa. In 1983 and 1987 I had the experience of campaigning in Mount Isa. I knew Bob reasonably well at that stage, but not quite well enough.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was remarkable. I was not looking forward to the meeting with the Council. When I arrived there, Bob Katter was at the front door. I thought, `Oh well, Bob is here to join the fight'. But I was staggered that he was there as a supporter because, on two of the major issues, he did not agree with the view that the Council was putting forward. I always remember thinking after that occasion that he was-so much of what has been said today reflects this-a remarkable man in that quite regularly he took positions that people were surprised about unless they knew him very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bob Katter did have an interest across various areas. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) mentioned the education that he used to give him about early Labor politics. It was remarkable that when Bob Katter Jr spoke at the requiem mass for his father he went back to the meeting at the Cloncurry branch when the motion was moved to form the Queensland Labor Party. Bob had told me that story on many occasions and other stories about Labor history in Queensland. As the Leader of the House found, it was always extremely interesting and educational to hear those stories from someone like Bob Katter. </PARA>

I was about to say, if I had had the opportunity, that that was a compliment that I reciprocated to Bob. But he did not forget my interests when he went on a parliamentary delegation to New Zealand. When I got home one Friday night an envelope had arrived. I opened it up and there was a great photograph of Bob standing as close as one can get-he was a very nasty animal-to Sir Tristram, the great New Zealand stallion. He sent that back, which is an indication of how thoughtful he was about keeping in touch with people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to touch on the matter that was mentioned by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). I had the honour of attending the requiem mass for Bob Katter, representing the Prime Minister. Despite the difficulties that he had with his State colleagues, three former leaders of the National Party and the present Leader attended the requiem mass. They were the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), a former member for Richmond twice removed, the Rt Hon. Doug Anthony, and the member for Richmond at that time, then the Leader of the National Party, and the present Leader of the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the tribute paid by Bob Katter Jr to his father was unquestionably one of the most moving, if not the most moving, that I have ever heard. It was a deep honour to represent the Government on that occasion. I found it to be very worthwhile and a very moving occasion. I think that the present honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) summed up Bob Katter as well as anyone could have in what has been a very moving tribute to him today when he said that he was a great bloke. I think that all of us will very much miss Bob Katter. As the Leader of the House mentioned, Bob Katter Jr did say that underneath it all, Bob Katter lived and died a Labor man. </PARA>

As the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) remarked this afternoon, he worked very hard to get them there. I can recall remarks at the time that because of the needs and demands of Victoria, particularly Melbourne, the royal family should go there. He happened to remark, `They always want to go upstairs and not downstairs', and so he got them to Queensland. He was a great pioneer for Australia. As has been said this evening, he was a pioneer of the outback of Australia. He was a person respected by many throughout the community. He had a great respect for the safeguards of the Constitution and the royal family and these are the things upon which he built tradition.

As our first task, we conducted an inquiry into the ways in</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>which the Parliament could assist families of Vietnam veterans and the veterans themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset of the inquiry a particular incident occurred here when Mr Katter who, as has been mentioned, was the Minister for the Army at the end of the McMahon Government found himself puzzled by the issues that were bothering Vietnam veterans, particularly the causes of stress. In one instance, the South Australian Director of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, Glen Edwards, gave a very moving and personal account of the events that occurred when he returned to Australia. He was really speaking on behalf of many of those veterans. It reduced Bob Katter to tears. He came to me after that meeting and said, `Son, I never understood what we did. Please do what you can to fix it up'. He than asked my permission to withdraw from the inquiry and he did not participate in the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA> When the report was handed down in the Parliament, the Government's response was announced and most of the recommendations were picked up. He came to me and he just said, `Thank you'.

The Local Government Association, my local government committee and shires around Australia are indebted to him. Bob Katter gave to local government an elevation and priority that it had not previously enjoyed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on Saturday, 10 March 1990, of the Hon. Sir Reginald Charles Wright, senator for Tasmania from 1950 to 1978, a Minister of the Crown from 1968 to 1972, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and members of his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Reg Wright was born on 10 July 1905 at Castra Central, Tasmania. He was educated at Devonport State High School and at the University of Tasmania. He was admitted to the Bar in 1928 and lectured in law at the University of Tasmania for 15 years. He enlisted in the 2nd AIF in 1941 and was appointed lieutenant in the 6th Australian Field Regiment and was promoted to captain in 1943. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to entering Federal Parliament he was the deputy leader of the Liberal Party in the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1946 to 1949 and was the inaugural State President of the Liberal Party in Tasmania. He was elected to the Federal Parliament as a senator for Tasmania in 1950 and served in that position until his retirement in 1978. He was appointed as Minister for Works from 1968 to 1972. He served on various parliamentary committees, including the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders from 1956 to 1962 and from 1965 to 1971, the Senate Legislative and General Purpose Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs from 1973 to 1975 and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances where he served for a total of 17 years between 1956 and 1978. He was a leader of the parliamentary delegation to east Asia in 1969 as well as serving on other delegations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in expressing our regret on the sudden death on 10 March of Reg Wright, Liberal Senator for Tasmania for some 28 years. Reg was well regarded on both sides of the Parliament for his oratory skills and for his formidable memory. He was generally known as the watchdog of the Senate. Being a relative newcomer to the Parliament I was not privileged to know Reg Wright personally although I did hear him speak on several memorable occasions. I am told that he was one of the great characters of this Parliament, a fiercely independent senator, a fighter for Tasmania and, above all, a fine Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has given us personal details of Reg Wright's birth, education and legal experience. I will not duplicate that. A very successful period of his life began with his debut in politics in the early 1940s when he led the Tasmanian campaign against a series of constitutional referenda put forward by the then Labor Government. Soon after he found himself one of the Tasmanian delegates to the original Canberra conference called by then Mr Menzies to draw together 13 different groups into what became the Liberal Party. As such he was one of the founding members of the Party. This decision to become involved in politics meant giving up a chance of a seat on the State Supreme Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Reg was the inaugural State President of the Liberal Party, entering the political arena as a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1945 as the member for Franklin. He stayed there until 1949, becoming Deputy Leader of the Opposition during this period. He left State politics for the Federal arena in 1949, the year Menzies was swept to power. In Federal Parliament he served as Senate Whip from 1950 to 1951 and was a Minister for Works in the Gorton and McMahon governments from 1968 to 1972. He was also Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities, assisting the Minister for Trade and Industry, John McEwen, during the same period. </PARA>
<PARA> Reg's most endearing characteristics were his fierce independence, his tenacity and his ability to work hard both for his State and the nation as a whole. He worked tirelessly, as the Prime Minister has recorded, on the Senate Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee. In the Senate Estimates committees he became renowned among public servants for his detailed and persistent questioning on Appropriation Bills. His view of the Senate was that of a House of review, responsible only to the Parliament as a whole and to the Australian people. His attitude was that the Senate should, above all, maintain its independence. </PARA>
<PARA> Reg retired from the Senate in 1978 and was knighted later that year for distinguished public and parliamentary service. After his retirement he continued to practice law and run a small farm on the north-west coast of Tasmania. Reg is survived by his wife Letitia, and two sons and four daughters from his first marriage to Evelyn. He leaves 15 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren, all of whom he loved. In recognition of Sir Reginald's distinguished contribution to Australia and as a mark of respect the Commonwealth Government accorded him a state funeral. In addition to this the national flag was flown at half mast in Tasmania on the day of the funeral. </PARA>
<PARA> This Parliament owes Reg Wright the respect it bestows on most distinguished members. Reg was a statesman and a great Tasmanian. He never forgot the broader perspective on the issues confronting the nation and the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of members of the National Party I rise to support the condolence motion regarding the late Sir Reginald Charles Wright. Whilst I met the late Senator Wright on at least one occasion I did not know him personally. Clearly he was both a capable and very colourful senator representing Tasmania and holding the various positions which have been ascribed to him by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Library produced a set of clippings in relation to Senator Wright which indicated his wide-ranging interests and activities. I salute the service that he gave to the nation. I highlight in particular one incident in July 1974, perhaps pertinent to today, when he asked the new President of the Senate that his ballot paper for the election of the Senate be placed on the table of the Senate so that it could be examined. He did this because he was determined to have it known that he voted the way he wanted to vote and in support of his party nominee. It reflected his colourful approach as he sought to lay down a precedent. He was advised by the new President of the Senate that whilst the ballot papers were held in a sealed envelope they were not to be opened and placed on the Senate table. So the exercise ceased at that point. </PARA>
<PARA> He entered Federal Parliament having served in the State Parliament. By way of passing I note that there are some five new members in this House today who have come from one particular State Parliament. I wish them well. Sir Reginald Charles Wright gave great service to Tasmania and to the nation. I extend sympathy to members of his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one of the two residual members of this Parliament who served with Reg Wright in Cabinet I rise to add my support to this motion of condolence. There are several things one could say about Reg Wright. He was a tremendous character. We have just spoken of Bob Katter. Those honourable members who were not in the Parliament when Reg was about would know that Reg, in an entirely different order, was equally a character. He was one of those great discontented souls who seemed to wander alone and yet so often was right in his advocacy. He had a very forceful oratorical style, a very strong voice and he asserted himself on occasions when many of us would have wished he remained silent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He had a number of causes which he espoused. He was always a champion of the small farmer. He was a great champion of Tasmania. He was a champion of correctness in the law. One of the great contributions that he made and the reason that I wanted to join in this condolence motion was that he perhaps more than any other individual found so many errors in legislation drafted by Parliamentary Counsel and submitted to the Parliament. He was a very active participant in the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. During his term as a Minister he was a very active member of the legislation committee. It worries me that the sort of work that Reg Wright did is perhaps not done adequately today. So much legislation passes through both chambers. The opportunities to examine it in detail, to look at the precision of the words and to look at the application of it with respect to individuals is certainly not examined in the detail or to the degree that Reg Wright pursued during his time in the Senate. Reg Wright was a great Australian, a great Tasmanian and a great character. I join in extending my sympathy to his very extended family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the sole Government member of the House of Representatives from Tasmania, I feel I should say a few words. Certainly Sir Reginald Wright was much of what has been said of him, but he was also a fearless, aggressive and dangerous opponent of the Labor movement in our State. He was certainly one of the most determined advocates of the philosophy of the Liberal Party and served well the interests of those who elected him to this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had some personal dealings with Sir Reginald-mostly after he had ceased to be a senator-when I was a young lawyer and he was a very elderly lawyer. I certainly learnt a little from Sir Reginald Wright about expressing oneself succinctly, shall I say. I once wrote to him a detailed proposal putting forward a certain compromise that I thought advantageous to both of us and received back, on crested paper with no salutation, the word `No'. Sir Reginald had, as has been said in debate, a certain way of expressing himself and he was a character. </PARA>
<PARA> I also know his family well. His sons and daughters, I think it can be fairly said, are friends of mine. I know all of them very well. As fellow Tasmanians, we all share a sense of loss in Sir Reginald Wright's passing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in paying tribute to the great service that Sir Reginald Wright gave not only to Tasmania but to the Australian nation. Sir Reg was a great Australian, and he was an Australian first and foremost. He gave great service to Tasmania and he was fiercely Tasmanian, but Reg always believed himself to be an Australian above all else. I believe that is a message that all of us ought to take on board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much has been said about Reg's service. He served in the State Parliament of Tasmania for three years at the end of the Second World War, during which he did military service. In 1949 he was elected to the Senate and served in the Senate continuously until 1978. I served and campaigned with Reg in Tasmania, and also served with him on various committees and in forums of the Liberal Party in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> He had a great capacity for work and, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has said, a great capacity for detail. In fact, he was contemptuous of people who slept for more than four hours a day. He believed it was unnecessary and a waste of time to be sleeping when one could be doing useful research work. Whenever Reg made a speech in the Senate one could always be certain of the impeccability of his research work and the detail contained in those speeches. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, Reg was a fierce Australian. He dedicated himself to the community and believed that people who serve in this place have an obligation to serve the community. He was a member of the Liberal Party, and loyally so, but I believe that on something like 150 occasions Reg chose to cross the floor and did so without any disrespect to the Party and without losing any of his fierce loyalty to the Liberal Party. Reg believed, above all else, that people who serve in this Parliament have an obligation to serve Australia above serving one's party. I believe, in the light of comments that were made earlier today, that that is a message that all of us ought to take on board: we serve Australia before we serve our parties. Reg believed fervently in that philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps there is a sad irony that within a matter of weeks both he and his brother, who served Australia long and loyally, died. His brother, Sir Roy Wright, made a valuable contribution to the law and medicine. Both of them made a very valuable contribution to Australia, and that same dedicated, valuable contribution has been continued by Sir Reg's sons. I join others in paying tribute to the life and dedicated service of Sir Reginald Wright, and I pass on my condolences to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to let the occasion pass without paying tribute, in particular, to the contribution that the late Sir Reginald Wright made to the great constitutional debates we have had over many years in this country about the number one law which, of course, is central to the democratic arrangements in this country. His minority report to the 1959 Joint Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Review is, in my opinion, one of the great expositions of the arguments which support the bicameral system and the concept of an independent Senate. He was very much an independent senator and did much to lay the groundwork for, and to continue, the efforts of those who support a strong and independent Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many who say that our Constitution is a document of the horse and buggy days and that many of its constituent parts no longer have the relevance they once had to our modern day life. In a sense that misrepresents the Constitution because our Constitution is, in fact, about the distribution of powers between the Federal Government and State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the arguments that he advanced in 1959 in that great minority report have been reworked in many of the referendum debates of more recent times-I think of 1974, 1977, 1984 and, of course, most recently, 1988. For example, in the recommendations of the Constitutional Commission there was a proposal to advance the idea of a joint sitting to resolve deadlocks-joint sittings without the benefit of a dissolution and election. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, Sir Reginald Wright canvassed the arguments for and against that proposition 30 years before in his 1959 minority report when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A joint sitting . . . is a ready means of submerging the Senate in futility. No second chamber could expect to retain its independence and individual right to represent States under such a system. Moreover-</PARA>
<PARA>and I think this is a great line-</PARA>
<PARA> why should the people's vote be by-passed?</PARA>
<PARA>That was a reflection of a Churchillian quote which he was fond of:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not Parliament that should rule. It is the people who should rule through Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>In his 1959 report he also quoted Churchill in supporting his argument about the importance of the concept of checks and balances within our democratic system. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a great exponent and supporter of an independent Senate. He did much to advance the cause of our parliamentary system and I pay tribute to the contribution that he made over many years to the debate about our Constitution. I extend my condolences to his family. </PARA>

I think someone described him as a discontented soul. He seemed to project that image, but it was combined with a quite impish sense of humour and a great oratorical manner of speaking. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly wanted to mention that in my early period here, in the early 1970s, the Liberal Party had a committee on industrial relations in which Sir Reginald Wright was very heavily involved. At that time he was a great advocate of the pursuit of damages at law in respect of irresponsible industrial action as a means of bringing that action to a conclusion. Of course, these days there have been Mudginberri and Dollar Sweets-which I am reminded of, seeing the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) sitting there-the gas fitters and plumbers, and the most recent example of the pilots. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is preoccupied at this moment, but I am sure that Sir Reginald Wright would have been among the first to congratulate the Prime Minister on the way he urged the airlines on. He would have greatly applauded the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's determination in urging the airlines to get to the court and get a large action for damages against the pilots! That was something in which Reg Wright was a great pioneer. He was a great Australian in all sorts of ways. I extend my condolences to his family and associates. </PARA>

<PARA> 348. Upon the presentation of a report, the report may be ordered to be printed with or without the documents accompanying it, and its consideration may be set down for a subsequent sitting when a specific motion without notice in connection therewith may be moved. </PARA>
<PARA>The motion I have moved provides for the adoption of Sessional Orders generally in line with the Sessional Orders which were in place at the end of the last Parliament. There are just four changes to which I draw the attention of honourable members. The first is that the requirement that a quorum for standing committees include a majority of Government members has been removed. Where there were references to Opposition members, an adjustment has been made to refer additionally to either non-Government members or any Independent member. That is obviously made necessary by the addition to our ranks of an Independent member. </PARA>
<PARA> The composition of the Selection Committee will in future specify the membership of the Chairman of Committees and the Whips, which reflects the situation in the last Parliament, and an opportunity has been made to make the language, I am advised, gender neutral. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst the Sessional Orders to be re-established are those relating to the conduct of business on Thursday mornings. The Selection Committee has not yet been set up and therefore it is not practicable to organise a program for this Thursday in accordance with the Sessional Orders and there will be a need tomorrow to move for a variation of the routine of business for Thursday, 10 May. I attempted in the last Parliament to arrive at a position where we put most of these into Standing Orders. It is still my desire that we get around to doing that. It was not possible to do it in the last Parliament for reasons of time but more importantly, I think, there were some disagreements over bits and pieces of the changes that were introduced to the proposed Sessional Orders. None of those changes that were circulating at the time are incorporated beyond the few that I have mentioned in these Sessional Orders. We will have to consider this matter again at a later stage during this term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, at the outset I would like to extend to you my congratulations on your re-election as Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Opposition will support the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) for the adoption of Sessional Orders that were in force during the last Parliament with the amendments that he has referred to. Although there are some minor amendments in the proposed Sessional Orders, most have been tried and tested in the House for a considerable time. Accordingly, the Opposition is not objecting to their being applied in the new Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was pleased to hear the Leader of the House refer to the fact that most of these Sessional Orders ought to be now included in the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives. I forget whether it was in the House, but I certainly indicated privately to him during the last days of the last Parliament that the Opposition would facilitate that particular move at an appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying this I do not want to give the House the impression that there is no scope for change or improvement and I am sure that was not implied in anything that the Leader of the House has said. We need to look constantly for ways of improving the effectiveness of the functioning of Parliament. For instance, those sessional orders covering days and hours of meeting, the automatic adjournment and the routine of business, which all have a linkage, are likely to generate controversy and are therefore subject to change. For that reason those particular parts of the Sessional Orders should not be incorporated in the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> As this Thirty-sixth Parliament begins I suggest that this is an area that warrants further examination. The Opposition will certainly cooperate with the Government and with you, Mr Speaker, in this regard. In carrying out that examination, we should be ever mindful of the need to promote and enhance the role of the Parliament as a representative and legislative body. </PARA>
<PARA> Parliament suffered increasingly under the previous Hawke Government. Sitting times were reduced, thus cutting into opportunities for adequately checking the Government's performance, for scrutinising legislation and for the airing of public concerns about the issues of the day. This year because of the Federal election the number of sitting days will be further reduced. If the reports that are circulating about the proposed program for the Budget sitting are correct, the House of Representatives may create a new record by sitting for less than a month for the whole of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out before and as the Leader of the Opposition said today when congratulating you, Mr Speaker, on your election as Speaker of the House, we really have to have a serious look at the question of the Parliament's image and the electorate's perception of it. I know that the Leader of the House will again point to the Macklin amendment in the Senate, as he has done on previous occasions, and say that if the Opposition had not supported it the House would have two or three weeks extra sitting time available to deal with relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> While that Senate cut-off is in place surely it devolves upon the Government to organise its legislative program accordingly. We could sit at least a week earlier or perhaps cut some of the recess time by a week or two in the autumn and Budget sessions. Surely if Ministers and departments were better organised it would not be beyond the wit of the Government to get its legislation to the drafting staff under a schedule that would alleviate the use of the guillotine to the extent that it is now being resorted to. </PARA>
<PARA> The rushing of legislation through the House towards the end of sitting periods has been going on for years-well before there was a Macklin amendment. On both sides speeches have been made down the years about `legislation by exhaustion'. The question is: Are we going to accept that we will go on doing things in the same old way or are we going to address the problem realistically?</PARA>
<PARA> If the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is short of resources to supply the Government with a more measured flow of legislation, why should not consideration be given to providing whatever is necessary to achieve that result? Mr Speaker, I think that is a matter that you personally should take into consideration and involve yourself in as the Presiding Officer. Additional funding would be involved but, as the political science fellow of the Australian Parliament, Mr Greg McIntosh, has said in his recent paper Executive Dominance and the New Parliament House, it may not be as expensive as recalling the House of Representatives for a special two-day sitting as occurred just before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> In his wide-ranging paper Greg McIntosh also suggests that if there is a perception that the Parliament is in a less powerful position in relation to the Executive than it should, an obvious solution may well be for the Parliament to sit longer. This, he says, should enable more time to be spent on the detailed analysis of proposed legislation and allow for a more detailed scrutiny of the activities of the Ministry and the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> He observed that the Australian Parliament sits for much fewer days than some overseas legislatures. In 1987 this Parliament sat for 84 days, whereas the Canadian and United Kingdom parliaments sat for 167 days each and the United States Congress sat for 170 days. This, I believe, is worth serious thought. I believe Parliament should meet much more than it does. If Parliament is to fulfil its role-the role that it should fulfil-our approach to it may have to change and we may have to educate the electorate to accept such a change. As Greg McIntosh points out, `the being on the spot in the electorate' ethos is so dominant in Australia that it is a barrier against the introduction of longer sitting periods. Certainly, as Parliament grows, it is something which we are going to have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 the size of the Parliament was increased, but we now meet less and so the opportunity for members to speak has been greatly reduced. Then there is still the vexed matter of Question Time. That has been referred to earlier today. Many of the country's commentators and edi- torial writers have also pointed out that there are deficiencies in the Question Time arrangements as conducted by this Government. Just to give the tone of this criticism, recently one paper commented:</PARA>
<PARA> Question Time, supposedly one of the pillars of the Westminster system, has denigrated under the Hawke Government into a travesty. Ministers avoid providing answers, read out tedious answers to prearranged questions and somehow think this is an achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>It is by this means that Ministers seek to reduce opportunities for members to question them and make them account for their own and their departments' decisions and failings. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect is that the number of questions has dropped from the average of 16 a day during the period of the Fraser Government to the present average of under 13. So what has happened to the undertaking which the former Leader of the House, the Honourable Mick Young, gave on 14 May 1987 that the Government would allocate a minimum of seven questions each day to the Opposition? The Government seems to have forgotten that. But if it adhered to it and Ministers gave relevant answers to questions instead of making disguised ministerial statements, we might get back to something approaching the true purpose of Question Time in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Theoretically, supplementary questions are allowed, but this practice is seldom followed. Consideration should be given to the introduction of supplementaries as normal Question Time practice. The Government argues that the raising of too many points of order by the Opposition has caused the fall in the number of questions. But even when no points of order were raised, as occurred on 25 May last year, only 13 questions were asked. We had an example last year when the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) gave an extraordinarily long answer to a dorothy dix question on education opportunities, leading some Opposition members to begin to count him out. I regret this, but the Minister was clearly being provocative especially in remarking that he was `enjoying himself', and taking about 10 minutes of the 50-minute Question Time to make his reply. Is it any wonder that the Opposition reacted angrily on that occasion!</PARA>
<PARA> That sort of attitude leads only to frustration on the Opposition benches and encourages a rash reaction which can only lower the dignity of the House. Despite the Treasurer's outrageous assertion early last year, that Question Time is a courtesy extended to the House by the executive branch of government, in our hearts I am sure that we on both sides accept that Question Time is one of the Parliament's most vital forums. No matter what side of the House we are on, I suggest that the role of Parliament, what changes are necessary and how they are introduced is something that we all need to turn our minds to. </PARA>
<PARA> Serious consideration should be given to Mr McIntosh's report. We have to look closely at the balance between the Executive and the Parliament. Going back to when Frank Green was Clerk of the House, from the late thirties to the mid-fifties, the issue of the Parliament losing ground to the Executive has been raised repeatedly. It is perhaps more pertinent again now that we are in the new House where communication and, in fact, general contact between Ministers and backbenchers-and, indeed, between all members generally have become more difficult than in the smaller building. Why not look at what might be done to balance the Parliament-Executive equation?</PARA>
<PARA> There is Mr McIntosh's suggestion, too, that a Joint Standing Committee on Parliamentary Operations be established. This would facilitate the obvious interest in reform that he has demonstrated being channelled into one forum. Perhaps, with some expansion, that role could be picked up by the new Procedure Committee when it is in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Other proposals have also been made. I do not propose to canvass them this evening. There is a report containing detailed recommendations about improving the operation of Question Time. The Government has been sitting on this for several years now. Let us dust it off and look at some of the other proposals that have been made, such as a more independent role for you, Mr Speaker, electronic voting, longer sitting hours, and an expansion of the parliamentary committee system in this House. While we are at it, why not look at any adjustments we need to make in this new House now that we have had the time to settle in? Above all, we must not shrink from the necessity for change and renewal, uncomfortable though it may sometimes be. Parliamentary democracy cannot flourish and endure without it. </PARA>
<PARA> Against the background of current events in Eastern Europe, I put it to the House that we have to nurture our parliamentary system; to work towards building it up rather than allowing it to be eroded. it is not only in our interests, but in those of the nation, which we are here to serve, for the hand of the parliament to be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last Parliament, I believe, standards slumped to the lowest level that I can remember during my long period of parliamentary service. The Government treated Parliament in a contemptuous way, and this should not be repeated in this Thirty-sixth Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. Whilst Standing and Sessional Orders can, and should, be updated from time to time to assist achieving this improvement, commitments from you, Mr Speaker, from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), from the Leader of the House, and from me, as Manager of Opposition Business, will ensure that the standards in this House are raised, quite apart from what might now or in the future be written into the Standing or Sessional Orders. However, I put it to you, Mr Speaker, and to the Leader of the House, that the commitment must be strong and it must be binding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I take on board the points made by the last two opposition speakers, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). My first point is that I agree with the comments made by the honourable member for Cook as to what would be appropriate. We nearly arrived at a conclusion to this matter during the latter part of last year. It is necessary for us to get this up and operating in a hurry so that Parliament can operate. The particular point raised by the honourable member needs to be considered again when we come to contemplating putting these into the Standing Orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point I make is in response to the comments made by the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume. While I do not concede the political points he made, he did raise a number of issues relating to the potential operations at Question Time, including supplementary questions and electronic voting. These things need to be talked out between us so that we can facilitate business in this House and render the House a bit more effective on the scrutiny of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the next few months I would be very happy to engage the honourable member in dialogue on that and talk to colleagues on my side of the House to see what means we might bring about to improve some of these things. They do not come without cost. Sometimes one thinks something is a bit of a solution but it is not. Nevertheless, there is enough in what the honourable member said for us to discuss it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member wanted some undertakings from all of us on behaviour. We can probably all speak for ourselves as individuals on what we are capable of conveying to our colleagues. I am happy enough to accommodate him on that part. But this is a rough old place and it always will be. I am not sure that any of us really want to alter fundamental aspects of its character whilst perhaps, at the same time, we want to ensure that we do not go over the top in a way that damages the reputation of the place. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1989-90, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA> In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1989-90 under Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Budget figuring contained allowances for prospective wage and salary increases, those amounts were not then appropriated, and funds are now required to meet the impact of the national wage case decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the additional appropriations in the three Additional Estimates Bills totalling $1,018m, $588.8m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), $419.5m in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and $9.8m in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2). </PARA>
<PARA> These amounts are offset, in part, by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) 1989-90 reflecting the Government's continued determination to improve the efficiency of ongoing programs. These savings, amounting to $352.9m, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document, `Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations', which has been distributed to members. In addition, a clause which has the effect of reducing by $399,000 an appropriation for the bounty under the Bounty (Ship Repair) Act 1986 made by Appropriation Act (No. 1) is included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA> After allowance for this reduction and the prospective savings, the appropriations now sought represent a net increase of $664.7m in expenditures financed from annual appropriations. As a proportion of total estimated outlays-encompassing both annual and standing appropriations-this increase amounts to 0.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline some of the main areas for which the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1989-90 to meet expenditure for the ordinary annual services of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $110m, or an increase of 1.3 per cent, is included for increased running costs, of which $80m is included to cover the costs of the first instalment of the national wage case decisions, while the $30m for administrative and operational expenses is associated mostly with transfers from salaries and various minor new policy initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Gross additional estimates of $240m are sought for the Defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). The gross figures include:</PARA>
<PARA> $52.6m for running costs, reflecting the impact of the first instalment of the national wage case decisions and increases in certain allowances for defence personnel and civilians:</PARA>
<PARA> $92.7m which largely reflects adjustment for price movements and variations in progress on a number of projects, including payments for Anzac ships;</PARA>
<PARA> $40.1m for costs associated with the establishment of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd and Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd;</PARA>
<PARA> $27.5m for defence facilities attributable to price increases and greater activity levels; and</PARA>
<PARA> $25.6m for defence housing, reflecting interest bearing loan capital and increases in market rents to be paid by defence to the Defence Housing Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Taking account of all transactions contributing to the defence function, including offsets provided from increased revenues and a reduction in the provision for contingent salary and related increases, total defence outlays are estimated to increase by $126m. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriation Bill (No. 3) also provides $30m for the Australian Trade Commission to meet eligible grants under the export market development grant scheme. The additional funds are estimated to be sufficient to enable settlement of all grants that are expected to be processed and hence payable by 30 June. In addition, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> $23.5m to assist in the recovery of the tourism industry following the pilots dispute;</PARA>
<PARA> $60.1m for the increased demand for non-departmental care for veterans and the corresponding flow-on costs in veterans' medical services; and</PARA>
<PARA> $6m for a bounty on sensitised film production. </PARA>
<PARA> These additional appropriations are required to meet commitments that have been approved by the Government since the Budget as well as requirements of an ongoing nature. The principal factors underlying the requirements include certain unavoidable cost and price increases and other parameter changes since the Budget was prepared. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposed to amend the Bounty Textile Yarns Act 1981 to provide persons currently eligible for bounty under the Act with an alternative in the form of a once-off capitalisation grant paid in lieu of possible future bounty receipts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision announced on 30 January 1990 to introduce an alternative scheme for textile yarn producers which gives a new impetus for restructuring the industry and achieving the textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) plan objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the scheme will generate net reductions in budgetary outlays in net present value terms. Capitalisation grants will apply only to the current bounty period and should not be seen as pre-empting arrangements for the industry beyond June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> Production of most textile yarns has been provided bounty assistance since 1982 and this is continuing as part of the TCF plan which is scheduled to run to 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>Bounty (Textile Yarns) Bill</PARA>
<PARA> Bounties for textile yarns are an integral part of assistance arrangements for the textiles industry. They have been preferred to tariffs as a form of assistance to help contain input costs to the downstream fabric, clothing and finished textile product sectors. This has enabled those sectors to operate with lower protection levels than would otherwise have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The TCF plan provides for progressive reductions in bounty rates to 30 per cent of manufacturing value added by March 1994 and then maintenance at that rate until mid-1995. While costly in budgetary terms-$87.9m in 1988-89-this assistance is phasing down to a tariff equivalent of approximately 15 per cent. Spinning of yarns is the most lightly assisted activity within textiles and clothing production and it is at the forefront of the Government's efforts to restructure and revitalise these industries in Australia. The yarns sector is the vehicle by which we can make real progress in developing an internationally competitive synthetic yarn industry and in adding value to Australia's wool clip and cotton crop. </PARA>
<PARA> A discussion paper was released last September for a review of textile yarn bounty administration by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority. In subsequent consultations on that paper, a number of firms indicated that a once-off grant in lieu of ongoing bounty would help stimulate the invest- ment necessary for them to become more competitive. In many cases, significant changes to manufacturing operations are required. Hence the proposal in clause 8 of the Bill to amend the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 by introducing a new part 3 for `capitalisation grants', as an alternative to ongoing bounty payments to textile yarn producers. I should point out that, as proposed in this Bill, applications for capitalisation grants will be open to all those who would be eligible for bounty assistance under the textile yarn bounty scheme. Further, introduction of capitalisation grants will be without prejudice to those who elect not to apply and instead continue receiving payments under the textile yarn bounty scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Applications for capitalisation grants must be made to the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, which is responsible for administering the TCF plan, pursuant to proposed new section 21b on page 3 of the attached Bill. Applications should include details of anticipated bounty receipts to mid-1995 under the textile yarn bounty scheme, together with an estimate of the grant sought, and details of how the grant will be applied. Applications must include a business plan outlining the applicant's business objectives in relation to the production in Australia of bountiable yarn and other TCF products and the marketing of such products, and the applicant's plans for achieving those objectives on a yearly basis against certain criteria specified in proposed subsection 21b (2); notably, the applicant's plans in terms of organisational restructuring, investment, research and development and sales and marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority must consider the application pursuant to proposed new section 21c on page 4 having regard to whether the business plan is financially viable, whether it is consistent with the objectives of the TCF plan, and whether the making of a grant is consistent with Australia's international obligations, including obligations under the ANZCERTA agreement with New Zealand. Additionally, the Authority must have regard to whether the grant sought, or any lesser grant, would be likely to result in reduced budgetary outlays by the Commonwealth-in net present value terms-relative to that which would be the case if the applicant continued to receive payments under the textile yarn bounty scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Following its consideration of the application the Authority must make a recommendation to the Minister either for a grant equal to or less than that requested in the application, or no grant at all. The Minister's decision must be advised to the applicant with a broad statement of the recommendation of the Authority. Where an offer of a grant is made, the offer is subject to the applicant's entering into a capitalisation agreement with the Authority on behalf of the Commonwealth. That agreement may be subject to such terms and conditions as the Minister thinks appropriate for achieving the objectives of the business plan pursuant to proposed new sections 21e and 21f on pages 5 and 6 of the Bill. Importantly, a failure to meet the terms and conditions included in a capitalisation agreement will, on demand, render the total grant repayable to the Commonwealth, pursuant to proposed new subsection 21f (5). Circumstances beyond the control of individuals however, such as sudden changes in economic conditions, would be an obvious mitigating reason should persons defer, or not be able to fully undertake, a proposed investment which has been nominated as one of the objectives of the business plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and as I mentioned at the introduction of this speech, a person who accepts the offer of a capitalisation grant becomes ineligible to receive bounty in respect of any textile yarn produced on or after the day on which the grant is made, as provided by proposed new section 21h. The essence of the new part to the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act which I have just described is to provide an alternative to bounty assistance that will encourage more rapid progress towards an internationally competitive textiles industry in Aus- tralia. Capitalisation grants offer the potential for major investments in new spinning facilities which would operate without bounties and without tariffs for the remainder of the TCF plan, that is, the dawning of an internationally competitive textiles industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not underestimate the challenge facing the Australian textiles industry. Already there has been progress, for example, in the cotton sector with major modern facilities in ACTIL by Textiles Industries of Australia (South Australia), in Bonds Industries by Pacific Dunlop (New South Wales), and by Rocklea (Victoria and Queensland). </PARA>
<PARA> Capitalisation grants could be of value to firms engaged in restructuring the Australian textiles industry. They could provide for rationalisation and reconstruction of plants by individual firms, mergers between existing players and new entrants combining with existing producers to build new plants. Investment in buildings, provided they are purpose-built, plant, equipment and systems could embrace spinning or related manufacturing like knitting, weaving, dyeing or finishing. This approach helps both those who have already invested in spinning as well as vertically integrated producers whose activities extend downstream from spinning. Investment requirements are ongoing and financial restructuring is needed to help those who have modernised get on to the business of manufacturing and international marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> Substantial effort is required to restructure and develop the Australian wool, cotton and synthetic fibre industry. As imports gain more liberalised access under the TCF plan, firms must invest and become internationally competitive. Even more so, new investment is essential if Australia is to meaningfully add value to our wool and cotton crops. Capitalisation grants are a potential vehicle for rebuilding Australia's textile industries while, at the same time, reducing budgetary outlays by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under current textile yarn bounty arrangements, Commonwealth outlays between 1 July 1990 and 30 June 1995 are estimated in present dollar values on a financial year basis as follows: $85.96m for 1990-91; $83.04m for 1991-92; $81.13m for 1992-93; $76.67m for 1993-94; and $74.14m for 1994-95-a total of $400.94m. The capitalisation grant scheme proposed in this Bill as an alternative in lieu of future bounty receipts is conditional in each instance upon there being a lesser outlay by the Commonwealth on a net present value basis than the outlay required if the applicant had continued to claim bounty in respect of bountiable yarn produced without the benefits of a capitalisation grant. The extent of potential outlay reductions as a result of the new grant scheme will depend, however, on the number of firms that apply and are approved, and the nature and timing of their proposals. I commend this Bill to the House and present its accompanying explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I introduce the Bill into this House in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus). The High Court of Australia recently ruled that the Government does not have the power to supplement a determination of the Remuneration Tribunal to provide postage entitlements to honourable members and senators. The Government has been advised that, whilst the High Court was not required to rule on the question, its decision placed in doubt the provision of benefits having a pecuniary value unless provided by or under legislation. That advice indicates that if the High Court were asked to decide the issue it would probably find that, on the basis of section 48 of the Constitution, supported by the separation of powers doctrine, only the Parliament can make provision for such benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the entitlements and facilities available to honourable members and senators have been provided by successive governments, in some cases since Federation. Apart from postage the entitlements which are not covered directly by legislation or indirectly by any tribunal determination include travel in Australia for official business by parliamentary office holders; travel overseas on official business by the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Presiding Officers; the provision of office accommodation, home telephones and equipment for the four Opposition office holders and the Presiding Officers in a capital city; the provision of postage in relation to the official business for Ministers, Opposition office holders, Presiding Officers, the leaders of minority parties and the Whips. </PARA>
<PARA> For honourable members and senators the entitlements not similarly covered are overseas travel as a member of a parliamentary delegation; travel in Australia for purposes related to parliamentary or electorate business; electorate office accommodation and equipment; postage, personalised letterhead stationery; Australian flags and printed material related to national symbols for presentation to constituents; publications available from the Australian Government Bookshop; and the transfer of bulk papers between Parliament House and the electorate office. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the provision of a postage entitlement to honourable members and senators, the Bill provides an entitlement up to the limits determined by the Government for 1989-90 until future postage entitlements are determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. The Tribunal is to be asked to determine the postage entitlements of honourable members and senators for the financial year 1990-91. Other entitlements covered by the Bill or new or supplementary entitlements can be varied or approved either by reference to the Remuneration Tribunal or by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the doubt expressed by the High Court on the provision to date of benefits having a pecuniary value which are not provided by or under legislation, the Bill validates all benefits of a kind described in the Bill which have been used by or made available to the parliamentary office holders, including the leaders of the Opposition and to honourable members and senators at any time prior to its commencement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides a legal basis for honourable members and senators to continue to receive their entitlements for the same periods they receive their parliamentary remuneration. This is relevant to honourable members seeking re-election on the dissolution of this House or to a senator seeking re-election on a double dissolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequential amendments are also necessary to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 to support the provision in the Bill that the benefits listed in the schedule to the Bill shall be omitted or varied only if referred to the Remuneration Tribunal for determination or by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The High Court's decision has raised serious issues which have cast doubt on many of the entitlements available to honourable members and senators to enable them to fulfil their parliamentary and electorate responsibilities. The Government has moved by introducing this Bill to rectify serious anomalies which, in some cases, have existed for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the zone of cooperation in an area between the Indonesian province of East Timor and northern Australia which was signed on 11 December 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill is required to fulfil certain of our obligations under the treaty and in particular to enable the ministerial council and joint authority to exercise the rights and responsibilities prescribed in relation to the exploration for, and exploitation of, petroleum resources in area A of the zone of cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile the Petroleum (Australia- Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill provides a series of amendments to legislation that would otherwise be inconsistent with certain provisions of the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> The treaty has a 10-year history. Negotiations with Indonesia over seabed boundaries in 1971-72 left unsettled the delimitation of the seabed boundary in the Timor Gap area. Negotiations were reopened in February 1979. After several rounds of talks, however, it became clear that it would be difficult to reconcile the two countries' competing seabed boundary claims. Both governments subsequently began exploring the possibility of a provisional `joint development' regime for petroleum resources, to operate pending final agreement on the precise boundary. The concept of a zone of cooperation was then developed, whereby both countries would jointly invite contractors to explore for and exploit petroleum resources under production sharing contracts in the disputed area. </PARA>
<PARA> Agreement on the text of the treaty, which is incorporated as a schedule to the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill, was reached by officials on 27 October 1989. The formal signing by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, and the Indonesian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Ali Alatas, took place on 11 December 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Timor Gap treaty is the most substantial bilateral agreement concluded in the 40-year history of Australia's relations with Indonesia. The treaty represents a unique approach to the settlement on a provisional basis of a dispute over territorial delimitation. This constructive approach has established a basis for cooperative exploration for and exploitation of petroleum resources which would otherwise have been indefinitely delayed by efforts to define a single boundary line. The zone of cooperation is an area of very high prospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The zone of cooperation consists of three areas. Area A is the area of joint development where the control of petroleum operations will be exercised by a ministerial council and a joint authority on behalf of Australia and the Republic of Indonesia. The joint authority will be responsible for the day-to-day management of petroleum operations in area A and will report directly to the ministerial council, a body comprised of an equal number of Australian and Indonesian Ministers. Area B is the area of sole Australian jurisdiction, but Australia will pay 10 per cent of gross resource rent tax revenues from this area to Indonesia and notify Indonesia about petroleum operations in the area. Area C is the area of sole Indonesian jurisdiction, and Indonesia will notify Australia about petroleum operations in that area and will pay 10 per cent of its contractor's income tax revenues from this area to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, together with the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill, is therefore directed at making Australian law consistent with the provisions of the treaty. The treaty includes four annexes. Annex A provides maps and the coordinates of the zone of cooperation. Annex B is the `Petroleum Mining Code for Area A of the Zone of Cooperation' which governs operational activities relating to exploration for and exploitation of petroleum resources. Annex C is the `model production sharing contract between the Joint Authority and contractors', being the basis on which production sharing contracts for area A should be concluded. Annex D is the `taxation code for the avoidance of double taxation in respect of activities connected with area A of the zone of cooperation'. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal financial impact will be the prospective receipt of sales proceeds by Australia from the production sharing arrangements. The basic principle of the treaty is that the joint authority exercises the rights of the two countries in the exploration for and exploitation of their petroleum in area A of the zone of cooperation. The joint authority is to enter into contracts with corporations to explore for and produce petroleum. In return, these contractors will receive a share of the petroleum produced, to which they will acquire ownership at the point of tanker loading. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary responsibility for the marketing of petroleum rests with the contractor. There are, however, safeguards to ensure that petroleum is marketed at world prices. Provision is made under the model production sharing contract for the joint authority to determine the value of petroleum sold by the contractor to purchasers, such as affiliates, that are not third parties. In addition, the joint authority may market any or all of the petroleum produced with the approval of the ministerial council, when the joint authority can receive a better price than the contractors. </PARA>
<PARA> The method of sharing petroleum production between the contractor and the joint authority is provided in section 7 of the model production sharing contract. This provides for three progressive stages in this sharing of crude oil production, between the joint authority and the contractor. The joint authority's share is to be paid intact and in equal shares to Australia and Indonesia. The initial stage is the shared first tranche petroleum. In the next stage, contractor's investment credits and operating costs are recovered from production revenues. The final stage is the sharing of residual production. </PARA>
<PARA> First tranche petroleum amounts to 10 per cent of crude oil production during the first five years of production and thereafter 20 per cent. On oil production up to a daily average rate of 50,000 barrels per day, this first tranche petroleum is to be shared in the ratio 50 : 50 between the joint authority and the contractor. For the next 100,000 barrels per day of production first tranche petroleum is to be shared in the ratio 60 : 40 between the joint authority and the contractor; and for production above 150,000 barrels per day the respective sharing ratios are 70 : 30. </PARA>
<PARA> The second stage provides the contractor with production equal in value to investment credits of 127 per cent of exploration and capital costs together with all operating costs, including exploration costs and depreciation of capital costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The third stage allocates residual production once investment credits and operating costs are recovered. The split of this production is based on the same progressive sharing arrangements between the joint authority and the contractor as applies to the allocation of first tranche petroleum. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenues from first tranche natural gas production are shared constantly 50 : 50 between the joint authority and the contractor. Following the recovery of investment credits and operating costs, residual natural gas production is again shared in the 50 : 50 ratio. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional and prospectively significant financial impact is the taxation receipt from business profits derived from area A. Both countries will apply their taxation legislation to contractors deriving profits from their operations in area A but in such a way that only 50 per cent of business profits and losses are taken into account by each country. </PARA>
<PARA> As noted, Australia is obliged by its treaty obligations to pay 10 per cent of its gross resources rent tax revenue from area B to Indonesia. Neither revenues from production sharing, nor taxation receipts from business profits from petroleum operations in area A, can be estimated until more is known of the petroleum potential of area A. </PARA>
<PARA> A third element in this overview of financial impacts is that the provisions to apply to individuals working in area A provide that residents of Australia will be subject to Australian taxes, and residents of Indonesia will be subject to Indonesian taxes. Double taxation provisions apply to business profits and salaries of individuals who are residents of neither Australia nor Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> The joint authority will be self-funding from contract fees. Such fees will not, however, be receivable until contract bids are received and contracts are subsequently awarded. This may not occur until some 12 months after the treaty enters into force. The final element in the financial impact of implementation of the treaty is therefore the initial working capital for the joint authority estimated at $US2m. Australia is required to advance its half share or $US1m. It is anticipated that this advance will be repaid within five years. The scope of the treaty extends well beyond production sharing, taxation and the arrangements for the ministerial council and joint authority. The treaty, under articles 12 to 30, covers the range of issues likely to be encountered in the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum. </PARA>
<PARA> These include the prevention and minimisation of, and liability of contractors for, pollution of the marine environment. For this purpose and civil claims generally, the legislation provides that State and Territory courts are vested with Federal jurisdiction in relation to acts or omissions done in area A resulting in damage or liability suffered by Australians. This will include liability for the pollution of the marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a range of other articles in the treaty covering other activities, contingencies and potential developments arising out of the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum in area A. These include surveillance, security measures, search and rescue, air traffic services, and health and safety for workers. These and other issues will be dealt with through a range of rules, regulations and procedures required by the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> This package of legislation gives effect to the treaty and its annexes which govern all aspects of the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum in area A of the zone of cooperation. The regime established by the treaty for area A of the zone of cooperation is unique compared with similar joint development zones in other parts of the world in both the complexity and comprehensive nature of its provisions. The joint nature of those provisions do not simply replicate the system existing in either Australia or Indonesia, but combine features of both in an innovative and practical arrangement. This legislation gives effect to a substantive and complex treaty which allows this vital cooperative effort with Indonesia to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1990. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides a series of amendments to legislation that would otherwise be inconsistent with the provisions of the treaty Between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the zone of cooperation in an area between the Indonesian province of East Timor and northern Australia. The text of the treaty is the schedule to the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill 1990, or treaty Bill. These amendments relate to legislation pertaining to the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum in area A of the zone of cooperation. Area A is the area of joint development where a ministerial council and a joint authority will exercise the rights and responsibilities of Australia and Indonesia in relation to the exploration for and exploitation of petroleum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crimes at Sea Act is amended so that it applies in area A consistent with article 27 of the treaty. Northern Territory criminal law will apply to offences by Australians, while Indonesian law will apply to Indonesians. The provisions, consistent with the treaty, deal also with persons who are neither permanent residents nor nationals of either Australia or Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> Other parts of this Consequential Provisions Bill are provided to make Australian legislation consistent with articles of the treaty dealing with the application of customs, migration and quarantine laws, industrial relations issues and changes required to permits which had been issued under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in area A. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Act is amended consistent with article 23 to make it an offence, without authorisation, for persons or goods to be brought directly to or from a resource installation in area A without first entering or returning to either Australia or Indonesia. Goods taken to or brought from area A for use in petroleum operations are not liable to customs duty, but are subject to duty if they are transferred permanently from -area A to another part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act and the Income Tax Assessment Act ensure that the anti-avoidance measures provided in these Acts are not diminished by the treaty or the taxation code. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Act amendment provides for employment contracts and collective agreements entered into under article 24 of the treaty to specify the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as an available mechanism for the settlement of disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Migration Act is amended to allow control of persons moving onto and from resource installations in area A and by regulation to allow the application of that Act in area A if that proves necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments provided to the  Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 redefine the schedule `adjacent area' to exclude area A of the zone of cooperation, and hence place it outside the scope of this Act. These amendments provide that those parts of permit areas extending outside area A are to be renewed. Provision has been made in the event that compensation is found to be payable in relation to the termination of permit areas in area A, in terms consistent with paragraph 51 (xxxi) of the Constitution. Legal advice to the Government, however, is that no such compensation will be payable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Quarantine Act amendments are similar to those made to the Migration Act. These control persons, goods and equipment leaving or entering area A for quarantine purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The financial impacts of these amendments are relatively less significant than those relating to the treaty Bill. The non-liability of goods to customs duty, when used in petroleum operations in area A, has the potential to relieve imports from duty over a broad range, but generally this exemption from duties would be within the level of 10 per cent to 20 per cent. Until the petroleum potential of area A is better understood and hence development plans can be prepared, there is no basis on which to estimate the impact of this provision. The object of these amendments is therefore to apply existing Commonwealth legislation in area A in a manner which is consistent with the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable members. As I indicated earlier, the explanatory memorandum which I presented in relation to the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation) Bill also covers this Bill. </PARA>
